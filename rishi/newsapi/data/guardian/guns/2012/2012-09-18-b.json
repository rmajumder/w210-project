  "<p>Classes have been suspended. Normal service will resume shortly. That is what we have been told in a series of mutually contradictory and rushed Isaf and Commons statements about the US decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/nato-scales-back-operations-afghans\" title=\"\">suspend joint operations </a>with the Afghan army \u2013 a decision no other coalition partner seems to have been warned about. One of those out of the loop, the defence secretary Philip Hammond, told MPs the decision was tactical, not strategic, and that its effect would be limited because the US did not routinely partner with the Afghans below the level of battalion. He is wrong on both counts.</p> <p>If this decision sticks, it strikes at the heart of the exit strategy, which is to leave an Afghan army strong and cohesive enough to stand on its own feet when foreign combat stops in 2014. If that were to happen now, the Hazaras and Tajiks would continue fighting, but the force itself would crumble and civil war would return within a year. All the slick alliterative hype about Afghans \"standing up as we stand down\" has been exposed for the sham it really is by the current campaign of insider attacks which have killed 51 Nato soldiers this year. The longer the suspension of joint patrolling lasts, the deeper the damage in relations between Nato and Afghan forces will become. Each day US troops stay in their bases <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/afghan-soldiers-pay-the-price-as-us-forces-told-not-to-interact-with-them-8143134.html?origin=internalSearch\" title=\"\">watching YouTube videos</a>, they expose the soldiers they are meant to be training to a stream of IED attacks and small-arms fire. Afghan soldiers lack the equipment they need to patrol, be it mine detectors, helicopters or drones.</p> <p>Nominally, 75% of the Afghan population now live in areas under Afghan control. But that tells you very little. The transition is a process, not a handover. In north Helmand, the centre of this war, the lion's share of the fighting is still done by US marines. The scale and speed of the training programme, which has left the Afghan army so vulnerable to infiltration, has been dictated by political imperatives as a war entering its 12th year drains of all meaning. It is significant that former soldiers turned Tory MPs like Bob Stewart and John Baron today question the purpose of Britain's role in Afghanistan. These questions come 11 years after the battle of Tora Bora, when al-Qaida was expelled from Afghanistan, but are as pertinent now as they were then. If Britain has abandoned nation-building, and its purpose is not to win a war against insurgents, what is the national interest in remaining there?</p> <p>Far from bombing the Taliban to the negotiating table, it may well be that the US is bombed to it first. This is the week in which the surge of US troops ordered by Barack Obama ends. At each stage generals have made political promises which they could not deliver. Today is no different from any other in a war which history will not look kindly on.</p>",

Those who are dependent on government, and those who think government's job is to redistribute \u2026 I'm not going to get them.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged that some people do not pay income tax \u2013 the figure is actually 46% \u2013 for good reason: \"There are a number of retirees, members of the military who aren't paying taxes and that's as it should be.</p> <p>\"I think people would like to be paying taxes. The problem is that so many people have fallen into poverty that they're not paying taxes, [and] they're relying on government.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ukhFBJgrZxM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ukhFBJgrZxM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The revelations, which have forced the Romney campaign on to the defensive for the second week in succession, were met with dismay from conservative commentators and strategists, with one influential editor describing Romney's views as \"stupid\".</p> <p>His campaign team, with their candidate already trailing Barack Obama after a long list of self-inflicted gaffes over the summer, is anxiously awaiting the next batch of polls to see the extent of the fallout.</p> <p>The video was shot during an hour-long appearance by Romney in May at a $50,000-a-head fund-raising dinner at the Florida home of investment banker Marc Leder. More excerpts are being lined up for release, making it impossible for his campaign to dampen the firestorm and return to its core focus, the economy.</p> <p>The latest clip shows Romney dismissing the chances of peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not an unusual view, but he then goes on to firmly put the blame solely on the Palestinians.</p> <p>He contentiously described the the Palestinians as \"committed to the destruction and elimination\" of Israel and indicated he was unlikely to pursue, as president, the creation of a Palestinian state, warning that Iran would use it as a base for attacks on Israel.</p> <p>The Israeli-Palestinian excerpt can be easily brushed aside by the Romney campaign but the 47% excerpt which was released on Monday is harder to handle.</p> <p>Within the space of a few minutes, Romney managed to potentially offend the elderly, veterans, students, Latinos and other demographic groups, most of whom do, in fact, pay some taxes and have earned their entitlements. </p> <p>In a remark that sounded especially callous from someone who claims that as president he would represent all Americans, he said: \"My job is not to worry about those people.\"</p> <p>One of the most destructive aspects of the video is the contrast between what he says in public and in private, opening him up to accusations of hypocrisy.</p> <p>The release of the video came only hours after the Romney team, struggling in the polls and repeatedly forced on the defensive by the Obama campaign team, had announced it was rebooting its campaign. </p> <p>The new-look strategy, in which Romney was to set out specific policies rather than focusing on attacking Obama, barely lasted 12 hours before the video emerged and the Romney campaign team was again engaged in damage-control.</p> <p>The media coverage was almost entirely negative. The New York Daily News on its front page had the headline \"Mitt Hits The Fan\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign was quick to jump on Romney's 47% remarks, with White House press secretary Jay Carney telling reporters on Tuesday that Obama was the president of all the people, not just those who voted for him. That was followed up with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUQ-j2sOA7c&amp;feature=player_embedded\">a new Obama campaign video</a> in which footage from the 47% video was intercut with members of the public responding to it. \"I actually felt sick to my stomach,\" said one woman. </p> <p>But it is the reaction of conservatives that will cause the Romney campaign the most concern. Some are labelling his election run as the most inept they have seen in half a century.</p> <p>The influential editor of the conservative Weekly Standard William Kristol described Romney's comments about the 47% as \"arrogant and stupid\" and hinted he should stand down in favour of his a ticket headed by his running mate Paul Ryan, with senator Marco Rubio as his vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, who was one of John McCain's campaign advisers in the 2008 campaign and one of the few Republican strategists to go on the record yesterday, told the Hill magazine: \"It's a kidney shot because it reveals a very cynical view. He's pushing independent voters out the door.\"</p> <p>He added that it could help motivate disgruntled Democrats into turning out in large numbers for the election.</p> <p>With seven weeks left, there is still time for Romney to turn it around, with the support of tens of millions of dollars in advertising and a good performance in the debates with Obama, the first scheduled for 3 October in Denver, Colorado.</p> <p>Romney, who was scheduled to hold fundraising events in Salt Lake City and Dallas on Tuesday, looked uncharacteristically haggard when he held an impromptu press conference on Monday night to deal with the 47% video and offered up a rambling defence. He said he had been speaking \"off the cuff\" and describing his comments as not \"elegantly stated\".</p> <p>While Romney's views expressed in the new excerpt about the Palestinians are not a major surprise given his strong expression of support for the Israeli prime minister Binyanmin Netanyahu, US presidents like to portray themselves as neutral referees in the conflict, even if in fact they lean towards Israel. Romney has blown any lingering prospect of being seen as a neutral arbiter.</p> <p>\"I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel,\" he said. He suggested he would not actively engage in the promotion of a peace process, as his predecessors have done. </p> <p>One of the reasons he said that it is difficult to allow the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank is that it could then become a base to which Iran and other Arab nations channel rockets and other weapons to threaten the Israeli financial capital Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Indicating he would not be pushing for a two-state solution, the creation of Palestine to stand alongside Israel, he said: \"All right, we have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.\"</p> <p>The Obama administration, apart from a few tentative attempts at the start of his presidency, has made no serious effort to resolve the conflict. The Obama administration has hinted that, free from the constraints of fighting another election, it might take a more robust approach to the issue in a second term.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2012. The original said \"He [Mitt Romney] described Tel Aviv as being only seven miles from the West Bank, though in fact it is over 40 miles away.\" In fact Tel Aviv is about 11 miles away from the nearest point of the West Bank.</p>",
  "<p>While the 47% of Americans who don't pay federal income tax got most of the flak in Mitt Romney's remarks to a wealthy clique of his supporters \u2013 now captured for posterity thanks to a hidden video camera \u2013 let's not overlook the remaining 53%, many of whom also received flesh wounds and collateral damage from Romney's gaffe-operated machine-gun.</p> <p>Once the initial shock from Romney's comments passes, Latinos, women and Jewish voters will join senior citizens, members of the US military, compassionate conservatives and the less well-off as among those wounded by the Republican presidential candidate's potshots. At least Dick Cheney only ever hit one person while out hunting. Romney, while on the chase for donations, managed to wing much of the US electorate, in one way or another.</p> <p>Here's a gaffe-by-gaffe guide to Romney's self-immolation.</p> <h2>The 47%-plus</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are 47% who are \u2026 dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 So my job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>The media's fact-checking machines have roared into life and churned out the many obvious flaws in Romney's statement: that the 47% he alludes to includes senior citizens depending on social security and Medicare, the working poor, members of the US military, and the out-of-work, as well as those who do pay taxes in the form of federal payroll taxes, state and municipal taxes, not to mention the national and local sales taxes that are impossible for most individuals to evade.</p> <p>Perhaps the oddest part of Romney's formulation is that these people somehow form an inevitable voting bloc for Obama. In the case of older retired voters \u2013 who don't pay income tax on social security and receive generous healthcare benefits from the state \u2013 that seems unlikely, given that national polls have the over-65s as one of Mitt Romney's strongest bases of support.</p> <p>What of the other parts of the 47% could Mitt Romney have cut off to spite his face-time with fundraisers?</p> <p>\u2022 Those unemployed or in difficulties in the course of this devastating recession, who Romney has been trying to woo with his promises of jobs, find themselves labelled as spineless.</p> <p>\u2022 Students, both because they typically don't pay federal income tax on account of low earnings and because many of them are also recipients of low-cost government grants or loans.</p> <p>\u2022 The working poor, such as a family of four earning a household total of $40,000. They may not have to pay federal income tax, thanks to earned income tax credits, but they can hardly be accused of either believing they are victims or of not taking responsibility for their lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Members of the US military serving in war zones, who are not required to pay federal income tax on their pay and benefits, and are directly employed by the US government, may not be happy at the thought they have a victim mentality.</p> <h2>Israel and Jewish voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another group of voters that Mitt Romney has had trouble reaching \u2013 in spite of repeated attempts \u2013 is Jewish voters. Poll after poll shows Obama with a wide margin in support, as Democrats have traditionally enjoyed. <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/USPresidentialrace/Article.aspx?id=285336\">But a recent Gallup poll published by Buzzfeed Politics</a> put it at 70% for Obama and just 25% for Romney.</p> <p>The relationship of American Jews to Israel is a complex and multi-faceted one, but it's hard to imagine many shades of Jewish opinion finding something to celebrate in Romney's remarks on the Israel-Palestine issue: in essence, shrugging it off. </p> <p>The hawks \u2013 who would approve of Romney sabre-rattling remarks regarding Iran \u2013 would prefer more full-throated support from a American presidential candidate. But the majority, especially those who favour a two-state solution, would be unhappy with Romney's remarks that \"the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish,\" having rattled off a weak series of objections, and appearing to think that the West Bank borders on Syria.</p> <p>The idea that a US president would merely punt on the most difficult issue in modern geopolitics \u2013 which is what kicking the ball down the field means \u2013 is among the most extraordinary remarks to come out of these tapes.</p> <h2>Women voters</h2> <p>Romney's failure to win more support from women voters is the over-riding reason for his failure to overtake Barack Obama in the opinion polls since becoming the GOP nominee. The Florida tapes suggest why: when prompted by a discussion with the wealthy donors, Romney offers only his wife Ann as evidence of his appeal to women voters.</p> <p>And even then, Romney makes what sound like cynical remarks about his wife's role in the political process: \"We use her sparingly now, in case people get tired or attack,\" he says, although he assures the room that she will be on the campaign trail frequently.</p> <p>Mitt's other meta-analysis again suggests a cold sense of calculation when speaking about his wife: \"We had a person named Hillary Rosen who attacked her and that made Ann more visible to the American people, which I think was helpful and gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise.\" How gallant.</p> <p>The only other issue that women voters might be interested in, it would appear from this tape, is The View, the ABC daytime talkshow. Although Romney counsels The View, aside from one conservative \u2013 Elizabeth Hasselbeck \u2013 the other hosts are described as \"women who are sharp-tongued\".</p> <h2>Latino voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Had [my father] been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot of winning this. But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. He lived there for a number of years. I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.</p> </blockquote> <p>A joke it may have been but Romney's remarks can't have helped him gain ground with yet another group he is struggling to win over: Latinos. \"The insult of all insults, Mitt Romney says if he was Latino he would win the presidential election, as if being Latino would have given him any advantage to win the White House,\" was one of many sharp responses, that one coming from Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra.</p> <p>Romney's joke came on the same day his campaign was boasting of a new and high-profile attempt to target Hispanic votes, including an appearance before the US Hispanic chamber of commerce. </p> <p>As with his remarks about women voters, Romney's comments suggest that identity rather than policies are what win elections, which may explain his personal shape-shifting. What he fails to understand is that his policies, especially on immigration and his risible \"self-deportation\" idea, are what is holding him back with Latinos, rather than his ethnic identity.</p> <h2>Compassionate conservatives</h2> <p>Compassionate conservatives do exist and many of them have been up in arms about the thrust of Romney's 47% remark \u2013 an \"imperious canard\", <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too\">as the American Conservative described it</a>.</p> <p>These are otherwise reliable Republican voters, including some Christians and evangelicals, who may find themselves less likely to support or even vote for a GOP presidential ticket headed by Romney.</p> <p>What defence there has been of Romney's remarks has claimed, without evidence, that those in the 47% don't necessarily define themselves as such. That has to be true to a point \u2013 who wants to agree that they are pathetic victims? \u2013 but here Mitt Romney has done the job for them: he has told them that they are victims, that they are feckless, and furthermore that he does not care for them. Romney has, in short, labelled them with a badge of shame.</p> <p>Rusty Reno, editor of First Things \u2013 the conservative religious journal founded by Richard John Neuhaus \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/09/18/absurd-republican-rhetoric/\">dismantled Romney's \"absurd\" remarks with a quiet ferocity</a>. Sketching out the life of a family of a man earning $12 an hour in Omaha, Nebraska, Reno numbered the entitlements a family of modest means required \"for their survival, to say nothing of any opportunity to advance\".</p> <p>The modern welfare and entitlement state is a mess, he concluded: \"But it's historically, intellectually, and morally stultifying to imagine that this mess is somehow unnecessary, that it is the result of the laziness or irresponsibility of working people and the wicked plots of collectivist liberals.\"</p> <p>Writing in the American Conservative, Rod Dreher commented on Reno's criticism: \"I thought I was the only theocon Romney had lost, or just about lost, with his 47% talk. Guess not.\" <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/romney-conservatism-of-the-heartless/\">Dreher described Romney's remarks as \"conservatism of the heartless,\"</a> and that they may have revived economics \"as a pressing moral concern for religious conservatives\".</p>",
  "<p>A key player in the transition to democracy in Spain, Santiago Carrillo Solares, who has died aged 97, was the the longest-serving secretary-general of the Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (PCE). However, the changes he was keen to promote in the country's political system ultimately marginalised the party. He was left a commentator outside it, respected by some, hated by others, notably for his controversial involvement in the darkest episode of the republican defence of Madrid during the civil war.</p> <p>While the dictatorship of Francisco Franco had governed unchallenged since the end of that conflict in 1939, its response to the grave social problems caused by the 1973 energy crisis proved inadequate. Carrillo, formal leader of the PCE since 1959, had been in exile, mostly in France, and began to push for what he called \"the pact for liberty\", a broad opposition front. During Franco's illness of 1974, Carrillo launched the Junta Democr\u00e1tica in an attempt to ensure communist dominance of such moves.</p> <p>He also published two works, Demain l'Espagne (Spain Tomorrow, interviews published in Paris in 1974, though banned in Spain until 1976) and Eurocomunismo y Estado (Eurocommunism and the State, 1977), aimed at proving his moderation. They established him as a leading theorist of Eurocommunism.</p> <p>Franco died in November 1975, King Juan Carlos became head of state, and the following February a heavily disguised Carrillo returned secretly to Spain. By the time the police detained him for eight days in December 1976, he had already played a crucial role in pushing Adolfo Su\u00e1rez's interim government in the direction of reform.</p> <p>The PCE was legalised in 1977, and that June Carrillo was able to lead his party into Spain's first democratic elections since 1936. It gained 9% of the vote, coming third after Suarez's short-lived Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico (35%) and the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE, 29%): Carrillo himself became a member of the Congress of Deputies.</p> <p>This was a considerable achievement, but Carrillo had already passed his zenith. In October 1976 he had called a general strike in the hope of provoking what he called the \"ruptura democr\u00e1tica\" (democratic break) \u2013 a scenario resembling the one that had seen the collapse of the dictatorial regime in Portugal. The failure of the strike had opened the way to the more moderate scenario of the \"ruptura pactada\" (negotiated break), advocated by the socialist leader Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.</p> <p>In fact, the transition to democracy proceeded along the lines of negotiated consensus between the democratic opposition and the most progressive elements of the Franco regime. The PCE was wracked by demands for reform, the authoritarian habits of the aged, exiled leadership sitting ill with the young intellectuals of the internal resistance to Franco.</p> <p>In response to proposals for the reincorporation of the reformists (known as \"renovators\") whom he had previously expelled, Carrillo resigned as secretary general in the summer of 1982. With elections imminent, he was persuaded to reconsider, but the collapse of the PCE vote from the 11% of&#xa0;1979 to 4% as Gonz\u00e1lez's PSOE came to power in October 1982 ensured that he did indeed resign. When his successor, Gerardo Iglesias, sided with the renovators, Carrillo was dropped from the central committee in April 1985.</p> <p>He formed a new workers-communist unity party, the Partido de los Trabajadores-Unidad Comunista, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the 1986 elections, in the 1989 European elections, and for parliament again in 1989. Two years later, Carrillo agreed to the mass incorporation of the Partido de los Trabajadores de Espa\u00f1a into the PSOE. He did not go with it, on the grounds that his long track record as a communist prevented him from playing an active role in the PSOE. However, his wife, Carmen Men\u00e9ndez, did join.</p> <p>Born in Gij\u00f3n, on Spain's northern Atlantic coast, Carrillo had in fact started his political life in the PSOE, in which his father, Wenceslao, was a prominent figure. The teenage Santiago was drafted into the party's youth movement, the Federaci\u00f3n de Juventudes Socialistas (FJS), and was a particularly vocal advocate of ultra-revolutionary responses to rightwing obstruction of reform in Spain's Second Republic. Accordingly, in 1934 he was elected secretary-general of the FJS, which became the most radical section of the socialist party.</p> <p>The most dramatic fruit of socialist radicalisation was the uprising by miners in Asturias in October 1934. After it was defeated, Carrillo was jailed. From there he denounced the moderate and centrist sections of the PSOE, and called for the \"bolshevisation\" of the party. However, he accepted the entry of both the PSOE and the PCE into the electoral alliance known as the Popular Front. When he was released from prison after its victory in the February 1936 elections, Carrillo was invited to visit Moscow, where he was brought into the communist orbit.</p> <p>On his return, he promoted the formation, in April, of the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (United Socialist Youth), through which the PSOE lost the FJS to the Communist party, of which he was probably already a member. By then, the civil war had broken out, and Carrillo's energy and organisational skills were at the service of the republican war effort.</p> <p>The PCE played a crucial role therein. In early November 1936, with Franco's African Army at the gates of Madrid, the republican government was evacuated to Valencia. Carrillo, now 21, was made councillor for public order in the Defence Junta left behind in the capital, an indication of his special relationship with the Russians. On the same day he announced publicly that he had joined the PCE.</p> <p>He immediately faced a terrible problem. The insurgent General Emilio Mola declared in a radio broadcast that the four rebel columns converging on Madrid would be joined by a \"fifth column\" of nationalist sympathisers, prompting official removals of rightwing and suspect army officers from Madrid's prisons on a large and horrific scale. Carrillo was technically responsible for these prisoners. Russian advisers insisted that they be evacuated. Thus about 2,000 were taken by bus and shot at the villages of Paracuellos del Jarama and Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz.</p> <p>It was the greatest single atrocity in republican territory during the war, but exact responsibility remains obscure. Communist claims that the buses had been waylaid at anarchist control posts on the outskirts of Madrid were unconvincing. Inevitably, Francoist propaganda built on it to create a picture of \"red barbarism\", and thereafter lost no opportunity to saddle Carrillo with the blame. In fact, the evacuation was a deliberate military decision, taken collectively by various authorities of which Carrillo was only one. However, he was a crucial element in the organisation of the process and his protestations of ignorance were untruthful.</p> <p>In France at the end of the civil war, Carrillo ingratiated himself further with the communist hierarchy by writing an open letter denouncing his father for joining the junta set up by Colonel Segismundo Casado in a vain attempt to negotiate with Franco. From September 1939, Carrillo spent six months in Moscow as secretary to the Communist Youth International. After working for the Comintern and with PCE exiles in Cuba, Mexico and Argentina, he returned to Europe to work for the reorganisation of the party within Spain.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1944, many of the Spanish maquisards who been prominent in the French resistance began to drift to the Spanish border. That October, the PCE delegation in France under Jes\u00fas Monz\u00f3n authorised an over-optimistic and inadequately prepared incursion through the Valley of Aran in the Pyrenees. Snowbound most of the year and sparsely populated by shepherds and woodcutters, it was no place to pick up support. With Franco's well-equipped army on the point of annihilating the invaders, Carrillo turned up with sufficient authority from Moscow to order the abandonment of the operation.</p> <p>Thereafter, Carrillo was de facto leader of the PCE in France, the most important section of the exiled party after that in Moscow, where Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri (La Pasionaria, the passion flower) was secretary-general. In 1948 he was part of a three-person delegation interviewed by Stalin about the situation in Spain. The Soviet leader recommended the abandonment of guerrilla action against Franco in favour of infiltrating the Falangist trade union organisation.</p> <p>Carrillo had separated from his first wife, Chon, in Cuba in 1944. He met Carmen Men\u00e9ndez, a party militant in 1947, and he married her (or openly acknowledged her as his partner) in Moscow in 1949. She was to be his faithful \u2013 and equal \u2013 partner until his death. Back in France, they lived as Monsieur and Madame Giscard, and had three sons, Santiago, Jos\u00e9 and Jorge. From the immensely powerful position of organisation secretary, Carrillo began to work towards taking over the PCE by presenting himself as an advocate of internal reform.</p> <p>In 1954 he called for a renovation of party structures, as a result of which the central committee was expanded to include cadres from within Spain. A showdown came at the end of 1955. When the bulk of the PCE leadership denounced the United Nations' incorporation of Spain, Carrillo praised it as a triumph for the Soviet policy of coexistence. His gamble was justified when La Pasionaria eventually threw her weight behind Carrillo after Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin in his \"secret speech\" of February 1956.</p> <p>Carrillo pressed his advantage, and that summer persuaded the PCE to accept a policy of national reconciliation to facilitate alliance with the new non-communist opposition to Franco. He was now virtually acting secretary-general of the PCE, and the post formally became his in December 1959, when La Pasionaria was elevated to the symbolic post of party president.</p> <p>Convinced that his new policy would quickly promote a great national alliance against Franco, Carrillo came into conflict with two erstwhile allies in the struggle for internal reform. Fernando Claud\u00edn was the PCE's most acute thinker and Jorge Sempr\u00fan the intrepid organiser of the secret networks within Spain. Both believed that economic growth in Spain would increase support for the regime.</p> <p>After a bitter debate, Carrillo had them expelled in early 1965, only to spend the next few years incorporating their ideas into his many writings, particularly his book of that year, Despu\u00e9s de Franco \u00bfQu\u00e9? (After Franco, What?).</p> <p>Carrillo's move towards a more liberal position was accelerated dramatically by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. To maintain the PCE's credibility as a moderate democratic segment of the anti-Franco opposition, he was forced to condemn the Russians. In 1970 Carrillo simply expelled those hardline Stalinists who opposed him.</p> <p>After the upheavals of the 1970s and 80s, Carrillo made a living as a writer. Although he was never a sophisticated theorist, Eurocommunism and the State had made him an international reputation. He wrote an account of his year on the run, El A\u00f1o de la Peluca (The Year of the Wig, 1987) and of his role in the transition, Memoria de la Transici\u00f3n (1983). In 1993 he scored a huge commercial success with his lengthy but disappointingly anodyne memoirs. Other volumes followed, on the Second Republic and the civil war, but he never gave away the secrets that could have done so much to illuminate the history of the period. In late 2000 he published \u00bfHa Muerto el Comunismo? (Is Communism Dead?).</p> <p>Carrillo also became a regular interviewee on television and radio, recognisable by a gruff, knowing voice that reflected seven decades of chain-smoking. He attributed his iron constitution to the advice given him in Moscow in 1936 to take an aspirin every day.</p> <p>As Spaniards began to investigate the crimes of Franco, the consequent backlash made Carrillo the target of ultra-rightwing attacks. A wall adjacent to his apartment block was scrawled with the words \"Carrillo, murderer, we know where you live.\" In October 2005, when the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid granted him an honorary doctorate, proceedings were disrupted by militants chanting \"Paracuellos Carrillo asesino!\"</p> <p>He shrugged it all off. In private, his affability and droll conversation belied his background as a party disciplinarian. Then, too, he would recount anecdotes that showed that from the age of 15 until his death he was a cunning old fox, a thoroughly political animal. His wife and sons survive him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Santiago Carrillo Solares, politician, born 18 January 1915; died 18 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>The two unarmed women officers were called to the unremarkable pebble-dashed house on an estate in Tameside on Tuesday morning by a seemingly innocuous reporting of a burglary. It was the sort of call they dealt with on a daily basis and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, as the address was not known to officers as being of particular concern.</p> <p>However, when constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, knocked on the door in Abbey Gardens, on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, they were confronted by Dale Cregan, 29, a one-eyed fugitive who has been on Greater Manchester Police's most-wanted list following his suspected role in the murders of 23-year-old Mark Short in spring, and the murder of his 46-year-old father David Short, three weeks ago.</p> <p>Police say Cregan leapt out of the house and threw a grenade at the two unarmed officers, who were both gravely injured, and fired a shotgun at them. He drove off at speed from the estate in a blue BMW one series car, before crashing it and handing himself in at the nearby Hyde police station, as emergency services raced to the scene. One of the officers died there and the other was pronounced dead in hospital. It is the biggest loss of police officers since the notorious 1966 murders in Ealing and is the first time two female officers have been killed.</p> <p>His alleged associate was arrested earlier this month at a park in Openshaw by armed officers following a tip-off, but still Cregan evaded police until Tuesday. However, some sources on the estate alleged Cregan had been seen drinking in nearby pubs in the last fortnight. It was impossible to verify these claims.</p> <p>While he was being sought by police the \u00a325,000 reward for information leading to his arrest was doubled. His mugshot was beamed on to the big screens at Manchester City's stadium and on a van driven round the city centre as armed officers patrolled Droylsden and Clayton to search for him \u2013 all to no avail as detectives were faced with a wall of silence about Cregan.</p> <p>What is known for sure is that Cregan had links to the estate and the force had previously targeted the area with armed officers in a search for him. Cregan was wanted in relation to his suspected involvement in a grenade attack that killed David Short at his house in Clayton, east Manchester on 10 August, three months after the murder of Short's son Mark. Cregan had already been arrested on suspicion of his involvement with the Mark Short murder \u2013 he was shot in the neck as he played pool at the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden on 25 May \u2013 but had been released on bail.</p> <p>Three other men were also injured during the shooting. Four men have been arrested in connection with the murder of Mark Short, a muscular amateur boxer who, like his father, had a violent history. Two other men have been charged with David Short's murder and Ward has also been charged with murder and attempted murder.</p> <p>Prior to his death, David Short had been repeatedly alerted by police that his life was in danger and had begun wearing a bulletproof vest as far back as 2004. By this time, the Greater Manchester force had issued him with three Osman warnings \u2013 served when officers receive information to suggest someone is at risk of being seriously harmed or killed.</p> <p>Six years ago, David Short was jailed for six years for possessing a firearm with intent after he and his son drove a gunman away from the scene of where shots were fired. Mark Short appeared before the courts as part of his role in the incident, but escaped being detained in a young offenders' institution. In the aftermath of the shooting, David Short assaulted a man during a drunken row in the Garibaldi pub in Gorton and was convicted for wounding. As far back as the 1990s, he appeared in court accused of witness intimidation.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester police chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, said hundreds of officers were involved in the search for Cregan and the force had executed 50 firearms warrants.</p> <p>He described it as \"one of the darkest days\" in the history of the force \"and for policing in the UK as a whole.\" Fahy said he believed that Cregan was in a house in Abbey Gardens overnight and at some point in the morning he or someone else has made a call reporting the burglary and effectively luring the officers to their deaths. Fahy said they had no intelligence to suggest that Cregan had been \"specifically targeting police officers\".</p> <p>Fahy described the huge operation across Greater Manchester to find Cregan, with hundreds of officers and specialist units involved. The officers involved are \"shattered\" by what has happened. The chief constable said Cregan's alleged motive for the attack was unclear and claimed Cregan had been protected by a criminal conspiracy to harbour him. He admitted there had been concern that Cregan may target others while on the run.</p> <p>The address is not known to police and had not featured on their intelligence systems. As it was a routine call, two unarmed officers were sent to the house and there hadn't been any need to send armed officers there, Fahy added.</p> <p>A cordon was thrown around the area, on top of a hill, with residents having to leave their cars in a layby on the main A57. The force helicopter hovered overhead and a bomb disposal team was in situ, carrying out a controlled explosion nearby.</p> <p>More floral tributes were left at the police cordon last night. One note attached read: \"To the families and colleagues of Fiona and Nicola. Our deepest sympathies. Your colleagues at Sankey police station, Cheshire Police.\"</p> <p>Another said: \"Nicola, Thank You For The Smiles.\"</p> <p>Attached to another bouquet was: \"RIP For Our Two Brave Fighters Fiona and Nicola. Sadly Missed By All. Our Thoughts Are With Your Families.\"</p> <p>One resident said 12 shots were fired and an explosion took place shortly after the police car arrived at the property mid-morning. Window cleaner Warren Sheppard was up a ladder nearby when the shooting happened. He said: \"I heard about 10 shots quite close, bang, bang, bang, like that. I knew they were gunshots because sometimes there is clay pigeon shooting in the fields. \"I heard a big explosion about 10 seconds after the shots. I got off the ladder, walked round, saw an empty police car. A car went speeding past to the main road.\" He went back to his van but could see the aftermath through a gap between two houses. \"It was like something on the movies,\" he said.</p> <p>During his time as a fugitive, police issued a photograph of Dale Cregan with a fake onyx eye, although he had a number of different \"ordinary\" eyes in varying colours. He boasted to friends that he had lost his eye after being struck with a knuckle duster during a fight with police in Thailand, but it is not clear how he really lost it.</p> <p>Assistant chief constable Garry Shewan said Cregan had been arrested and bailed following the murder of Mark Short in May this year.</p> <p>At Ashworth Lane, the first person to lay flowers, Karen Hutchinson, said: \"My heart goes out to the officers who've died. It's too close to home. It is hard when it happens on your doorstep.\"</p> <p>The force vowed to track down and bring to justice all those who had been sheltering and harbouring Cregan. Other people who were in the houseon Tuesday are said to be \"helping police with their inquiries,\" Fahy added. Cregan is being questioned by detectives on suspicion of four murders.</p> <p>Fahy paid full tribute to both officers. Of Hughes he said: \"Nicola enjoyed karate. She was bubbly and loved life and socialising. She was a chatterbox and was always smiling, even after a night shift when everyone else was a bit grumpy. She was a good listener and could not do enough for people. She was a lovely friend, and a great bobby.\"</p> <p>And of Bone: \"When she first joined the shift she was quite quiet and reserved. However, she came out of her shell and had a great sense of humour. She was so happy with her partner and they were in the middle of planning their wedding. Indeed her partner only spoke to her this morning about the wedding invites and fellow officers gave her advice about how to make them on the computer.</p> <p>\"Her fellow officers said that they always loved being partnered off with her as she was always calm, collected and professional, and could defuse situations with her calm, gentle way. She was an excellent bobby, and cared about her job, and the community she served.\"</p>",
  "<p>Eleven years after it began, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/nato-afghanistan-shatter-claims-progress\" title=\"\">Nato's occupation of Afghanistan is crumbling</a>. The US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/18/hague-afghanistan-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">decision to suspend joint Afghan-Nato operations</a> in response to a wave of attacks by Afghan soldiers and police on Nato troops cuts the ground from beneath the centrepiece of western strategy.</p> <p>Nato is, after all, supposed to be training up Afghan troops to take control in time for the withdrawal of combat forces in 2014. Instead, those client regime troops are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/18/nato-afghanistan-insider-attacks-soldiers\" title=\"\">routinely turning their guns on a long-reviled foreign occupation force</a>. No wonder support for a continued military presence is falling rapidly in the main British political parties \u2013 long after it has among the populations of all the occupying states.</p> <p>The US-British invasion of Afghanistan was of course launched in response to the 9/11 attacks: the poison fruit of US-led support for the Afghan mujahideen war against the Soviet Union. Why do they hate us, many Americans asked at the time, oblivious to their country's role in decades of coups, tyranny, sanctions regimes and occupations across the Middle East.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/12/libya-egypt-attacks-muhammad-film-live\" title=\"\">killing of the US ambassador to Libya and assault on the consulate in Benghazi</a>, as protests against a virulently Islamophobic US-made video spread across the Muslim world, Hillary Clinton echoed the same sentiments. \"How could this happen in a country we helped liberate?\" she asked, \"in a city we helped save from destruction?\"</p> <p>She was referring to Nato's decisive role in winning power for the Libyan rebels who first took up arms in Benghazi last year. But just as the mujahideen the US backed in Afghanistan later turned their guns on their imperial sponsor in the form of the Taliban and al-Qaida, so many of the Islamists and jihadists who fought against Gaddafi with Nato air cover have their own ideas for the future of their country.</p> <p>This is the start of the blowback from US and western attempts to commandeer the Arab uprisings. Something similar is likely to happen in Syria. The invasion of Afghanistan more than a decade ago not only didn't destroy al-Qaida, it spread it into Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen and north Africa, and today the flags of its offshoots are flying across the Arab world.</p> <p>In Libya, Nato's intervention sharply escalated the death toll, triggered large-scale ethnic cleansing, spread war&#xa0;to Mali, and left thousands in jail without trial and the country in the control of multiple armed militias. Western governments hailed July's elections, in which most seats were not open to political parties, as bucking the Islamist trend across the region.</p> <p>But their man, a former Gaddafi minister, has now been defeated for the job of prime minister by an independent Islamist, while the British ambassador's convoy, the Red Cross and UN have been attacked and Sufi shrines destroyed. Meanwhile, the Nato-backed authorities are threatening military action against jihadists in Benghazi, as American warships and drones patrol Libya's coast and skies.</p> <p>The fact that the attack on the US consulate, along with often violent protests that have spread across 20 countries, was apparently triggered by an obscure online video trailer concocted by US-based Christian fundamentalists and \u00e9migr\u00e9 Copts \u2013 even one portraying the prophet Muhammad as a fraud and paedophile \u2013 seems bafflingly disproportionate to outsiders.</p> <p>But in the wake of the Rushdie affair&#xa0;and Danish cartoons controversy, it should be clear that insults to Muhammad are widely seen by Muslims&#xa0;as an attack on their collective identity and, as the Berkeley-based anthropologist <a href=\"http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/saba-mahmood\" title=\"\">Saba Mahmoud</a> argues, a particular form of religiosity that elevates him as&#xa0;an ideal exemplar.</p> <p>Those feelings can obviously be exploited, as they have been in recent days in a battle for political influence between fundamentalist Salafists, mainstream Islamists and the Shia Hezbollah. But it would be absurd not to recognise that the scale of the response isn't just about a repulsive video, or even reverence for the prophet. As is obvious from the slogans and targets, what set these protests alight is the fact that the injury to Muslims is seen once again to come from an arrogant hyperpower that has invaded, subjugated and humiliated the Arab and Muslim world for decades.</p> <p>Since launching the war on terror, the US and its allies have attacked and occupied Afghanistan and Iraq; bombed Libya; killed thousands in drone attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia; imposed devastating sanctions; backed Israel's occupation and dispossession of the Palestinians to the hilt; carried out large-scale torture, kidnapping and internment without trial; maintained multiple bases to protect client dictatorships throughout the region; and now threaten Iran with another act of illegal war.</p> <p>The video is manifestly only the latest trigger for a deep popular anger in a region where opposition to imperial domination is now channelled mainly through the politics of Islam rather than nationalism. The idea that Arab and Muslim hostility to the US would have been assuaged because it intervened to commandeer Libya's uprising (an intervention most Arabs reject) is absurd.</p> <p>About two-thirds of people in the Middle East and North Africa say they distrust the US, <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/09/17/what-muslim-world-really-thinks-america/\" title=\"\">polling shows</a>, rising to more than three-quarters in Pakistan. After 11 years of the war on terror, following decades of baleful intervention, the only surprise is that there aren't more violent anti-US and anti-western protests in the region.</p> <p>Western war in the Muslim world has also fed a toxic tide of Islamophobia in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/16/voters-support-anti-immigrant-party\" title=\"\">Europe</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/09/combating_islamophobic_violence/\" title=\"\">US</a>. What is it about Muslims that makes them so easily offended, Europeans and Americans commonly demand to know \u2013 while Muslims point to cases such as the British 19-year-old who was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-19604735\">convicted in Yorkshire last week</a> of posting a \"grossly offensive\" Facebook message that British soldiers in Afghanistan \"should die and go to hell\", and ask why they're not afforded that protection.</p> <p>The events of the last week are a reminder that an Arab world which has thrown off dictatorship will be more difficult for the western powers to hold in thrall. The Economist called the deadly assault on the US consulate in Libya <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21562914\" title=\"\">an example of \"Arab dysfunction\"</a> and urged the US not to retreat from the Middle East but go in deeper, including in Syria. As Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Libya have already shown, that would only bring disaster.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01msfkl\" title=\"\">L<strong>ove and Marriage: A 20th Century Romance</strong></a> feels like something you might have seen on BBC4 before: it is full of jolly black-and-white footage going back a century, stuff expressly shot to extol a certain British way of life, which now looks not only quaint but a little fiendish. It's all underlined \u2013 or undermined \u2013 by testimony from people who actually lived though the period. The witnesses are, of course, the more precious resource. Fortunately the programme was no less insightful for its familiarity. It boasted a particularly strong collection of&#xa0;talking heads, crowned by the marvellous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/diana-athill\" title=\"\">Diana Athill</a>, who took us back to her parents' courtship in 1916. \"Granny believed that no lady could possible let a man kiss her,\" she said, \"unless they were going to get married.\" Athill's mother believed it too; she married unhappily and an affair with an army officer followed. By&#xa0;the time Diana was 18, she knew her youngest sister was not her father's child. \"One of the reasons was that he was so much nicer to her,\" she said.</p> <p>Athill herself dreamed of marriage to a dashing military man, but not everybody was so romantic in the 1930s. \"I was very practical,\" said Hetty, another woman interviewed. \"Hockey was my great joy.\" She fully expected to enter into a match arranged by her parents, until she met Reg while out canvassing for Labour. \"My first thought was: 'Oh, what a pity&#xa0;he's not Jewish!'\"</p> <p>Hetty had a more enlightened and pragmatic attitude toward birth control than some of her contemporaries. Marion Atkinson's hard rural life was made no easier by 15&#xa0;children. She didn't romanticise the situation; not then, not now: \"I said often in my married life: 'I'm going to run away.'\"</p> <p>War brought disruption and a measure of expediency to the institution of marriage. On the eve of&#xa0;going overseas, John said to his girlfriend: \"Darling, I've got 25 quid. Will you marry me?\" Athill's RAF bomber fiance stopped writing to her from the far east. \"I don't know how long I went on writing into this silence,\" she said. After more than a year, he broke off the engagement. Then he married someone else. Then&#xa0;he got killed.</p> <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of marriage in the 20th century was how quickly prudishness, formality and ignorance were re-established after the war. Eileen's parents turned up at a Blackpool guesthouse to make sure she and her fiance had separate rooms. After Eileen and Arthur married, she couldn't understand how she had got pregnant, because they hadn't been \"trying\". She refused to&#xa0;believe the doctor's diagnosis.</p> <p>Any testimony from the happily married of the early 20th century is particularly poignant, since only one half of the partnership is likely to have&#xa0;survived. The programme spared us everything but the good news: Eileen and Arthur recently celebrated their 60th anniversary; John and his wife \"still remain devoted to each other\",&#xa0;70 years on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00x1c6f\" title=\"\"><strong>Lilyhammer</strong></a> (BBC4), in which Steven Van Zandt plays a New York mobster relocated to Norway under a&#xa0;witness protection scheme, has a classic fish-out-of-water premise. Two episodes in, the water is becoming more interesting than the fish. The collection of characters that populate Frank's (now renamed Giovanni) adopted town have a quirky, provincial&#xa0;exoticism \u2013 they're from Norway, after all \u2013 while Frank does everything you'd expect a mobster to do. He tries to bribe people. He tells a bullied kid to stand up to his&#xa0;tormentors with a mitten full of rocks. He kills a wolf with a handgun.</p> <p>The freshest characters may be, for&#xa0;all I know, well-worn Norwegian stereotypes (Elvis-impersonating policeman, pervert council worker), but the best lines tend to be in the subtitles. The council worker suggests a role reversal exercise at his self-defence class for female immigrants. \"I&#xa0;am now a defenceless minority-background girl,\" he says, \"and you're&#xa0;a tiresome guy from Gausdal.\"</p> <p>Only one moment approached the dark humour of Van Zandt's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-sopranos\" title=\"\">Sopranos</a> work: after he and his new business partner push a rival down the Olympic ski jump. Finding their victim on his back some distance from the take-off point, Frank says: \"I say we give him a&#xa0;chance to improve his score on a second run.\" More of that, please.</p>",
  "<p>Football administrators, supporters and players have no room for complacency regarding discrimination, racism included. That is the conclusion of a parliamentary committee which has urged the Football Association to demonstrate strong, example-setting leadership.</p> <p>Among its key recommendations are measures to increase the number of black managers, directors and referees. Although these stop short of advocating positive discrimination, there is a suspicion that certain recruitment processes are not entirely meritocratic and may instead favour white candidates.</p> <p>The committee also stops short of suggesting that new legislation is needed, pointing out that: \"There is already legislation in the UK concerning racist or indecent behaviour at football matches. The Football Offences Act 1991 made racist or indecent chanting an offence at a designated football match.\"</p> <p>Instead it says: \"We recommend that the Football Association commission an external body to conduct a review of the educational programmes about discrimination currently available and make recommendations based on their effectiveness.\" It adds: \"The FA should demand stronger leadership from Uefa and Fifa on tackling racism.\"</p> <p>The Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee conducted its inquiry in the wake of some high-profile cases of alleged racist abuse last season and concluded that consistent methods for reporting criminal behaviour, most notably racism, are still lacking, particularly at grass-roots level.</p> <p>Another concern, which it believes needs addressing, is homophobic abuse. This was described as a \"significant problem\", sometimes concealed by the euphemistic term \"laddish behaviour\". The use of social media by, among others, the FA, as a deterrent to this and other types of discrimination was advocated.</p> <p>Committee members also identified a clear need to encourage more candidates from ethnic minorities to train as coaches and referees, thereby ensuring that clubs can recruit from a more diverse talent pool. They stressed that all appointments should be based on merit, irrespective of race, and concluded that the most equitable way to introduce greater diversity among managers and club boards was to encourage a transparency and consistency of recruitment across the game.</p> <p>While noting radical changes in atmosphere and attitudes at matches since the 1970s and 1980s when racist abuse proved common and football was often far from family friendly, the committee stressed that room for improvement remained.</p> <p>It hopes the FA will prioritise the development of procedures and training which would enable stewards and other club staff to react swiftly and consistently to abusive incidents.</p> <p>While prosecutions in cases of racial abuse at league and club level are \"extremely welcome\", similar efforts should be applied to the grass-roots game, the committee said.</p> <p>John Whittingdale MP, chair of the committee, said: \"Much has been done to improve the atmosphere and behaviour at football matches. However, significant problems remain.</p> <p>\"Social media has become a tool for the spread of racist and abusive content but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour.</p> <p>\"The football authorities should be using this developing communication forum to spread positive messages about equality and diversity and to speak out strongly against racist abuse. More needs to be done to increase the diversity of coaches and referees, to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels.</p> <p>\"While the general level of progress in combating racism and racist abuse in the UK should be applauded, there is much more that can and must be done. We believe it is for the FA to take the lead and set the example for everyone to follow.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russia has ordered a key US agency to shut down operations as Vladimir Putin continues to crackdown on a protest movement that he maintains was orchestrated by the US state department.</p> <p>The government has given the US agency for international development (USAid) until 1 October to shut its office in Moscow. \"While USAid's physical presence in Russia will come to an end, we remain committed to supporting democracy, human rights, and the development of a more robust civil society in Russia,\" state department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said in a statement.</p> <p>The move appeared to be the latest salvo in the Kremlin's efforts to squeeze a protest movement largely borne of civil society efforts to highlight growing government abuses. In addition to funding health and environment projects, USAid mainly focuses on supporting groups that promote democracy and human rights in Russia.</p> <p>\"We regret this decision by the Russian government,\" a senior Obama administration official said. \"We lament the fact that we will not be able to do the work that we've been proud to do. It's a difficult day.\"</p> <p>Putin, who returned to the presidency in May amid an unprecedented protest movement against him, has reserved particular scorn for Golos, an election monitoring organisation that receives the bulk of its budget from USAid. The group highlighted voting violations during a contested parliamentary election in December, helping bring tens of thousands into the streets as reports and videos of fraud went viral on YouTube and social networks.</p> <p>The administration official remained defiant about US funding of civil society in Russia, saying the order to close the agency \"doesn't mean we've changed our policy of supporting the kinds of actors USAid has supported\".</p> <p>\"Over the coming weeks and months, the Obama administration will look at ways to advance our old policy objectives with new means,\" the official said.</p> <p>The situation could become reminiscent of the drawn out struggle experienced by the British Council, which was forced to shut all its offices outside Moscow in 2007 as relations plunged in the wake of the murder in London of dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p>About 60% of USAid's $50m budget for 2012 went to groups that promote democracy and human rights \u2013 a sharp increase from the Bush era. The agency first opened in Moscow in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse.</p> <p>Among the nearly 57 organisations that receive USAid funding in Russia are human rights NGO Memorial and anti-corruption group Transparency International.</p> <p>Those groups have already been squeezed. The Russian parliament passed a new law this summer that required all non-governmental organisations that receive foreign funding to brand themselves \"foreign agents\" on all publications and websites and to undergo extra financial checks.</p> <p>Although rumours that the Kremlin was pressuring USAid had long swirled, the government's means of informing Washington appeared sudden. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, first informed Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, of the planned move during a meeting at an economic summit in Vladivostok earlier this month. The foreign ministry sent official notice on 12 September.</p> <p>USAid's 13 diplomats will likely have to leave the country. The fate of the 60 locals that work for the office remains unclear.</p> <p>Officials in Washington see the Russian move as part of the continuing war of attrition by Moscow against groups clamouring for greater democracy. They say it has been clear for some time that the Russian government has been irritated by USAid's support for an array of pro-democracy organisations, civic society groups and human rights activists.</p> <p>Putin has drawn on Cold War stereotypes and conspiracy theories on US involvement in the Arab Spring uprisings to blame the US for encouraging Russia's own opposition movement. Relations have plunged to further lows over Moscow's defiant stance against pressuring the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here from 7.25pm or so for coverage of Real Madrid v Manchester City. In the meantime, here a preview of tonight's game:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has warned Manchester City that Real Madrid will be \"at our best\" when they face them at the Bernab\u00e9u in their opening Champions League group game on Tuesday evening. The Spanish champions are reeling from a poor start to the season that continued with Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Sevilla, which left them eight points behind the leaders, Barcelona.</p> <p>\"To play against City motivates me as much as playing against Getafe,\" said Mourinho. \"To win the Champions League motivates me like any other match. Motivation is something intrinsic to the job. The conviction is that tomorrow [on Tuesday evening] we will have a team. A determined, compact and solid team. I will try to field the team that I think will show up. Maybe we won't be as relaxed, or filled with the same conviction and confidence we usually have against an opponent like City, coming off a game which was terrible.</p> <p>\"I'm sure we'll be at our best. I could be wrong but that's what I think. The lineup will not be very different [from Sevilla], nor will I try to show any player that they are not in the best condition. It will be the best that I consider to play against an opposition full of players of the highest level. I don't believe I have created doubts. The principal person responsible is me. When my teams win, we win together, and when we lose, I am the one responsible. Before losing to Sevilla I said to the players what I then said in the press conference. For this reason it is not a criticism but a conviction.</p> <p>\"I said it to them before the game. Football is about today and tomorrow, not yesterday. Yesterday is history. I haven't been able to keep my players motivated and concentrated at the top level and that is my fault.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Here are the teams,</strong> although it should be noted that there are claims on Twitter that Uefa has published the wrong line-ups.

As for City, apparently an insider has told ITV that Mario Balotelli has been omitted from the squad for \"technical reasons\".</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.44pm: The away end is full, but there are abundant empty seats elsewhere in the stadium, which suggests that the economic woes in Spain mean many people have a good deal more cause to be sad than Poor Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We have go. For of you watching in black and white, Real are in white and City are in black. For those of you watching colour, it's the same. For those of you following only this mbm, Real are naked and City are in pink leather.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Real move quickly down the left, whereupon Ronaldo cuts inside and sends a decent long-range shot several yard wide. The poor guy just can't catch a break ...</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> City haven't shown much so far, just trying to keep it steady early doors. Yaya Tour\u00e9, as ever, has shown a couple of classy touches but it's Real who've had most of the ball.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> A lovely flick by Silva sends Tevez scampering into the danger zone but Pepe hurtles across to snuff out the danger. City are starting to spend a little time in the opposing half.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Fine save! Poor Ronaldo received the ball wide on the left, then bamboozled Kompany with some foot-magic before aiming a low curling shot towards the bottom corner. Hart sprawled himself smartly to tip it behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball on the left, then cuts inside past Maicon and unleashes another fierce shot that Hart pushes away. At some point City are going to figure out that when he receives the ball on the left, Poor Ronaldo likes to cut inside and shoot ...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> City knock the ball around midfield for a bit, going nowhere ... and then Nastasic tries to chip on forward for Tevez to chase but it's too long and Real get ready to rumble forward anew. \"Real are naked and City are in pink leather?\" gasps Toby Mohr before stammering: \"The important question, Paul, is what are you wearing?\" A confused expression, as ever.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> You get the feeling City will pay for their passiveness sooner or later. Fortunately that time it was Arbeloa who cut in from the wing (right) and shot, and Hart was left with an elementary save.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Silva turns nicely in midfield and darts towards the Real box, with team-mates to either side of him: this is a promising position .... but Silva delayed his pass too long and Marcelo disposseses him.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Hart to the rescue again, as Higuain springs the offside trap but is forced sufficiently wide to have to pass backwards rather than shoot. Ronaldo attempts to find the net from the edge of the area but his shot is deflected into the path of Khedira ... who stabs it over the bar from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Real are well on top, moving the ball at such speed that City seem sliuggish. Maicon is being given the Bale treatment by Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> The ball is a boomerang to City at the moment: every time they boot it out of their half it keeps coming back, though accompanied by several Real players. Essien it the latest Real player to try his luck, but his 20-yard blast hurtles way wide.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Solid work by Kompany to shunt Higuain off the ball after Nastasic was caught in possession.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Nasri, who has been peripheral at best so far, appears to have pulled a muscle and is hobbling off. He looks unlikely to continue.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> What a chance for City! The imperious Tour\u00e9 strode through midfield and City flood forward in support, and briefly had four attackers versus just two defenders. Alas, Tour\u00e9 pass to Silva was imperfect, forcing the Spaniard to break his stride and giving Real a moment to recover. Pepe charges down Silva's shot at the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Kolarov has been introduced in place of Nasri.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Scandalous miss! Di Maria clipped a superb cross from the right over Kompany's head. Hart, to the defender's anger, chose not to come to meet it, leaving Higuain to stretch out a leg and .... tonk the ball over the bar from five yards!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Ronaldo receives the ball wide on the right, cuts inside Maicon ... and this time Kompany blocks his shot before it reaches Hart.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Di Maria has a pop from 25 yards. It flashes just wide.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> The ref stops play so that he can berate Tour\u00e9 and Khedira for excessive stroppery. \"Looking at the subs it seems certain Barry has to play 90mins,\" moans Richard Hamilton. \"Don't you think this level, and the business end of International football is just too much for him? Nice fella, good pro, just limited in ability.\" Yes. And I take it from your suggestion that there is no alternative on the bench that you don't think Rodwell is better?</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> After looking like they were coming to terms with things, City have let the initiative slip again and Real are well on top. Di Maria slams one wide from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> City have bad Real finishing and fine Hart goalkeeping to thank for a scoreline that is even despite Real dominating for long periods. City have not been awful but not have they been good enough to suggest they can continue holding out unless they find greater cohesion, accuracy and tempo.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time observation:</strong> \"I've just counted the total squad numbers of the 11 City players on the pitch,\" admits Edan Tal. \"It's 190! This is getting silly!\" It certainly is, Edan, it certainly is.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Regarding Gareth Barry. </strong>\"Ask any City fan if they'd have wanted Barry to start today, and the answer would have been a resounding yes,\" thunders Daniel Green. \"We've leaked goals this season, and it is due to Barry's absence. When we won our last 6 games to win the league Barry was a critical part of the XI we used weekly. He is slow and isn't flashy, but then again neither was Dietmar Hamann. Only people who don't watch City regularly fail yo see how important he is to us.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> City get the second half under way.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Maicon gets farther forward than he ever did in the first half ... but his cross from the right is feeble.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball wide on the right ... and you know the drill. But Nastasic knows it now too, so he came across to help out Maicon and prevent the Portuguese from shooting. So instead he shunted ball sideways to Di Maria, whose shot from the right is deflected wide.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong>Tour\u00e9 sets Kolarov racing in behind the Real defence down the left ... this is a great opportunity .... but instead of crossing, Kolarov runs all the way out of play. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Javi Garica booked after some helter-skelter midfield action sparked by Tour\u00e9 losing the ball. Garica didn't deserve to see yellow mind: he won the ball back off Khedira fair and square.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 min: </strong> Garcia nods over from a corner, Pepe having applied enough pressure to prevent him from getting a proper connection on it.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Poor Ronaldo receives the ball on the right ... and gain City double up on him, Kompany helping out Maicon. But down-on-his-luck Ronaldo has support too, with Marceloa providing an overlap. PR gives him the ball and Marceloa fires a brilliant low cross across the face of goal. Higuain, however, was dawdling so Clichy was able to clear under no duress. \"Someone should point out to Daniel Green that Dietmar Hamann did a bit more than just occupy space in front of the central defenders and knock the ball six yards sideways every now and then,\" bellows Nick Smith, doing the pointing out himself. \"Why did Rafa want to replace Alonso with Barry? Its the biggest mystery in football... I miss Xabi.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> City nod off while Real take a quick corner. THen Pepe is allowed to receive a cross unmarked on the far side of the box: he even has time to miscontrol it and do a fancy twirl before firing the ball across the face of goal. Again Clichy is on hand to bash it clear. \"I throw a very dark cloud over Daniel Green's impassioned defence of G. Barry,\" barks Sasu Laaksonen. \"The City fans I know understand there's a big difference between the Premier League football and CL/International football. And while they would not mind seeing Barry starting a game against Stoke, there's no way they would want him to lumber v Real Madrid. And yes, I am a Finn....but there's a rapidly growing City contingent here too.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Bang! Marcelo fires a cracking shot inches wide from 20 yards. City are on the rack here ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Respite for City as Varane chops down Silva to concede a freekick near the Real corner flag (the one to the right of their goal, if you must know). And that's Silva's last contribution to the game, as Mancini takes him off to throw on Dzeko.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Marcelo goes close with yet another blast from distance.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 0-1 City (Dzeko 69')</strong> Now there's a sucker punch! That was mildly reminiscent of Fernando Torres' goal for Chelsea gainst Barcelona last season, although the chance was created not by a mighty punt forward but by a trademark burst by Tour\u00e9, who collected the ball off Tevez and stormed past two and drew the last defender before knocking the ball into the path of Dezko. The Bosnian cantered towards the box and slotted the ball past Casillas from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Hart comes to meet a corner but misses it. Happily for him, Varane heads over from close range. Meanwhile, Mourinho is poised to make two substitutions ...</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> That's another dangerous break by City, who have three attackers versus four defenders. Tevez has Dzeko to his right and Kolarov to his left. He goes for the Serbian option ... and Kolarov forces a decent save from Casillas with a shot from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Real subtitutions:</strong> The cavalry arrive in the persons of Benzema and Modric, with Higuain and Khedira leaving.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>City substitution: </strong>Maicon off, Zabaleta off.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Modric's first involvement sees him nick in to steal the ball off Kolarov as he embarked on another run.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 1-1 City (Marcelo 76')</strong> A superb strike by Marcelo, who did what Poor Ronaldo has been attempting to do all night: after receiving the ball on the right, he cut inside and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner from 20 yards. And on that note, could people please stop referring to Ashley Cole as the best left-back in the world?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> This is fun. The match has an engagingly hectic feel to it, with both sides going for the win.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Ozil, who came on for Essien earlier on, is becoming a menacing influence for Real, probing tantalisingly on the edge of the City box. Real's latest attach yielded a corner, with Hart then having to produce solid saves from first from Varane and then from Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Real are establishing a base camp at the rim of City's box. Modric has a pop from there but it's straight at Hart.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> A fine break by Tevez and Kolarov relieves the pressure and results in a corner for City. Poor Ronaldo heads the corner clear but City regain the ball and circulate it smartly before winning another corner.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 1-2 City (Kolarov 86')</strong> Kolarov sends a curling freekick from the right towarads the back post. Defenders and attackers go for it ... but all miss it (or maybe Alonso got a slight nick to it) and it bounces into the corner of the net! That's what's called putting the ball into a dangerous area with vicious intent. Nasri's injury has turned out to be a blessing of sorts, since Kolarov has made a difference since replacing him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 2-2 City (Benzema 87')</strong> Way to kill City's celebrations quick smart! Di Maria went on a jagged run down the right and then pinged the ball into Benzema, who turned away from Nastasic and fired a low shot into the net from the edge of the box!</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> This game is far from finished: Real threaten a winner with a lightning break and quickfire passes. Benzema cuts the ball back to Poor Ronaldo, who could put Di Maria through on goal but elects to have a good himself, and Hart pushes his 20-yard drive to safety.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Real 3-2 City (Happy Ronaldo 90')</strong> Ronaldo received the ball on the right, cut inside and sent a swirling shot past Hart and into the net! Kompany appeared to duck under the ball before it bounced just in front of the keeper, who reckons the centreback should have cut it out. Ronaldo, meanwhile, scampers off to milk the adulation of the jubilant crowd.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> City will be sick. Twice they were in front and twice they let their lead slip quickly and sloppily, and then were sunk by a late winner than Ronaldo had been rehearsing all night. It was not a spectacularly high-quality game but it sure had its moments, and a pleasantly chaotic and positive vibe in the second half, in particular.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p>Reaction from Joe Hart: \"It's not on. You can't go 2-1 up and lose. It's not on. We only have ourselves to blame.\"</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Evening all</strong> No peace for the insipid, I've had to double up with the cricket earlier so haven't had time to compose much of a preamble. Tony Adams is looking very relaxed indeed on Sky's coverage. When told Arsenal were 20-1 to win the European Cup, he said: \"Jesus! It's a cup competition.\" Maybe he'll have a punt. Ray Wilkins thinks this is a '\"very nice\" start for Arsenal given Montpellier's poor form this season but any club with Youn\u00e9s Belhanda should not be written off. I was based in Montpellier for the 1998 World Cup. Lovely city. All the talk that summer from fans of MHSC focused on the future of Ibrahima Bakayoko. He ended up at Everton before returning to France with Marseille. I've enjoyed watching Arsenal this season, Cazorla in particular, but praise is also due to Arteta, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Podolski and Diaby. The Ox, however, is on the bench tonight, making way for Giroud's return to Stade de la Mosson.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Your teams</strong><br><strong>Montpellier:</strong> Jourdren, Bocaly, Yanga M'Biwa, Hilton, Bedimo, Estrada, Saihi, Mounier, Belhanda, Cabella, Camara. <br>Subs: Pionnier, Marveaux, Herrera, Congre, Ait-Fana, Stambouli, Jeunechamp. <br><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Diaby, Arteta, Gervinho, Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud. <br>Subs: Shea, Koscielny, Andre Santos, Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, <br>Coquelin. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Cultural update:</strong> From the culturally inquisitive Gary Naylor: \"I'm in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank for an avant garde musical production of Hamlet by the Tiger Lillies. There was a time when this sort of thing cost more than a night at the football.\" I've seen some of their Shockheaded Peter stuff, Gary, and realised my tastes are, by comparison, hopelessly square.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>\"Will you be giving us updates on the Real Madrid-Man City game tonight while you effortlessly MBM Montpellier-Arsenal?\"</strong> asks Brian Russell. \"I'm recording that one, see, so I would prefer it if you didn't.\" Fair enough. I ain't sayin' nish. If you want news from the Bernab\u00e9u, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/champions-league-real-madrid-manchester-city-live\">you need to check in with the Doyler</a>. And as for the \"effortlessly\" \u2026</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Montpellier kick off and within 20 seconds Abou Diaby is yellow carded for a sliding tackle on Estrada in the centre-circle, the referee deciding that even though he got the ball, the lunge was reckless and with his studs up.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Camara is slipped the ball from the left but he had made his run between Vermaelen and Mertesacker too early and was offside, which the referee eventually notices.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Free kick to Arsenal on the edge of the box, five yards or so to the left of centre, for Saihi's foul. Taken by Cazorla, he hits the wall and HSC break quickly with Camara but Vermaelen is well-positioned and the cover comes quickly with Jenkinson making very good ground to force a mistake from Camara and win a throw.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Arsenal corner after a rather nervy clearance from Bocaly. Taken to the near post for Mertesacker but Camara reads the intention and clears the danger.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Mounier is given the ball by Jenkinson rather carelessly when he's looking for Gervinho but again the cover snuffs out the danger.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Penalty to Montpellier!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Montpellier 1-0 Arsenal (Belhanda)</strong> The penalty looked tame when Belhanda went flying over Vermaelen's challenge. It looked on replay though that he did clip him even if the two forward rolls looked excessive. And Belhanda scores the pen with a Panenka of class and contempt.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> We're still on the old MBM software so you might need to refresh the page for the goal descriptions to appear. There's a smoke bomb or flare behind Mannone's goal after the penalty. Arsenal have responded with composure, playing it short after going behind for the first time this season, looking to get Cazorla and, particularly, Podolski on the ball.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Montpellier take a free kick for another soft foul, Estrada rifling in a shot from 30 yards out by the left touchline that Podolski half clears but the rebound opportunity is hit wide and wasted.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Montpellier 1-1 Arsenal (Podolski)</strong> A wonderful move with Cazorla picking up a pass about 30 yards out and firing in a pass to Giroud who lays it off to Podolski running free through the middle with a deft flick and the German sells the goalkeeper with his shimmy and calmly slots his shot home from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Montpellier 1-2 Arsenal (Gervinho)</strong> The assist comes from Jenkinson with a cross spun across the six-yard box from the right begging to be turned in. Gervinho had started the move, playing a one-two with the right back before cutting inside. When he was tackled the ball made its way back to Jenkinson who curled in the cross to the spot where Gervinho had continued his run.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Right. Where were we? Refresh if you can't see the goal descriptions.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> You get the feeling from the way Tony Adams spoke of Jenkinson in the build-up that he's Streve Bould's particular protege. And he's playing very well, indeed, linking up with Gervinho but also positioning himself to prevent Cabella cutting in to link up with Belhanda. Belhanda just did get a run but his cross ballooned up and Mertesacker nodded it clear.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> An almost identical cross to his assist from Jenkinson is cut out by Yanga-Mbiwa for a corner, taken by Cazorla and headed away by Belhanda.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Podolski gets away with a foul on Cabella, either unseen by the referee, or, according to the commentator, the referee not impressed by the triple body roll on falling so decided to ignore it. Belhanda robs Cazorla who claims a foul but doesn't get it either then Arteta stalls the move by tapping Cabella's ankles.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Giroud's crossfield pass is telegraphed and cut out, allowing Mounier to launch a jinking raid up the left to win a corner. It's played short to make an angle and though three HSC forwards anticipate the deep cross to the far post from the left so does Gibbs who leaps to head it out of the area and upfield to Podolski. Good anticipation and concentration.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Arteta on the ball in the old right-half position, elegantly chips up a pass to Jenkinson on halfway by the touchline and he feeds Gervinho with a short lay-off, turns and sprints upfield but Gervinho hesitates and holds on to the ball too long losing possession.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Giroud wins a free-kick when Yanga-Mbiwa jumps into his back. Cazorla takes it, five yards in from touch, 35 yards from goal on the left but he and Arteta try to be too clever and draw the defenders out but are caught in possession when they can't offload it quickly enough.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Shot from 20 yards from Estrada who ran in horizontally across from the right touchline and spun a left-foot shot towards Mannone's left post and the Italian turned it around with his finger tips.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> \"Calling Montpellier HSC, while strictly true, makes them sound like bankers,\" writes Krishan Arora. \"Maybe the Arsenal fans could think of a chant around that.\" Inventive these football fans, Krishan. Good break from Montpellier with Mounier spinning in a deep cross that Mannone picks up.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Mertesacker looks calm in possession tonight. There were times last season when he was prone to panic but it seems that he trusts both himself, the system and his team-mates now. Yellow card for Yanga-Mbiwa for pole-axing Arteta after he'd lost the ball and tried too vigorously to reclaim it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Aaagh. Diaby fails to make the killer pass to set up Giroud by inches.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Gervinho is enjoying the space he's been given and the movement of Cazorla and Podolski, to sneak in off the right touchline and almost carve out chances. His final balls, so far since his goal, have just been cut out. But only by a toe.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Arsenal corner from Cazorla loops straight into Jourdren's hands.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half time: </strong> \"A propos of very little, the great Carlos Valderrama used to run out for Montpellier,\" writes Simon Frank. \"He is a quarter of my all-time dream midfield of Xavi, El Pibe, Seedorf and Bart-Williams.\" The Bartman. What taste! \"This is the first time I can remember seeing Montpellier on TV since Mark Hughes grabbed his face after zero contact, a la Rivaldo, to get one of their players sent off,\" says Niall Mullen. \"I think it was at Old Trafford but I cannot find a clip anywhere. Did I dream it?\"</p> <p>You didn't, Niall. Here's David Lacey:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"07 Mar 1991: The Guardian - Page 18 - (686 words)<br>Soccer: Ten-man Montpellier show up United - European Cup Winners' Cup, third round, first leg: Manchester United 1, Montpellier 1<br>By: By DAVID LACEY<br>MANCHESTER United made a blissful start to their Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final against Montpellier at Old Trafford last night but then showed their ignorance of European affairs. As a result English football's first season back in the continental competitions since the Heysel tragedy looks likely to end with a spot of French leave.</p> <p>When Brian McClair gave United the lead after 53 seconds Old Trafford echoed to the sounds of a half-forgotten glory. But within six minutes Lee Martin, whose goal had won them the FA Cup at Wembley last May, put the ball into his own net and Montpellier , thrown this unexpected lifeline, never let go.</p> <p>So now Alex Ferguson's players have to visit the tight little stadium in the south of France where Bobby Robson's PSV Eindhoven side lost narrowly in the first round and Steaua Bucharest were routed 5-0 in the second.<strong> Last night Montpellier showed all the resilience which had frustrated PSV in the away leg and easily survived the dismissal of Baills which reduced them to 10 men for all but three minutes of the second half.</strong></p> <p><strong>The right-back was a little unlucky but remained the victim of his own impetuosity. The game had stopped for a Manchester United free-kick when Baills charged at Hughes and appeared to knock the striker to the ground.</strong></p> <p><strong>Television suggested that contact between the two players had been minimal but the Italian referee saw only violent conduct and produced the red card. </strong>So Baills will miss the return game along with Guerin, who had been sent off in Eindhoven and was booked last night for a foul on Sharpe.</p> <p>Manchester United will not take much consolation from the absence of these Montpellier players. Valderrama and his orange mop have yet to appear in this tie and Xuereb, who came on for the last eight minutes, nearly won the match for them in the closing seconds.</p> <p>Manchester United provided a stirring overture but then failed to give a performance. Robson and Hughes are not short of European experience but the team as a whole lacked the wit to break down a Montpellier defence tightly organised around Blanc, the sweeper, and increasingly relieved of pressure by the excellent displays in midfield of Lemoult and Suvrijn.</p> <p>Having shown how Sharpe's speed on the left could win the tie, United relied more and more on Robson trying to drive deep wedges into a packed defence which absorbed this form of attack with equanimity. It was boiled beef and carrots against solid provincial French cooking.</p> <p>Manchester United never recreated the speed and simplicity of their opening movement a quick pass from Hughes to Sharpe, whose pace left Baills standing, and a low cross from which McClair drove the ball firmly past Barrabe. Thereafter their crosses and final passes became vague and predictable.</p> <p>Yet all might have been well for United had Martin not suffered his moment of aberration in the seventh minute. Garcia opened up the left flank for Montpellier by sending Ziober towards the byline. The Pole's centre was low and true but nobody was in the goalmouth except Martin and Sealey.</p> <p>Maybe Martin was aware of someone stealing up behind but the young full-back, who had not scored at either end since the Cup final, prodded the ball into his own net.</p> <p>Manchester United had several chances to regain the lead Barrabe saving smartly from Hughes, who later directed a free header into the goalkeeper's hands, and McClair just failing to connect with a diving header after Sharpe had at last provided another dangerous centre.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails ping in</strong>: \"Louis Nicollin cheekily offered to take Giroud back on loan,\" says Matt \"not an Arsenal fan\" Dony. \"Is it equally as cheeky to suggest it might be a good idea for Arsenal?

This has been very disjointed so far from Arsenal this half.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Another HSC corner, taken short then sent to Mounier on the edge of the D. He pivots to take it on the volley with his left foot and connects well but Vermaelen is wise to it and stands tall to block the shot. \"Simon Frank got me to reminiscing about Montpellier when Valderrama played for them,\" writes Brian Russell. \"I have a strong memory of them playing, I think, Liverpool, in Europe in the early 90's.

Good times for fans of crazy hair and slick togga.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Montpellier have begun this half with great gusto and given the chances they've either been handed on a platter by Arsenal's slackness or carved out for themselves should be level by now. Now Cazorla is robbed and the ball breaks to Cabella who weights a lovely chip over Mannone and on to the bar then hits another with his left foot over the bar from the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Montpellier have dominated this past 10 minutes, largely because Diaby and Arteta are being bypassed either on the flanks or with the ball coming from the breakdown of their attacks catching them on the front foot.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Diaby sidles forward with all his languid grace to set up a shot for Cazorla that is beaten away by Jourdren.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Very sharp passing from Montpellier, quick and to feet, is threatening still to pierce Arsenal's defence. As Alan Smith says, they're putting in far more conspicuous effort this half, upping the pace and getting right up to their opponents on the press.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Part of this second-half recovery is down to the greater presence of Saihi and his impact in splitting the advanced midfield three from the two behind.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> In truth HSC have moved the ball with such slickness this half that they should have equalised before they inevitably run out of puff.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Bocaly and Belhanda play a one-two in the box, the full-back falling over when he receives the final pass by the penalty spot. The crowd appeals for a penalty but the ref tells him to get up. It looked like a dive. Off goes Mounier, replaced by A\u00eft-Fana.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Excellent close control from Podolski on the dribble when he storms into the box almost bears fruit but Yanga-Mbiwa stays so tight that he finally gets his foot in to stop him shooting.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> A lot of chat from the commentators centres on Giroud's lack of effectiveness and whether he should be replaced. He's not found it easy this half and I wonder if his positioning as the spearhead with the so called trident behind him is quite right yet.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Pot shot from Ait-Fana ends up as a daisy-cutter when he slips mid-execution as he hits it from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Perhaps Arsenal have weathered that 30-minute storm but then again given the number of times they have given the ball away they might need the imminent reinforcements in midfield to effect a proper change.

Ramsey on for Giroud.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> So Gervinho goes left and Podolski through the middle and again the German is a foot away from a fair shooting chance. It's Diaby and Cazorla who look most knacked and in need of replacing. Stamboulli for Camara, Herrera also comes on for HSC.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Diaby is pickpocketed again, for the third or fourth time this half, and has his centre-halfs to thank for stopping the thrust from HSC. He didn't play on Saturday and looks ring rusty after the international break and his knock.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Belhanda wastes a peach of a chance after shifting the ball between his feet having seen Mertesacker on his backside when his lunge couldn't cut the pass out. His fall opens the space for a shot from 10 yards which Mannone blocks with his armpit.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Arsenal look pooped, more than a touch winded after their exertions to repel Montpellier's second-half revival. They earn a breather when Belhanda is booked for catching Arteta with a flung-out hand and understandably take as much time as they can.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Arsenal play it back from an attack up the left wing, fully 80 yards to Mannone who begins again but when the ball is chipped over the top by Diaby for Gervinho's clever run he was a couple of feet offside.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Montpellier continue to commit players forward, particularly Yanga-Mbiwa on surges up the right flank to link up with Bocaly. In he runs from the touchline towards the box, lays it off then gets it back and hits a cross from inside the area but Mannone catches it.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Arsenal subs: Walcott for Podolski; Coquelin for Cazorla. There will be three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong>Montpellier claim a penalty against Diaby for what they perceive to be a trip on Cabella but he didn't seem to catch him and the referee isn't buying it.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Yanga-Mbiwa plays a 30-yard pass into the box, trying to find Herrera but Gibbs heads it away before it drops to the forward's feet.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> Strong block by Vermaelen closes the game.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Full time: Montpellier 1-2 Arsenal</strong> One-nil down. Two-one up. Arsenal played very well for a good half hour of the first half but Montpellier dominated that second half as Arsenal lost possession, and energy because they'd spent so much chasing the ball which was being zipped about. HSC squandered several chances and Arsenal, in the end, hung on. Excellent result for them and rumours of Montpellier's demise have been greatly exaggerated but their performance after half-time will be a concern. Thanks for your emails. Good night.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's largest police forces has been plunged into deep shock and mourning after two \"very brave and courageous\" unarmed female officers were said to have been lured to an ambush where they were fatally injured in a gun and grenade attack.</p> <p>Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, were responding to a routine callout in Hattersley, Tameside, when they were caught in a trap believed to have been set by Dale Cregan, a fugitive wanted by police in connection with earlier suspected murders. The deaths are the first time two British female officers have been killed on duty.</p> <p>As they arrived at a property in Abbey Gardens where a burglary had been reported, the officers came under fire from bullets and a grenade. The call was thought to have been made either by Cregan, 29, or someone acting on his behalf, said Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police.</p> <p>\"It would appear Cregan has deliberately done this in an act of cold-blooded murder,\" he told a press conference. The motive for the unprecedented attack was \"impossible to fathom\", he added.</p> <p>Within an hour, Cregan \u2013 who had already been the focus of a huge manhunt \u2013 is believed to have walked into a nearby police station in Hyde. He was arrested on suspicion of the murders of Bone and Hughes, as well as those of David and Mark Short, who were killed in separate attacks earlier this year.</p> <p>Tributes poured in for the two officers, who, against the backdrop of criticism relating to the Hillsborough disaster and the PC Simon Harwood case, were described by Fahy as \"exemplifying the very best of British policing\". Flags at the force's headquarters were flying at half mast.</p> <p>Hughes, who had served three years in the force, was described by her colleagues as a \"bubbly\" karate fan who \"couldn't do enough for people\". Bone, who had been with the force for five years, was said by Fahy to be a \"calm, gentle woman\" and \"excellent bobby\" who had been about to get married.</p> <p>Before she went out on patrol with her colleague, he said, she had spoken to her partner on the phone about wedding invitations.</p> <p>\"What we've got are two young girls who went out this morning and they've got an absolute right to come home tonight to their loved ones,\" said the chairman of the Greater Manchester Police Federation, Ian Hanson. \"This is cold-blooded murder. It's the slaughter of the innocents.\"</p> <p>Branding the attack an act of \"pure evil\", David Cameron said: \"The cold-blooded murder of two female police officers doing their job out there protecting the public, another reminder of the incredible risks and great work our police service does. My thoughts and I think the thoughts of the whole country will be with their families at this impossibly difficult time.\"</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, said: \"This is a deeply shocking incident and a terrible reminder of the risks that police officers face every day to keep our communities safe.\"</p> <p>Cregan, of Droylsden, had been wanted by Greater Manchester police ever since 23-year-old Mark Short, an amateur boxer, was gunned down at a pub in May \u2013 and the search became even more urgent when, in August, David Short, Mark's father, was killed at his home in Clayton, Manchester. A reward of \u00a350,000 was offered for information leading to Cregan's arrest.</p> <p>Despite a huge search that had seen multiple arrests made and pictures of the one-eyed man distributed nationwide, however, police said they had had no intelligence linking him to the street or property.</p> <p>Consequently, Bone and Hughes were dispatched unarmed, at about 11am, to the reported burglary, which had been called in an hour earlier. While cautioning that police were still piecing together how the exact chronology of events that had led to the tragedy, Fahy accused Cregan of having laid a deliberate trap.</p> <p>He said: \"We believe Dale Cregan was in a house in Abbey Gardens overnight and at some point this morning has either himself made a call or have someone else make a call reporting a burglary. This particular address was not known to us, was not in our intelligence systems, had not featured in this particular huge inquiry ... and so, as would be routine, two unarmed officers were sent to the scene. When they arrived it appears that Cregan then emerged into the road and killed these two officers. A firearm was used and a grenade was also used.\"</p> <p>PC Bone was killed at the scene, police said. Her colleague died a short while later despite the efforts of an emergency team from Tameside hospital.</p> <p>Officers who had been involved in the search for Cregan had been left \"shattered\" by the tragic way in which he had finally been apprehended, said the chief constable. Vowing to full investigate what he said had been \"a criminal conspiracy\" to harbour him, Fahy said the force was \"absolutely determined\" to bring those involved to justice.</p> <p>In Hattersley, the area around Abbey Gardens was cordoned off and a bomb disposal unit reportedly seen nearby. Warren Shepherd, a window cleaner, said he heard the attack and saw the officers being taken into ambulances. \"I just heard gun shots, bang, bang, bang \u2013 about 10 of them, then a pause and a big explosion,\" he said.</p> <p>As a police helicopter hovered, Christopher Quinn, a near neighbour who heard the commotion from Ashworth Lane, said he heard what he would describe as \"a boom-like sound under water\". He said: \"I just heard one bang and I didn't go out and look but my friend said something was happening in the area, so everyone went outside. Hattersley has a pretty bad reputation but we don't see anything bad on this side of the estate. I didn't know Dale Cregan was in the area \u2013 I don't even know what he looks like.\"</p> <p>Quinn said he knew the man who lived in the house where Cregan is believed to have been staying. He described the neighbour, who lived on his own, as \"just a normal lad, really sound\".</p> <p>There were some calls for police officers to be routinely armed. The officers were the second and third officers to have died after a firearms incident this year. PC Ian Dibell was killed in July by a single bullet wound to the chest after intervening in a dispute in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.</p> <p>Darren Rathband, the twin of PC David Rathband who was shot and blinded by Raoul Moat and found dead at his home earlier this year, said that equipping officers with only CS or pepper spray and Tasers \"beggars belief\".</p> <p>However, opinion within the police service has historically shown itself to be opposed to the idea of routinely arming officers, with a 2006 a Police Federation survey of 47,000 officers finding 82% opposed it. Fahy argued that officers could not be sent armed to \"hundreds\" of routine callouts.</p> <p>\"We are passionate that the British style of policing is routinely unarmed policing. We know from the experience in America and other countries, that having armed officers certainly does not mean, sadly, that police officers do not end up getting shot.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Maldives stand on a knife edge. At stake is its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12651486\" title=\"\">hard-won liberal democracy</a>, forged from the ruins of a brutal, 30-year dictatorship \u2013 a period that was synonymous with serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7658672.stm\" title=\"\">President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a>'s rule was eventually ended in 2008, by a democratic vote in which I was elected. But it is important that the outside world clearly understands that Gayoom, his allies and his henchmen are back. It was they who established, late last year, the \"December coalition\" of Islamic extremists who accused my government of being controlled by \"Jews\" and \"Christians\" and used incitement to religious hatred and violence as political tools. It was they who orchestrated February's overthrow of the Maldives' first democratically elected government. And it is they who control the current administration as well as the police and armed forces. From this position of strength, they are slowly squeezing the life out of the democratic fabric of my country.</p> <p>Despite this, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (Cmag), which met last week, is considering removing the Maldives situation from its agenda. A decision is expected in late Septemberlater this month. The choice before the group, comprising the foreign ministers of Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Vanuatu, could hardly be more important.</p> <p>Thousands of pro-democracy protesters in the Maldives have been brutalised by the police, arrested and imprisoned. Many of them have been tortured, or charged with terrorism \u2013 the favoured means, post 9/11, for repressive states to dispose of opponents. Journalists have been beaten and arrested and media outlets threatened with legal action and closure. Freedom of speech is being strictly curtailed \u2013 people can now be arrested for calling members of the current government \"traitors\". And the country's independent oversight bodies are being staffed with friends and relatives.</p> <p>Moreover, a growing sense of impunity is taking hold. Key agents of February's coup d'etat, and the police officers responsible for the violence that followed, know they cannot be touched. A grotesquely one-sided report into the coup, by the Commission of National Inquiry, was co-chaired by Gayoom's former defence minister. Despite gross and systematic human rights violations since February \u2013 all catalogued by NGOs such as <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/maldives\" title=\"\">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href=\"http://minivannews.com/politics/maldives-backtracking-on-democracy-international-federation-for-human-rights-43715\" title=\"\">International Federation of Human Rights</a> \u2013 not one police officer or state representative has been prosecuted. Indeed, many of those responsible have been promoted.</p> <p>The government has said it will not do anything to ensure accountability for these crimes. And yet, without even a hint of irony, it is ruthlessly pursuing legal action against many of the pro-democracy campaigners elected to government in 2008, including myself. Numerous members of parliament from my party, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldivian_Democratic_Party\" title=\"\">Maldives Democratic party</a>, have been taken before pliant judges and stripped of their seats. Many more await trial. The government has also made clear that I and members of my former cabinet will stand trial very soon, with the home minister promising that I will be imprisoned for the rest of my life.</p> <p>Their goal, in addition to revenge for their electoral defeat, is to prevent me standing in next year's election. Gayoom and his allies made the mistake once of losing power through a free and fair election: they will not make the same mistake twice.</p> <p>If Cmag were to remove the Maldives from its agenda the chances of securing justice for the victims of human rights violations, and of ever again having free and fair elections in the country, would disappear. The Maldives would once again become a police state, and our cherished democracy relegated to a footnote in the history books \u2013 a one-off experiment that failed.</p> <p>So I urge the group members to keep the spotlight on my country until all violations have been dealt with, all victims have received redress, and conditions are in place for fresh elections.</p>",
  "<p>Back in the early 1940s my grandfather had a great idea. Noting the obsession Californians have with perfectly green front lawns, he decided that what they needed was an automatic sprinkler system. He lavished time and love on it, inventing this and fine-tuning that, and eventually came up with what was essentially an electric clock that could be timed to turn water valves on or off at given times of the day and night. Patent number 2311108 was duly filed in 1943, at which point my grandfather started knocking on manufacturers' doors. It was a long, arduous process. Finally, in 1950, after endless discussions, the Moody Rainmaster hit the stores. It earned my grandfather a modest income.</p> <p>Recently, I decided to follow in his footsteps, but apply a little 21st-century know-how to the mix. Online I found a few like-minded souls interested in producing an improved water sprinkler. We used open-source software to help us create a sprinkler system not only capable of being operated remotely via an app by worried gardeners on holiday, but also sophisticated enough to factor in the latest local weather forecasts before deciding whether to switch the system on or off. We then sent our designs to an assembly house who duly came up with a smart-looking finished product. It has proved quite popular. It took my grandfather a decade and a small fortune to perfect his device and market it. It took us a few months and $5,000.</p> <p>And that in a nutshell is the Maker movement \u2013 harnessing the internet and the latest manufacturing technologies to make things. The past 10 years have been about discovering new ways to work together and offer services on the web. The next 10 years will, I believe, be about applying those lessons to the real world. It means that the future doesn't just belong to internet businesses founded on virtual principles. but to ones that are firmly rooted in the physical world.</p> <p>This has massive implications not just for would-be entrepreneurs but for national economies. The fact is that any country, if it wants to remain strong, must have a manufacturing base. Even today, about a quarter of the US economy rests on the creation of physical goods. A service economy is all well and good, but eliminate manufacturing and you're a nation of bankers, burger flippers and tour guides. As for software and information industries, they may get all the press, but they employ just a small percentage of the population.</p> <p>The nascent Maker movement offers a path to reboot manufacturing \u2013 not by returning to the giant factories of old, with their armies of employees, but by creating a new kind of manufacturing economy, one shaped more like the web itself: bottom-up, broadly distributed, and highly entrepreneurial. The image of a few smart people changing the world with little more than an internet connection and an idea increasingly describes manufacturing of the future, too.</p> <p>It's almost a cliche that anyone with a sufficiently good software idea can create a fabulously successful company on the web. That's because there are practically no barriers preventing entry to entrepreneurship online: if you've got a laptop and a credit card, you're in business. Manufacturing has traditionally been regarded as something else entirely. But over the past few years, something remarkable has begun to happen. The process of making physical stuff has started to look more like the process of making digital stuff.</p> <p>Various innovations are helping to make this possible. The first, of course, is the crowdsourcing power of the internet \u2013 if you don't know all the answers, there is someone out there who will. Put out a call for help on a blog or online forum, and somewhere there will be an expert prepared to help you. The second innovation is the increasing sophistication of design programs that can take raw ideas and transform them into executable files. Just as word-processing software has become ever simpler and more intuitive for the user, so Cad (computer-aided design) programs are becoming simultaneously more sophisticated and easier to handle. You design something; the Cad program works out how it can be&#xa0;produced.</p> <p>And then there is the first generation of 3D printers. These take \"geometries\" on screen (3D objects that are created with the same sorts of tools that Hollywood uses to make computer generated movies and turn them into objects that you can pick up and use. Some 3D printers extrude molten plastic in layers to make these objects, while others use a laser to harden layers of liquid or powder resin so the product emerges from a bath of the raw material. Yet others can make objects out of any material from glass, steel and bronze to gold, titanium or even cake frosting. You can print a flute or you can print a meal. You can even print human organs of living cells, by squirting a fluid with suspended stem sells on to a support matrix.</p> <p>What's important here is not so much current reality as potential. 3D printers, laser cutters and \"CNC\" (computer numerical control) machines, which use a drill bit to shape a block of material, are already sophisticated devices \u2013 a few years ago they would have seemed distinctly sci-fi \u2013 but I suspect that they resemble the technology of 10 years hence in much the same way that the primitive single-colour dot matrix printers of the 1980s resemble the colour laser printers we having sitting in our homes today. Even now scientists are talking about creating manufacturing tools that use \"structural DNA\" to create physical objects. In other words, the technology still has a long journey to make. However, its liberating implications are already there, and I believe that when they are combined with other online innovations, a very powerful manufacturing force is created.</p> <p>First of all, such technology helps remove the shackles from innovation. Until now, the creative process has been beset with obstacles, from the problems inherent in creating a prototype, to the difficulties of persuading a third party to become involved, to the expense of the final launch. And, of course, there's no guarantee of ultimate success.</p> <p>Now, however, things are looking rather different, both at the innovation and the selling stages.</p> <p>Take Alex Andon, for example. After graduating in 2006, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for a biotech job. But his real passion was jellyfish, which he had first encountered while sailing in the British Virgin Islands as a teenager. He quit his job and set up a company in a friend's garage to make custom jellyfish tanks with special pumps (a conventional pump will suck in a jellyfish and rip it to pieces), custom water-flow systems to keep the jellyfish off the sides and colourful LED lighting. That in itself was no small feat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376778\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347988412127/jellyfish-001.jpg\" alt=\"jellyfish\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Andon's jellyfish tank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Alex also scored, though, was in his ability to test the market before he launched his product. He opted to go via the crowdfunding website <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> to see whether people were interested in what he could offer them. If they were, he invited them to help fund his start-up in return for one of his Desktop Jellyfish Tanks at a discount. His aim was to raise $3,000. After a month he had raised more than $130,000. He had managed both to market-test his idea and find his first customers without having to go to the risky expense of first filling a warehouse (or his bedroom) with jellyfish tanks.</p> <p>It's not difficult to see how Maker technology suits this sort of niche enterprise. The chances are that a savvy and committed market already exists for the right product, and, thanks to the internet, it's relatively easy to find it. What's more the current manufacturing technology that supports Makers is ideally suited to small batches of bespoke products \u2013 from customised plastic toys to tailored clothes. With a conventional factory, you fix on a design and mass-produce it; start up is expensive, but mass-production involves compensating economies of scale. With a 3D printer, start up is cheap, but there are no economies of scale to&#xa0;be gained: product number 150 will&#xa0;cost&#xa0;you precisely the same to create as product number 1. That precludes success in the mass market, but does set you up to succeed in a niche market that by its very nature is&#xa0;less price sensitive.</p> <p>Moreover, you can, if you choose, make every item bespoke: number 150 does not have to be precisely the same in appearance as number 100. And you can manufacture at home, perhaps using your own 3D printer (in the US prices are already dropping to $1,000) or sending your files to a third party fitted out with the necessary kit.</p> <p>Having said that, I don't believe that Makers enterprises have to remain small-scale. Many, of course, will opt to do so, creating customised goods for a specialist market. Others, though, can utilise all that the Maker technology has to offer to get an enterprise off the ground, road test its products, respond to customer feedback, and then build a larger-scale company. What they'll have going for them in addition \u2013 and it's something that many larger companies lack \u2013 is agility and flexibility built into their DNA.</p> <p>Imagine a new company, WindCo, making its first product: a small backyard wind turbine generator. They&#xa0;make the first prototype themselves, as well as a handful of others. Then, it's time to go into serious&#xa0;production. WindCo is small, and they don't have sufficient manufacturing capacity themselves, so they outsource to a factory in China that can handle small batches cheaply.</p> <p>If the product is successful and demand builds, they may well opt to move production back home to cut out delays. If it's astonishingly successful, then they may decide to move production to a different factory in China that specialises in bulk manufacturing. They have to be flexible because their business is constantly evolving. They are able to be flexible because their design files are digital, the tooling costs of setting up a new manufacturing operation are minimal, and they all use the same robotic machinery.</p> <p>This adaptive business of the future will need to be accommodating in other ways, too. It needs to be in constant contact with its customers and be prepared to respond quickly to their feedback and criticism. It needs to be able to draw on skills wherever they are, not merely on people who happen to be close to home. The co-founder of a small robot aeroplane enterprise I run, for example, is not someone who answered an ad, but an enthusiast who came to my attention when he started posting inspired ideas for improvements on a online forum I&#xa0;was hosting.</p> <p>That this can work is demonstrated by the success of a Colorado-based company, <a href=\"http://www.sparkfun.com/\" title=\"\">Sparkfun</a>, which operates in one of the most ruthlessly cut-throat of all areas of business \u2013 electronics. Back in 2003 its founder, Nathan Seidle, was an undergraduate engineering student, who was finding it frustratingly difficult to locate electronic components that he needed for his projects. Today, Sparkfun designs and manufactures specialist printed circuit boards, using sophisticated pick-and-place robot machines to assemble them. Its website makes a major feature of its blog, with chatty tutorials and videos from employees, and forums that are full of customers helping one another.</p> <p>Its employees are young, passionate and appear to totally love their jobs. Dogs and hobbies are indulged at work (though not on the production floor); tattoos and indie punk rock reflect its culture. It's a far cry from the \"dark satanic mill\" vision of manufacturing \u2013 much closer in fact to the maverick image of software companies in their startup days.</p> <p>And it works. Today Sparkfun has more than 120 employees and annual revenues of around $30 million. It's growing by 50% a year. A basketball-court-sized ground floor is dominated by robotic electronic production lines, running day and night. Daily blog posts and tutorials have turned its retail website into a high-traffic community, with more than 50,000 visitors a day.</p> <p>The Maker movement has a long way to go before it can really be said to have come of age. But that doesn't mean it should be ignored or regarded solely as a hobbyist's or niche manufacturer's paradise. It represents the first steps in a different way of doing business. Rather than top-down innovation by some of the biggest companies in the world, we're starting to see bottom-up innovation by countless individuals, including amateurs, entrepreneurs and professionals. We've already seen it work before, in bits, from the original PC hobbyists to the web's citizen army. Now the conditions have arrived for it to work again, at even greater, broader scale, in atoms. If the Second Industrial Revolution was the Information Age, then I would argue that a Third Industrial Age is on its way: the age of&#xa0;the Makers.</p> <p><em>Makers: The New Industrial Revolution by Chris Anderson is published by Random House Business Books, priced \u00a320.

  "<p>The UK Border Agency has disclosed that it is working on plans for fast-track passport lanes for rich travellers at Heathrow and other British airports so it can avoid a repeat of the two-hour queues witnessed this year. Brian Moore, the departing head of the UK Border Force, told MPs that \"high-value\" people who were considered valuable passengers by the airlines or valuable to the British economy would be given priority treatment at immigration control under the plans.</p> <p>It would be an extension of a priority queueing system tried out this year at Heathrow, under which passengers from Australia, Canada, the US, New Zealand and other mainly \"old Commonwealth\" countries who do not need a visa to enter Britain would be fast-tracked.</p> <p>Moore told the Commons home affairs select committee: \"It is an idea that officials are discussing with port operators. It will then go back to ministers for them to consider whether and how it is going to be progressed. It is an idea that is being&#xa0;pursued.\"</p> <p>Keith Vaz, the committee chair, pressed Moore as to whether it meant the super-rich would have a fast-track into Britain. Moore said it would cover people who were \"valuable to the economy and were valued by the airlines\". He said the move was intended to demonstrate that Britain was \"open for business\".</p> <p>The plan is likely to be seen as highly divisive, especially if there is any repeat of the two-hour queues at passport control earlier this year and in the runup to the Olympics. Even at normal times, passengers from outside the EU are expected to queue for up to 45 minutes to get through passport control at Heathrow. The airport has a target to keep passport queues below 25 minutes for passengers with EU&#xa0;passports.</p> <p>UKBA declined to give any further detail on who would qualify as a \"high-value business person\" to get such preferential treatment. But it could be safely assumed that frequent business-class flyers might well be nominated by airlines to qualify. Other wealthy individuals and their families that British embassies, consulates and large companies nominate as valuable to the UK economy might also be offered such a fast-track into Britain.</p> <p>Moore said similar fast-track schemes were in operation in other countries, with some airlines offering first-class ticket holders speedy passport checks.</p> <p>The super-rich from outside Europe have already been offered a fast track to settle in Britain under immigration rule changes proposed last year. Overseas \"super-investors\" who are willing to keep \u00a35m in a UK bank account are to be given the right to stay indefinitely in Britain after only three years, two years faster than the five-year wait imposed on every other migrant. An overseas investor who is willing to deposit more than \u00a310m will be able to stay after an even shorter period: two years.</p> <p>This contrasts sharply with the new minimum income threshold of \u00a322,400 a year introduced in July for a British citizen wanting to bring an overseas spouse and child into the country to live with them.</p>",
  "<p>A new \u00a318,000-a-year private university headed by the philosopher AC Grayling and offering lectures by Richard Dawkins, Niall Ferguson and Steven Pinker has not filled any of its courses ahead of its opening next week.</p> <p>The New College of the Humanities is still offering undergraduate places in economics, English, history, law and philosophy with just days to go until it opens in Bloomsbury, central London. It has recruited only a third of the students it intends to have in each year group.</p> <p>The numbers suggest NCH, which has been established as a for-profit private company, will run at a significant loss in its first year.</p> <p>Backers of the college include the City financiers Howard Leigh and John Singer, as well as Charles Watson, chairman of the PR firm Financial Dynamics. With others, they are understood to have provided support of about \u00a310m.</p> <p>When Grayling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/05/new-college-dawkins-grayling-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">launched the college last year</a> as a commercial alternative to Cambridge and Oxford, which are up to five times oversubscribed, the plan was to attract 200 students a year with teaching staff who would include some of the most famous academics in the UK and US.</p> <p>In April, Grayling was reported as saying that the overall intake in September would be \"no more than 180 to 200\", but in advance of next Monday's opening the NCH confirmed that only 60 students were expected to take up places this term.</p> <p>Grayling had said that students and their parents would consider \u00a354,000 for a three-year University of London degree good value for money, despite this sum being double the fee charged by the University of London's own colleges. He said: \"There's a quarter more content, contact with some rather distinguished people, and preparation for professional life.\"</p> <p>But the low take-up could prove embarrassing for some of the high-profile teachers who signed up. They include the Booker prize-winning novelist Howard Jacobson and the Princeton history lecturer Sir David Cannadine.</p> <p>Lawrence Krauss, professor of earth and space exploration and physics at Arizona state university, who has advised Barack Obama on science policy, is to teach cosmology and science literacy, and the leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson is a visiting professor.</p> <p>Grayling said on Tuesday that he was very happy with the number of students presently enrolling.</p> <p>\"Sixty students in our first cohort is ideal. This founding group of students, similar in size to that of a small Oxbridge college, will receive an individual experience.\" They would \"form our founding clubs, societies and union, which will be built on in years to come\", he said.</p> <p>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, the largest trade union for lecturers, said the numbers suggested it would \"take more than occasional appearances from academics off the telly to justify the enormous price tag\". She added: \"Perhaps unsurprisingly, charging fees of more than double humanities courses at established institutions does not appear to be the way to open the subject up to more students.\"</p> <p>Students at NCH will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/06/ac-grayling-private-university-syllabus?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">follow syllabuses matching those taught in University of London colleges</a> and will have to sit exams in the university to gain their degree, said Jonathan Kidd, dean of the University of London's international programme.</p> <p>With the student numbers as they stand at present there will be more than one teacher for every two students. About 20 students will be on assisted places, either paying no fees at all or \u00a37,200.</p> <p>If half of those were on full scholarships, NCH would have an annual income of about \u00a3800,000, from which it would pay a teaching staff of 36, and cover the cost of premises at Bedford Square, London, and the tens of thousands of pounds in fees to the University of London to which the students are registered.</p> <p>\"We are not disappointed,\" said Watson, the college's chairman. \"It is not above expectations, but it is where we thought we would be. We were really a bit late getting to the sales process by launching last June. People are starting to take a view on where they are going to go in the lower sixth form. So the second year is a really key test because we will be able to engage with students at an early stage.\"</p> <p>NCH had 445 applications and offered places to 112 candidates. Watson said most of those who turned down their offer did so after securing places at Oxford and Cambridge, where the fees are \u00a39,000.</p> <p>He denied price was an issue with any of those who opted to go elsewhere and said some chose American universities where the fees might be higher than at NCH.</p> <p>Liam Burns, general secretary of the National Union of Students, called NCH a vanity project: \"It is no surprise that students are failing to sign up. Our research shows that students value teaching ability and interaction with other students and academics over inaccessible star names with a mountain of publishing credits.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Beijing Olympic silver medallist Emma Pooley had hinted before the world time-trial championships in South Limburg that her chances of remaining in the sport next year would be enhanced by regaining the title she won in 2010, or improving on last year's silver medal, but on the day she finished a disappointed fourth behind the defending champion, Judith Arndt.</p> <p>On a course that was far better suited to her climbing skills than the flatter circuit at the London Olympic Games, Pooley started strongly and was one of three riders who went through the first time check, 10 kilometres into the 24.3km course, between six and seven seconds behind Arndt, who was riding the event for the last time; the German will retire after Saturday's road race at the age of 36.</p> <p>After the strength-sapping but not particularly steep ascent of the Gronsvelderberg early in the course, the key point was the final climb, the short and brutal Cauberg, which begins in the village of Valkenberg and tops out with a 1.7km drag to the finish line. The ascent is a key feature in the Dutch spring classic, the Amstel Gold Race, and it will form the finale to all of the road races when they start on Friday.</p> <p>Pooley had slipped to fourth behind Arndt, New Zealand's Linda Villumsen and Evelyn Stevens of the United States at the second checkpoint at 16km and, although she looked to have springs in her legs as she danced on the pedals up the Cauberg towards the finish, she did not regain enough time on the climb to earn a medal, crossing the line 9sec slower than Villumsen, the bronze medallist.</p> <p>The 30-year-old Pooley has already stated her intention of taking some or all of next year out of the sport and she has said the decision will be made after the world championship.</p> <p>\"I've got a PhD to finish off, so I won't be going to Australia to train this winter as I usually do,\" she said. \"I can't see cycling as a long-term job, it's not going to keep me for the rest of my life. It's not that I want to get paid lots of money, it's that it's not easy if you get into your late 30s and then have to find a new career path. The later I start the rest of my life, the worse it will be for me.\"</p> <p>Pooley does have options for next year, she said. \"I have had some interest which is nice but I want to be in a situation which suits me. I would have to have a reduced race programme in 2013 in the spring, because of not having the winter's training in Australia.\" She will, however, have a second chance of a medal when she lines up on Saturday for the women's road race alongside Nicole Cooke and the London silver-medallist, Lizzie Armitstead; again the finish up the Cauberg will play to her strengths.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, however, Great Britain did take their first rainbow jersey of the week when Elinor Barker went one better than her silver medal of last year in the junior event. It is 11 years since her fellow Welshwoman Cooke took Britain's last gold in the event and it was a dominant victory, 35sec ahead of Denmark's Cecile Uttrup Ludwig.</p> <p>A product of the same British Cycling youth talent conveyor belt that produced the London track star Laura Trott, the 18-year-old recently took two silver medals and a bronze in the world junior track championships. A regular on the Newport velodrome in the winter, she should be a likely candidate to join Trott and company in the team-pursuit squad in the future.</p> <p>The chances are that Arndt's fellow-countryman Tony Martin will make it a German double on Wednesday in the men's time trial. Martin will be favourite to defend his title in the absence of the Olympic champion, Bradley Wiggins, and the multiple world champion Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, while the recent Tour of Spain winner, Alberto Contador, is another likely medallist.</p>",
  "<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won the first round in their battle for privacy on Tuesday when a French magazine was banned from selling or reusing images taken of the couple at a private chateau in Provence.</p> <p>But the war was far from over as French prosecutors must now decide if criminal proceedings are to be brought against the magazine editor and the photographer or photographers responsible for taking pictures of the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France.</p> <p>The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Nanterre, Paris, granted an injunction ordering the gossip magazine Closer to hand over digital files of the pictures within 24 hours and preventing it disseminating them any further, including on its website and tablet app.</p> <p>The four-page ruling, which only affects Mondadori Magazines France, Closer's publisher, also ordered it to pay \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,600) in legal costs. The magazine faces a \u20ac10,000 fine for every day it fails to comply with the order. No damages were sought by the couple.</p> <p>\"These snapshots which showed the intimacy of a couple, partially naked on the terrace of a private home, surrounded by a park several hundred metres from a public road, and being able to legitimately assume that they are protected from passersby, are by nature particularly intrusive,\" it said. The couple were thus subjected to this \"brutal display\" from the moment the magazine's cover appeared.</p> <p>The magistrates ruled that every photograph published in France by Mondadori, the publishing company owned by former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, in future would carry a fine, also of \u20ac10,000 per breach.</p> <p>But the ruling refers only to the 14 pictures that have already been published. Closer's editor has hinted she has other, more intimate pictures.</p> <p>The ruling came as the duke and duchess were welcomed to the South Pacific country of Tuvalu on the final leg of a nine-day tour that has been largely overshadowed by the privacy row. Smiling through the media storm, they put on colourful grass skirts and danced at a fateles, a traditional gathering where local communities compete in singing and dancing.</p> <p>St James's Palace said the couple \"welcome the judge's ruling\". A source said: \"They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy.\" Maud Sobel, a lawyer for the royal couple in Paris, described it as \"a wonderful decision\", adding: \"We've been vindicated.\"</p> <p>Though pleased their civil action has succeeded, the couple have taken the rarer step of seeking to have a much more public criminal prosecution for breach of privacy brought against the magazine and photographer or photographers responsible.</p> <p>The prosecutor will have to decide the targets for any criminal proceedings and the complaint cites \"persons unknown\". But it is understood the couple want proceedings brought against the editor of Closer, which published the photos on Friday, and whoever took the images of the couple sunbathing at the chateau, which belongs to Lord Linley, son of the late Princess Margaret.</p> <p>A preliminary investigation was launched on Tuesday by the Paris police. Under French law breach of privacy carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of \u20ac45,000.</p> <p>This is the legal action that will truly lay down a marker, and by pursuing it the couple indicate a determination to convey a wider message to the world and, they hope, deter paparazzi in the future.</p> <p>Their lawyers had not asked for copies of Closer magazine to be removed from shelves.</p> <p>On Saturday the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/sep/16/irish-daily-star-kate-photos-video\" title=\"\">Irish Daily Star published the photos</a>, leading to the editor being suspended on Monday night pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Also on Monday, the Mondadori-owned Italian celebrity magazine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/17/kate-topless-photos-chi-magazine\" title=\"\">Chi rushed out a special edition</a> with 26 pages devoted to the candid photos of the future queen.</p> <p>The couple's lawyer, Aur\u00e9lien Hamelle, had told the Paris court it was necessary to block the \"highly intimate\" images of the duchess without her bikini top as she was a \"young woman, not an object\".</p> <p>But Delphine Pando, defending Closer, said the action was a \"disproportionate response\" to publication of the photographs. She added that the magazine could not control their resale as it did not own the original images.</p> <p>Copies of Closer magazine were doing brisk business on online auction site eBay, with one selling for \u00a331.01, until the site removed all listings following \"strong feedback\" from its community.</p>",
  "<p>It was an American instructor who took each small group of officers through their practical paces at the police academy, attended by a police officer now serving in Kabul, teaching them everything from first aid to shooting practice.</p> <p>Afghan instructors stuck mostly to classes on the constitution, police paperwork or literacy, which is a big concern for a force where under a quarter of recruits can read and write, but not the only key skill for officers in a country at war.</p> <p>\"For the present generation we need foreigners, for the next generation we can train ourselves,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity because he did not have security clearance to talk about the programme. \"If the foreign soldiers all leave, our fate will be civil war,\" he said.</p> <p>He is just one of tens of thousands of Afghans who have streamed through the gates of Afghanistan's police and army training academies in the last few years, as the country rushed to bulk up its security forces ahead of the departure of foreign troops.</p> <p>But a tiny portion of those graduates have turned their guns on the foreigners who are mentoring them or fighting by their side. They have killed 51 this year alone, and on Tuesday news seeped out of Washington that the Nato-led coalition would suspend joint operations and limit partnering programmes in an attempt to curb the toll.</p> <p>\"Of course naturally among us there were some people who hated the Americans,\" the officer said. \"Sometimes when they got some help they would be happy for a short while, but you could see there was hate in their hearts.\"</p> <p>Intelligence officers were scattered through each intake, and did occasionally root out suspicious characters, he said, but there was no training for others on how to spot infiltrators, or system to report them.\"</p> <p>\"Sometimes I would discuss this with friends, there would be clear signs. We would say to each other 'that man used a fake ID to join up'. But what could we do about it, we were just ordinary policemen.\"</p> <p>As dozens of Afghan police and soldiers have also died at the hands of comrades in arms, worries about Taliban sympathisers is not an abstract problem. Afghan army officers going out on operations are sometimes almost as concerned about threats from the men lined up behind them as they are worried about dangers ahead, a senior officer said earlier this year.</p> <p>But infiltrators are not the only, or indeed the main problem; around three-quarters of the killings are prompted by personal grudges, the Nato-led mission to Afghanistan estimates.</p> <p>A report on the problem which was retrospectively classified by the US military \u2013 entitled A Crisis of Trust and Cultural Incompatibility \u2013 highlighted a range of irritants in the relationship that could fray ties and pave the way for shootings.</p> <p>The issues that annoyed, angered or even repulsed Afghans ranged from the US troops' ignorance about Islam to their tendency to swear and urinate in public. US forces in their turn were disgusted by Afghan cruelty to animals, lack of discipline and hygiene, among other issues.</p> <p>But for many soldiers who don't share those sentiments, or are more positive about the relationship overall, the attacks are depressing.</p> <p>Some generals fear the US decision is already undermining military morale, the BBC reported.</p> <p>\"When I was at my academy and I heard about these attacks, it made me sad for my country. How did these people get through the checks?\" said the Kabul officer.</p> <p><strong>Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</strong></p>",

In 2007 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/11/overbyoverreports.cricket\">West Indies v South Africa</a> was a classic with Chris Gayle's 10 sixes in his 57-ball 117 countered by Herschelle Gibbs and Justin Kemp (what happened to him?). In 2009<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/05/england-holland-world-twenty20-cricket\"> the Dutch defeated England</a> with Stuart Broad's overthrow off the last ball of the match (what Blowers and Johnners used to call a \"buzzer\"). I remember my job that day was to write a sketch of the opening ceremony for the paper but the rain wiped it out and spared us the prospect of Alesha Dixon belting out The Boy Does Nothing to a bemused Robert Key, preferred in England's side to Kevin Pietersen that day. In 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/01/west-indies-thrash-ireland\">it was a comfortable win for the hosts</a> and I'm expecting something similarly one-sided today. Zimbabwe have improved and got Duckworth-Lewised in 2010 but have lost their last 12 T20s and their last four defeats by New Zealand included one by 10 wickets, one by seven wickets and one by five.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>At the cricket writers' lunch yesterday</strong> Joe Root and Nick Compton won awards, the Yorkshireman for young player of the year, Compton the County Championship player of the year.

The consensus seemed to be that James Taylor would be the extra batsman and I can't help feeling today that he's been a little hard done by. No Kevin Pietersen either, who, with Geoffrey Boycott naturally, was the butt of most of the jokes from the podium. Anyone watching KP on ESPN?

Both hang about a bit.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1st over: Sri Lanka 4-0 (Munaweera 4, Dilshan 0)</strong> Dilshan Munaweera (how confusing given his partner) was the leading scorer in the SLPL and takes first strike on debut. He's a Warner-type basher we're told. Kyle Jarvis opens the bowling, a full, slow, wideish bunger to start with, steered through the covers for four with ease and gratitude. The second and third balls move, the first away, the second back in and gives Jarvis back some control. Munaweera can't get a bat on them, nor the fourth which hoops away from him towards first slip. The bowler is using variations of pace well and is rewarded with five dot balls after that loose opener. Munaweera looks like a dasher but with a tendency for flakiness to me given the extravagant play and misses.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 10-0 (Munaweera 4, Dilshan 5)</strong> Brian Vitori starts from the other end, left-arm over, trying to use the angle to keep Dilshan honest outside off stump. But it's such a fine line if he doesn't get it to swing back into the batsman and makes it so hittable, wide and sitting up. Dilshan waits for one of them and smears it through point for four. He takes a single then shouts at the stewards policing the sightscreen to pull their fingers out as they're letting spectators run across it. Munaweera faces two balls, \"four or nowt\" seems to be his philosophy, misses both by a mile. That's one four and seven dots for him.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 19-0 (Munaweera 11, Dilshan 6)</strong> Big shout from Jarvis when he traps Dilshan on the knee with a huge inswinger but it was snaking three feet past leg stump. Jarvis's eyes light up wwhen Munaweera gets the strike but he's too pumped, and is called wide for his bouncer then watches as the batsman connects and straight drives back over his head for four. Nice shot but he doesn't look at all \"in\" as he keeps playing around the line \u2013 and gets a life when he sends a swirling chance with a mistimed pull probably 30ft up that Waller drops on the drive.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 29-0 (Munaweera 12, Dilshan 13)</strong> Vitori gives up his second wide with a fast bouncer, pitching far too short on this pitch and watching the keeper take it outside off above his head. The wind saves a Sri Lanka batsman again when Dilshan sweeps and sends it behind him, a steepling catch 15 yards behind the keeper. Taylor sprints back but the ball is carried on the breeze just out of his grasp. Dilshan finishes the over with the best shot of the innings. He waits for it to rise outside off and he absolutely larrups it square off the front foot for four but loses his brain off the last ball, tempted by the thought of a rapid single he makes it only by dint of a missed shy at the stumps,</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 38-0 (Munaweera 12, Dilshan 19)</strong> Live long and Prosper Utseya bowls the last over of the powerplay. Dilshan sees spin this early and cackles, smashing four with a patient cut. He's getting some turn though and recovers from that unwelcoming start, bamboozling Munaweera, who nonetheless gets runs off his pads while Dilshan utilises the edge.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (Munaweera 17, Dilshan 29)</strong> Another dropped catch and it's Waller again, this time off Mpofu when Mumaweera skies it to deep square leg and Waller misjudges his dive. The debutant has ridden his luck so far but is doing his job to put Dilshanon strike (if not the one he was selected for to give them a Jayasuriya start). Dilshan's timing is exquisite and he hits two crowd-pleasing fours, the first with the scoop, the second with a glorious off-drive. We've lost pictures from Sri Lanka but according to TMS Munaweera plays a decent shot off the last, wayward legside ball, flicking it down to fine leg for four.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Munaweera run out 17</strong> The pictures are restored for the (unnecessary) third-umpire replay as he had dropped his bat and was out by three feet trying to make it home without diving.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 55-1 (Jayawardene 1, Dilshan 30)</strong> Utseya rattles through his over, perhaps giving Munaweera so little time to settle helped to scramble his mind and set off for that run and lose his bat. He did OK for a first match but never looked composed but then who does in their first international T20?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 59-1 (Jayawardene 3, Dilshan 32)</strong> Cremer replaces Mpofu after that poor if unlucky first over that should have bought a wicket but ended up costing 15 runs. Cremer, too, gets the ball to turn sharply and with his line is telling the batsman they have to score behind square on the legside unless they use their feet. Tidy stuff.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 70-1 (Jayawardene 8, Dilshan 38)</strong> While the spinners have managed to smother the batsman's big attacking shots for a couple of overs, they can't stop the inventiveness of these two and Mahela, having been pinned down, reverse sweeps expertly and deftly for four. Dilshan uses the orthodox sweep to take two. This is an enormous field and they have understood that giving the fielders the runaround saps the spirit as much as power hitting.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Jayawardene lbw Cremer 10</strong> Wait they're going to check for a no ball.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>Scratch that, <strong>NOT OUT.</strong> It was a no-ball on the back foot law. Cremer's back foot, given his angle coming in almost square, clipped the outside of the crease so Mahela gets a life and free ball.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Dilshan c Taylor b Cremer 39</strong> He finally gets his reward for an excellent over when Dilshan steps back and feathers it through to the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 76-2 (Jayawardene 11, Sangakkara 1)</strong> An excellent ball spins, leaps and catches Mahela plum on the back foot but he is reprieved but doesn't add insult to injury with the free hit, slashing at it and only connecting with a quarter of the ball. Cremer fights back from his disappointment, with that turn and anglewhich has caused both batsmen problems.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 80-2 (Jayawardene 12, Sangakkara 4)</strong> Utseya's going to bowl through while AW Greig does his Sri Lanka tourist board pitch, so familiar to those of us who watched England's tour at the end of this winter. The batsmen milk four runs, finding it hard to get under the ball to hit over the top. Prosper ends with four overs for 25 runs. Not too bad at all.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Run out review</strong> OUT</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Jayawardene run out 13</strong> He was stranded by about four feet after Sangakkara had played a beauty of a cut shot to deep cover. The throw was hard and flat and the bowler positioned himself in front of the stumps then flung it backwards to knock off the bails as Mahela struggled to make two.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 86-3 (J Mendis 1, Sangakkara 8)</strong> Fine over of containment and the lack of boundaries \u2013 one in five overs \u2013 builds enough pressure for Sanga to push Mahela into a run his body couldn't pull off.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 96-3 (J Mendis 7, Sangakkara 12)</strong> Mpofu who took a bit of tap in his first over is back and Taylor must be cursing the lack of a third spinner. The batsmen switch the strike by manipulating the ball around the ring before Sanga almost breaks the shackles off Mpofu's slower ball but Ervine's devalues turns four into three. From the sublime to the shambolic and Ian Gould laughs when Mendis hits his first four, a straight drive that almost decapitated the umpire and went through the legs of two fielders, Vitori who deflected it and the man sweeping behind him.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 107-3 (J Mendis 16, Sangakkara 14)</strong> Cremer will bowl out at this end and can't maintain the control he'd established, Mendis finishing the over with two cracking fours. What fast hands, he has, whipping his drives with terrific power.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 120-3 (J Mendis 27, Sangakkara 15)</strong> Time for a part-timer \u2013 Elton Chigumbura comes on after Mpofu takes his punishment. And so does Elton, Mendis belting him high for six, the first of the match. After trying a deranged reverse hook rather than sweep that doesn't come off, Elton serves him up a pie of Melton Mowbray sumptuousness, a wide half-tracker outside leg, which Mendis pivots and belts for four past fine leg.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 129-3 (J Mendis 31, Sangakkara 20)</strong> Mpofu switches ends to start his third spell and does far better with the first three balls, changing his pace and almost tricking Sangakkara into stopping his lofted drive and giving a chance but the balloon drive he ends up with falls short of long on. They're looking to up the tempo, now, but although they swing hard, it takes them until the final ball for Sangakkara to get his boundary, uppercutting an off-stump bumper for for four.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 139-3 (J Mendis 35, Sangakkara 22)</strong> Jarvis returns and Sri Lanka opt for a hit and run approach. I would say tip and run but they're not nurdling. They're going for the big shots and taking singles when they mistime it or fail to pierce the sweepers at cover and midwicket. Jeevan Mendis comes down the pitch, Jarvis sees him coming so bowls it quicker and fuller. Batsman and keeper cannot adjust and the Zimbabwean is unjustly punished with four byes for such quick thinking.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 150-3 (J Mendis 37, Sangakkara 30)</strong> Vitori pitches up to Sangakkara who plays a shot that looks like a golf drive from between his feet to mid-on, takes one and runs up the middle of the pitch when sent back after he asked for a second. Hmmm. This has been perfectly acceptable bowling from Zimbabwe, so far, decent skill, variation and control in general let down by poor catching and the too-frequent no balls. And having to face hardened, supremely talented world-class batsmen.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>19th over: Sri Lanka 167-3 (J Mendis 42, Sangakkara 36)</strong> Jarvis finishes his stint and begins by wasting a run-out chance and compounding his error with a recklessly wild over-arm diving shy from three yards when a pea-roller was required to give away four buzzers. Next ball Sangakkara latches on to the ball pitched up outside off and pummels his square drive away for four, racing past cover. Dreadful, shoddy fielding leaks more runs with another stupid, madly ambitious throw. Ervine is the only one showing any consistency with his groundfielding.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Kumar Sangakkara run out 43</strong> Sanga goes Sydney Carton, chucking away his wicket for a greater cause. Well, his team's.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 182-4 (J Mendis 43, Perera 36)</strong> Mpofu is going to bowl out, not Vitori. Strange. He comes round the wicket and gives up a pair of singles with an outside-off line before Sangakkara sweeps him beautifully around the corner for six behind square. he's out next ball pushing for two. In comes Perera and smacks his first ball over square leg for six. Mpofu follows him with the last ball of the match as the batsman tries to give himself some room to slog. The bowler finds the blockhole and ends with a dot ball.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Innings break</strong> Zimbabwe need 183 to win. Back in 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>1st over Zimbabwe 3-0 chasing 183 (Masakadza 0, Sibanda 1)</strong> Kulasekara takes the new ball and almost traps Vusi Sibanda leg-before with his third ball with his old failing, playing around his front pad. It was missing leg-stump by a ball's width. Hamilton Masikadza, too, knows he can't hang around and play himself in so has a couple of swishes, trying to go large.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2nd over Zimbabwe 8-0 chasing 183 (Masakadza 0, Sibanda 2)</strong> The slinger shares the new ball and straight up hits 85mph with a wobbling pitched-up effort on middle stump that Sibanda blocks and tries to sneak a run from. But sharp fielding and a throw at the stumps saves a run. Masakadza picks up four leg-byes off his hip from a wilder one from Malinga but is struggling to get his bat on to the ball.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3rd over Zimbabwe 16-0 chasing 183 (Masakadza 6, Sibanda 3)</strong> Both opening bowlers are hooping it around, Kulasekara matching Malinga for rapid in-duckers. The Zimbabwe openers know they have to play some big shots during the powerplay but it's so difficult with the pressure of the daunting target, the movement through the air and the pace of the two bowlers. Having said that Masakadza, though not timing it properly, looks reasonably solid and he brute forces away a four off the splice straight then looks less secure when dashing for a quick single into the offside. He would have been gone had the throw hit the stumps at the non-striker's end.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4th over Zimbabwe 28-0 chasing 183 (Masakadza 17, Sibanda 4)</strong> Stand and deliver. Ace shot from Masakadza who uses his enormously strong forearms to smack Malinga between wide mid on and midwicket for a lovely four. Malinga decides to bounce Sibanda after his partner tips and runs a single and Sibanda ducks, then flashes the broadest smile at the bowler. After Sibanda takes a single Masakadza stretches the field, turning one into two and finishes the over, Dick Turpin-style, by rocking back and creaming an off-drive with raw power uppishly for four.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5th over Zimbabwe 36-0 chasing 183 (Masakadza 17, Sibanda 11)</strong> At last Sibanda finds the boundary during the PP when Kulasekara's inswing deserts him and the batsman frees his arms to launch a drive over point for four. This start, ordinarily, would be creditable. Sadly their fielding was so bad that creditable will not be good enough.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Sibanda b A Mendis 11</strong> The mystery spinner may not nave quite the bag of tricks he was once reputed to have but his top-spinning doosra is something to behold, puzzling Sibanda and destroying his stumps.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Taylor st Sangakkara b A Mendis 0</strong> Golden duck. Another one that turned away and the new batsman misread it, toppled forward and had his bails removed with his back foot an inch or so off the ground ass his momentum dragged him forward.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6th over Zimbabwe 36-2 chasing 183 (Masakadza 18, Chigumbura 2)</strong> Ajantha Mendis takes the first post PP over and neither Sibanda nor his captain manage to read his turn. Chigumbura plays the poor hat-trick ball, which is far too short and straight, comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>7th over Zimbabwe 43-2 chasing 183 (Masakadza 20, Chigumbura 3)</strong> Angelo Mathews is going to have a bowl, one of the largely batting all-rounders who are key to Sri Lanka's selection policy. After a couple short of a length that Masakadza can't get away he makes a mistake when he sees the opener advancing and drops it too short and giving away a wide. Masakadza punches and steers this over, unable to free his arms.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Masakadza b A Mendis 20</strong> Ajantha's impact has been immense. Hamilton Masakadza, knowing he had to up the pace, went for the lofted drive and dragged it on to his stumps.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>7th over Zimbabwe 43-3 chasing 183 (Ervine 0, Chigumbura 3)</strong> Mendis takes a wicket with his googly then should have had another when he caught Ervine on the pad sweeping but his follow through had blocked the view of the umpire who, consequently, couldn't give it. He's playing boggle with the batsmen.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>8th over Zimbabwe 48-3 chasing 183 (Ervine 3, Chigumbura 3)</strong> Mathews is bowling well, too, not posing the mental and technical tests Ajantha does but keeping the batsmen on the straight and narrow with his line and length, not allowing them to generate any power with the ball so close to their bodies.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>10th over Zimbabwe 57-3 chasing 183 (Ervine 10, Chigumbura 6)</strong> Thisara Perera takes the ball for his Collingwoodesque mixture of deceptively quicker ones and annoyingly difficult to whack trundlers. This is a very good pitch for the bowlers with bounce and pace. An email. Hurrah. \"Watched Kevin's debut as an analyst on Star Cricket here in India,\" writes Vivek Radhakrishnan. \"It started off with Ganguly saying that without KP England will suffer a whitewash for the test series and that India cricket team must be delighted that England are playing t20 world cup without their best player, Kevin was giving a sheepish grin and awkward looks. He did a good job analysing Sri Lanka v Zimbabwe. Apart from that awkward moment everything went well.\" Sourav mischief-making? Say it ain't so. Ervine ends the over by cross-batting a huge six over wide mid-on for six, the only time he was given room to give it some welly.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Ervine st Sangakkara b J Mendis 10</strong> Ervine leant too far to reach the ball outside off without making the adjustment with his feet and when he had a swing and miss he couldn't get his back foot down quick enough and Sangakkara bagged his second stumping of the innings.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Waller lbw J Mendis 0</strong> The first ball he faced was a googly he didn't read and his literacy hadn't improved for the second wrong one, getting his feet into a mess and playing around it. <em>Malcolm.</em></p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>11th over Zimbabwe 59-5 chasing 183 (Cremer 0, Chigumbura 6)</strong> Mendis power. J and A causing equal puzzlement, consternation and mayhem.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>12th over Zimbabwe 66-5 chasing 183 (Cremer 5, Chigumbura 8)</strong> Cremer gets away with a thick edge for four as the required rate climbs above 15 an over. Interesting bowler Perera, like a Luke Wright with more bite.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>13th over Zimbabwe 75-5 chasing 183 (Cremer 6, Chigumbura 15)</strong> Oooh. Elton Chigumbura's going to go down swinging and plays a dexterous sweep straight over square leg for six. Jeevan doesn't like it so starts throwing in his variations to stem the assault. Googly, top-spinner, non-spinner, leggie does the trick.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Chigumbura b A Mendis 19</strong> Top spinner, Chigumbura played for the spin I think and it raced through to clip off-stump. He now has four for eight.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>14th over Zimbabwe 80-6 chasing 183 (Cremer 6, Utseya 0)</strong> Chigumbura played another good sweep, to take four to fine leg, but then didn't pick Ajantha Mendis's last ball and off he goes. Impressive how Ajantha sets up batsmen and doesn't get frustrated when he gets hit. At times it is part of the plan.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>15th over Zimbabwe 87-6 chasing 183 (Cremer 11, Utseya 1)</strong> It's an all-Mendis attack, but Jeevan's length has gone to cock. And then his line goes a bit. He doesn't care.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Utseya c Jayawardene b Ajantha Mendis 1</strong> That's his five-for, dipping in and holding its line when the Zimbabwe spinner decided he had to get after it and thick-edged it to slip.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Jarvbis lbw A Mendis 0</strong> Doesn't read the googly and is caught on the back leg off the second ball he has faced.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>16th over Zimbabwe 87-8 chasing 183 (Cremer 11, Vetori 0)</strong> Double-wicket maiden and the best bowling figures in this tournament's history for the marvellous Ajantha, six for eight.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Cremer b J Mendis 17</strong> The ninth batsman who can't read the spin and pays the price, playing all around it and seeing his stumps torpedoed.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>17th over Zimbabwe 93-9 chasing 183 (Mpofu 0, Vetori 0)</strong> Cremer was the pick of the Zimbo bowlers and is doing OK with the bat even if he's having the odd blind swipe at both the Mendis boys. Just as I typed that he played all around a tossed up leg-break and is clean bowled. They need a Merlin these lads but lack the resources.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Mpofu c sub (Chandimal) b Malinga 0</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Sri Lanka win by 82 runs</strong> When Malinga resumed Vetori middled the second ball of the 18th over and they ran three. The throw flewin and missed the stumps, going for four so Vetori went from 0 to seven off one ball. Next ball Mpofu was out to end a comprehensive defeat. They fielded poorly and were utterly flummoxed by both Mendises. Sri Lanka enjoyed their fortune with the bat and should have lost wickets to dropped catches but they were very impressive with the ball. Thanks for your, er, email. Good night.</p>",
  "<p>When the police have been in the headlines in recent weeks it has too often been for reasons that have done them little credit. The deaths of two women officers in Manchester today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/woman-police-officer-killed-manchester\" title=\"\">Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes</a>, fatally shot in the course of attending a \"routine incident\", is a reminder that for every foul-tempered officer whacking a passer-by at a demonstration or taking a backhander off a reporter, there are countless others who accept the risk of a violent assault \u2013 or worse \u2013 as part of an increasingly stressful profession.</p> <p>In 1966, the shooting dead of three police officers in Shepherd's Bush, west London, seemed like something from another world. We were used to reading of the murders of the police in the United States, for instance, or other countries where officers were routinely armed and gunfights between the lawmen and the lawless were seen as unremarkable. The fact that we still know the name of Harry Roberts, one of the guilty Shepherd's Bush gunmen, who remains in jail to this day, is an indication of how rare and shocking such an event was. No more.</p> <p>Seven years ago in Bradford, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/21/ukguns.immigrationpolicy1\" title=\"\">PC Sharon Beshenivsky</a> was killed by gunmen as she arrived at the scene of a robbery. She was already the seventh female officer to have lost her life in the line of duty. In 1997, the also unarmed Nina Mackay had been stabbed to death by a paranoid schizophrenic after being called to arrest someone in breach of their bail conditions. And events over the past year or so in Libya have reminded us that the killers of WPC Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside the Libyan embassy in 1984, have still to be brought to justice; that \"W\" prefix disappeared in 1999, long after women officers had taken on the same roles and risks as their male counterparts.</p> <p>The names of other officers may be familiar to us because of some aspect of the story. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/police-officers-killed-timeline?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">PC Keith Blakelock</a>, who died during the Tottenham riots in 1985, is still remembered not least because of the failure to find his actual killers. The off-duty officer PC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/11/clacton-shooting-police-ian-dibell\" title=\"\">Ian Dibell</a> who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/10/clacton-shooting-police-hunt-suspect\" title=\"\">shot dead in Essex in July</a> is still fresh in the mind. But most of the scores of others who have died slip into anonymity outside of their family, friends and the police service.</p> <p>We still live in a country where the death of a police officer is a major event, not something taken as inevitable. We may be accustomed now to armed officers at airports or outside embassies but we are still not used to them exchanging fire or being fired upon. It is right that when police officers are gratuitously violent or corrupt or tell lies that they are brought to account. We now know all too well that in every powerful institution in Britain \u2013 politics,</p> <p>banking, law enforcement, journalism \u2013 there are dishonest and greedy people who see themselves as above the law. But it is also right to remember that every day there are hundreds of police officers who answer a 999 call and head off to some \"routine incident\" at a godforsaken spot, unaware of whether what awaits will be a stranger with a knife, a drunken wifebeater or, as the two Manchester officers discovered to their cost, someone who thinks he can shoot himself out of trouble.</p> <p>There are often calls for a return of the death penalty when a police officer is killed and for officers to be routinely armed. They should be resisted. The two young women officers who died in Manchester represented the police service as it can be and at its bravest, and it would be a poor memorial to their courage to use their deaths for narrow political ends.</p>",
  "<p>Many people in higher education think of distance learning the same way one would a distant cousin: aware of its existence, perhaps even thinks well of them, but reluctant to pick up the phone and find out how they are doing. And like the cousin you don't know well, the justification for your lack of interest is that distance learning is just a little bit awkward.</p> <p>Distance learning is reputedly characterised by clunky online interfaces, isolation and generally conspiring to make students \u2013 and staff \u2013 miss out on so many of the things that make university life so attractive: daily interaction with people who think like we do. We imagine it to be just a depleted version of the 'real thing'.</p> <p>But in the same way that reconnecting with a distant relative can teach you things about yourself that daily interaction with your closest friends can't, distance learning has things to offer that are difficult to find in a traditional university course. An good example of this is its capacity to instantly connect to people from all over the world. At the <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>, we run a range of specialist <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/gse-postgraduate-study\" title=\"\">renewable energy and sustainable architecture masters degrees</a>. Our distance learning course has enabled us to create a course that gives sustainability a global perspective.</p> <p>A distance learning course puts students into a classroom that spans the whole world. It means the range of perspectives that are brought into that classroom are more diverse than any other method of learning. For a course based on sustainability this is crucial. Sustainability shouldn't be taught as an abstract theory amongst a group of people that all basically come from the same background, it should be taught as a discourse amongst people with diverse experiences of its practical application. Many other fields would benefit from similar thinking.</p> <p>Of course, all university courses will have some international dimension to their intake. But the barriers of increasingly restrictive visa regulations and high cost mean that, in reality, physically attending a course in the UK is becoming increasingly difficult for many overseas students. Academic discourse will suffer if we can't find alternative models, such as distance learning, for bringing students together.</p> <p>Without a doubt there are features of attending university that distance learning courses will never be able to emulate. I've spoken to students on residential degrees at the Centre for Alternative Technology who say they learn as much from chatting to lecturers or other students in the tea breaks as they do from the lectures. Earl Wilson's quip: \"Science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break\", rings true. Still, there are also unique benefits to joining the online classroom that can never be found in a traditional university course.</p> <p>If the benefits of higher education rest on the personal connections that students aspire to make, then we must ask what experiences are of value \u2013 if students just want to meet other people their own age to go out drinking with on a Friday night then sure, that is not what a distance learning course offers. If, however, students are looking to be part of seminars with people with a genuine plethora of life experiences, this is the extra element that a distance learning course can offer.</p> <p>Distance learning doesn't create distances between people, it bridges the distances that already exist and connects diverse people. And the tools are improving to help universities do this better. So rather than simply acknowledge that distance learning exists in a universe far removed from the traditional university campus, it might be time to get to know this 'distant cousin' and learn what it has to add to the strength, and diversity, of UK HE.</p> <p><em>Kit Jones is media officer at the </em><a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Alternative Technology</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Here's an illustrative tale of how science is used and abused in government policy making. In some circumstances, as with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/16/badger-cull-government-go-ahead?intcmp=239\">imminent badger cull</a>, you can take scientific evidence and extrapolate it to breaking point in order to justify the decision you have already taken.</p> <p>Today, on the issue of bees and pesticides, we see the opposite. Despite serious evidence of great harm being caused to bees by sub-lethal doses of neonicitinoid pesticides - published in the world's most prestigious journals - the government has decided that no changes to regulation whatsoever are required, because the case has not been proven beyond all doubt.</p> <p>So extrapolation is fine if you like where it takes you, but abhorrent if you don't. Evidence-based policy making remains as dreamy a concept as ever, it seems, even with something as critical as keeping the nation's pollinators in good health and our food supply secure.</p> <p>The bee fiasco began in March with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline\">publication of two studies in Science</a>. The first found that bees consuming one pesticide suffered an 85% loss in the number of queens their nests produced, while the second showed a doubling in \"disappeared\" bees, those that failed to return from food foraging trips. The work was the first to be carried out in realistic, open-air conditions and used levels of neonicotinoids found in fields.</p> <p>Professor Micka\u00ebl Henry, at INRA in Avignon, France, who led the \"disappeared\" bees study was under no illusion about the implications of his findings: \"Under the effects we saw from the pesticides, the population size would decline disastrously, and make them even more sensitive to parasites or a lack of food.\" He said current regulation was inadequate.</p> <p>These high profile studies - <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/04/120405224653.htm\">and others</a> - prompted the UK's environment ministry (Defra) to investigate. \"It is appropriate to update the process for assessing the risks of pesticides to bees in the light of scientific developments \u2013 including the latest research,\" it stated. </p> <p>Now, six months on, it has <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/quality/chemicals/pesticides/insecticides-bees/\">delivered its verdict</a>: \"The recent studies do not justify changing existing regulation.\" How can this be? Defra states:</p> <blockquote> <p>The studies were interesting but they either used neonicotinoids at a higher level than is currently permitted, or the studies weren't carried out under field conditions. The studies did not show that currently permitted uses of neonicotinoids have serious implications for the health of bee populations.</p> </blockquote> <p>The authors of the studies dispute the suggestion that both the doses and conditions were not realistic. It seems to me that Defra are refusing to be convinced by any scientific study, because the very act of studying it means it is not \"field conditions\". Do you see the paradox?</p> <p>Be careful to also note Defra's use of the word \"permitted\", which echoes the get-out used by pesticide manufacturers, but ignores the fact that farmers have and will exceed allowed doses, either by accident or design.</p> <p>Another question: why have <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/intheworks/ccd-european-ban.html\">France and Italy</a> been persuaded that the evidence is sufficient to impose a suspension in the use of some of these pesticides, but not the UK?</p> <p>Lastly, Defra states:</p> <blockquote> <p>Regulation needs to be based on all the science. Existing field studies on neonicotinoids found there weren't any significant differences between hives exposed to treated crops and hives exposed to untreated crops.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Prof David Goulson, at the University of Stirling and leader of the other study in Science, told me previously: \"If they have done these studies, where are they? They are not in the public domain and therefore cannot be scrutinised. That raises the question of just how good they are.\"</p> <p>There is one glimmer of hope in the Defra document, which was very quietly slipped out: </p> <blockquote> <p>The government has already put new research in place to explore further the impacts of neonicotinoids on bumble bees in field conditions and to understand what levels of pesticide residues and disease in honey bees are normal. This work is due to finish in spring 2013.</p> </blockquote> <p>Defra also states: \"We are prepared to take whatever action the evidence shows to be necessary.\" It seems clear to me that sufficient evidence already exists to require action, but we can only hope the new work ends Defra's stalling.</p> <p>Paul de Zylva, Friends of the Earth nature campaigner, sums it up well: \"The government's failure to act on neonicotinoid pesticides is astonishing \u2013 there is still a massive question mark over the impact of these chemicals in declining bee populations. Pesticide company profits must not be put ahead of bees well-being.\"</p> <p><strong>Update 1015, 19 September:</strong> Prof Goulson has sent me this response, which speaks for itself:</p> <blockquote> <p>Few experiments are perfect. In this situation, the perfect experiment would be to find and follow the fates of hundreds of natural bumblebee nests in landscapes with crops treated with neonicotinoids, and hundreds of control nests in an identical landscape without neonicotinoids. The latter does not exist, since these compounds are extremely widely used. That is why we dosed our bees in the lab, before putting them in the field. </p> <p>I still think that ours is the closest anyone has come to doing a well replicated, controlled experiment to look at the effects of neonicotinoids on bumblebee nests in something approaching a natural setting. If our results are anywhere close to the truth, then they are pretty alarming. </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The German defence ministry is <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120728-44029.html\" title=\"\">to make a decision</a> in the coming weeks on whether to follow the western military trend and order combat drones armed with air-to-ground missiles, but the issue has come up against persistent ambivalence, 70 years on from the second world war, about the ethics of going into battle.</p> <p>Writing in Der Spiegel, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/essay-on-german-plans-to-acquire-combat-drones-a-848851.html\" title=\"\">essayist Dirk Kurbjuweit</a>, warned that \"humane\" drones could actually be \"the most brutal weapons of all\" and drew on a still raw memory from Germany's recent military past: a 2009 air strike ordered by a German colonel in Afghanistan that led to the death of 100 Afghans, many of them civilians.</p> <p>Unwilling to risk German lives, the colonel, Georg Klein, relied on aerial images to call on US warplanes to open fire on two petrol tankers stolen by the Taliban. Kurbjuweit wrote: \"If a patrol had been sent, the soldiers would have seen that the trucks were stuck in the mud and no longer posed a threat, and they would also have seen that the people surrounding the trucks were harmless villagers and not combatants. But that would have meant risking German lives, which Colonel Klein didn't want to do.\"</p> <p>The killing of scores of civilians, including many children, marked one of the worst death tolls from a single incident in Afghanistan for many years. It had a particularly deep impact on German public opinion, in which the sense of guilt over the Nazi era is still a powerful psychological factor. The defence minister then, Franz Josef Jung, had to resign.</p> <p>Klein himself, however, was not charged and last month was promoted to the rank of general. The armed forces, the Bundeswehr, shrugged off the hail of criticism.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/conscription-germany-army?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Bundeswehr, which is undergoing a period of transformation, finally changed from being a conscript force to a professional one last summer</a>, and is expected to shrink from 240,000 to 185,000 personnel. And last month the federal constitutional court ruled that in case of an attack of \"catastrophic proportions\", such as a terrorist assault in a city, the nation's soldiers could be deployed with their weapons on German soil in peace time.</p> <p>No western society wants to see troops on the street, but such a domestic role had hitherto represented a particular taboo in Germany because of the country's burden of history. Emerging from the ruins of the war, the post-Nazi German state bound its army tightly in constitutional red tape in the hope it would never again represent a threat to its own people and the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Over the past two decades there has been a cautious removal of those bonds, one taboo at a time. When war broke out in the Balkans, many Germans argued that the country had a special duty to stop genocide. When Nato finally intervened in 1995, German soldiers were deployed abroad for the first time since the second world war, establishing a military hospital in the Croatian port of Split.</p> <p>Germany went a step further in Kosovo, where German soldiers fired their first shots in anger, although the mission was peacekeeping again, with an only slightly higher level of danger than Bosnia.</p> <p>When Germany agreed to contribute troops to Afghanistan three years later, in solidarity with the United States after the 9/11 attacks, the deployment was thought to be only slightly more perilous. In the more peaceful north, Germans were told their soldiers would spend their time helping with development projects. To limit casualties, the deployment was ring-fenced by \"caveats\" limiting what the soldiers were allowed to do, reportedly provoking a British officer to describe the Bundeswehr as \"an aggressive camping organisation\".</p> <p>However, the drastic deterioration in the security situation in the northern provinces where the Germans are garrisoned has forced the caveats to be steadily suspended. In February 2010 the foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, freed the Bundeswehr further, formally reclassified the Afghan war as \"an armed conflict under international law\" to allow German soldiers in Afghanistan to act without fear of prosecution on their return home.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan turned out a lot less safe than they thought it was going to be, but the Germans toughed it out, changed their rules of engagement, and fired back,\" said Tomas Valasek, the director of foreign policy and defence at the Centre for European Reform.</p> <p>\"Germany has gone from a special case to a normal military. It used to be an outlier. Now it is still one of the more reluctant countries in Europe to deploy force, but it's no longer off the charts.\"</p> <p>That residual reluctance made itself apparent when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Westerwelle decided to opt out of the Nato intervention in Libya, fearing that a German role in another foreign venture with an uncertain outcome would go down badly with the electorate on the eve of regional elections.</p> <p>\"This was a calculation by individuals in the political class in view of the coming election,\" Christian M\u00f6lling, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said. \"I don't think it represented in any way a strategic judgement. Basically thinking about the strategic impact of these moves has not been widespread in Germany.\"</p> <p>Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, argued that in retrospect, German abstention from the UN resolution authorising intervention, and its decision not to take part in operations, was a mistake.</p> <p>\"While its closest partners and allies embrace and nurse their commitment to the doctrine of responsibility to protect, Germany still likes to think of itself in terms of that bigger version of Switzerland. But this simply does not work for Europe as a whole,\" Gu\u00e9rot wrote.</p> <p>In a German Marshall Fund Ttransatlantic trends poll, more than half of the Germans asked thought that the Libya intervention was justified. Some German military analysts argue such limited operations providing air cover for a limited time in support of a friendly force on the ground provides a far better model for western interventions than the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a security expert at the German Marshall Fund, said: \"There is a general dissatisfaction with stabilisation operations, and an approval of quick-in and quick-out, involving air cover and special forces.\"</p> <p>By transforming itself into a lighter, more agile expeditionary force that could take part in such operations, the Bundeswehr is now converging organisationally with its European and American partners. Psychologically, however, it may be still be some time before Germans lose their legacy of unease with their armed forces altogether.</p>",
  "<p>Barbara Kimenye, who has died aged 82, was one of East Africa's most popular and bestselling children's authors. Her books sold more than a million copies, not just in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, but throughout English-speaking Africa. Many of her more than 50 titles are still available.</p> <p>Best remembered is her <a href=\"http://www.oxford.co.ke/index.php/head-start-secondary-english/lit/storybooks\" title=\"Moses books on the OUP East Africa website\">Moses series</a>, about a mischievous student at a boarding school for troublesome boys. Though not always well-behaved, Moses was never malicious, possessing all the good, bad, questioning and imaginative qualities of a teenager.</p> <p>His classmates at Mukibi's Educational Institute for the Sons of African Gentlemen included his closest friend, the big-for-his-age King Kong, a dedicated fan of the singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/11/miriam-makeba-obituary\" title=\"Miriam Makeba obituary\">Miriam Makeba</a>, to whom \"he believed he was virtually engaged\" since a secretary sent him a signed photo. Rukia, with his love of law and order, could never keep out of anyone else's business, while Matagubya had a source of banana beer.</p> <p>Perhaps the most colourful of the characters in Dorm Three was Itchy Fingers, \"always very good about giving back people's belongings \u2013 even if, as occasionally happened, he absentmindedly picked them up again later in the day\". To the whole crew, Barbara brought her highly readable, but never patronising, style, and storylines that gripped but never disconcerted her readers.</p> <p>Barbara Clarke Holdsworth was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, the daughter of a Jewish-born Catholic convert mother and a West Indian doctor father. She attended Keighley girls' grammar school before moving to London to train as a nurse. There she met many students from East Africa, and married Bill Kimenye, son of a chief from Bukoba in what was then Tanganyika. They moved to his home town on Lake Victoria in the mid-1950s.</p> <p>After the marriage broke up, she moved with a toddler and another baby on the way across the lake to Uganda, where she had friends. In Kampala, the capital, she was reacquainted with many friends who had been some of the first Ugandan students in Britain. By now they were becoming the first leaders and professionals of what would soon be independent Uganda.</p> <p>The then <em>kubaka</em> (king) of Buganda, Edward Muteesa II, invited her to work as a private secretary in his government. She lived near to the palace compound, and her two sons, Christopher (Topha) and David (Daudi) became close to his family and other members of the royal household.</p> <p>Barbara always had a gift with words (she wrote her own newspaper as a child of 11) and became a journalist on the Uganda Nation newspaper, possibly the first black woman in East Africa to perform such a role. She also developed a talent for storytelling, writing down the tales she told to children.</p> <p>Moving to Nairobi, Kenya, in 1965 to work on the <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Daily Nation</a>, and later the East African Standard, Barbara was wooed by publishers who, post-independence, sought talented authors who wrote for and about African children. However, her first book, Kalasanda, for OUP, was a tale of Ugandan village life, followed by Kalasanda Revisited. It was after this that she turned her hand to stories for children and schools.</p> <p>Barbara lived in Nairobi until 1975 when, with both sons in England, she moved to London. There she worked for Brent council as a race relations adviser, while continuing to write. She assiduously followed political developments in a disrupted Uganda and played an active role supporting exile groups opposed to the rule of Idi Amin, and later the second <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/12/guardianobituaries.hearafrica05\" title=\"\">Milton Obote</a> regime.</p> <p>In 1986, with the overthrow of Obote, she returned to Uganda to help rebuild the country. She was to spend a further three years in Kampala before deciding to relocate to Kenya where she spent the next 10 years in semi-retirement \u2013 though still writing at least one book a year.</p> <p>In 1998 Barbara finally settled back in London where she lived happily and was much involved in community affairs in Camden.</p> <p>Shortly before her death she received the news that the Moses series was about to be relaunched by OUP and also to be translated into Kiswahili.</p> <p>Christopher died in 2005. She is survived by David, and a granddaughter, Celeste.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Clarke Kimenye, author, born 19 December 1929; died 12 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>In 1957, two years after Exeter University gained its royal charter, Daniel O'Connor, who has died aged 98, set about expanding its <a href=\"http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/sociology/\" title=\"Exeter sociology and philosophy department\">philosophy department</a>. Known to colleagues \u2013 of which I was one from 1971 \u2013 and students as Dan, he was a gifted communicator. His clear, precise thinking is evident in 10 books and numerous papers.</p> <p>A student and then close friend of <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayer/\" title=\"Stanford Encyclopedia: AJ Ayer\">AJ Ayer</a> and <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/\" title=\"Stanford Encyclopedia: Karl Popper\">Karl Popper</a>, Dan shared, but was not limited by, their commitment to logical empiricism, taking logic, mathematics and the physical sciences as a primary focus for reflection, and as a foundation for the clarification of long-disputed philosophical problems.</p> <p>One of his earliest papers, Is There a Problem About Free Will? (1940), pointed to his abiding interest in the conflict between our beliefs in our freedom of choice and in the causal predictability of all events in the physical world. His book Free Will (1971) displays a non-partisan approach: an empiricist might have simply adopted the determinist's generalisation that \"Every event has a cause\" to close the case against free choice, but instead Dan argues that although the generalisation may be true, it has clearly not been proved to be so by the past achievements of the empirical sciences. Therefore it cannot be treated as a scientific law. Scientific laws are confirmed and falsifiable hypotheses that have not yet been falsified, he insists, while the determinist's generalisation is neither.</p> <p>The Correspondence Theory of Truth (1975) explored the difficulties in spelling out the relation between statements of empirical fact and the world which makes them true. The intent of correspondence theorists is to treat concepts as the work of the perceiving and thinking mind, which gives us our articulated experience of objects, their properties and their interrelations: the world itself is therefore lacking this conceptual articulation.</p> <p>Dan dismisses previous attempts at depicting this world as a collection of \"facts\" or \"states of affairs\", for these are already conceptually structured, and instead proposes a two-stage model of the relations between world, perception and statements. For this he introduces his own term, the <em>status rerum</em>, for the \"raw unexperienced welter of objects and events\". At the first stage, our sense organs provide a limited conceptual awareness of things and their properties, situations and events, and at the second stage the final selection process of language results in statements that are candidates for truth. The idea of the <em>status rerum</em> has proved controversial, for a welter of objects and events hardly constitutes an unstructured and hence unconceptualised place. Welcoming the controversy, Dan continued to defend his idea to the end.</p> <p>An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education (1957) sparked another debate. Can theories decide such questions as whether to abolish the grammar-school system, extend formal education beyond the age of 16, or expand the university intake? Dan takes it that a \"theory\" must be both explanatory and predictive, and so open to the possibility of being falsified. Any educational theory can draw only on such sciences as psychology and sociology. What itcannot do, according to Dan, is lead to any prescriptions for modifications of educational practices \u2013 as David Hume long ago insisted, you cannot derive an \"ought\" from an \"is\".</p> <p>This attempt to keep educational theories free of value judgments was strongly challenged by others such as RS Peters, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/20/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"Paul Hirst obituary\">Paul Hirst</a> and Alan Montefiore, who sought to reintegrate values within educational theories and hence ensure their power to guide practice. Dan's approach provided generations of students of education with a clear intellectual starting point, even if few agreed with him.</p> <p>Dan's interest in the history of philosophy extended well beyond the empiricist tradition. He wrote influential works on John Locke (1952) and on Aquinas and Natural Law (1967), and compiled A Critical History of Western Philosophy (1964). He could also see much to value in the traditions of the East.</p> <p>Born in Seattle, Washington state. Dan was the son of an Irish diplomat father, also Daniel, and Frances Call, from Northern Ireland. Under the stagename spelling of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jan/26/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Joseph O'Conor</a>, Dan's brother was an acclaimed Shakespearean actor \u2013 and Old Jolyon in the BBC's 1966 Forsyte Saga. He also had a sister, Maureen.</p> <p>Following a Jesuit education at Wimbledon College, south-west London, in 1933 Dan went to work at the Ministry of Education. As a part-time student at Birkbeck College, London, he gained a BA and a PhD in classics, and then a BA in philosophy. He was a Commonwealth Fund fellow at the University of Chicago, where he gained an MA in philosophy under Rudolf Carnap, another logical empiricist, in 1947.</p> <p>Early posts in South Africa and at the University College of North Staffordshire led to chairs at Liverpool University (1954-57) and then Exeter (1957-79). He was at various times president of the Mind Association, the Aristotelian Society and the British Society for the Philosophy of Science.</p> <p>Dan had a keen interest in classical music, especially opera, and in literature. He was an accomplished chess player and a regular figure on the cricket field for Exeter University's Erratics - he was a mean left-arm medium pace bowler.</p> <p>He married his first wife, Kathleen Kemsley, in 1948; she died in 2000. He is survived by his second wife, Maureen Castle, whom he married in 2003.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel John O'Connor, philosopher, born 2 April 1914; died 12 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Kenyan troops are about to advance on Somalia's rebel-held southern port of Kismayo in a final assault against the Islamist militants of al-Shabaab, according to a military spokesman in Nairobi.</p> <p>Kismayo's capture would mark a major breakthrough for the <a href=\"http://amisom-au.org/\" title=\"\">African Union forces</a> fighting the rebels, but rights groups are concerned a protracted battle could lead to many civilian deaths.</p> <p>A victory would probably reinforce the optimism that greeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">last week's election</a> as president of activist and professor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the first leader to be chosen in Somalia since the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which has been forced to relinquish control of a number of cities and towns in Somalia this year, is heavily dependent on revenue from charcoal exports through Kismayo's port, and taxes levied on businesses.</p> <p>However, some analysts warn that defeat would not signal the end of the al-Qaida-linked group, which could melt into the countryside and continue attacking the African Union's Amisom troops and their Somali allies. It is also unclear who would then control Kismayo, a lucrative source of income that has been fought over by Somali clans in the past.</p> <p>Military spokesman Colonel Cyrus Oguna said Kenyan troops were stockpiling supplies of fuel and ammunition around the town of Jan Abdala, about 25 miles (40km) from Kismayo, before moving forward.</p> <p>\"The final advance to Kismayo may be in the next one or two days. I cannot tell you with any certainty when [the city] may fall,\" he said, adding it might take a week or two to secure victory.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said on Tuesday on its Twitter page that \"rumours of Mujahideen withdrawing from Kismayo are blatant lies being peddled by the Kuffar [unbeliever] to further their agenda\".</p> <p>Oguna said al-Shabaab fighters and vehicles from Kismayo were reportedly moving into towns north-west of the city, including Jamaame and Jilib.</p> <p>\"I think they have sensed defeat and the amount of casualties they have incurred \u2026 has been so enormous,\" he said, adding that he believed the rebels were heading to strongholds further north.</p> <p>Kenyan troops crossed the border into Somalia in October last year to pursue the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> militants blamed by officials for a series of cross-border raids and kidnappings.</p> <p>The troops were integrated into the 17,000-strong African Union Amisom peacekeeping force in June, and are advancing with Somali troops and fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia in the south.</p> <p>Oguna said around 30 al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the last few days. One Somali soldier also died and one or two Kenyan soldiers were injured, he added.</p> <p>The Kenyan navy has shelled Kismayo in recent weeks, with <a href=\"[http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/23/somalia-protect-civilians-kismayo]\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a> saying two teenage boys and a pregnant woman were killed on 11 August. It called on the Kenyan government to investigate the incidents.</p> <p>The United Nations refugee agency, <a href=\"http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/country.php?id=197\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>, said more than 3,500 people had left Kismayo over the past weeks.</p>",
  "<p>The case reported on Monday of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-19621675\" title=\"\">Sarah Catt</a> cannot evoke much sympathy. Having overstepped the 24-week&#xa0;limit for an abortion, she bought a drug from India, self-aborted and disposed of the foetus, possibly within a week of term. She believed its father to be her lover and wanted to conceal it from her family. A Leeds judge, Mr Justice Cooke, sent her to prison for eight years, a minimum of four to be served.</p> <p>What conceivable good can be served by such a sentence? It appears merely a gesture of abhorrent rage on the judge's part. He accused Catt of robbing \"an apparently defenceless child \u2026 of the life which he was about to commence\". The judge used the cliche often used of wrongdoing women, that she was \"cool and calculating\", as if any women expecting sympathy should be hot and emotional. She had even been to university and acted \"in your own self-interest alone\", which no woman should do. The judge ranked the abortion as \"between manslaughter and murder on the criminal scale\".</p> <p>Leeds police then added the traditional damnation \"on the steps of the court house\", a modern version of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillory\" title=\"\">pillory</a>. Catt was \"extremely deceitful, cold and calculating\". She had shown no remorse and had lied to everyone concerned. The police hoped that \"she now has time to reflect on her actions\".</p> <p>Little in the case tells in Catt's favour, except that she had a loving husband who stood by her, and a family that was still together. A previous pregnancy at university had led to an adoption. She had an affair and, on the facts as presented, she acted from panic and desperation on finding she was pregnant.</p> <p>Being told by a clinic she was over the limit, Catt went for a second opinion and was again refused an abortion. She&#xa0;searched the internet for help and ended up with a drug from Mumbai. What must have been a horrifying process of self-administering, going into labour and disposing of the foetus had to be concealed from her family. When caught, she went from one lie to another to conceal what she had done.</p> <p>Catt asserted that the foetus was stillborn, though she clearly did not help herself by refusing to say where it was. We must take the judge's implication at face value, that she conducted the grisly process without a shudder of grief or emotion, though this seems unlikely.</p> <p>The judge said the act was between manslaughter and murder, but you cannot murder a foetus. It may be almost a person, but in common law it is not one until born alive and independent of its mother. It is legal to terminate a pregnancy after 24 weeks and indeed up to full term, albeit under strict medical supervision and only where there is a risk of serious abnormality or a grave, permanent injury to the mother. What Catt did was clearly illegal, but not manslaughter or murder.</p> <p>Many women have gone through pregnancy and abortion outside the strict confines of the law, balancing the risk of discovery against other risks attendant on an unplanned and unwanted birth. Many women must have panicked in these circumstances, and might afterwards have seemed \"calculating\" to a male judge, when what they were was totally traumatised. Either way, it does not seem the role of the justice system to pass judgment and sentence on the basis of female demeanour, let alone to expect a better emotional performance from those who have been to university.</p> <p>Catt should not have done what she did, but locking her away for eight years will cost the state about \u00a3225,000, at the going rate. It must come near to destroying her family. A long sentence is, as any judge should know, \"for life\", given the impact&#xa0;it has on life thereafter. Everything about the case suggests a woman badly in need of care and treatment.</p> <p>Some public retribution for a crime is \"required\" by political theorists and tabloid editors. In Britain it overwhelms considerations of rehabilitation, restitution or cost benefit. One might think that the process of trial in itself was retribution enough. In Catt's case,&#xa0;no social purpose is served by a fine or prison. A civilised response would be to find some way of piecing together a life so clearly devastated, especially for the sake of a family. Instead, the judge is punishing the living members of a family for the sake of a dead one. I&#xa0;am told that imprisonment in such a&#xa0;case would be extremely unlikely in any other European country.</p> <p>Eighty per cent of the 4,200 women prisoners jailed in England and Wales (up from 1,900 in 1995) committed nonviolent offences, including some 300 foreign drug \"mules\". More than a quarter are for transgressing Britain's antiquated drug laws. Many others are victims of a judicial machismo in jailing for petty shoplifting, tweeting, missing jury service, not paying a BBC licence fee and web-surfing in court. The result is to separate 17,000 children from their mothers each year, the surest sign that they too will end up in prison.</p> <p>The harm to society done by the judges in sending women unnecessarily to jail must far outweigh that of the original crime. In this matter Britain is still in the middle ages. And we have the cheek to go round the world, lecturing others on justice and the rule of law.</p>",

We keep expecting King, who is the GTW, to start effing and blinding, but he would appear to have a more positive outlook than that. The initials stand for Greater Than Wealth, and he pushes an anti-materialist message in interviews. They've even got a track called Sublime that is like What's Going On revisited. Maybe King could play early-70s Marvin Gaye in <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/julien_temple_to_direct_marvin_gaye_film_sexual_healing_based_on_comeback_l\" title=\"\">Julien Temple's forthcoming biopic.</a></p> <p>Or he could play the young Pharrell Williams if that movie ever gets made \u2013 he has got a similarly spacey-soul cadet quality about him, and a similar love of R&amp;B and funk at their most languid and jazzy.

This was always going to make us prick up our ears because it suggested a combination of the former Nashville trio's immaculate 80s-fixated slap bass-centric musicianship and the latter Cape Town maverick's spikily esoteric electro. It's not quite that amazing, but there are some beautiful moments on their new 4814 EP that display a slow-jam loveliness that go some way towards realising a dream we probably once had about Jensen jamming with the Neptunes. Cravings is as hazy and dazed as you could want, the title track is breathy boho rap, Cold Shoulder ft Lili K almost as juicy-fruity as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MucY5wRYByU\" title=\"\">Mtume's 80s disco-funk</a>. Somehow this obscure indie-soul kid from Chicago managed to solicit a cameo from Gwen Stefani for Blak Lux, and it was worth it, despite or perhaps because of the intrusively \"wubwubby\" dubstep bass.

  "<p>If events in the Middle East in the past two years have taught us anything, it is that Arab public opinion now matters. The events of the past week have only driven the message home further and made it clear how high the stakes are in the battle to determine the future direction of Arab politics.</p> <p>Since the decolonisation of the Middle East in the wake of the second world war, Arab countries have been ruled by a series of dictators who often justified and maintained their rule with ideologies \u2013 and with guns \u2013 imported from the west.</p> <p>Over the decades, a fragile arrangement emerged whereby the United States did its dealings with the region's dictators in return for stability in the world's most crucial oil-producing region. Egypt and Syria violently suppressed their own strongly anti-American Islamist movements \u2013 in Syria's case, with the deaths of tens of thousands and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_massacre\" title=\"\">near-levelling of the city of Hama</a> in 1982.</p> <p>The US didn't necessarily like the rulers of the Arab world, but it could deal with them. Challengers to the regional status quo were chastened \u2013 but not too much. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, President George HW Bush ensured Saddam returned to within his own borders but declined to unseat him, largely because he feared the chaos that might follow.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Arab dictators and their henchmen whispered to western diplomats about how complicated their societies were, how violence lay just beneath the surface, and how a strongman was needed to keep the peace and deliver gradual change \u2013 just not quite yet.</p> <p>The Arab dictators were right about one thing: their societies are complicated. The Arab world is rife with sectarian, social and economic inequality to which the dictatorships lent undertones of violence. Completely absent in the postwar status quo in the Middle East was any real role for the Arab people themselves. There was precious little public space for Arabs to discuss and reach compromises on their differences. The west dealt with the dictators, and the dictators dealt with their people: the people had little choice but to accept the status quo.</p> <p>This era has now come to a spectacular close with what is more appropriately called the \"Arab awakening\" rather than the \"Arab spring\". As governments have fallen, the populations of the Arab countries are finally being allowed to wake up and participate in forging their own destiny. The familiar, if brutal, regional order is being replaced with something much more complicated. This presents challenges for the west.</p> <p>Foremost among them is how to increase mutual understanding and tolerance between the peoples of the west and the Arab world. When President Obama <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-cairo-university-6-04-09\" title=\"\">made his famous speech</a> at Cairo's al-Azhar university in 2009, American conservatives derided him for \"apologising\" for America and \"appeasing\" Arab rulers. If this argument ever had any validity when the Arab dictatorships appeared immovable, it has precisely zero now that Arab public opinion is a deciding factor in how the politics of the region develops.</p> <p>But gestures such as Obama's speech will not be enough. Anti-western ideology is <a href=\"http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=54406\" title=\"\">deeply entrenched</a> in parts of the Arab world, and it will take more than gestures to dislodge it. Western countries must strike a difficult balance between helping new, popular Arab governments where they can without seeming to dictate to them. Their assistance should focus on building trust by helping to address the practical economic and administrative problems facing countries such as Egypt, Libya and Tunisia.</p> <p>Many of the grievances that kickstarted the Arab rebellions were economic, and in the short term measures such as <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/07/uk-usa-egypt-debt-idUKBRE8860XF20120907\" title=\"\">debt relief</a> for Egypt should top the agenda. The US must give moderate political figures, such as the secular Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki and Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, some slack <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/09/16/political-battles-in-tunisia-shade-attacks-on-u-s-embassy/\" title=\"\">in their domestic battles</a> with more extreme groups, who have a sizeable base of support.</p> <p>In Libya, the focus should be on providing what assistance the new government requires to build up the country's weak central state and to harness the feeling of goodwill towards the west that followed the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi. This is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/libyan-president-magariaf-military-action\" title=\"\">the only way to marginalise</a> groups such as the one that murdered the American ambassador in Benghazi.</p> <p>On a more profound level, the US must accept that it now has diminished control over events in the region. It must adapt itself to the local moderate forces in each country. A true process of give-and-take must take place, and this will include setbacks for US interests. A return to the forced intervention of the George W Bush years is out of the question, as it is an inappropriate way to deal with democratically elected governments and will only strengthen the extremists.</p> <p>Now that the west is no longer able to deal solely with the Arab dictators, it must turn its attention to building trust with the Arab people. In the past, these people have often been derisively and simplistically called, in the singular, the \"Arab street\". Yet Cairo, Damascus and Benghazi have many streets; we must now patiently learn how to navigate them.</p>",
  "<p>The Palestinian militant turned theatre director Zakaria Zubeidi has resumed a total hunger strike in protest at his continued detention without charge by Palestinian security forces, and his supporters say he could die within days.</p> <p>Zubeidi, who publicly renounced armed struggle in 2006 in favour of cultural resistance, has been held in prison in Jericho since 13 May after being detained in a wave of arrests in his home city of Jenin. He has not been charged with any offence.</p> <p>He received assurances that he would be released, but at a court hearing on Monday his detention was extended by a further 19 days. He declared that he would refuse all food, fluids and medical attention.</p> <p>According to witnesses, a visibly weak and thin Zubeidi told the court: \"This morning the doctor told me I have three days to live if I don't drink water. So this court has decided to kill me.\"</p> <p>Zubeidi's arrest followed an attack by gunmen on the home of Jenin's governor, who shortly afterwards died of a heart attack. A weapon used in the attack was linked by Palestinian investigators to Zubeidi. He denied any involvement and before his arrest he offered to co-operate with the investigation.</p> <p>He told relatives and associates that he had been held in solitary confinement for the first 50 days of detention, had been denied access to a lawyer for more than two weeks and had been abused and tortured by interrogators. His lawyer, Farid Hawwash, was also arrested after criticising the Palestinian security forces.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch criticised Zubeidi's continued detention. \"For more than four months, the Palestinian Authority has violated Zubeidi's basic due process rights to be charged and tried, and continues to ignore his statements that interrogators tortured him,\" said Bill Van Esveld, of HRW.</p> <p>\"The PA's foreign donors should urgently pressure it to end the impunity and arbitrary detentions that Zubeidi's case exemplifies.\" Western governments including Britain and the US provide direct funding to the PA security services.</p> <p>Zubeidi is a director and co-founder of Jenin's innovative but controversial Freedom Theatre. Jonatan Stanczak, managing director of the theatre, said: \"I fear Zakaria will be the first Palestinian prisoner to die as a consequence of hunger strike \u2013 and the terrible thing is that he's in a Palestinian prison.\"</p> <p>Jenny Nyman, the widow of Juliano Mer-Khamis, the theatre's founder who was shot dead 18 months ago, said: \"It's a disaster and a disgrace for the PA. If they let a person who has fought all his life for the freedom of his people die in prison, it's a very dark period, and a big symbol of the state of Palestinian society.\"</p> <p>Hawwash, Zubeidi's lawyer, said he would appeal against the decision in court in Ramallah on Wednesday, but had \"no expectations\" of the outcome.</p> <p>Jenin was a bedrock of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and the home of many suicide bombers sent to target Israeli citizens. Zubeidi was on Israel's most-wanted list as the leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in the city. But Jenin was later held up as a model of good Palestinian governance as the city prospered with economic investment and PA security forces won control from militant groups.</p> <p>A string of attacks in the past 18 months \u2013 including the unsolved murder of Mer-Khamis, the assault on the governor's house and the assassination two weeks ago of the Palestinian security chief Hisham al-Rakh \u2013 has led to claims that Jenin is slipping towards anarchy.</p> <p>The city's new governor, Talal Dwekat, denied there was a crisis. \"There is no problem we're incapable of solving, and no person above the law,\" he said. \"Years ago you would see gangsters and guns in Jenin, but now you walk around and the only guns you see are in the hands of the security forces. There is total control over Jenin.\"</p> <p>Zubeidi's detention is another blow to the Freedom Theatre, which has been repeatedly raided by Israeli security forces since Mer-Khamis was killed. The theatre has antagonised both Israeli and Palestinian authorities by criticising their actions.</p> <p>\"The level of harassment from the Israeli army has been seriously affecting our work to the extent that it has even threatened our continuation,\" Stanczak said. \"Now the PA is also causing problems by detaining Zakaria, but I don't know whether by intention or as a consequence. His detention makes the PA seem like another occupier rather than a servant of the people.\"</p> <p>The theatre has been criticised by conservative elements in the Jenin refugee camp in which it is based over its mixed-gender acting workshops and progressive outlook. \"We challenge power structures, we are provocative,\" Stanczak said. \"If we didn't, what would be the purpose of our work?\"</p> <p>Dwekat said he had not received any complaints about the theatre since he became governor five months ago. \"Even if the theatre makes mistakes, the reaction should not be violent. All our problems should be dealt with through dialogue. The PA is totally supportive of cultural activities.\" He said he planned to make his first visit to the theatre \"very soon\".</p>",
  "<p>What defines a woman? Over the past few weeks the defining feature has been the new celebrity in town, a source of fascination to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19319240\" title=\"\">deluded politicians</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/naomi-wolf-women-orgasm-neural-wiring\" title=\"\"><em>soi-disant</em> feminists</a> alike: the vagina, a magical creature that can distinguish between consensual sex and rape and, according to Naomi Wolf's now <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/09/10/120910crbo_books_levy\" title=\"\">much-</a><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/pride-and-prejudice/?pagination=false book\" title=\"\">mocked</a> <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2012/09/problem-naomi-wolfs-vagina\" title=\"\">book</a>, can hear when it is being insulted and will rebel in kind, turning the carrier person into \"a bitch\". This is the problem with essentialism: no matter how varied its uses, the ultimate point is always the same and always reductive.</p> <p>But femaleness doesn't stop at the vagina. No, no, no! Many things happen via the magical vagina and it is one of these in particular that certain US politicians see as defining a woman. No, not cystitis, or vajazzling, although I'd love to hear Mitt Romney's thoughts on those pressing issues. No, it is motherhood.</p> <p>This was most obvious at the Republican and Democrat national conventions, in which the current and aspiring first ladies did the traditional schtick of attempting to appeal to women voters by telling Americans what great husbands they have. Whether being even a halfway decent president is in any way connected with being a great husband is a question I reckon Hillary Clinton and the late Jackie Kennedy Onassis could answer with more authority than me but that was not the point these women were hammering home. Rather, it was their role as mothers.</p> <p>Ann Romney announced at the beginning of her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NraMG2zImE\" title=\"\">sappy speech</a> that she would be talking \"not about politics, not about party\" \u2013 which raised the question why she was talking at the RNC at all \u2013 \"but love \u2026 that love so deep only a mother can fathom it\". It is mothers, according to Romney, \"who really hold this country together\" and while she was open-minded enough to include \"single, married, widowed\" in the varieties, the ultimate flavour was still the same: Mom. \"It's the moms who always have to work a little harder to make it right.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama also played the mom card in her otherwise <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPdKUA9Ipg\" title=\"\">perfectly judged speech</a>, saying \"at the end of the day, my most important role is still 'mom-in-chief'\". Writer Tami Winfrey Harris <a href=\"http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2012/09/a-black-mom-in-chief-is-revolutionary-what-white-feminist-get-wrong-about-michelle-obama/\" title=\"\">wrote</a> recently in response to the disapproval Obama received for this, saying that critics are missing the point here: Obama is overturning old stereotypes about black women by presenting herself as \"nurturing, beautiful and stylish as well as whip smart, athletic and strong\". But in this instance, the line between \"overturning racial stereotypes\" and \"kowtowing to a gender status quo\" seems an awfully fine one.</p> <p>The Republicans have a problem with women, on various levels. They have a problem with getting women votes; Obama currently has a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/poll-obama-holds-narrow-edge-over-romney/\" title=\"\">12-point advantage</a> over Romney among women and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-11/obama-tops-romney-in-poll-with-2-1-backing-from-single-women.html\" title=\"\">a poll</a> in July said twice as many single women favour Obama over Romney. The Democrats, encouraged by this and by the Republican's move to the intractable right in regards to birth control, have been <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/05/dems_to_ladies_you_are_important/\" title=\"\">talking </a>about abortion and contraception with increasing boldness.</p> <p>The Republicans, by contrast, have become hysterically conservative and retrograde about birth control and abortion. Simultaneously, they venerate the concept of motherhood yet don't want to deal with the messy realities of it, which is why they can <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/07/1129098/-Mitt-Romney-s-women-s-ambassador-says-birth-control-is-off-message\" title=\"\">claim</a> that birth control is not an economic issue when it clearly is precisely that.</p> <p>Paul Ryan can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/paul-ryan-mother-medicare-florida\" title=\"\">wax sentimental</a> about his dear mother while simultaneously proposing <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/13/how-would-a-vice-president-paul-ryan-affect-women.html\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to women's healthcare, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3717\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to what was once known as the food stamp programme by $133.5bn (\u00a382bn) and removing exemptions in abortions, even for rape and incest victims. This is because the mothers they want to think about are rich mothers. (They also like thin ones: when Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/romney-hearts-snooki-among-other-interview-highlights/2012/09/14/ed11e80c-fe8e-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html\" title=\"\">asked</a> recently who his favourite reality TV star was he replied that it is Snooki from Jersey Shore, who recently had a baby: \"Look how thin she's gotten! She's lost weight,\" he replied, like a magazine that applauds women who lose the \"baby weight\".) Thus, when Ann Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/ann-romney-responds-to-democratic-pundit-saying-she-never-worked-a-day-in-her-life/2012/04/12/gIQApstpBT_blog.html\" title=\"\">accused</a> back in April of not being representative of most American women due to her $250m bank account, the Romney campaign insisted that her status as a mother somehow outweighed her financial situation, meaning she really is an everywoman, such is the mythical power of motherhood.</p> <p>Now, I'd like to state for the record that I love mothers. Hell, I even have one myself. But it should surely go without saying that, just as not all parents are women, not all women are mothers. This somewhat undermines the idea that emphasising Obama and Romney's maternal roles makes them \u2013 and by extension, their husbands \u2013 universally relatable. A woman's role as a mother is of undoubtedly central importance within her home but, at the risk of undermining this Norman Rockwell mentality in US politics, it's not really all that relevant to those outside it.</p> <p>Moreover, this conflation of women and mothers and valuing motherhood itself over women plays into the mentality of anti-choice advocates who believe that the woman herself doesn't matter: it's the baby who is important here, who defines her \u2013 she's just the carrier pod. Contrary to what too many politicians think, not all mothers are the same and not all women are mothers. Just as the vagina doth not make the woman, nor does the uterus.</p>",

  "<p>Labour knows that tuberculosis in cattle is a major animal health problem. We understand the desperation of farmers affected by this devastating disease. That is why, in government, we set up the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT). It cost \u00a350m and remains the most extensive scientific study, over a 10-year period, on whether culling badgers reduces bovine TB.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bovinetb.info/docs/The%20Duration%20of%20the%20Effects%20of%20Repeated%20Widespread%20Badger%20Culling.pdf\" title=\"\">study concluded</a> that \"the reductions in cattle TB incidence achieved by repeated badger culling were not sustained in the long term after culling ended and did not offset the financial costs of culling. These results \u2026 suggest that badger culling is unlikely to contribute effectively to the control of cattle TB in Britain.\"</p> <p>Labour's approach in government was led by that science. We continue to be led by it. Sadly, the coalition government's approach to bovine TB has been driven by short-term political calculation. Their \"big society badger cull\", which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">issued the first licence on Monday</a>, carries some very real risks and will be bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.</p> <p>First and foremost, the cull could make TB worse. Localised culling significantly increases the TB risk in neighbouring herds due to a \"peturbation\" effect, when traumatised badgers move out of cull areas and spread the disease, particularly in the first two years. The new cull will use \"hard boundaries\", such as roads and rivers that badgers find hard to cross, but the RBCT found that the perturbation effect still occurred when hard boundaries were in place.</p> <p>Furthermore, the RBCT used cage trapping and shooting, but the new cull will use free shooting as it is cheaper. Free shooting has therefore never been tested and is not supported by the science. <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/tb-control-measures/100915-tb-control-measures-annexe.pdf\" title=\"\">The environment department's own risk assessment</a> to ministers raises concerns about the impact of free shooting: \"If a different culling strategy to that conducted in the RBCT is used the effect on TB incidence and the degree of the resulting perturbation is uncertain.\"</p> <p>The panel of scientists who met at the department on 4 April 2011 stated that vaccination is unlikely to be effective at reducing the impact of peturbation. The government places great emphasis on that <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">scientific meeting at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the two-page document</a> it yielded, yet it concluded: \"If culling is not conducted in a co-ordinated, sustained and simultaneous manner according to minimum criteria, then this could result in a smaller benefit or even a detrimental effect on confirmed cattle TB incidence.\"</p> <p>Worryingly, there is no mechanism in place to measure whether the culling makes things worse or better. The \"pilot scheme\" in Gloucestershire which got the go-ahead on Monday is in no sense a scientific test of policy. The panel set up to oversee its effectiveness will have a narrow remit: is free shooting humane and can the farmers deliver it? They will not look at the reduction in the number of cattle affected by TB to see if culling saves public money.</p> <p>The panel will assess whether farmers can shoot more than 70% - but less than 100% - of badgers in an area. But as the government hasn't counted the badgers in cull areas, they will not know what proportion of the population has been killed. If 1,000 badgers are killed, we won't know whether that is part of a population of 1,001 or 2,000. Lord Krebs, the Oxford scientist who instigated Labour's RBCT, has described the government's cull as \"a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19623931\" title=\"\">crazy scheme</a>\". These pilot culls are a shot in the dark, in every sense of the word.</p> <p>Another crazy aspect of the culls is that costs will exceed the benefits. <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovine-tb-impact-assessment.pdf\" title=\"\">Defra's impact assessment</a> states: \"For farmers in cull areas, monetised costs exceed expected monetised benefits.\" So the costs to farmers will exceed the benefits. Hardly a compelling case to sign up for the cull.</p> <p>Taxpayers will still pay for TB testing, monitoring, issuing licences and judging the effectiveness of the cull. In addition, the costs of providing armed police to manage any public protest at cull sites was not included in the government's cost-benefit analysis produced in 2011. In a written answer to parliament, the government estimated it will <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120220/text/120220w0001.htm\" title=\"\">cost taxpayers \u00a3500,000 per cull area</a> per year to police. Police will also bear the costs of licensing firearms.</p> <p>And there are a series of further risks. Will the cull wipe out whole badger populations, putting us in breach of the Bern Convention on wildlife protection; will farmers actually be able to deliver the long, hard cull the policy prescribes?</p> <p>The government is under siege from scientists who rightly object to ministers dressing up the cull as being \"science-led\". The reality could not be further from the truth. Bovine TB is a terrible disease that needs to be controlled. This cull is not the way to do it.</p> <p>\u2022 Mary Creagh is Labour's shadow environment secretary</p>",
  "<p>In May, something extremely rare happened: a federal court applied the US constitution to impose some limits on the powers of the president. That happened when federal district court judge Katherine Forrest of the southern district of New York, an Obama appointee, <a href=\"http://sdnyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/12-Civ.-00331-2012.05.16-Opinion-Granting-PI.pdf\">preliminarily barred enforcement</a> of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the statute enacted by Congress in December 2011 with broad bipartisan support and signed into law by President Obama (after he had threatened to veto it).</p> <p>That 2011 law expressly grants the president the power to indefinitely detain in military custody not only <em>accused</em> terrorists, but also <em>their supporters</em>, all without charges or trial. It does so by empowering the president to indefinitely detain not only al-Qaida members, but also members of so-called \"associated forces\", as well as anyone found to \"substantially support\" such forces \u2013 whatever those terms might mean. I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/16/federal_court_enjoins_ndaa/\">wrote about that decision and the background to this case</a> when it was issued. </p> <p>What made Judge Forrest's ruling particularly remarkable is that the lawsuit was brought by eight journalists and activists, such as former New York Times reporter Chris Hedges, Daniel Ellsberg, Noam Chomsky, and Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, who argued that their work, which involves interactions with accused terrorists, could subject them to indefinite detention under the law's broad and vague authority,<em> even for US citizens on US soil</em>. The court agreed, noting that the plaintiffs presented \"evidence of concrete \u2013 non-hypothetical \u2013 ways in which the presence of the legislation has already impacted those expressive and associational activities\". The court was particularly disturbed by the Obama DOJ's adamant refusal to say, in response to being asked multiple times, that the law could not be used to indefinitely detain the plaintiffs due to their journalistic and political activities.</p> <p>Last week, Judge Forrest made her preliminary ruling permanent, issuing <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/432859-hedges-v-obama-injunction-2.html\">a 112-page decision</a> explaining it. Noting that the plaintiffs \"testified credibly to having an actual and reasonable fear that their activities will subject them to indefinite military detention\", she emphasized how dangerous this new law is given the extremely broad discretion it vests in the president to order people detained in military custody with no charges:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396332453\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347968278683/forest.png\" alt=\"forest ruling\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The court also brushed aside the Obama DOJ's prime argument, echoing the <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/ideology-of-lawlessness.html\">theories of John Yoo</a>: namely, that courts have no business \"interfering\" in the president's conduct of war. After acknowledging that the president is entitled to deference in the national security realm, Judge Forrest dispensed with the Obama DOJ's claim with this vital observation: one that should be unnecessary but, in the 9/11 era, is all too commonly ignored:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396332454\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347968762065/forest2.png\" alt=\"forest ruling 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"378\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In other words: while the president is entitled to deference in his conduct of war, he's not entitled to wield the power to order people, including American citizens, indefinitely imprisoned in military detention. Regardless of how he claims he intends to exercise this power, the mere act of vesting it in him so chills the exercise of first amendment and other protected rights that the constitution can have no meaning if courts permit it to stand.</p> <p>In response to this ruling, the Obama administration not only filed an immediate appeal, but they filed an emergency motion asking the appeals court to lift the injunction pending the appeal. Obama lawyers <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/433357-hedges-motion-to-stay-2nd-circuit.html\">wrote a breathless attack</a> on the court's ruling, denouncing it as \"vastly troubling\" and claiming that it \"threatens tangible and dangerous consequences in the conduct of an active military conflict\" and \"threatens irreparable harm to national security\".</p> <p>The Obama DOJ also objected that the decision \"was entered against the president as commander-in-chief in his conduct of ongoing military operations, is unprecedented and exceeded the court's authority\": how irreverent. And they argued that the broad detention power claimed by President Obama \"has been endorsed by two presidents [meaning him and George W Bush], by the [rightwing] DC circuit in habeas litigation brought by Guant\u00e1namo detainees, and by the Congress in Section 1021(b)(2).\"</p> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/\">written at length before</a> about why indefinite detention is so dangerous, and why a statute such as the NDAA \u2013 which purposely (as the court here found) leaves open the question of whether it applies to US citizens \u2013 is one of the most pernicious laws enacted in some time. I won't rehash that here, but I do want to make two points about the Obama administration's new fight in defense of this law.</p> <p><em>First</em>, the Obama administration's unhinged claim that Judge Forrest's ruling imperils national security gives the lie to the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/\">central excuse for the NDAA</a>: namely, that it does not expand the president's detention powers beyond what is already vested by the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm\">2001 Authorization to Use Military Force</a> (AUMF). Judge Forrest's ruling leaves the 2001 AUMF in place and did not purport to nullify any prior decisions applying it. Therefore, if the NDAA does nothing that the 2001 AUMF did not already do \u2013 as Obama defenders relentlessly claimed to justify his signing of this odious bill \u2013 then it cannot possibly be the case that Judge Forrest's ruling harms national security, since Obama already has all the detention power he claims he needs under the 2001 AUMF.</p> <p>The reality is that the NDAA did indeed wildly expand the president's detention powers beyond what the 2001 AUMF provided. In contrast to the 2001 AUMF \u2013 which empowered the president to act against a relatively narrow category: those \"he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons\" \u2013 the NDAA empowers him to act against a much broader range of people: not only those who perpetrated 9/11, but also \"associated forces\", and not only those who are members of such groups, but those who \"substantially support\" them.</p> <p>While the Bush and Obama DOJs have long absurdly interpreted the 2001 AUMF to apply to this broader range, and while some courts have accepted that interpretation, the law itself vested no such power. The NDAA <em>did</em>. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law\">denounced Obama's signing of it so vociferously</a>, and it is why the Obama DOJ is so horrified, obviously, by the prospect that it will be invalidated: precisely because it so drastically expands their detention power. Both the court's ruling and the Obama DOJ's reaction to that ruling prove that the NDAA does indeed provide the president with significantly enhanced authority of indefinite detention.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, to see the sorry and wretched state of liberties in the US under President Obama, let us look to Afghanistan. The US is currently attempting to turn over to the Afghan government control of the lawless prison system the US has long maintained in Bagram and other parts of that country. But that effort is running into a serious problem: namely, the US wants the prisoners to remain there in cages without charges, but the Afghans are insisting that indefinite detention violates their belief in due process. From an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ggpHowv0PAy_skdOC1tSR9g1Gx6A?docId=d81b0861a5424214a83b225f63ca647e\">Associated Press article Monday</a> headlined \"Afghans reject US-favored administrative detention\":</p> <blockquote> <p>\"An Afghan judicial panel ruled Monday that administrative detention violates Afghan law, potentially thwarting a US plan to hand over Afghan detainees that American officials believe should continue to be held without a trial.</p> <p>\"President Hamid Karzai's office announced in a statement that a top-level judicial panel met earlier in the day and decided that the detention of Afghan citizens without a court trial 'has not been foreseen in Afghan laws' and therefore could not be used.</p> <p>\"The US government has long held Afghans captured in operations inside the country without trial, arguing that they are enemy combatants and therefore can be detained for as long as their release might pose a danger to the international coalition \u2026</p> <p>\"A US official confirmed that the transfer of detainees had paused because of the dispute.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is that not amazing? On the very same day that the Obama DOJ fights vigorously in US courts for the right to imprison people without charges, the Afghan government fights just as vigorously for basic due process.</p> <p>Remember: the US, we're frequently told, is in Afghanistan to bring democracy to the Afghan people and to teach them about freedom. But the Afghan government is refusing the US demand to imprison people without charges on the ground that such lawless detention violates their conceptions of basic freedom. Maybe Afghanistan should invade the US in order to teach Americans about freedom.</p> <p>This is not the first time this has happened. In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/23/AR2009102303709.html\">the Obama administration decided</a> that it wanted to target certain Afghan citizens for due process-free assassinations on the ground that the targets to be executed were drug \"kingpins\". They were to be killed based solely on US accusations, with no trial, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp\">just as the Obama administration does with its own citizens</a>. But again, that plan ran into a roadblock: Afghan leaders were horrified by the notion that their citizens would be extrajudicially executed based on unproven suspicions [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A US military hit list of about 50 suspected drug kingpins is drawing fierce opposition from Afghan officials, who say it could undermine their fragile justice system and trigger a backlash against foreign troops. </p> <p>\"The US military and Nato officials have authorized their forces to kill or capture individuals on the list, which was drafted within the past year as part of Nato's new strategy to combat drug operations that finance the Taliban \u2026</p> <p>\"General Mohammad Daud Daud, Afghanistan's deputy interior minister for counternarcotics efforts, praised US and British special forces for their help recently in destroying drug labs and stashes of opium. But he said he worried that foreign troops would now act on their own to kill suspected drug lords,<em> based on secret evidence, instead of handing them over for trial.</em></p> <p><em>\"'They should respect our law, our constitution and our legal codes,' Daud said. 'We have a commitment to arrest these people on our own'</em> \u2026</p> <p>\"There is a constitutional problem here. A person is innocent unless proven guilty,\" [former Afghan interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali] said. \"If you go off to kill or capture them, how do you prove that they are really guilty in terms of legal process?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, the Obama administration has received far more resistance to its due process-free imprisonments and assassinations from Afghans than it has from its own citizens in the US. If only more Americans, including progressives, were willing to point out the most basic truths in response to these Obama power seizures, such as: \"If you go off to kill or capture them, how do you prove that they are really guilty in terms of legal process?\" </p> <p>Instead, many Americans, particularly in the age of Obama, are content to assume that anyone whom the US government accuses of being a terrorist should, for that reason alone, be assumed to be guilty, and as a result, any punishment the president decides to dole out \u2013 indefinite imprisonment, summary execution \u2013 is warranted and just; no bothersome, obsolete procedures such as \"trials\" or \"indictments\" are necessary. </p> <p>It is that mindset that will ensure that Obama's vigorous fight to preserve the power of indefinite detention will provoke so little objection: among Americans, that is \u2013 though obviously not among Afghans, who seem to have an actual understanding of, and appreciation for, the value of due process.</p>",
  "<p>Last month, the number of people qualifying with <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/faqs/becoming-a-teacher/qualified-teacher-status.aspx\">Early Years Professional Status</a> (EYPS) reached the 10,000 milestone. The 10,000th graduate, Nafeesah Rafiq, was hailed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/person/6690/sarah-teather\">Sarah Teather</a>, the Minister for Children and Families, as being one of the \"talented and passionate\" professionals now working in our nurseries and pre-school facilities who have the potential to \"make a particular impact on those who are among the most disadvantaged\".</p> <p>The Minister is absolutely right. Such highly trained and knowledgeable professionals working in the early years sector are making an enormous contribution to the life chances of thousands of young children from all backgrounds.</p> <p>On the face of it, this vital workforce has come a long way from the days of the 'mum's army' of women who would work in pre-school settings, often as volunteers, and always unnoticed in challenging conditions. Yet the many graduates now working in early years facilities remain unrecognised, despite having completed a multi-disciplinary degree. The <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1899&amp;Itemid=239\">Destination of Leavers in Higher Education Survey</a> (DLHA) does not classify early years work as a graduate job at all, because it contains no managerial classification to define it as such, though many of those achieving EYPS will be graduates who end up in leadership roles.</p> <p>In fact it was the introduction of the EYPS that brought about the move towards a professionalised service. The now defunct Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) set a goal that by 2010 every early years private, voluntary and independent facility would have at least one employee with EYPS who would lead good practice among their colleagues, and that they would enjoy parity as professionals with teachers who have achieved Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).</p> <p>While a workforce of 10,000 staff trained to postgraduate-level is a step in the right direction, the aims of the CWDC sadly remains some way off being achieved. Ministers may celebrate this milestone, but there are outstanding issues that the government needs to address.</p> <p>Firstly, no-one has been brave enough to tackle the pay and conditions of service for staff working in foundation years, and therefore the tens of thousands of staff working there remain relatively poorly paid. Unlike their counterparts in school classrooms, early years staff are under-represented by trade unions and associations and have never had the benefit of a professional body to act as their advocate.</p> <p>Furthermore, the EYPS has recently been undermined by an independent review into the early years qualifications framework carried out on behalf of the government by Professor Cathy Nutbrown, of the University of Sheffield. Her interim findings attracted criticism from pre-school staff when she suggested that EYPS should be phased out and effectively absorbed by QTS. The implication was that, contrary to previous assurances, there was no parity between the two professional qualifications.</p> <p>What is now needed is a shift in attitude and understanding on the impact the work of early years professionals has on the development of young children. Numerous reports have concluded that getting the early years right and putting in place the appropriate interventions where needed is crucial to a child's future academic and social success. Yet the very people to whom we give this huge responsibility are still not being adequately rewarded or recognised for the work that they do in terms of their professional status, pay or conditions of service.</p> <p>One of the big questions is who is going to pay the additional wages to employ this level of expertise on a larger scale? Putting up childcare fees would defeat the object and put early years provision out of the reach of many families, and at a time when parents are already struggling to afford the fees. It needs a strong government to take a lead and to ensure that the remuneration reflects the importance of the job.</p> <p>Perhaps the first step should be recognising the professional status of early years graduates. At the <a href=\"http://www.worcester.ac.uk/\">University of Worcester</a> \u2013 one of only eight national providers of the EYPS programme - 97% of our early childhood graduates gain employment within six months of leaving us. Yet this is not reflected in our position in any media-created university 'league tables' because of the DLHA's classifications.</p> <p>There needs now to be an acknowledgement of the rigour of the EYPS programme that these students undertake, which includes the study of aspects such as the law around children and families, expertise in the birth to five age range, safeguarding children, leading delivery of the Early Years Foundation Stage, child development and psychology, and health and welfare.</p> <p>This level of expertise must be viewed more favourably than is currently the case. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/earlyyearseducation\">Early childhood professionals</a> are educators, carers, family support workers, and so much more \u2013 taking on multi-faceted roles requiring a full understanding of the holistic needs of children and their families. They must be valued for their knowledge as well as the responsibility entrusted in them by parents and society in general.</p> <p><em>Karen Hanson is principal lecturer and head of the Centre for Early Childhood in the Institute of Education at the <a href=\"http://www.worcester.ac.uk/\">University of Worcester</a></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<h2>The building</h2> <p>Kino is in the now\u2013trendy Pigneto area east of Rome, previously a working-class neighbourhood, where Pasolini shot his first film Accattone. Kino took over the Grauco, a film society established in the 70s and an important destination for Roman cinephiles until it was forced to close due to financial pressures. But two years ago a group of young people who all work in the cinema industry decided to get together and use the space to create their ideal cinema where they could show films that were impossible to see elsewhere in Rome. </p> <p>Kino is split into two levels: the basement houses the auditorium (36 seats, digital projector), and the ground floor, where is a cool European cafe with mismatched chairs and leather sofas, and another less formal projection space. There, you can eat delicious local food, sample from an excellent selection of wines (they have a nice selection of biodynamic wines) before or after the film. You can also bring your own food and drink into the auditorium.</p> <h2>The clientele</h2> <p>The group of people behind Kino are all in their 30s and 40s and their original idea was to create a cinema different from the fusty image of old-fashioned film societies. The Kino clientele reflects this spirit and is mostly made up of young people who work in the media and film industries \u2013 above all, they share a great passion for cinema. Anyone, regardless of age or background, who also has this passion will feel at home there.</p> <h2>The programme</h2> <p>Kino's programme is bold and imaginative and its main aim is to show films that struggle to get distributed in Italy. They have also started to act as a distributor, most recently for Miranda July's The Future which wasn't released theatrically in Italy. Their programme is themed by day: you can watch an independent Italian film on a Tuesday or a cult movie on a Saturday. Once a month they invite someone from the art or cinema world to choose five films that mean something to them. The event, an established feature in many Parisian cinemas, is called Carte Blanche, and for aspiring cinephiles the good news is that anyone can submit their own ideas for a season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396365665\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347893660196/Kino-Rome--008.jpg\" alt=\"Kino Rome \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kino Rome's bar.

Kino is a fun place to be whether you want to watch a film or just hang out. The founding members are part of the staff and it isn't unusual to have one of them, or a director or an up-and-coming actor serving you food or making you a cocktail. </p> <p>Their manifesto epitomises the fresh and playful spirit of the owners and at the same time shows their serious goal: to create something for an audience starved of the best contemporary Italian and international cinema. From the Kino manifesto:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kino is a cinema<br>Kino isn't a film society<br>Kino doesn't have 3D: 2 dimensions are enough<br>Kino is irreverent, childish, smart<br>At Kino you can see what you can't see anywhere else<br>Kino is an idea, a manifesto, a foolish act</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>A man with a sack slung over his shoulder trudges up a mountain of rotting rubbish, where Marabou storks perch like mournful sentinels. In the valley below, a woman pulls a jacket from the rubbish and holds it up, appraising it with a critical eye.</p> <p>At Nairobi's Dandora rubbish dump, the working day is in full swing. Men and women pick through a newly arrived truck, looking for plastic, food, clothes, paper and bottles \u2013 anything they can sell on or take home to use.</p> <p>Robert Ondika, 27, straightens from sifting through the rubbish with an iron hook. He has been working in Dandora, one of Africa's largest rubbish dumps, for three years and earns between 50 and 500 Kenyan shillings a day (between $0.60 and $6). \"We come here to earn our daily bread,\" he says in Kiswahili. \"Here, we touch different things, we could step on something sharp. It is only God who is helping us here.\"</p> <p>For these foot soldiers in Nairobi's unregulated rubbish business, the work is perilous and the rewards paltry, to say nothing of the discomfort of spending the day in a smoky, stinking wasteland. But for those who live in the neighbourhoods around the dump, it offers survival.</p> <p>That is Dandora's paradox \u2013 it is source of life, but also of illness and, occasionally, death. In a <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report released on Tuesday</a>, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a>, Italian development group <a href=\"http://www.cesvi.org/\" title=\"\">Cesvi</a> and church group <a href=\"http://www.kutokanet.com/\" title=\"\">Exodus Kutoka</a> say the dump is \"one of the most flagrant violations of human rights\" in Kenya.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> says the city council of Nairobi, local government departments and the <a href=\"http://www.nema.go.ke/\" title=\"\">National Environment Management Authority</a> (Nema) bear legal responsibility for the hazardous living conditions in the slums nearby.</p> <p>The dump, which lies 8km (5 miles) from the city centre, was declared full in 2001, and since then campaigners, including Concern, have sought to have it decommissioned.</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy: The Impact of Garbage on Human Rights in Nairobi City</a>, says the rubbish had polluted the soil, water and air, affecting more than 200,000 people, including up to 10,000 who spend the day seeking treasure from it.</p> <p>Most of them do not wear gloves or masks and many suffer from respiratory ailments, such as asthma. Other conditions that have affected workers include anaemia, kidney problems, cancer and frequent miscarriages.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=519&amp;ArticleID=5679&amp;l=en\" title=\"\">2007 study</a> by the United Nations Environment Programme found that at least half the children in surrounding neighbourhoods had heavy metal concentrations in their blood that exceed the minimum level set by the World Health Organisation. Some estimates say around half the workers on the dump are under 18.</p> <p>A site for a new dump was earmarked near Nairobi's international airport, but that idea stalled this year when the Kenya Airports Authority said birds attracted by the rubbish could endanger planes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">Trash and Tragedy report</a> says many workers do not support plans to close the dump, where 850 tonnes of waste are deposited each day.</p> <p>Father John Webootsa, who lives nearby in Korogocho slum, understands this. \"It brings money and it brings death,\" says the Comboni priest, who has campaigned for years to have the 30-acre dump relocated. He organises vocational training and loans for scavengers to help them escape.</p> <p>\"We believe this is not a life that human beings should live,\" he says. \"Many [people] have died and others are dying. Others have been burned by the acid, the 'boilers' [contaminated industrial waste barrels] that are there. Beneath that garbage, there are boiling chemicals, and people may be burned if they step on them by accident.\"</p> <p>Korogocho, which means \"crowded shoulder to shoulder\" in Kiswahili, appears to have been forgotten by the government. On one of the narrow streets, pigs snuffle among piles of rubbish, just yards from the body of a dead dog. Webootsa says people here feel rejected by society and by the government. \"Social amenities are not provided, the government is not here. We do not have a public health facility \u2026 there are only two schools, and they were built by us,\" he says.</p> <p>But the dump is a source of wealth and power for the men at the top of an informal cartel that runs the site. With no government control, there is plenty of room for gangsters to wield their influence. Visitors must organise and pay for \"security\" to walk around the site and to take photographs.</p> <p>The report says powerful business interests have rallied communities against the decommissioning process. \"Most of the anti-decomissioning forces have deeply vested business interests that thrive in the prevailing chaos,\" it says.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en/resources/trash-and-tragedy-nairobi-city\">report</a> argues that any solution requires a sea-change in Nairobi, a city of more than 3.5 million people where recycling is non-existent, or ad hoc. \"Residents of Nairobi must take responsibility for their waste \u2026 a key step is to demand urgent delivery of a safe and comprehensive waste management system, with a functional sanitary landfill,\" the report says.</p> <p>Concern and its co-authors urge the government to use modern technology to isolate toxic waste in Dandora, and identify a site to build a sanitary landfill.</p> <p>Webootsa stresses that any solution must take into account the thousands working as scavengers. \"They don't need the dump. They need the job,\" he says. \"They don't need the rubbish. They will be happy to have a clean environment, they will be happy to breathe clean air, and of course, there has to be a proper livelihood.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Pen\u00e9lope Cruz was shooting Twice Born \u2013 in which she plays an unhappily infertile academic \u2013 she was still breastfeeding her own young son. For some scenes, her character shares the screen with a rolling cast of newborns, swapped once they grew too big.</p> <p>\"Some of these babies were only a week old. And so they were smelling me and that made them want to eat. But I was playing a woman who couldn't feed because she hadn't given birth! That created a very strange but alive dynamic between me and those babies. You cannot learn something like that. And this film is full of moments that could not be planned.\"</p> <p>Cruz leans forward, black trousers tapering to huge nude stilettos. She looks polished and glossy as a stag beetle; a stag beetle who's wearing a crocheted cardie and miming batting babies from her breasts.</p> <p>This film is Twice Born, an epic, operatic soap partly set during the Bosnian war, which premiered at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/sep/10/toronto-2012-end-watch-thanks-sharing\" title=\"\">Toronto film festival</a>. Cruz plays Gemma, an Italian who returns to Sarajevo in the present day with her 16-year-old son, Pietro. They're in town so she can tell him more about his father, a dead American photographer called Diego (Emile Hirsch), with whom she lived in the city years before. Through flashbacks, we realise Gemma isn't actually Pietro's mother, and Diego's copybook might be more blotted than family legend records.</p> <p>\"I think this movie is homage to all women, a homage to motherhood,\" she says in husky, heavily accented English. It's testimony to her work ethic \u2013 and accent coach \u2013 that she's one of the few foreign-language female actors able to open a movie in the States, who can flirtily jostle for top-billing with Johnny Depp (<a href=\"http://www.filmofilia.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/pirates_4_final.jpg\" title=\"\">Pirates of the Carribean 4</a>) and Nicolas Cage (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mandolinfilm1.jpg\" title=\"\">Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a>). She pauses, sucks on her iced coffee, and continues. \"It's a homage to that relationship of mother and child.\" Having her own, Leo, with the actor Javier Bardem, amped up her empathy. \"A woman that doesn't want children obviously can be happy without children. But one that wants to have children that much ... it's very difficult for her to be happy. Of course I understood all that before I became a mother. But after you give birth you understand in a much deeper way what Gemma was missing.\" So it intensified her pity? \"The opposite. Just the understanding. This is what she wanted and what she can't have.\"</p> <p>Twice Born is based on the bestseller by <a href=\"http://margaretmazzantini.com/\" title=\"\">Margaret Mazzantini</a> \u2013 a European book club staple and a heady holiday read. Mazzantini also wrote the erotic thriller Don't Move, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/105021/don.t.move\" title=\"\">starred Cruz in the 2004 film version</a> as an Albanian bartender who is raped by a wealthy surgeon, and then falls in love with him. The co-star and director of that film was Mazzantini's husband, Sergio Castellitto; he also directed Twice Born, and plays Gemma's present-day army husband and the film's real hero (great with babies, looks lovely in uniform).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376859\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347975888117/Twice-Born-008.jpg\" alt=\"Twice Born\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'A padlock of flesh' \u2026 Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Emile Hirsch in Twice Born </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruz lapped up both books. \"Mazzantini is one of my favourite writers for she talks about things the way women are. It's painful to read but at the same time it's really encouraging and raw; the way it is.\" In what way encouraging? \"You can be reading something by her and weeping but also feeling really strong. Sometimes it is dark and painful, but you always turn the page with a feeling that to fight is still worth it. Her writing makes you feel you should keep going.\"</p> <p>Both novel and film are remarkably frank about the reasons some women want children. Gemma is fuelled most by a desire to replicate her partner; at one point she says she longs to see a smaller version of his feet pattering in front of her. As she admits to a psychologist, played by Jane Birkin, who is assessing the couple as potential adoptive parents: \"I want a child to tie this man to me.\"</p> <p>\"For me,\" says Cruz, \"that's one of the most important lines in the book. She says: 'I want a padlock of flesh.' When I read the book I highlighted that line. That really describes who Gemma is. She's really honest. She wants to become a mother because she wants to experience that but also because she doesn't want to lose that man. She feels defective.\"</p> <p>Such candour seems rare. \"Yes! Really refreshing! But Gemma doesn't have a problem showing her insecurities. She even says to Diego that he should go and find somebody with good ovaries.\"</p> <p>Cruz hasn't shot a lot since her son's birth. \"More and more I try to be more picky with my selection. I am now able to choose the work I do, which I don't take for granted.\" She has chosen to re-team with Woody Allen, as a helpful prostitute in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149157/to-rome-with-love\" title=\"\">To Rome With Love</a>, and has just finished filming I'm So Excited, Pedro Almod\u00f3var's return to comedy. And she's now working on Ridley Scott's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/20/penelope-cruz-join-bardem-counselor\" title=\"\">The Counselor</a>.</p> <p>They are all obvious nods: Almod\u00f3var is the mentor/soulmate who's cast her in a fleet of bespoke vehicles since Live Flesh in 1997. It has been a mutually beneficial relationship: with films such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79653/all.about.my.mother\" title=\"\">All About My Mother</a>, Volver and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/129975/broken-embraces\" title=\"\">Broken Embraces</a>, he has cemented her celebrity while she has widened his appeal. Cruz is warm enough to sand down the Almod\u00f3varian excesses that can prove too spiky for some. Her genius lies in humanising camp and, on the flipside, making the mainstream sensual. Allen cast her in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126605/vicky.cristina.barcelona\" title=\"\">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a> (2008) without audition, after seeing her in Volver. It won her an Oscar (and rekindled her relationship with Bardem). The Counselor co-stars Bardem, her now-husband, as well as Brad Pitt and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-fassbender\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender</a>.</p> <p>Cruz's decision to commit to Twice Born is less immediately obvious and, maybe, more revealing. For a start, there's her loyalty to Castellitto and Mazzantini; Twice Born is very much a family affair \u2013 their son, Pietro, plays Pietro, while Cruz's brother, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2480990/\" title=\"\">Eduardo</a>, provides the soundtrack. He too is in Toronto giving interviews, and seeing brother and sister together is curious. Eduardo, a composer (and ex of Eva Longoria), is a buffed hunk with elaborate tattoos and blingy earring. Twice Born may have gritty bits and its feet in Greek mythology, but it's also a pretty naked pageturner.</p> <p>Plus, Gemma is a transitional role, which recalls Cruz's youth in flashback (she can still pass as a 22-year-old) then ages her with badgery hair and muted makeup to her late 40s. She is much more the everywoman than in her usual roles. Gemma has neither the vivacity nor the mystery of her roles for Almod\u00f3var, nor the flat-out battiness of her work with Allen.</p> <p>\"When we did Don't Move that character was really borderline. There cannot be fear or concern about looking ugly. This character was very different; emotionally, you had to be nearer the truth. She goes through so much, so in order to get all the colours of that journey you have to be able to try everything and not be afraid of the result.\"</p> <p>In the flesh, Cruz is friendly, thoughtful and smoothly beautiful, but her luminosity seems purposefully dimmed. At 38, you suspect she has wearied of the charm offensive and doesn't mind hopping on the back-burner in the service of frying bigger fish. She is an eager cheerleader for Castellitto's manifesto for the film: to examine why the world is so violent, and to tub-thump for pacifism.</p> <p>\"We need to be reminded about things that happened not so long ago in places not far away. I cannot go to this movie without thinking about what is happening in Syria. I'm always depressed that it doesn't occupy more space in the newspapers. That should be the main story instead of elections. So many children are dying every day. It's the same with so many areas in Africa that are in disastrous situations. They last so long, then they are forgotten, and that makes it worse.\"</p> <p>So what is her theory? Why is there so much violence? Cruz's brow furrows lightly. \"There is a lot of confusion and this is not new. By now we should learn from our mistakes, but we don't. I don't think a movie can solve a problem like that. Unfortunately it doesn't have that power. But it can inspire a question.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Prince of Wales lobbies government ministers. He writes letters on all sorts of subjects, from architecture to fisheries policy, but we've never been allowed to know the details. That's why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/prince-charles-letters-ministers-judges\" title=\"\">today's ruling that the government has to disclose the prince's confidential letters to government ministers</a> is so significant. It means we're finally getting a little closer to finding out what kind of demands the wholly unaccountable heir to the throne makes on elected politicians.</p> <p>But don't hold your breath: the government has a month to decide whether to appeal against the ruling by a freedom of information tribunal. Ministers have been fighting the case for seven years, ever since the Guardian lodged a FoI request for letters written over a seven-month period in 2004 and 2005. Unless ministers concede defeat in the next four weeks, their next port of call is likely to be the high court.</p> <p>Even if this batch of letters is published, ministers last year imposed a blanket ban on the prince's correspondence being disclosed in the future, even if publication is in the public interest. You'd almost think they've got something to hide \u2013 something, for instance, like the prince trying to influence government policy. In fact, thanks to the information commissioner, we already know that he's routinely consulted on legislation which might affect the Duchy of Cornwall.</p> <p>Documents released earlier this year show that the then fisheries minister, Huw Irranca-Davies, wrote to the prince's private secretary in 2008 enclosing two copies of a draft marine and coastal access bill. He highlighted clauses which would require the prince's consent and got a response a couple of months later, informing him that \"the Prince of Wales is content with the bill\". This archaic formula is troubling in a democracy \u2013 many of us might not be \"content\" with proposed legislation but we don't have a veto over it \u2013 but it isn't even as if the prince confines his correspondence with ministers to Duchy matters. In 2009, it was revealed that he had written to ministers in eight government departments over a three-year period.</p> <p>The tribunal which ruled in favour of disclosure heard that the prince has lobbied on \"holistic\" medicine, genetically modified crops, cuts in the armed forces, architecture and agricultural policy. It doesn't take much ingenuity to guess his views on any of these subjects, which are doubtless typical of a socially conservative landowner with a prejudice against science. In their 126-page ruling, the three judges conceded that Charles's activities \"are not neutral and in a number of respects have been controversial\".</p> <p>But the point isn't the prince's political views, reactionary though they may be. It's that he habitually abuses his position by lobbying ministers at all; I've heard from former ministers who were astonished by the speed with which their first missive from Charles arrived, opening with the phrase: \"It really is appalling\". And Charles doesn't write in the guise of an ordinary citizen, politely drawing attention to a matter of concern. He knows that his letters go \"to the top of the pile\" and are \"treated with great reverence\" in the words of Paul Richards, a Labour special adviser.</p> <p>This is a delicate moment for the monarchy. The jubilee celebrations were intended to showcase the Prince of Wales, whose succession to the throne is likely to create all sorts of problems for the institution. Charles has waited decades to become King, he doesn't have the prospect of a long reign and he is a meddler by nature. Buckingham Palace is trying to prepare the country for the reign of Charles III and the last thing it wants is the publication of a cache of embarrassing correspondence with ministers. In the modern world, political interference is more damning than any number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/24/prince-charles-letters-ebay\" title=\"\">indiscreet love letters</a>.</p>",

  "<p>The flamboyant Chinese police chief whose dash to a US consulate triggered the downfall of politician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bo-xilai\" title=\"\">Bo Xilai</a> appears on course to escape the death penalty, after the court trying him credited him with confessing and giving important evidence against others.</p> <p>Wang Lijun received 3m yuan (nearly \u00a3300,000) or more in bribes, according to a statement released by Chengdu intermediate people's court in south-west China shortly after his trial concluded on Tuesday. He is also accused of defection, \"bending the law to selfish ends\" and abuse of power.</p> <p>The statement described how Wang had been privy to state secrets due to his position and had left his post in Chongqing while on duty and defected to a foreign consulate \u2013 the US mission in Chengdu.</p> <p>There, he told diplomats that he believed Bo's wife Gu had murdered British businessman Neil Heywood. She was handed a suspended death sentence last month. \"Wang knew perfectly well that Bogu [SIC] Kailai was under serious suspicion of intentional homicide, but he deliberately covered up for her so that Bogu Kailai would not be held legally responsible \u2026 The circumstances are especially serious,\" said the statement.</p> <p>The document, read out by spokesman Yang Yuquan, also said Wang had used surveillance technology \"against many people on multiple occasions, either without the approval of authorities or by forging approval documents\".</p> <p>But it also added that prosecutors acknowledged a string of extenuating circumstances that should result in a lighter sentence. Wang ordered his subordinates to collect and preserve evidence of the murder case, reported Gu's possible involvement to authorities, provided evidence and willingly aided the reinvestigation.</p> <p>He turned himself in, in other words, agreed to leave the US consulate, and confessed and performed \"major meritorious services\" by exposing serious offences committed by others and playing a key part in the investigation.</p> <p>While the amount of bribes Wang accepted appeared almost modest when compared with the startling sums revealed in other recent corruption cases, it might under normal circumstances be enough to warrant the death penalty because the legal threshold was low, said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based expert on the Chinese criminal justice system.</p> <p>\"There are significant grounds for lenience, but we have to figure out what we mean by lenience. It's clear, I think, that he won't be put to death and quite likely, I think, that he won't be given a suspended death sentence. Could he still get a life sentence? I think there's a chance of that. Under the circumstances, that might be considered lenient,\" he added.</p> <p>Video released by China's state broadcaster showed the 52-year-old Wang looking calm and apparently well as he sat in the courtroom, wearing a white shirt and dark trousers, with a few dozen people behind him.</p> <p>He was seen reading documents and speaking briefly. The court statement described Wang as emotionally stable and in good health. The judgment will be delivered on an unspecified date, but there is little doubt of the verdict.</p> <p>Criminal cases almost always end in conviction in China and state news agency Xinhua described evidence against him as \"concrete and abundant\" when it announced his indictment.</p> <p>The case began unexpectedly on Monday, with a hearing held behind closed doors because it touched on state secrets.</p> <p>Xinhua described Tuesday's hearing as an \"open trial\", although it took place under tight security and with only carefully selected people present.</p> <p>Scores of uniformed and plainclothes officers surrounded the taped-off courthouse, with at least 10 photographing and filming journalists. Wang Yuncai \u2013 no relation of her client, and one of two defence representatives \u2013 said the former police chief's relatives had been in court. She declined to comment on whether he had made a statement.</p> <p>The court statement said Wang did not challenge the charges but his lawyer put forward mitigating circumstances. The conclusion of the trial will take China closer to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\" title=\"\">resolving the political upheaval that resulted from Wang's decision to go to US officials</a> \u2013 particularly important given the impending transition of power to younger leaders.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether authorities will also try Bo, who has been under investigation by the party for unspecified disciplinary violations since April. Some analysts believe those at the top of the party are reluctant to do so because it would shed such an unflattering light on senior leaders and might stir up Bo's supporters. Others think that indicting Wang for offences related to his duties indicates they are preparing the way for a criminal trial of his boss.</p> <h2>Court security<br></h2> <p>The security operation mounted at Wang Lijun's trial appeared at least as intense as that deployed at Gu Kailai's in Hefei. Authorities will not have been concerned that the former police chief planned another sudden dash, like the flight that brought him to Chengdu in the first place.</p> <p>The efforts were directed at keeping people away from the courthouse, not inside it. Unlike the recently built Hefei facility, the Chengdu intermediate people's court is in a busy neighbourhood and surrounded by ordinary businesses, making it harder for officials to monitor.</p> <p>Uniformed police taped off and guarded the imposing grey stone building and scores of plainclothes officers surrounded it; mostly men, with a handful of fashionably clad young women. At least 10 unidentified individuals were taking pictures and video footage of foreign journalists and other people on the street, some while apparently pretending to be on the phone or surfing the net, and others just openly using cameras. They appeared less keen to have their own photographs taken.</p> <p>While Xinhua described the hearing as an \"open session\" and stressed that \"Wang's family and relatives, journalists, deputies to the people's congress, political advisers, as well as ordinary citizens\" heard the trial, foreign media were not allowed to register for places. It appears the state broadcaster, CCTV, and official news agency, Xinhua, were the only media inside.</p> <p>Foreign journalists were allowed to film the front of the court, but not the back entrance, where most people and vehicles arrived. A subsequent press briefing on proceedings in court was short and no questions were permitted. But its very existence was unusual, demonstrating how aware Chinese authorities are of the extraordinary global impact of a story that has shaken its domestic political world.</p>",

  "<p>There are three inducements of support that Americans are powerless against: the promise of whiter teeth, the suggestion of no-diet weight loss and the cause of justice.</p> <p>Political campaigns tend to couch their appeals in terms of the last, though parts of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/paul-ryan-tax-loopholes_n_1890790.html\">Romney-Ryan economic pitch</a> could be described as the second. In today's truly divisive debates, both parties have usually engineered a rhetorical claim to the side of fairness: gay rights advocates propelled themselves forward when they began to argue for \"marriage equality\" against the outdated complaint of \"special rights\".</p> <p>Americans rankle at unearned privileges as much as they rally, in the main, to equality. Hence the widespread, enthusiastic support of voter ID laws (they <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-concerns-about-voter-fraud-spur-broad-support-for-voter-id-laws/2012/08/11/40db3aba-e2fb-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story.html\">poll</a> with about 75% in favor) makes total sense if you see the laws exactly the way their authors and promoters talk about them \u2013 as barriers to voter fraud. After all, voter fraud is when criminals unfairly manipulate voting, the most basic expression of fairness available in a democracy.</p> <p>Asking Americans if they support measures against voter fraud is like asking if they support measures against adults suiting up for Little League baseball. The problem is that there are probably more cheaters in baseball than voting: a recent analysis found cases of alleged voter fraud running about one for every 16,000 voters. What's more, voter ID laws work in such a way that a no-adults-in-Little-League equivalent would ban not just grownups from playing, but also anyone who looked adult-<em>ish</em> and didn't show up for practice with documentary evidence of minor status.</p> <p>The metaphor breaks down pretty quickly, however, and not just because a tall-person-free Little League might wind up still being a decent pastime for those involved (the tall people could play elsewhere). In real-life democracy, there is no farm team. You either get to play or you don't. What's more \u2013 as American as playing baseball is \u2013 it's not <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/timelines/timeline-voting-rights-act\">a legal right</a>.</p> <p>The pre-eminence of voting as a right, and not a privilege, is where the facile arguments that make voter ID laws sound so commonsensical falter as well: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"You have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed \u2026 you have to show a picture ID to set foot on an airplane.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So went South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's argument at the <a href=\"http://m.npr.org/news/U.S./160884806\">Republican convention</a>. So why not to vote? Somehow, this is not a line of reasoning conservatives favor when it comes to buying a gun, but no matter! Let's agree that the risks of someone with bad intentions buying Sudafed, or getting on a plane are bad enough that it makes sense to err on the side of caution. The ID-less people who want to buy Sudafed just to treat a head cold, or who are badly organized travelers, do not suffer overmuch \u2013 and have other options.</p> <p>By contrast, those with good intentions and blameless records who are barred from legally casting a ballot because they lack ID are not just being inconvenienced; they are being denied the right that defines democracy. Voting is so important to democracy's functioning as an equalizing force that it is the first thing those in power deny the minority and the last thing they grant. Campaigns for voter ID laws may have multiplied dramatically in recent years, but they are far from new. They are simply an innovation in a decades-long campaign to deny those <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/voter-id-laws minorities_n_1878893.html\">at the margins</a> \u2013 blacks, the poor, the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-schleifer/disabled-voting rights_b_1853234.html\">disabled</a> \u2013 the right to representation.</p> <p>As Republicans' economic agenda pushes us further toward a winner-take-all society, their state-level legislative voter ID agenda shows an impulse to eliminate other players entirely.</p> <p>As personal and private as voting is, the forces at work to deny the franchise have been subsumed by larger, technocratic forces. The biggest threat to voting rights posed by activists such as \"<a href=\"http://www.truethevote.org/\">True the Vote</a>\" \u2013 a conservative outfit claiming to ferret out voter fraud \u2013 is not intimidation at the polls <em>or</em> requiring voter ID: it's computer-driven, human-assisted purges of voter rolls, often brought about by private citizens \"alerting\" local governments to possible fraud, but also instigated by Republican officials.</p> <p>Called \"caging\", this technique often relies on using returned mail as proof that the voter has registered illegally (under a false address) \u2013 no matter if the voter has moved but retains residency in the state. This method produces very favorable results in areas with high foreclosure rates, like \u2026 well, everywhere, really. The best-known example of caging is from 2000 in Florida, with an attempt to clear the voter rolls of felons using a computerized list that wound up <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/florida-gop-takes-voter-supression-to-a-brazen-new-extreme-20120530\">striking</a> 12,000 eligible citizens. </p> <p>There are no witnesses to these purges, no ugly footage to brandish on the evening news. What's more, there is not an equal and opposing force: no computer program that can create a list of people who <em>should</em> be allowed to vote. The <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/press-release/strong-enforcement-voter-protections-needed-colorado-stop-%E2%80%9Cbullies-ballot-box%E2%80%9D\">Common Cause/Demos paper last week</a> that spurred some the current coverage of voter ID makes suggestions for leveling the playing field, such as making challenges to voter registration as individuated as possible (requiring a signed affidavit for each challenge, for instance). </p> <p>In the end, though, once challenged, the only way for a would-be voter to push back is by a literal act of personal integrity: showing up at the county registrar's office or hearing, usually. While I can imagine the satisfaction of telling a conservative activist who has challenged my rights to \"say that to my face\", the fact is that if someone has been challenged because he or she has no driver's license or is struggling with permanent housing, they may not even find out they've been challenged.</p> <p>Many of the arguments for voter ID laws and other anti-fraud measures make sense in the abstract: yes, voter fraud is bad! But nothing about voting is abstract. It is an inherently physical act; it is about what country one chooses to call home. In theoretical terms, psychologists still puzzle over why people vote at all. It would be more logical, more immediately self-serving to not vote. Voting takes time and effort and, in the grand scheme of things, one vote doesn't matter. Unless it's yours. </p> <p>Ultimately, people vote so that they can continue to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Do you know what my favourite gun is at the moment? The Jakob Ornery Law. It's a pistol holding nine rounds with what looks like a bread knife soldered to the underside of its slender barrel. The name may sound a little silly, but I tell you, it's a work of art.</p> <p>This is a new one for me, as I don't usually take to pistols in shooter games. They aren't as pleasing either sonically or physically to use as assault rifles or shotguns and they usually don't cause as much damage. Not so, the Ornery Law. Pull the trigger on this baby and you're rewarded with a satisfying crack, the control pad kicks in your hands and the target in front of you takes 293 points of damage. At close range, this unassuming little handgun is capable of doling out more pain than a couple of the shotguns I have in my possession.</p> <p>Over longer range, though, it's fairly useless, which is why I have the Jakob Skookum Muckamuck sniper rife. This is a sleek, beautiful instrument of death capable of putting 245 points of damage into targets at a fair distance. Unless, of course, you score a critical hit and then you're looking at 1,345 points of damage; in most instances, the target's head simply goes away.</p> <p>Yes, it could be said that Jakob is my favourite weapons manufacturer on Pandora. Not only do their guns bring the pain, as it were, but they all have a classic, wild-west-meets-steampunk look to them. I prefer them to, say, the rockabilly blasters made by Bandit, or the hi-tech, yet soulless-looking stock of Hyperion. And don't get me started on Tediore; their guns may be effective, but their garish day-glo colours mark them out as the sort of guns you'd take to a rave. Nope, I'm a Jakob man, through and through.</p> <p>The fact that I've spent four paragraphs talking about my favourite weapons in Borderlands 2 should give you some sense of the loving care that inhabits every pixel of this title. A rudimentary appraisal of the game is that Gearbox is simply super-sizing their 2009 sleeper-hit, giving players more \u2013 well, a super-tanker-load more \u2013 of guns to shoot, enemies to kill and trinkets to pick up. There's a kernel of truth to that, sure, but the game's most immediate impact is made by Gearbox fleshing out the overall character of the universe they created in the first Borderlands.</p> <p>The world of Borderlands 2 is a place where irreverent space-western sci-fi collides with trailer-park horrorshow hostility and all of it is shot through with rambunctious playground humour. The planet of Pandora is equal parts Firefly and Mad Max, with all of the dialogue and plotting taken care of by the creators of South Park.</p> <p>Gearbox paints in broad brushstrokes, sure, but they don't rely on cardboard cut-out characters or run-of-the-mill mission structure. For example, the fact that Pandora's resident big-game hunter sports a monocle and a plummy British accent shouldn't surprise anyone, but if you could predict this character would send you on a mission that involves sifting through mounds of alien dung for voice recorders, you're a more visionary gamer than I.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396299262\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347903682472/Borderlands-2-2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Borderlands 2 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borderlands 2 Review Screenshot.jpg</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's a plot of sorts, but it's mainly used as a framework to hang a ton of gun battles and looting opportunities off. As the game begins, Pandora is in the grip of a war between an entity known at the Hyperion Corporation and a rag-tag band of prospectors. Hyperion's man on the ground is a sneering bucket of contempt and hair grease known only as Handsome Jack, who has taken it upon himself to wipe any non-Hyperion personnel \u2013 including the player \u2013 off the face of Pandora. In swift succession, the player finds themselves joining up with a rebel movement \u2013 led by the four characters from the original game \u2013 who want to stop Jack from unleashing some sort of unstoppable weapon upon the planet's inhabitants. Hilarity ensues.</p> <p>Like the first Borderlands, players have a choice of four character classes to pick from. There's Salvador, the Gunzerker, a raging slab of muscle and testosterone whose special powers is dual-wielding weapons. There's Maya, the Siren, who is able to project a forcefield around enemies and haul them out of cover. There's Axton, the Commando, who can deploy a machinegun turret with a barrel that can swivel in a 360 degree arch. Finally, there's Zero, The Number (or assassin), whose powers involve turning invisible in order to slide up close to enemies and then dismembering them with a katana.</p> <p>Essentially, Zero, Axton, Maya and Salavador are steroid-enhanced versions of the four characters (Mordecai, Roland, Lilith and Brick) from the first Borderlands, and as before they all have a set of three talent trees. Each time the player levels up, they're assigned a point to spend as they wish, and since it's fairly impossible to fill up all three talent trees before the game's level cap of 50, it pays to specialise.</p> <p>Talents start off as fairly rudimentary \u2013 more health, more shields, more gun damage and the like \u2013 but at high levels, they turn the player into a vicious two-legged wrecking ball. At high levels, for example, Salvador's dual-wielding expands to encompass any sort of weapon he can get his hands on, so if you fancy taking aim at a target with two massive rocket launchers, have at it.</p> <p>Zero has the ability to tag critical points on targets on his HUD, which makes his sniper shots and blade swipes incredibly lethal. Axton becomes able to deploy his turret on any surface \u2013 wall, roof, you name it \u2013 while Maya can turn entire gangs of enemies against each other.</p> <p>Alongside their skills, the player also has a list of Badass Challenges to complete \u2013 such as scoring headshots or blowing enemies up \u2014 which are, roughly put, Gearbox's way of encouraging players to do as much and shoot as much as humanly possible in the game. This Badassery rewards players with Badass tokens they can spend on improving abilities they'll use all the time, such as reducing gun-recoil, gun damage, health levels and shield recharge rates. The amount each Badass token improves a skill by is tiny, so players who want to beef their character up better load up on guns and bring some friends.</p> <p>Speaking of friends, like its predecessor, Borderlands 2 supports four-player co-op and the more players who join the party, the tougher Pandora's collection of robots, alien creatures and hockey-mask-wearing nutjobs become. Friends don't have to pick different classes to each other \u2013 especially if they've specialised differently \u2013 but it's arguably more fun if you do. A team of Axtons with missile-flinging turrets can do a ton of damage, but a Gunzerker's ability to flip off enemies and act as a decoy can provide the rest of his squad with a veritable turkey shoot.</p> <p>It's also worth noting that it's best to play this game only with players who you trust to work as a team, as there's no mechanic to stop greedy so-and-so's hovering up all the best loot and cash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396299263\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347948756227/Borderlands-2-004.jpg\" alt=\"Borderlands 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Borderlands 2 Photograph: Ashley Rochelle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Rochelle/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, one of the main reasons to play Borderlands 2 \u2013 aside from the compulsive nature of its loot drops \u2013 is the insane arsenal available to the player. Guns here come in all shapes, sizes and colours. Some shoot electrically charged bullets. Some fire incendiary rounds or bullets filled with corrosive acid. Some transform into a grenade when you reload them. Still more come loaded with AI pacifist chips that plead with the player not to kill anyone with them.</p> <p>Each target the player shoots and each container the player opens has the potential of dropping yet another weird and whacky firearm, the stats of which they can immediately check against those of the weapon they're carrying in their hands. Since backpack space is limited, occasionally players are forced to toss out items they aren't using to make room for a shiny new toy. Pack rats, you've been warned.</p> <p>There are also a ton of mods, class augmentations, grenade mods and shields in the game. Some are fairly standard, while others are as weird as the game's weaponry. How about a shield mod that tosses out shield recharge batteries if the player takes too much damage? Or how about a grenade mod that splits grenades into bouncing bettys that produce multiple explosions? My personal favourite, for the moment at least, is a mod that spews acid from grenades that eats through flesh and metal \u2013 particularly handy against robotic or shield-carrying foes.</p> <p>If the size of the game's arsenal sounds impressive, you should get a load of its environment. To put it bluntly, Pandora feels even bigger and more varied than it did in the first Borderlands. Whether players are ploughing through icy tundra, driving across a desert, picking their way through a goop-filled cavern or blasting through a gang's blood-daubed hideout, Borderlands 2 feels consistently fresh. This is a world to lose yourself in \u2013 and thanks to the addictive quality of the game's loot-drops, it's likely many players will do just that. It's not just the size and scope of the place that is likely to seduce them, however, it's the fact that this time round, Pandora feels more like an actual place than a virtual battleground, thanks to Gearbox's attention to detail in this game.</p> <p>I mean, when was the last time you cared about the name of any gun manufacturer in any shooter you played recently? Listen, I've played the heck out of the COD: MW titles, and I've used a TAR-21 more times than I care to mention, but I couldn't tell you who manufactured it (not without looking it up, at any rate). The gun-makers in Borderlands 2 don't even exist, for goodness sake, and I'm already brand-loyal to one of them. That would be Jakob, who proffer the most stylish firearms in the galaxy. If you want to take down a Badass Spiderant Burner, be a Gentleman about it, and use Jakob ordnance.

  "<p>For the past few months, <a href=\"http://conservationdrones.org/\" title=\"\">drones</a> have been flying over the tropical forests of south-east Asia to map endangered species. A dozen of these unmanned aircraft, fitted with a video camera and an autopilot, have been deployed and will be joined by several more.</p> <p>The planes are designed by Lian Pin Koh, a specialist in applied ecology and conservation at the <a href=\"http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN\" title=\"\">Science and Technology University</a> in Zurich, and Serge Wich, a biologist from <a href=\"http://www.liv.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Liverpool University</a>. The project started in 2011 during a study of deforestation in Indonesia, on which Wich headed a programme to protect Sumatran orangutans.

The <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/\" title=\"\">United Nations environment programme</a> estimates that 98% of these forests will have vanished within 10 years.</p> <p>\"Monitoring is difficult in a tropical environment because cloud cover makes it impossible to use satellite imagery. Remote-controlled model planes are affordable and seem to be a good way of speeding up our research,\" the two scientists explain. Conventional observation missions are expensive: \"$250,000 for a two-year study,\" Koh adds.</p> <p>A fully configured drone costs $2,000: $320 for a scale model manufactured in China using expanded polyolefin foam, which is sufficiently elastic to withstand shocks; slightly less for the flight control software developed in the United States; and the rest for stabilisers and batteries, imported from Europe, and, of course, the camera.</p> <p>The drones have a range of 20-25km (about 20 minutes' flight) and are GPS-guided, following a route established on computer. Newer prototypes \"will travel twice as far and photograph about 100 hectares on each mission,\" Wich and Koh explain. Partly funded by the National Geographic Foundation and the <a href=\"http://www.orangutan.com\" title=\"\">Orangutan Conservancy research centre</a>, the project has received almost $19,000 in subsidies.</p> <p>In February a drone made a successful test flight at Aras Napal in Sumatra.

The various regions of the continent are very different.</p> <p>Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt have their own sets of problems where the power of Islam is strong. The petroleum-rich states of Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria have the problems of western exploitation of their oil resources, associated corruption and human rights violations. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a long history of exploitation of resources by foreigners due to a weak government and other problems. South Africa is totally different in its attempts to escape their apartheid history. All of these states have serious problems with inequality.</p> <p>Birrell notes the relative success stories of Ghana, Ethiopia and Mozambique. He says the west remains locked into stale narratives of Africa. His article does nothing to alleviate this misinformation. The differences within the continent require an understanding of the specific cultures, politics and historical differences for each region and nation.</p> <p>An important aspect of certain African states is the history and the continuation of exploitation of their resources. One should remember those Africans who have been assassinated or executed, probably with western complicity, for advocating the use of their resources for the benefit of their people. They include Am\u00edlcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau, Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso; and the Congolese Patrice Lumumba. <br><strong>Don Kerr </strong><br>Collingwood, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Reducing Kenya fatalities</strong></h2> <p>Whilst agreeing with most of Clar Ni Chonghaile's article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/08/kenyan-dangerous-drivers-twitter-roads\" title=\"\">about Kenyan road deaths</a> (31 August), I think two key issues have been overlooked.</p> <p>First, the poor infrastructure and maintenance of the roads. Drivers have to avoid potholes and long stretches of road with little or no tarmac. Second is the over-reliance on lorries to transport goods, especially from Mombasa to Nairobi and beyond to Uganda.</p> <p>These issues need to be addressed by the government through a road repair programme and upgrading the railway system.

  "<p>Brunei and the US will this month start delivering the first of a series of intensive 11-week English-language courses for teacher trainers and government officials in southeast Asia, where consolidated language skills are expected to help unify the region before it becomes a single economic zone in 2015.</p> <p>The courses are part of a five-year, $25m Brunei-US English Language Enrichment Project for the <a href=\"http://www.aseansec.org/\" title=\"\">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> (Asean), aimed at linguistically unifying the 10 members \u2013 all of which speak their own languages \u2013 and strengthening diplomatic, educational and teaching opportunities across the region.</p> <p>Some 70 teacher trainers and government officials will take part in the programme, which is funded entirely by the Brunei government and run jointly by the <a href=\"http://www.ubd.edu.bn/\" title=\"\">University of Brunei Darussalam</a> (UBD) and the Honolulu-based <a href=\"http://www.eastwestcenter.org/\" title=\"\">East-West Centre</a>. Courses begin with a seven-week module in English proficiency at UBD and continue in Hawaii with a four-week course in culture and leadership, says Terance Bigalke, director of education at the East-West Centre.</p> <p>\"The idea of the English-language proficiency approach is to prepare diplomats and officials for being able to use language effectively in the work that they do,\" Bigalke says. \"For the teacher trainers, the modules deal with education materials and methods of teaching. For the diplomats there are specific courses on leadership and a range of regional issues which we're still ironing out, but which will cover environmental, population health and international relations challenges.\"</p> <p>Focusing on communication skills in speaking and writing, and using up-to-date information technology, the learners are expected to graduate from the programme with a wider skill set that will enhance dealings with fellow Asean members on the issues that face the region collectively.</p> <p>They will also undergo a specialised module on the cultures and peoples of Asean, Bigalke adds, to promote harmony in a region where past disagreements have arisen over minority groups such as Burma's Muslim community and control of the South China Sea.</p> <p>While English was chosen as the official lingua franca of Asean in 2009, its adaptation has proved particularly challenging for certain member states \u2013 notably Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia \u2013 that don't have a history of English language usage and which have therefore been targeted by officials at UBD as \"most in need\". Others have launched their own English language programmes such as Thailand, where an ambitious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/feb/14/thailand-speak-english-campaign\" title=\"\">English Speaking Year Project</a> aims to teach conversational skills to some 14 million students.</p> <p>The choice of English in a linguistically diverse region is a strategic one, says US-Brunei project executive Dr Salbrina Sharbawi: \"The dominant status of English in Asean is undisputed, and English is the language of choice in interactions between speakers of different first languages.\"</p> <p>America's tie-in to this project is of particular interest. The US government became an Asean \"dialogue partner\" in 1977 and in 2009 pledged, among other things, greater socio-economic ties with all 10 nations, a move that critics viewed as a thinly veiled attempt to weaken China's role in the region. Hillary Clinton is the only US secretary of state to have visited every member state, and her diplomatic visits have focused recently on promoting unity over the South China Sea, to which various Asean states \u2013 as well as China \u2013 lay partial or full claim.</p> <p>In a seeming attempt to provide a counter-balance to English language hegemony in the region, however, Chinese officials have in some cases attempted to drum up interest in Mandarin. One significant move has been to offer to send 1,000 Chinese teachers to Thailand, and 1,000 Thai students to China, at no cost to the Thai government.</p> <p>For the moment, however, all eyes are on the English-language prize. The US-Brunei programme will mostly involve officials and teacher trainers in their early 30s. Organisers are keen to place so-called \"English-language fellows\" in remote areas in all 10 Asean countries, where they will work in universities and schools in underprivileged locations to help expedite capacity building.</p> <p>As it expands, the programme will look to recruit qualified US and Bruneian English-language teachers to work at higher-education institutions across Asean. A forum on English education for Asean integration and an online resource for teacher trainers are also planned for the near future, Bigalke says.</p> <p>\"This will all take quite a few years to effectively develop, but it will be really engaging and people will learn a lot.\"</p>",
  "<p>Days before US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos were due to launch a partnership, to promote US culture and provide English lessons to young learners around the world via 35,000 Kindle e-readers, the event was quietly cancelled.</p> <p>The proposed partnership with Amazon to develop the Kindle Mobile Learning Initiative was officially terminated on 15 August. The cancellation notice stated that the <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/\" title=\"\">state department</a> \"intends to conduct additional market research and re-examine its requirements for this programme\".</p> <p>The U-turn was an embarrassment for the state department, which spends close to $40m a year on spreading English language skills around the world. But it is also a tacit acknowledgement that e-readers may not be a quick fix for raising learning achievement and that more needs to be done to learn how to exploit them effectively.</p> <p>The reasons behind the withdrawal remain unclear. One factor may have been the US's <a href=\"http://www.nfb.org/\" title=\"\">National Federation of the Blind</a>'s (NFB) claim that Kindles are not fully accessible to the visually impaired and therefore the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/97451466/Mauer2clinton-Nfb\" title=\"\">project was illegal</a>. \"This agreement would violate US law regarding access to information by the blind,\" NFB president Marc Maurer said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the apparent commitment to conduct further research has been welcomed by many education experts. Mobile learning has a relatively short history, but there is much to learn from both the successes and failures of early projects.</p> <p>The agreement with Amazon would have involved a purchase of 35,000 Kindles over five years, with pre-loaded content and access to further material online. The anticipated value of the contract was $16.5m with the state department aiming to: \"Create a global e-reader programme that introduces aspects of US society and culture directly to young people, students, and international audiences in new ways and expands English language learning opportunities worldwide.\"</p> <p>While Amazon's input into the project was clearly outlined in <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=8232e06b4c4af4bb54f90e706b5e9ebc&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list&amp;=\" title=\"\">US Federal Business Opportunities</a> documentation, there appeared to have been little focus on exactly how the Kindles would be integrated into current education programmes. Yet a concentration on technology over pedagogy has become a critical factor in determining the success of English language programmes that combine ICT and traditional teaching, also known as blended learning.</p> <p>Kindles have already been used to support large-scale education projects. The nonprofit organisation <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/\" title=\"\">Worldreader</a> aims to improve literacy and language skills of school children in developing countries by providing digital libraries on Kindle devices. With current projects in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, encouraging results have been reported in evaluation studies. Worldreader is also developing its <a href=\"http://www.worldreader.org/what-we-do/our-app/\" title=\"\">Book App</a> that can be accessed on mobile phones, with further details on new funding partners for this scheme expected to be announced shortly.</p> <p>However, putting in funding and providing hardware for a blended learning project is not enough by itself. The US-based <a href=\"http://one.laptop.org/\" title=\"\">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project has distributed more than 2m low-cost laptops since 2007 to children globally, but a report by the <a href=\"http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details,3169.html?pub_id=IDB-WP-304\" title=\"\">Inter-American Development Bank</a> into OLPC in Peru sparked widespread debate when it appeared in February. It stated that, 15 months after implementation, there appeared to be no significant increase in language test score levels or the quality of teaching in classrooms. The report suggested that the amount of training that teachers received on how to use the technology with their students could have been a factor in the disappointing results.</p> <p>When large numbers of expensive and delicate electronic devices are involved, research and training on how to maintain them is key. Over 40% of the Kindles broke during Worldreader's initial pilot in Ghana. According to <a href=\"http://worldreader.org/uploads/Worldreader%20ILC%20USAID%20iREAD%20Final%20Report%20Jan-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">USAid's final evaluation report</a>: \"[the] high breakage rates were primarily a result of the device's fragile screen and vulnerability to&#xa0;dust.\" Worldreader claims that the breakage rates have been reduced to almost zero in the latest project, following the introduction of a more robust screen and better training for users on care and maintenance.</p> <p>Working on ways to ensure that the technology is valued by the students, teachers and administrators is also of crucial importance in ensuring that the devices do not end up being discarded.</p> <p>As UK-based ELT learning technologies specialist <a href=\"http://www.psa.eu.com/\" title=\"\">Pete Sharma</a> states: \"Both teachers and students need to hold positive attitudes towards technology. While many teachers are happy to incorporate digital learning, others are less so. If the teacher does not believe in the pedagogical soundness of the digital component, there is a real chance of failure.\"</p> <p>The content that is available for use via the devices must also be closely matched to the existing curriculum.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/english\" title=\"\">British Council</a>'s English projects manager David Pardoe has been working on bringing English language audio content to resource-poor schools in sub-Saharan Africa. British Council-produced podcasts and radio programmes are loaded onto solar-powered, portable devices with integrated speakers, known as <a href=\"http://lifelineenergy.org/lifeplayer.html\" title=\"\">Lifeplayers</a>. These are being distributed to rural schools in eight countries in southern Africa.</p> <p>\"A lot of people get excited when they see the device and that is good, but the initial enthusiasm can quickly be lost if it's not linked to curriculum,\" Pardoe says. \"I would say that right now, matching content is almost more important than the device, because if it's not then it's quite difficult to convince a teacher to use it in lessons.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/\" title=\"\">Unesco</a> is currently drafting policy guidelines for the development of m\u2011learning initiatives. According to its programme specialist Steve Vosloo, \"[Our] research has found that there is a dearth of policy related to mobile learning at the national level. [The guidelines will] try to fill that vacuum by helping policy makers understand the benefits and challenges related to mobile learning and to offer guidelines for creating an enabling policy environment in which mobile learning can grow.\"</p>",

St James's Palace was making no immediate comment.</p> <p>A source said of the couple: \"They welcome the injunction that's been granted. They always believed the law was broken and that they were entitled to their privacy.\"</p> <p>In granting the injunction, the French judges sided with the royal couple, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/topless-photos-shocking-breach-royal-couple\" title=\"\">whose lawyer told the court on Monday that the photos portrayed the \"profoundly intimate life of the couple\"</a> and asked: \"In what name did this magazine publish these shocking photos&#xa0;\u2026 It was certainly not in the name of information. This has no place on the cover of a magazine or even in an article in a magazine.\"</p> <p>Their lawyer had argued in court that the photographs were a breach of the French privacy laws and \"a shocking breach of their personal intimacy\".</p> <p>The legal action, while not the first taken by a member of the royal family against a newspaper or magazine, was seen as a bid to put down a marker and prevent any further invasion of the duchess's privacy.</p> <p>But one senior executive at a British celebrity magazine said: \"I think the action has been taken while the horse is already halfway round the field.\"</p> <p>On Saturday a second publication, the Irish Daily Star, published the photos, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/18/irish-daily-star-closure-recedes\" title=\"\">leading to the editor being suspended on Monday night pending the outcome of an internal investigation</a>.</p> <p>And on Monday, an Italian celebrity magazine, Chi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/17/kate-topless-photos-chi-magazine\" title=\"\">rushed out a special edition with 26 pages devoted to the candid photos of the future Queen</a>.</p> <p>When Closer published the photos on Friday, St James's Palace roundly condemned the move as a \"grotesque\" invasion of the duke and duchess's privacy \"reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales\".</p> <p>Closer's editor, Laurence Pieau, defended the decision to print the photos and said she did not think the photos were shocking or degrading.</p> <p>She said she thought the reaction had been disproportionate and that all they had tried to do was show a young couple in love.</p> <p>The pictures were taken while the duke and duchess were staying in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew.</p> <p>The couple, who are currently visiting parts of south-east Asia and the Pacific for a diamond jubilee tour, were told about the pictures just ahead of a stop at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>According to the Confederation of British Industry's year-on-year reports, companies feel they cannot get enough qualified scientists and engineers to fill their jobs. Kids at school just aren't flocking to do science A-levels and subsequent degrees in the numbers apparently needed, despite the ostensible promise of a healthy job market. The increase in A-level entrants for science subjects in recent years is encouraging, but it has still not caused numbers to recover to the levels of 20 years ago (unlike in maths where numbers have risen markedly). It is not difficult to see one of the reasons why this might be so. How can schoolchildren get a taste for what a life in science might be like? How can they find out what it is that scientists \"do\" day by day, or what it might mean to be a scientist? Or even what a trained scientist might do far removed from the lab, but where their scientific background is still crucial. And if they don't have a clue about these things, how can they make sensible choices at critical stages in their schooling about what courses and exams they should pursue?</p> <p>Careers advice at school is often inadequate due to funding and time pressures, with many schools no longer able to provide face-to-face advice. Even in those schools which do have formal careers advisers, they are likely to be unfamiliar with the range of careers associated with scientific disciplines. A depressingly low percentage of such advisers themselves possess a science degree and so have any kind of first-hand knowledge to pass on. This is not a happy situation.</p> <p>The consequence is that many schoolchildren will end up ill-informed, their knowledge of science beyond the classroom likely to be limited to either science fiction films and books or programmes they have seen on TV. CSI is probably not the best introduction to scientific practice in real life and, although series such as Brian Cox's recent blockbusters undoubtedly contain good science, the life he leads cannot be said to be typical of a physicist, let alone a scientist more generally. The idea that a scientific training is useful in all kinds of jobs beyond the obvious is also likely to be unappreciated; examples where we need more trained scientists include journalism, politics and the civil service. Even the more \"obvious\" career choices, such as engineering or computer gaming, may mean very little to students in terms of what is involved and what qualifications they need to get into such jobs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8042/7997050271_175031fb79.jpg\"> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/athenedonald/7997050271/\" title=\"phys at work2 by Athene Donald, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8042/7997050271_175031fb79.jpg\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" alt=\"phys at work2\" /></a> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see that numbers taking science and maths A-levels has steadily increased over the past decade, including this year. There is also a small but steady rise in the number of girls taking both physics and chemistry at A-level. However, the overall numbers are still too low to satisfy the needs of CBI members and for physics have not yet returned to the numbers seen at their recent peak around 10 years ago.</p> <p>How can scientific work be made more accessible to children and how can they be helped to appreciate the kinds of things scientists get up to in practice? Typical outreach events are designed to excite and intrigue the students, get them enthusiastic about the subject rather than provide them with much insight into the job market. In contrast to the standard Science Festival fare, for more than 25 years the <a href=\"http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/\">Cavendish Laboratory</a> (the University of Cambridge's Physics Department), my place of work, has opened its doors once a year to a range of exhibitors to enable them to showcase their activities, their companies and their practicing scientists as part of the annual <a href=\"http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/physics_at_work/\">Physics at Work</a> event. This week saw an invasion of more than 2,500 schoolchildren (mainly year-11s) to sample the exhibition. This is a major opportunity for the exhibitors \u2013 about 25 each year from industry and academia \u2013 to highlight what it is that physicists do in their daily work and why they find it exciting.</p> <p>This exhibition can only scratch the surface of providing information about potential jobs to the students, but over the years it is obvious how valuable teachers find it as a way of informing their classes. What is the evidence for that statement? That they keep coming back! They even come half way across England to attend, the most distant group this year coming from Liverpool.</p> <p>What do the children see when they come? They get to see a selection of half a dozen or so of the 25 exhibits, and they get to meet the people who do the science. They'll discover that scientists are articulate and passionate about what we do. Most won't be wearing white lab coats, or have Einstein-like hair. Exhibitors this year ranged from Rolls-Royce to the British Antarctic Survey, from Domino Printing to The Technology Partnership Consultancy, as well as several research groups from the physics department and further afield in the university. Something, one would hope, to appeal to everyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/7997464461_b2e626dee4.jpg\"> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/athenedonald/7997464461/\" title=\"dara_burst_balloon-1 by Athene Donald, on Flickr\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/7997464461_b2e626dee4.jpg\" width=\"460\"alt=\"dara_burst_balloon-1\" /></a> </figure>  <p>I believe we need more events like this across the country to help students visualise what a life in science, or a career built on a science qualification but which isn't necessarily directly scientific, might mean. If all they think scientists do is sit at a bench intoning over bubbling test tubes, they are missing the big picture. We need to broaden their horizons and give them a taste of the spread of options in principle open to them. Sharing the excitement is vital, but sharing the reality is too.</p>",
  "<p>The European court of human rights has ordered the government to pay \u00a36,500 in compensation to a mother who was forced to leave a council's Gypsy site in Wales.</p> <p>Maria Buckland, 53, was denied the opportunity to challenge her eviction through the British courts after the House of Lords denied her permission to appeal, <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx#{%22documentcollectionid%22:[%22COMMITTEE%22,%22DECISIONS%22,%22COMMUNICATEDCASES%22,%22CLIN%22,%22ADVISORYOPINIONS%22,%22REPORTS%22,%22RESOLUTIONS%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-113129%22]}\" title=\"\">the ECHR judgment said</a>.</p> <p>The decision was one of two released on Tuesday in which the Strasbourg court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/18/strasbourg-judges-indeterminate-sentences-unlawful\" title=\"\">found against the UK</a>. The case revolved around Buckland's rights to respect for private and family life and home as guaranteed by article 8 of the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>Buckland, a mother of two, moved on to the Cae Garw caravan site near Port Talbot in 1999, and six years later was served with a possession order revoking her licence.</p> <p>She alleged that she had not been given the chance to challenge the authorities' decision in the domestic proceedings on the grounds of her personal circumstances. She eventually left the caravan site in May 2008 after the House of Lords' refusal of her request for permission to appeal.</p> <p>The Strasbourg court ordered that Britain should pay her \u20ac4,000 in damages and a further \u20ac4,000 in costs and expenses.</p> <p>The judgment said she had never been given a full explanation of why she had been asked to leave the Traveller site. A British judge at a hearing in 2006 \"was, however, satisfied that her son, who resided part of the time with her, had been involved in an incident on site in which he threatened someone with a gun, although it was not clear whether the gun had been real or merely an imitation; and had dumped garden refuse on the site\", it said.</p> <p>In relation to Buckland herself, it was only said that she had failed to pay arrears in her water charges. The ECHR said: \"Although the court has found a procedural violation of article 8 of the convention, it&#xa0;\u2026 is not possible to speculate as to what would have been the outcome if the applicant had been able to contest the making of the possession order on the basis of her personal circumstances.\" Instead the courts had said her only possible legal options were a challenge to the law itself or a judicial review of the process.</p> <p>However, it was satisfied that as a result of the making of a possession order that Buckland was unable to challenge, she had \"suffered some feelings of frustration and injustice\".</p> <p>Buckland, the judgment said, was now living on land owned by her brother. \"It has no planning permission for residential use and its occupants, which include the applicant's brother, his six children and the applicants' parents, share minimal facilities, namely one toilet and one sink with cold running water in a shed with no lighting.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://atrium.haygroup.com/uk/our-products/misc.aspx?ID=3295\" title=\"\">study</a> conducted by the global management consultancy Hay Group, which surveyed 600 graduates and managers at 40 of the UK's largest graduate employers, found that more graduates are prioritising career progression and the ability to make a difference over bonuses and benefits. But it's not only graduates who are changing their priorities. Neil King, HR director at the <a href=\"http://www.leyf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">London Early Years Foundation</a> also reports an increase in applications from the private sector.</p> <p>These findings are echoed by Lydia Langford of <a href=\"http://acre-resources.com/\" title=\"\">Acre Resources</a>, a specialist sustainability recruitment consultancy, who has seen an increase in numbers of applicants wanting to get into the sector, mirroring a corresponding rise in vacancies. A second wave of companies has begun to join those who already have a sustainability agenda, while the number of FTSE 100 companies employing a sustainability executive has increased more than fourfold since 2005, she explains.</p> <p>However, competition for vacancies is tough, and employers are selective. What does a candidate need to do to appeal to a company with sustainable values?</p> <h2>Values alignment</h2> <p>Ed Shepherd credits the <a href=\"http://onpurpose.uk.com/become-an-on-purpose-associate/apply-today-2\" title=\"\">On Purpose leadership programme</a> with helping him examine his own values so he could then identify a company where those values were aligned. Clarity in how your values match helps you build your proposition as a candidate, he says. Shannon Houde, executive and career coach at Acre, suggests mapping your language and values to the organisation's, through \"creating a story around your values, skills and character traits\" in your application.</p> <p>Researching the organisation's website should reveal important information about its values and skills requirements. However, demonstrating awareness of the business model and strategy and an interest in the organisation's culture and mission at assessment or interview stage, will impress much further, says King.</p> <h2>Training, skills and mindset</h2> <p>Although values-led companies expect candidates to share the same values, they are also as specific in their skills and experience requirements. Candidates need to show they can deliver results on projects or programmes. At senior level, strong engagement and relationship management skills are vital to get stakeholder buy-in, says Langford; while in other organisations assessment activities are also used to determine an applicant's suitability.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.pg.com/en_UK/\" title=\"\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> the importance of leadership potential goes beyond an assumed skillset, says Niall de Lacy, HR director for UK and Ireland. To stand out, candidates need to show examples of their ability to engage and energise \u2013 whether these are gained from education, extra-curricular activities or community work.</p> <p>A commitment to developing skills (both technical and soft) makes you more desirable as a candidate. Jack Scriven, an On Purpose fellow, received training in structured problem-solving, influencing techniques and story-telling to complement his technical skills in finance, while Candice Motran developed her social impact measurement and multi-agency programme management skills, both highly desired areas of expertise. Organisations also value strong teamwork skills \u2013 especially evidence of working to achieve shared values and outcomes. Houde also underlines policy and legislation understanding, commercial understanding and strategic thinking as important skills to build.</p> <p>Coaching and mentoring demonstrate a commitment to your professional development and an \"ongoing professional development\" section can be effective in highlighting your goals and motivations, as well as demonstrating personal ownership of your career \u2013 a key trait, advises P&amp;G's de Lacy. Displaying an interest in your future with the organisation is also important. Sustainability-focused companies see \"the future\" as their people, explains Houde, and mutual investment is crucial to attract and retain top talent. Applicants therefore need to portray themselves as having the potential to be managed and developed.</p> <h2>Experience</h2> <p>Analyse previous experience to uncover your main strengths and value to an employer, then frame these in terms of the problems you solved and the impact you had. Both paid and voluntary experience are useful: a variety of environments and challenges not only widens your understanding of business operations, but enables you to improve problem-solving skills and flexibility in applying solutions across sectors. Experience in values-led organisations is particularly important for the insights into how values are applied in decision-making and operations, while any experience you have which clearly matches the company's sustainability agenda should be prominent, advises Langford.</p> <p>Jack Scriven emphasises the importance of voluntary work or acting as a trustee to demonstrate commitment as well as to gain practical experience \u2013 particularly valuable for those changing career into the sustainability sector.</p> <h2>Networking</h2> <p>Networking (such as attending events) is key for building and maintaining contacts with likeminded professionals, and for finding out more about potential employers and the sector.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Anti-Japanese protests are continuing across China as the countries' competing claims to a group of islands threatened to escalate. There were reports that a large flotilla of Chinese fishing boats was due to arrive in the area later on Tuesday.</p> <p>Hundreds of Japanese firms closed their businesses, as demonstrators took to the streets to mark the anniversary of the start of Japan's 14-year occupation of northern China in 1931.</p> <p>As the region braced for the possible arrival of up to 1,000 fishing boats in waters near the disputed Senkaku islands \u2013 known as the Diaoyu in China \u2013 Beijing reacted angrily to reports that two Japanese activists had briefly landed on one of the three islands that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/japan-china-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">the Japanese government bought from their private Japanese owners last week</a>.</p> <p>\"The unlawful landing of the Japanese rightwingers on the Chinese territory of the Diaoyu islands was a gravely provocative action violating Chinese territorial sovereignty,\" Hong Lei, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said in a statement.</p> <p>At least two of 11 Chinese ocean surveillance and fishery patrol ships sailing near the islands have entered what Japan considers its territory, the public broadcaster NHK said, quoting Japan's coastguard.</p> <p>China's national defence minister, Liang Guanglie, said Beijing reserved the right to take further action against Japan over the dispute. It was hoped the countries could reach a negotiated solution, but the Japanese government should \"undo its mistakes and come back to the right track of negotiations\", he said.</p> <p>The Japanese activists briefly landed on one of the islands \u2013 which are thought to be located amid huge natural gas deposits \u2013 after swimming ashore from a dinghy, then returned to their boat, NHK said.</p> <p>The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted an aide to Yoshihiko Noda, the Japanese prime minister, as saying that the possible arrival of the fishing boats would take the dispute to a \"new stage\".</p> <p>He told the paper: \"The government is taking a wait-and-see approach for the moment. But we will not be able to sit by idly if fishing vessels reach the Senkaku islands in large numbers. It could lead to a new stage.\"</p> <p>The coastguard could be forced to arrest the captains of any Chinese vessels that enter Japan's territorial waters, in a repeat of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/24/japan-free-chinese-boat-captain\" title=\"\">incident that soured relations between the two countries in 2010</a>. If the coastguard is unable to cope, some have speculated that the defence forces could become involved.</p> <p>The Japanese activists' landing and the presence of Chinese ships in the area heightened tensions days after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/japanese-firms-close-offices-china\" title=\"\">protesters set fire to Japanese factories, attacked other businesses and hurled objects at the Japanese embassy in Beijing</a>.</p> <p>Tuesday's demonstrations reportedly spread to 100 cities, but there were no reports of violence amid a much heavier police presence. The Chinese authorities have endorsed the popular outpouring of anti-Japanese sentiment \u2013 now in its eighth day \u2013 but have warned marchers not to break the law.</p> <p>Wang Guoming, a retired soldier, said anger towards Japan had prompted him to travel to Beijing from his hometown in Shanxi province.</p> <p>\"I came here so our islands will not be invaded by Japan,\" Wang told the Associated Press. \"We believe we need to declare war on them because the Japanese devils are evil. Down with little Japan!\"</p> <p>In central Chengdu, around 1,000 demonstrators waved Chinese flags and chanted, but appeared outnumbered by the massed ranks of paramilitary, uniformed and plainclothes police. A note left on a Japanese-made police car nearby read: \"Reject Japanese products. Don't dig your own grave.\"</p> <p>The Chinese government moved to dampen the fervour of the protests late on Monday after signs that some of the demonstrators' anger was being directed towards their own government.</p> <p>Authorities in China are normally quick to prevent even small protests, but have a history of tolerating mass anti-Japan protests for a few days before stepping in to tone them down or stop them, aware of the potential for the mood to turn against them.</p> <p>Some human rights activists have already sought to take advantage of the rare chance to take to the streets: one protestor told the Guardian three of his friends had been detained by police after 10 of them marched with a banner reading \"Democracy, human rights, constitutional government\" at a demonstration in Shenzhen this weekend. They were released with a warning.</p> <p>\"We saw the anti-Japan protests online and joined because China rarely gives people a chance to take part in protests,\" the man said. \"Police said we had disturbed social order and could not have the protest because it was not harmonious with the other protesters.\"</p> <p>China's state news agency, Xinhua, announced that Beijing had expressed \"strong dissatisfaction\" after one of its consulates in Japan was attacked with smoke bombs.</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, repeated calls for both sides to prevent an escalation in the crisis amid calls for a boycott of Japanese goods that could harm ties between two important trading partners.</p> <p>Washington has not taken sides in the sovereignty row but is bound by its security treaty obligations with Tokyo to come to Japan's aid if it is attacked.</p> <p>\"We hope that the US will truly abide by the principle of not taking sides over the question of who the Diaoyu islands belong to,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.</p> <p>The Japanese airline All Nippon Airways reported more than 18,000 cancellations from passengers in the coming weeks, most for flights from China.</p> <p>While there have been no reports of violence against Japanese citizens, some expatriates voiced concern about their safety. Many stayed at home on Tuesday on the advice of their employers and the Japanese government.</p> <p>There are no signs at this stage that Japanese companies are preparing to withdraw from China, although analysts say they may reconsider future investments there.</p> <p>China is Japan's single biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth a record $345bn (\u00a3213bn) last year.</p>",

Published yesterday, the survey found that Britons are less keen on the idea of coalition government, less satisfied with the NHS - and think there should be less spending on benefits. Penny Young, chief executive of NatCen, the organisation that carries out the survey, says this year's findings <a href=\"http://natcenblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/what-britain-thinks-bsa29.html\" title=\"\">highlight the likely battleground for the next general election</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With most of the planned spending cuts still to bite, a striking finding is that after a decade of declining support for more public spending, we're seeing the first signs of a reversal in this trend. 36% now want more spending \u2013 even if it means higher taxes \u2013 a rise of 5 points year on year. This is not huge, and most people want spending to remain the same, but the fact that the trend is changing direction is significant \u2013 and we'd expect to see it rise further in the coming years.<br>The challenge for government, then, will be to convince the public that cuts won't necessarily mean poorer performance in key public services. But there are already worrying signs in terms of the NHS: from an all-time high at the end of the Labour government, we found the first fall in NHS satisfaction for more than a decade. The 12 percentage point drop (to 58%) is the biggest annual fall since the mid 80s. This is likely to reflect some concern about what's ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on the Office for Public Management blog, Mike Bonnet asks <a href=\"http://www.opm.co.uk/are-the-public-really-as-unhappy-with-the-nhs-as-reports-would-lead-us-to-believe/\" title=\"\">Are the public really as unhappy with the NHS as reports would lead us to believe?</a> He says \"it would seem that public's perception of NHS standards has fallen disproportionately to the reality\", and adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are numerous possible reasons for this shift in attitudes, many of which are explored in the report, but a theory that particularly interests me is the idea that people's perception of the NHS has become increasingly negative because they oppose the extent of changes being made to the service. As the report points out \"while many feel the NHS needs to change to some degree, radical changes\u2026are not generally the kind of change they have in mind. Even so, a large minority think this is what will, in fact, happen\".</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 A timely retweet of a 2010 Demos report on the impact of <strong>welfare reforms </strong>on people with a disability.

The anonymous blogger, who has a background in local government, writes that she spent 10 years of her life writing (\"funding bids, monitoring documents, council plans, service plans\"), but: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Much of it was made up. Fudged. Spun. Pasted. Cobbled together. Cut. Cleansed. Copied. Attractively formatted!<br>I told lies in themes, lies in groups, lies in pairs. Pages and pages of them. Hundreds of pages of nonsense. Strategic lies. Operational lies. Cross cutting lies. My speciality.<br>Every document I wrote was packed full of white lies. I've lied at every level.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>She adds that \"if not lying, I wasn't confident that what I was writing was real\", and says the purpose of this written work was to project positive news. But she concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The alternative to lying up the hierarchy is simple. Take the hierarchy to see the truth.<br>We should have been taking our managers, chief executives, politicians, civil servants and funders to see what was actually going on. We should have got them sitting on council receptions, listening to hours of phone calls and listening to service users in their own contexts. No reading or writing required. No hours of wordsmithing, checking and formatting. Just good honest finding out.<br>To find out what is really going on, you don't need to be aware of the committee cycle, no approvals necessary, no checking, no version control, nothing cross cuts and nothing comes in clusters or themes. It is just as it is. Always there, waiting to be discovered. Immediate, live and real.<br>There are no lies here. At the bottom of the hierarchy, where the end-user touches it, you find out the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Term of the day, coined by Gaby Hinsliff: \"<strong>elastic middle</strong>\". Referencing Saturday's Guardian Weekend feature on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/14/do-britons-feel-rich-poor\" title=\"\">who feels rich or poor</a>, she says British people are relutcant to label themselves rich. But Hinsliff says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/defining-the-squeezed-middle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">politicians should be clear about who is really struggling</a>. She writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's easy to mock deluded millionaires, of course, but they're not the only ones hopelessly confused about what it means to be rich, poor or stuck in the infamously \"squeezed middle\". We're riding into a storm over the creation and distribution of wealth, with the party conferences dominated by arguments about tax and spending, yet most Britons still have only a vague idea of where they fit in the national picture.<br>Attitudes to the poor are hardening, but based on fundamental misunderstandings about who the poor actually are. Today's British Social Attitudes Survey showed sympathy for the unemployed dwindling, on the assumption that they should just get jobs \u2013 never mind the forgotten hordes in jobs that don't pay enough to escape poverty. And while attitudes to the rich have hardened too, we're hazier than previously about who they really are.<br>Survey after survey shows most people reckon themselves roughly in the middle of the income scale: they think they're average because they feel no richer than their friends, forgetting that their friends are from similar backgrounds. The result is a large, politically awkward class of \"imaginary middles\" \u2013 perhaps best defined as the kind of people who definitely think the richest 10% of Britons should pay more tax \u2013 until they realise that means anyone earning just over \u00a346,000 a year, themselves included.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 An incredibly powerful letter by One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey following his son's death at the age of 20. The excellent Letters of Note site <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/09/what-world.html\" title=\"\">shares the letter Kesey wrote to five of his closest friends</a>. It's not an easy read, as Kesey describes his son Jed's final days in hospital following a bus crash, and the funeral. But it ends on a hopeful note after the family agreed to organ donation (\"Jed's always been as generous as they come. Take whatever you can use\"). Kesey writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All the doctors were there, bent over a long list, phoning numbers, matching blood types, ordering nurses...in such a hurry they hardly had time to offer sympathy. Busy, and justly so. But the nurses, the nurses bent over their clipboards, could barely see to fill out the forms.<br>They phoned the hotel about an hour later to tell us it was over, and that the kidneys were in perfect shape. That was about four in the morning. They phoned again a little after six to say that the kidneys were already in two young somebodies.<br>What a world.<br>We've heard since that they used twelve things out of him, including corneas. And the redwinged blackbirds sing in the budding greengage plumtree.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Kesey adds a postscript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Jed's wallet was finally sorted out of the debris and confusion of the wreck it was discovered that he had already provided for such a situation. He had signed the place on his driver's license indicating that he wanted to be an organ donor in the event of etc., etc. One man gathers what another man spills.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19629997\" title=\"\">Government eyes end to benefits and inflation link</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074624/parents-suffer-silence-hands-abusive-children-report\" title=\"\">Parents suffer in silence at the hands of abusive children, report finds</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13387/csv_launches_700000_government-backed_professional_volunteers_drive\" title=\"\">CSV launches \u00a3700,000 government-backed professional volunteers drive </a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/mental-health/2012/09/film-confronts-mental-health-s.html\" title=\"\">Campaign confronts mental health stigma in schools</a><br>\u2022 FT [\u00a3]: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a8a41abc-00d4-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26ogwgKpW\" title=\"\">Cameron puts brakes on pension reform</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/doctors-from-crisishit-eurozone-countries-heading-to-uk-for-work-8145194.html\" title=\"\">Doctors from crisis-hit eurozone countries heading to UK for work</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/banks-asked-to-help-tenants-with-universal-credit/6523770.article\" title=\"\">Banks asked to help tenants with universal credit</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106944\" title=\"\">Prisk urges landlords to create 'spark' for home building</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/call-for-end-to-perverse-tax-breaks-for-pensioners/\" title=\"\">Call for end to 'perverse' tax breaks for pensioners</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9549656/Controlling-partners-to-be-prosecuted-for-domestic-abuse.html\" title=\"\">Controlling partners 'to be prosecuted for domestic abuse'</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Fundraising/article/1150366/scope-launches-scheme-philanthropists-sponsor-charity-shops/\" title=\"\">Scope launches scheme for philanthropists to sponsor charity shops</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's government appears to have abandoned a three-year-long standoff with the country's top judges over the writing of a controversial letter to officials in Switzerland responsible for investigating money-laundering charges against the president.</p> <p>What is known as \"the Swiss letter\" has become central to a case that, although based on arcane legal and constitutional arguments, has already ended the career of one prime minister and has threatened to bring down the government led by the Pakistan People's party (PPP).</p> <p>The supreme court, led by an increasingly assertive and popular chief justice, has long demanded the government write to Switzerland to rescind a 2008 notification that it was no longer a party to corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari that Swiss officials had investigated.</p> <p>The government has been equally insistent it would never write such a letter, claiming Zardari enjoys immunity as head of state. PPP loyalists have argued the supreme court refused to drop the issue because of the personal enmity between Zadari and the chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry.</p> <p>In June former prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/19/pakistan-prime-minister-yousuf-gilani-disqualified\" title=\"\">Yousaf Raza Gilani was forced to step down</a> after he was found guilty of being in contempt of court for refusing to write the letter.</p> <p>Many observers had assumed Zardari would continue to defy the court in order to limp to the end of the government's term by sacrificing one prime minister after the next \u2013 the current incumbent, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, is widely regarded as a political lightweight and has been implicated in his own separate corruption scandal.</p> <p>But on Tuesday morning Ashraf, accompanied by senior cabinet ministers, arrived at the grand marble chamber of the supreme court to announce that the law minister had been \"empowered\" to write to the Swiss authorities.</p> <p>He said he was acting \"in the larger interest of the country\" and added: \"I don't want to be seen standing on the wrong side of the history.\"</p> <p>The climbdown prompted the judges to exempt Ashraf from threatened charges of contempt of court, ensuring his political future for the time being.</p> <p>Several legal experts predicted that any letter written to the Swiss would be contrived to ensure it would not trigger any further investigation of Zardari for the alleged laundering of tens of millions of dollars through Swiss bank accounts in the 1990s when Benazir Bhutto, Zardari's widow, was in power.</p> <p>\"Given the track record of the PPP it is certain they will not write the letter that the supreme court wants,\" said Wajih Uddin, a former chief justice of the Sindh provincial supreme court. \"It will be sugar-coated in such a way that it will benefit Mr Zardari.\"</p> <p>However, the law minister indicated he would allow the supreme court to approve a draft of the letter.</p> <p>Other legal experts assume the government must have been assured that Switzerland would not reopen the case, even if formally asked to do so.</p>",
  "<p>The European court of human rights has ruled that indeterminate prison sentences (IPPs) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/18/strasbourg-judges-indeterminate-sentences-unlawful\" title=\"\">breached prisoner's human rights</a>. There are over 6,000 IPP prisoners in England and Wales currently without a release date. 3,500 of these prisoners have already served their time but have no idea when they will leave prison.</p> <p>IPPs were brought in by previous Labour home secretary David Blunkett to appease a shocked electorate in the wake of the murder of schoolgirl <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/sarah-payne\" title=\"\">Sarah Payne</a>. So invidious are these IPPs, described as a \"stain\" on the criminal justice system by former justice secretary&#xa0;Ken Clarke, they were recently abolished. Not only are prisoners who were convicted in the past now stuck in the system, IPPs are still being dished out despite the change in the law.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-podmore\" title=\"\">John Podmore</a>, former governor of HMP Brixton, is horrified. \"We're locking them up not for what they've done, [but] for what they might do in the future\". </p> <p>Three months after passing the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which abolished IPPs, the government has no strategy for dealing with these thousands of prisoners. The IPP sentence was meant to demonstrate the government's tough approach to serious offenders. If a judge felt that offenders were a risk to society they could hand down an IPP, which meant that offenders had to prove to the Parole Board that they were ready to rejoin society by completing rehabilitation programmes. The intention was to reduce the number of life sentences, while demonstrating a tough approach towards violent criminals.</p> <p>However, IPPs became a safe option for judges who were worried about a public backlash if lenient sentencing resulted in an offender committing a violent crime upon release. The previous Labour government noticed the massive numbers of prisoners serving IPPs and toughened up these regulations, but by this point there were already thousands serving IPPs for non-violent crimes.</p> <p>The abolition of IPPs will also not be applied retrospectively, meaning that thousands of IPP prisoners are still trapped in the system.When I asked the Ministry of Justice when IPPs would be scrapped the answer was vague, with the press officer coming to the muddled conclusion that different parts of an Act are brought into law at different times and there is no deadline. As a result, IPP sentences are still in existence because it seems their retrospective abolition would be a logistical headache. The Strasbourg ruling has now added to the problem, giving the MoJ three months to consider whether to appeal the judgment.</p> <p>Why are so many IPP prisoners failing to secure release? According to Podmore, the backlog of IPP prisoners trapped in the system is due to the lack of rehabilitation programmes available. These courses are scarce in certain prisons, and often over-subscribed. There is also the issue of prison population management. Many prisoners find themselves moved around regularly from jail to jail as a way of tackling overcrowding. If a prisoner is in the process of taking a programme this can hinder or even curtail their progress \u2013 many prisons don't offer certain programmes so if you are moved to a prison without a particular course you are back to square one when it comes to the crucial Parole Board assessment.</p> <p>Holding people in prison for an indefinite amount of time, with limited or no access to rehabilitation programmes, (as in the <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-113127#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-113127%22]}\" title=\"\">cases of Brett James, Nicholas Wells and Jeffrey Lee</a>) not only results in a massive cost to the taxpayer \u2013 currently \u00a345,000 per prisoner per year, it also flies in the face of a democratic system where punishment is intended to be redemptive.</p> <p>There is also the issue of fair sentencing \u2013 if a person has a violent fight in a bar and is sentenced to an IPP with a two year tariff, and then finds himself stuck in the system six years later he has received a punishment three times more severe than the crime he committed in the eyes of the court. With no word from the government on their plan for the 6,107 IPP prisoners still serving time, the \"stain\" on our justice system is yet to be removed.</p> <p><em>A longer version of this article appeared on </em><a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/News/the-disappeared-the-ipp-prisoners-trapped-in-the-system/\" title=\"\"><em>thejusticegap.com</em></a><em> </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 September 2012 to remove quotes that were not intended for publication.</p>",

Disclosure would undermine the convention which allowed the heir to the throne to be educated in the business of government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters-rodney-brazier?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">to prepare him to become king</a>, they claimed.</p> <p>But the judges decided that permitting the prince's lobbying to be concealed under this convention was a \"massive extension\" of the convention, which was not justified. They decided that \"it was fundamental\" that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/15/prince-charles-letters-appeal?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the lobbying by the heir</a> \"cannot have constitutional status\" and cannot be protected from disclosure.</p> <p>The evidence, they said, \"shows Prince Charles using his access to government ministers, and no doubt considering himself entitled to use that access, in order to set up and drive forward charities and promote views, but not as part of his preparation for kingship\".</p> <p>\"Ministers responded, and no doubt felt themselves obliged to respond, but again not as part of Prince Charles's preparation for kingship.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/14/prince-charles-letters-ministers-adviser?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Paul Richards, a former Labour special adviser,</a> told the tribunal that letters from the prince went \"to the top of the pile\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/ministers-prince-charles-letters?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">were \"treated with great reverence\"</a>.</p> <p>The judges noted that although the public had strong views about Charles, they had made their decision \"dispassionately \u2013 in the words of the judicial oath, 'without fear or favour, affection or ill-will'\".</p> <p>They said: \"Some will be horrified at any suggestion that correspondence between government and their heir to the throne should be published&#xa0;\u2026 Others may welcome such disclosure, fearing among other things that without it there will be no real ability to understand the role played by Prince Charles in government decision-making.\"</p> <p>The judges noted that the prince's activities \"are not neutral and in a number of respects have been controversial\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/interactive/2010/sep/20/prince-charles-letters-adam-tomkins\" title=\"\">Adam Tomkins, a law professor,</a> had testified that the prince had lobbied on \"the perceived merits of holistic medicine, the perceived evils of genetically modified crops, the apparent dangers of making cuts in the armed forces, his strong dislike of certain forms of architecture (leading him to make high-profile interventions in a number of contested planning developments), a range of issues relating to agricultural policy\".</p> <p>According to media reports, the prince once complained to Tony Blair, when he was prime minister, about the government's treatment of rural workers, relaying a Cumbrian farmer's view that \"if we, as a group, were black or gay, we would not be victimised or picked on\".</p> <p>On another occasion he outlined his concerns to Lord Irvine, then lord chancellor, about an American-style \"compensation culture\", reportedly writing: \"I and countless others dread the very real and growing prospect of an American-style personal injury 'culture' becoming ever more prevalent in this country\".</p> <p>He was also reported to have criticised \"the degree to which our lives are becoming ruled by a truly absurd degree of politically correct interference\".</p> <p>Copies or details of the prince's letters have been made public, either through leaks, Jonathan Dimbleby's 1994 biography of Charles, or other sources. However, the tribunal's decision is the first time under the freedom of information legislation that the government has been instructed to publish his letters.</p> <p>It is likely to be the last time, as ministers last year enforced a blanket ban on his correspondence being disclosed under the freedom of information law in the future, regardless of whether it is in the public interest. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/13/charles-letters-freedom-information-act?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">The absolute block was imposed following pressure</a> from the royal family, a well-placed source has told the Guardian.</p> <p>The judges ordered the Cabinet Office, and the departments responsible for business, health, schools, environment, culture and Northern Ireland to disclose their correspondence with the prince between September 2004 and April 2005.</p> <p>It is the second freedom of information defeat the government has suffered over the question of the prince's political influence.

  "<p>LinkedIn has hit the 10 million-user mark in the UK. Great. What does it mean for you? Well depending on who you want to target it could mean a number of things.</p> <p>This magic 10 million-user mark is supposed to represent four out of five business professionals in the UK. Excellent. I really value LinkedIn for a number of reasons but obviously it depends on your business. So if you're not sure, ask yourself the following:</p> <h2>1. Do you need fellow business professionals to find you easily? </h2> <p>If yes, then you need to make sure your profile reflects what you're doing now \u2013 not what you did 10 years ago. LinkedIn, like any digital resource, has a search function which works on a number of factors including keywords. Therefore, if your profile has more text talking about your past than your present or future, those are the searches you will appear in. Not helpful if you're looking for a new job or clients for your current role.</p> <h2>2. Is business development part of your role? </h2> <p>Trust is a hugely important factor when it comes to being a successful business development professional. Be strategic about which groups you join and use them to get in front of the right people. Always check the group statistics before you begin and allocate time to invest in engaging with the group after joining (be prepared to leave a group if it's not working out).</p> <p>Groups are a great way for you to show your expertise, link back to your own content across the web and build relationships with the right people. Not only that, if you have company events this is a great way to invite new and relevant delegates.</p> <h2>3. How up to date is your Rolodex? </h2> <p>LinkedIn helps you keep track of former clients, colleagues and collaborators without having to worry about updating email addresses and phone numbers. Business cards are great but as the pace of change in the job market continues, it's invaluable to have a resource that keeps track of your contacts for you.</p> <h2>4. Are you the face of your organisation? </h2> <p>I would argue that all of your employees are the \"face\" of your organisation. However, some faces are always more visible than others. If part of your role involves public speaking, sitting on non executive boards, networking at key industry events then you would benefit from having a LinkedIn profile that showcases a bit of that personality.</p> <p>The principles of networking are just as important for online networking as they are for face-to-face interaction. That old cliche of \"people buy people\" still holds. You may meet at sector specific events and kick off conversations talking about business but you build relationships when you find common interests and beliefs.</p> <p>Update your profile with apps which can display recent SlideShare presentations, reading lists, personal blogposts and even video clips of conference appearances. Having a well-rounded profile with a bit of personality will help you stand out against more traditional profiles and also back up your experience claims with tangible examples.</p> <p>And that's just for individuals. There are many more opportunities when it comes to organisations and their own LinkedIn profiles.</p> <p>Like any other social network, it's important to evaluate why you want to be there. If you answer no to any of the above then fine, maybe LinkedIn isn't that important to you. However, at the very least you may be job hunting one day in the future and it is better to have a profile to be proud of with useful contacts than one which is thrown up the day before your CV goes to market.</p> <p>So, how do you use LinkedIn? Do you find it important for your business? If you want to know more you can sign up to the <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4153816176/web\" title=\"\">Guardian's Media Academy seminar</a> on using LinkedIn for your business which takes place on 24 September. I may be biased as I'll be running the course but it will be an excellent way to take your use of LinkedIn to the next level. Hope to see you there.</p> <h2>Wider resources</h2> <p><a href=\"http://livefreerange.bo.lt/linkedin_hits_10_million_registered_members_in_the_uk\" title=\"\">LinkedIn hits 10 million members</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.linkedin.com/\" title=\"\">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/09/16/uk-10million\" title=\"\">More on LinkedIn 10 million</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://livefreerange.com/5-time-saving-social-media-tips\" title=\"\">Time-saving tips</a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Bestselling ebooks by authors including Jeffrey Archer and James Herbert are being sold for just 20p from Sony and Amazon's digital stores, prompting concerns from writers that the \"relentless downward pressure on book prices\" could lead to industry ruin.</p> <p>As news emerged this morning that digital fiction book sales were up 188% by value in the first half of this year, according to the Publishers Association, Sony added another title \u2013 Herbert's bestselling horror novel Ash, which has a cover price of \u00a318.99 \u2013 to its 20p price promotion, which has been running all summer. Sony's 20p offer, which has seen Amazon.co.uk price-matching each discount, <a href=\"http://lu.ebookstore.sony.com/Navigation.do?catId=112&amp;title=eBooks%20from%2020p&amp;viewAll=yes&amp;recPerPage=25\" title=\"\">currently includes a range of titles</a> from Kate Grenville's Sarah Thornhill to Chris Pavone's The Expats.</p> <p>Readers have been quick to take advantage of the cheap titles: Ash currently sits at the top of both Sony and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bestsellers-Kindle-Store-eBooks/zgbs/digital-text/341689031/ref=pd_ts_zgc_kinc_341689031_morl?pf_rd_p=285525267&amp;pf_rd_s=right-6&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=341677031&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=0HK23Y0J4WJ9RXJSJ2ER\" title=\"\">Amazon's digital bestseller charts</a>, with Alice Peterson's 20p title Monday to Friday Man in third place on Amazon, David Baldacci's 20p Zero Day in fifth, Peter James's thriller Dead Man's Grip in seventh and The Expats in ninth place, all discounted by 97% or more.</p> <p>James has seen his sales soar as a result of the promotion \u2013 \"at one point I was selling 10-20,000 copies a week,\" he said \u2013 and as both Sony and Amazon are taking the hit on the offer, he and his publisher are still getting paid as if the books were selling for full price.</p> <p>\"I'm still getting royalties as if it were full price \u2026 so I'm a really happy bunny,\" said James.</p> <p>But the author feels that while the offer is attractive in the short term, \"it has a lot of long term dangers\". \"What's worrying is that the 20p price point sets a precedent. The public starts getting used to paying even less,\" he said. And unable to compete on price, the sector of the market that will \"lose out in the long term is the independent bookshop,\" believes the novelist. \"That's my biggest worry.\"</p> <p>Pointing as well to the \"price war\" currently under way over <a href=\"http://www.littlebrown.co.uk/TheCasualVacancy\" title=\"\">JK Rowling's soon-to-be-published adult novel The Casual Vacancy</a>, Kate Pool at the Society of Authors said that \"some writers favour cheap books, believing that low prices are made up for in substantially increased sales\", but that the majority \"find the relentless downward pressure on book prices deeply worrying\". Rowling's \u00a320 novel, out on 27 September, is on offer for \u00a39.86 from Amazon and Tesco, and for \u00a310 from Waterstones.com.</p> <p>\"Since before the inception of the Society 128 year ago, authors have fought long and hard to ensure that copyright properly protects their fundamental right to control and profit from their creations,\" Pool said. \"If books are perceived to have almost no value, that fight seems pyrrhic indeed, as are the chances of professional authors, of even the most sought-after books, let alone those which are highly researched or costly to produce, making a living from their writing.\"</p> <p>Historical novelist Lindsey Davis, chair of the Society, said that while she approved of special offers as loss leaders, she was otherwise \"very opposed to the 20p book trend\", because \"authors should be able to make a living\".</p> <p>Peter Shea, general manager for Sony Digital Reading Services, said the retailer recognised \"that there is a concern about a perceived devaluation of ebooks\", and that it chose the price point of 20p for some titles \"as we see this as such a significant discount off list price that consumers can appreciate it is not the 'new price of ebooks'.\"</p> <p>\"As a retailer dedicated to ebooks only, we at Reader Store believe that offering exceptional prices on ebooks that people want to read is an engaging way to help curious readers experience digital books, perhaps for the first time,\" said Shea. \"Unlike with physical books, some publishers do not allow their ebooks to be sold at discounted prices. As a result, at Reader Store we aim to provide excellent prices to our customers where we can with a selection of ebooks priced as low as 20p while others are only available at full list price. Of course, the publishers and authors of the ebooks we choose to sell for 20p still receive their full payment for each book we sell. We have found these publishers and authors enthusiastic when informing them of our pricing for their books.\"</p>",
  "<p>The European court of human rights has ruled \"arbitrary and unlawful\" the operation of indeterminate sentences for the protection of the public (IPPs), currently being served by more than 6,000 prisoners in England and Wales.</p> <p>The Strasbourg judges said the prison system was \"swamped\" by prisoners without fixed release dates after the indeterminate sentences were introduced in 2005. They said the three inmates who brought the case had \"no realistic chance\" of accessing the rehabilitation courses they need to qualify for release.</p> <p>The new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, told MPs he was disappointed by the judgment, and intended to appeal against it. He said: \"It is not an area where I welcome the court seeking to make rulings.\"</p> <p>The unanimous ruling by seven judges, including the British judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, awarded up to \u20ac8,000 (\u00a36,500) compensation to three prisoners, Brett James, Nicholas Wells and Jeffrey Lee, who have been held up to two years and 10 months longer than the original minimum recommendation of their trial judge. They were also awarded \u20ac12,000 costs each.</p> <p>All three were given indeterminate sentences after being convicted of violent offences in 2005 and ordered to serve a minimum tariff of two years, 12 months and nine months respectively. James, from Wakefield, has now been released, as has Lee, who lives in Fleetwood. Wells is still in prison.</p> <p>Indeterminate sentences were introduced on the understanding that rehabilitative treatment would be made available to those prisoners concerned.</p> <p>But the ruling published on Tuesday said the court found the \"considerable delays in the applicants making any progress in their sentences had been the result of lack of resources, planning and realistic consideration of the impact of the sentencing scheme introduced in 2005\".</p> <p>The European judges note that the problems with IPP prisoners were the subject of \"universal criticism\" in the British courts. The ruling said the three inmates had been left in privately run local prisons for two and half years, where there had been few, if any, rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>\"The stark consequence of the failure to make available the necessary resources was that the applicants had no realistic chance of making objective progress towards a real reduction or elimination of the risk they posed by the time their tariff periods expired,\" says the ruling.</p> <p>\"Moreover, once the applicants' tariff had expired, their detention had been justified solely on the grounds of the risk they had posed to the public and the need for access to rehabilitative treatment at that stage became all the more pressing\".</p> <p>The judges said that in those circumstances their detention had been \"arbitrary and therefore unlawful\".</p> <p>The IPP sentence is due to be replaced by a new \"extended determinate sentence\" later this year. It will not apply to the IPP prisoners in jails in England and Wales, whose release dates are to be decided on a \"case-by-case\" basis by the Parole Board.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice, which has three months to consider whether to appeal, said the ruling did not mean that the 6,078 prisoners would now have to be released.</p> <p>It said 3,531 IPP prisoners had passed their tariffs \u2013 the dates set by their trial judge for their earliest release. Officials added no compensation would be paid to the offenders who had brought the case until all appeals had been exhausted.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed by this judgment and are currently considering our grounds to appeal,\" the ministry said in a statement. \"Public protection will not be put at risk \u2013 the judgment does not find that indeterminate sentences are unlawful, and will not mean prisoners currently serving IPP sentences will have to be released.\"</p> <p>The justice ministry confirmed ministers' intention to replace the current complex IPP system with a new regime of determinate sentences: \"This will see more dangerous criminals given life sentences, and others spending longer periods in prison, with tough licence conditions on release.\"</p> <p>The prison system is understood to have recently improved IPP inmates' access to rehabilitation courses with better sentence planning and prioritised places on courses. One option facing Grayling, would be to implement a lower threshold release test, which was put on the statute book by his predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, for the parole board to use in IPP cases.</p> <p>Frances Crook of the Howard League for penal reform said: \"This judgment emphasises that the government was right to abolish the IPP in recent legislation as the sentence was fundamentally unjust.</p> <p>\"The question now is what can be done to give those IPP prisoners who are still in prison over their tariff the support they require in order to be safely released into the community.The Howard League and many others said for years that the IPP sentence was both wrong in principle and wrong in practice. It is wrong to imprison someone not for what they have done but what they might do. In practice, the IPP has proved a disaster that has left many in a catch-22 situation where they can only be released from prison after completing courses that our overcrowded prisons cannot provide, not least because there are now over 6,000 prisoners serving IPP sentences.\"</p> <p>Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust said the judgment should prompt Grayling to institute a review of the cases of more than 3,500 people held beyond their indeterminate sentence tariff dates.. and to use his discretion under new legislation to change the release test and \"eradicate a stain\" on our justice system.</p> <p>\"It is shaming to have so many people locked up in our prisons, not for what they have done but for what they might do in the future. Many of these prisoners are condemned to years of uncertainty during which time they must somehow prove, from the confines of a bleak, overcrowded jail, that they no longer present a risk to the public,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The Nato-led military strategy in Afghanistan has been thrown into disarray after joint on-the-ground operations were suspended because of a collapse in trust over the killings of Americans and other Nato soldiers by Afghan government forces.</p> <p>The move came after a surge in the number of \"insider attacks\" by Afghan government soldiers and police officers. There have been 36 such attacks this year, which have killed 51 Nato soldiers. The suspension threatens the joint plan to train an effective Afghan army to keep the Taliban at bay after foreign troops pull out.</p> <p>General John Allen, the US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, ordered a stop to joint combat operations and patrols \"until further notice\".</p> <p>The decision, which was announced in Washington, took the UK government by surprise, coming just a day after the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, spoke in defence of Nato's continued work with Afghan troops in parliament. Whitehall sources said British commanders were unaware the announcement was going to be made.</p> <p>He said on Monday: \"It is essential that we complete the task of training the Afghan national security forces and increasing their capability so that they can take over the burden of combat as we withdraw. That is what we intend to do, and we will not be deterred from it by these attacks.\"</p> <p>Hammond will be forced to address the Commons on Afghanistan for a second day in succession on Tuesday after the Speaker, John Bercow, granted Tory MP John Baron an urgent question at lunchtime.</p> <p>A Ministry of Defence source said everything the British army did in Afghanistan was in partnership with Afghans so it would have to look closely at how to continue operations while complying with the direction from the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf).</p> <p>The source said: \"We are very much partnered with the Afghans. Literally everything is partnered with them right down to every level. We need to see what are the parameters for us&#xa0;\u2026 it's for the individual countries working under Isaf to determine how they work through what Isaf wants to be done.\"</p> <p>The chief US military officer, General Martin Dempsey, said the \"insider attacks\", in which four American and two British soldiers were killed at the weekend, were themselves \"a very serious threat to the campaign\" against the Taliban.</p> <p>There were at least 12 such attacks last month alone, leaving 15 dead.</p> <p>Nato said in a statement that \"most partnering and advising\" would now be at a battalion level and above, a significant withdrawal by Nato forces from working with the Afghan military on the ground.</p> <p>Joint operations at a lower level would be \"evaluated on a case by case basis\" and only happen with the approval of regional commanders.</p> <p>Nato said in some places all on-the-ground collaboration would cease and foreign military advisers would be \"stepping back to advise from the next level\".</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, described the attacks as the \"last gasp\" of a weakened Taliban. But the admission that Nato troops are no longer safe from the forces they are relying on to contain the Taliban after the final US pullout in two years' time is a severe blow to Washington's plans.</p> <p>Under the strategy, members of the 350,000-strong Afghan security forces gain experience patrolling and fighting alongside US and other foreign soldiers. But the killings have led to a collapse in trust.</p> <p>American, British and Afghan officials became increasingly alarmed at the attacks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/17/afghanistan-insider-attacks-us-soldiers\" title=\"\">because of their impact on troop morale and public opinion in the US and UK</a>.</p> <p>The decision strikes at the heart of Nato \u2013 and British \u2013 strategy which is based on the assumption that foreign troops and Afghan security forces will work increasingly closely until the Afghans take over all ground combat operations by the end of 2014.</p> <p>Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, asked why Hammond made no mention of the move when he faced MPs in the Commons on Monday in response to an urgent question from former Labour minister Denis MacShane. He said there were \"very serious questions\" for the government to answer.</p> <p>Alexander told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This announcement begs more questions than it answers. Why did Philip Hammond not even mention it yesterday when he addressed MPs in the House of Commons? Was it that he didn't know or did he choose not to tell MPs? But sitting beyond that question is the deeper question: does this represent a temporary tactical response by military commanders on the ground or does it represent a more strategic shift in the mission?</p> <p>\"If we are in a position where a regional commander is generally unwilling to grant the authority for troops to go out on patrol with Afghan soldiers, that would severely compromise the capacity of the mission to deliver its objectives.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"The whole of the strategy in Afghanistan now is built around the premise that as the international forces step back, the Afghan forces can step up.</p> <p>\"That's why I think there are very serious questions for the government to answer in the hours ahead.\"</p> <p>Though British commanders were drawing up plans designed to better protect their troops against \"insider\" or \"green on blue\" attacks, defence officials are making clear that the Nato decision to suspend joint ground operations was unexpected.</p> <p>Hammond told the House of Commons on Monday that the latest attacks, including the killing of two British soldiers from 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment on Saturday, could not be allowed to \"derail\" the training of Afghan security forces by British troops.</p> <p>The Nato decision has driven a coach and horses through that plan, and raises a huge question mark over the manner in which the 9,000 British troops in Helmand will be reduced over the next two and a quarter years.</p> <p>Hammond confirmed to MPs on Monday his remarks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/afghanistan-military-plans-early-withdrawal\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian last week</a> that his military commanders had advised that UK troops could withdraw faster than planned \u2013 a reversal of recent military advice. That advice may change again.</p> <p>Hammond discussed the attacks with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, on a visit to Kabul last week, saying the problem was a huge concern and had to be \"put back in its box\".</p> <p>American officials say the insider attacks are carried out by a mixture of Taliban infiltrators dressed as soldiers, insurgents who have got themselves recruited and Afghan soldiers angry about their treatment, personal insults or cultural differences.</p> <p>US commanders had already assigned soldiers to guard their comrades as they slept, ate or interacted with Afghan forces because of the increasing number of insider killings. American troops were also ordered to carry loaded weapons at all times, even inside their own bases.</p> <p>Afghan civilian deaths caused by Nato attacks have added to the strain. In the latest, an air strike killed eight women and girls collecting firewood.</p> <p>The loss of trust in the force the US is relying on to prevent the Taliban retaking control of Afghanistan compounds other concerns about Washington's strategy.</p> <p>The additional 33,000 soldiers Barack Obama, dispatched two years ago as part of the surge are expected to complete their withdrawal this week. The remaining 68,000 American troops are supposed to gradually shift responsibility to Afghan forces, which, under the US strategy, are to take the lead in combat as early as next year.</p> <p>But despite gains on the battlefield, questions persist about whether Afghan forces will have the ability and will to keep an undefeated Taliban at bay once Nato forces have left.</p> <p>Colonel Tim Collins, a former commanding officer in the Royal Irish Regiment, said Allen had taken a sensible decision to reduce the risk to his troops.</p> <p>He told the Today programme: \"Because of the recent upsurge of protest across the Islamic world, amongst Muslims in general, the risk to his troops at this point is such that this is the time to decide to take the train wheels off and let them go on their own.\"</p> <p>Collins said there was no evidence that the Taliban had a strategy in play. \"There is no evidence to support that,\" he said. \"The Taliban are taking advantage of disgruntled Afghans who have been recruited in large numbers \u2013 many of them far too quickly. This has turned into a copycat thing. To credit the Taliban with a tactic is to become what Lenin would describe as a useful idiot.\"</p>",
  "<p>BBC One's dark drama <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00szy7c\" title=\"\">Good Cop</a> comes to an end this week. We've spent three hours watching the life of Warren Brown's PC John Paul Rocksavage spiral further and further out of control, and nobody's any the wiser as to whether he'll claw his way to redemption or sink into the abyss for good.</p> <p>The signs aren't good. The beauty of Good Cop has been the care that writer <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/2012/08/good-cop.shtml\" title=\"\">Stephen Butchard</a> initially spent demonstrating that Rocksavage is a decent guy \u2013 he rescues imperiled girls from thugs, he Skypes his sick dad while on duty, he doesn't steal from victims \u2013 so that he could then slowly strip those attributes away as comprehensively as possible.</p> <p>It's not just that Rocksavage semi-accidentally murdered the man who killed his partner. It's that, by covering it up, he became a slave to consequence. There were witnesses. And with every attempt to silence them have come more witnesses. Every time Rocksavage tries to fix things, the circle of violence widens. This weighs down on him so much that he takes his eye off the ball professionally \u2013 he allows stabbings and suicides to occur on his watch. And is he really that good, anyway? After all, there's the pregnant girlfriend he dumped and the married woman he's sleeping with to take into consideration. One of Good Cop's central themes is the idea of a good man who does bad things. But is Rocksavage really a good man? Can he be, in the face of such an aggressively escalating bodycount?</p> <p>For anyone who, like me, has been waiting for Idris Elba to stop mucking around in Hollywood and make more episodes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/jul/05/how-to-be-luther\" title=\"\">Luther</a>, Good Cop has become a much-needed substitute. Like Luther, it is a dark drama about a downbeat policeman. Like Luther, it features no end of unintentionally hilarious criminals. Like Luther, its theme tune still mistakenly thinks that trip-hop is a thing. And, like Luther, it has Warren Brown in a plum role.</p> <p>It's far from perfect, of course. Things tend to be not so much alluded to as rammed down your throat \u2013 Rocksavage's dad, for instance, has an extraordinary, some might say mystic, talent for only reading books that mirror events to an absurd degree. Plus, the villains really are hilarious \u2013 without fail, they've all been hooting, swivel-eyed, unbearably broad cartoons with no motives whatsoever. The incidental music is so on the nose that you could quite easily follow the plot accurately without ever looking at the screen. And then there's Rocksavage himself, who at times seems to exist purely as a device to be shuttlecocked from catastrophe to catastrophe.</p> <p>That said, when Good Cop hits its stride, it's fantastic. The last few minutes of the second episode, when Rocksavage decided to commit his second execution, constituted some of the most gripping television of the year. It was escalation in the truest sense of the word \u2013 Rocksavage was no longer the victim of the first episode. He was now a man capable of premeditated murder and, worse, a man who actually seemed to take pleasure in it.</p> <p>The third instalment saw the pace drop a little \u2013 nobody even got offed\u2013 but hopefully it was the calm before the storm. The noose is tightening around Rocksavage. New witnesses continue to spring up from nowhere. His superiors already smell a rat. What's more, Rocksavage is being suffocated by his own sense of guilt. Will he hand himself in? Lash out and create even more casualties? Surely he can't get away with it. Like Christopher Nolan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92823/insomnia\" title=\"\">Insomnia</a>, the plot of which the series has closely resembled up to this point, Good Cop exists in a universe far too moral to allow so many horrific crimes to go unpunished.</p> <p>I'll be sad to see Good Cop go. It's been just the thing for soothing my Luther withdrawal symptoms. If you haven't been watching, you can <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00szy7c\" title=\"\">catch up on iPlayer</a>. And you should, because it won't be back. It can't be. Surely there's no way that a policeman can be that stupid twice in one lifetime.</p>",
  "<p>Sony's Japan Studio has a reputation for making completely out there games, and never more so than when they are designed to be downloaded from the PlayStation Network. But even so, Tokyo Jungle reaches a whole new level of sheer, delicious nuttiness.</p> <p>After it first surfaced at E3 2012, it swiftly became known as \"the dog-shagging game\" and while it does indeed feature dogs and they do, ahem, couple, any attention-seeking that implies shouldn't be allowed to detract from its considerable merits as a game, which include originality and a fearsome level of addictiveness.</p> <p>Tokyo Jungle is a proper sandbox effort with an irresistible premise: something has happened in Tokyo that has caused its entire human population to disappear. So the city has been left to the animals, and the law of the (urban) jungle applies.</p> <p>Initially, you can choose between two animals to play as: a cute Pomeranian, representing carnivores, or a Sika deer, representing herbivores. Your mission is to traverse Tokyo district by district, surviving as long as possible.</p> <p>As a carnivore, you progress by killing animals (a matter of sneaking up behind them and timing your attack to when a purple icon showing a pair of jaws goes red) and marking out your territory via pre-positioned flags. Once you've marked all the flags in a given district, you can procreate: the map shows you where potential female mates are, and you must take them to a designated nest.</p> <p>Once there, when you press the Mate button, you're treated to an animation showing some exploratory bottom-sniffing, followed by the initial stages of a mounting \u2013 before the camera discreetly pans out.</p> <p>On top of the simple premise, there are plenty of embellishments. For example, potential mates are rated between Desperate and Prime, and it's dead handy to find the latter as they will produce more offspring, thereby giving you a pack of siblings to mooch around with.</p> <p>The latter are necessary since the more territory you conquer, the greater the threats you encounter, and no matter how dexterous you are, it requires a pack to survive a pack attack. And when the animal you control dies, you'll automatically acquire control of another pack member.</p> <p>Controlling a herbivore brings completely different gameplay. While you can attack predators by kicking them, it's more sensible to proceed stealthily, hiding yourself in long grass or underneath plastic containers. You can only eat plants, but you can run faster and jump higher than the carnivores.</p> <p>As you make progress through Tokyo's different districts, you find memory sticks (bizarrely, given that they're of no earthly use to animals) which fill in details of the back story explaining why the humans disappeared, and which open chapters of the story mode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396309791\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347963940593/Tokyo-Jungle-007.jpg\" alt=\"Tokyo Jungle\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tokyo Jungle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are essentially set-pieces confined to small areas of the game \u2013 for example, you start off as a Pomeranian which must leave its ex-owners' flat and start to fend for itself in the wild. Story chapters are checkpointed, but the main survival mode isn't: when you die, it's back to square one.</p> <p>There are also objects (in gift boxes) to find throughout the districts, which can be handy items such as food or medicine, or preposterous clothes with which to dress up your Pomeranian. More or less all animal life is in the game \u2013 you unlock new species by performing specific challenges in survival mode and encounter everything up to dinosaurs as you roam around.</p> <p>As you may have guessed, Tokyo Jungle doesn't take itself too seriously \u2013 and it sometimes makes you laugh despite not intending to. Once you become accustomed to its peculiar logic, you can do things such as create killer Pomeranians \u2013 I had one which took out an entire population of alley-cats, before succumbing to a panther.</p> <p>It constantly plays incredibly cheesy music, and bleeps when you level up in the manner of a retro arcade game. And there are some annoying aspects \u2013 the map, for example, is more or less useless, and you need to accumulate certain objects before even attempting the more difficult areas, such as the more or less food-free sewers beneath the city.</p> <p>But despite its tongue-in-cheek nature, Tokyo Jungle is a superb game. It feels quite unlike anything else (the best description of it would be a stealth-action-survival-RPG), it's laugh-out-loud funny and incredibly moreish. And because of its rigorous, sandbox construction, it's unusually meaty for a download game, with plenty of replayability. If you fear that modern games play it too safe, Tokyo Jungle will restore your faith.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on PS3</strong></p>",
  "<p>Writers have said a lot of things about short stories. \"Get in, get out, don't linger.\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/oct/28/trick-raymond-carver\" title=\"\">That was Raymond Carver</a>. \"The sound of the story comes first,\" <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2028/the-art-of-fiction-no-131-grace-paley#.UAAvxvZcZAM.twitter\" title=\"\">said Grace Paley</a>. \"A new kind of prose\" was Katherine Mansfield; \"A row of lamps\", Virginia Woolf. Chekhov's \"new form\" \u2026 All opinions varying, but all agreeing and disagreeing about the genre from the point of view of someone who actually writes short stories \u2013 either for a living or for fun, as craftsperson or artist, on commission or as experiment.</p> <p>How very different, then, that sense of the vision and imagination and self-consciousness of the short story of writers themselves is to the definition laid down by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01m7rqn\" title=\"\">this year's chair of the BBC International Short Story Award</a>, Clive Anderson, who told us that what the short story must have \u2013 its overriding and most important feature \u2013 \"is a twist\".</p> <p>Really? A twist? Isn't that something that we used to talk about in the fourth form when we were reading <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saki\" title=\"\">Saki</a>, or earlier, while in thrall to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780141037578/tales-of-the-unexpected\" title=\"\">Tales of the Unexpected</a>? Isn't a \"twist\" something you put in to spice things up, add colour or bite, because you worry there's not any colour or bite there in the first place? That whole motivation for the turnaround ending \u2013 the \"sting in the tail\" as Saki called it \u2013 was that nothing else in those kinds of stories was surprising, not really. We're on home ground with writers who rely on a twist; everything is familiar. We feel pretty clever reading them because we're in control; we're never unmoored and taken down curious paths on new journeys. The twist is there to provide the surprise, all of it. Its job is to jolt the tale into life.</p> <p>However you view the work of Saki and others, who enjoy fashioning their stories this way (and there are plenty who do, and plenty that's interesting about their stories), the problem here is not so much the notion itself as the fact that we have the chair of a high-profile, widely-publicised award telling us what counts in the genre; a lawyer and chat show host defining for the nation what is valuable and memorable about this important component of our literary art.</p> <p>That speaks to a larger concern \u2013 which is the way literature in the UK is constantly made safe and understandable, diluted and commoditised, by those who don't have the first idea about form or voice or point of view or emotional landscape or any of those things real writers concern themselves with before they even sit down and think about inventing a story.</p> <p>Once again, the pronouncement that comes from the chair of this year's distinguished panel of judges \u2013 writers and critics both, who have made a life out of thinking about fiction and what makes it valuable \u2013 is privileged over those other, more informed voices, to have the soundbite that carries.</p> <p>\"Judging this competition was\" <a href=\"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/prizes-and-awards/1\" title=\"\">says Clive Anderson</a>, \"a perfect reminder of just how rewarding the short story genre can be. In the 10 which made it to the shortlist are to be found everyday human activities such as first loves and last laughs, infidelity and murder. Plus a goose, a dog and a must-have disposable electronic device. In short, some great stories.\"</p> <p>Not surprising that the paragraph has us think not about these \"great\" stories at all, but about the voice of Anderson himself. It's what our culture wants to do to art: break it down, play it for laughs. Make us feel we get the joke. It's the approach that stops us taking it seriously.</p> <p>Yet the short story is so serious, and so hilarious, and terrifying and moving and transporting. It is so much more supple and dangerous and \"other\" than glib comments such as this would have us believe, taking us, in the single breath of our reading, to another place, a new way of thinking. It has the power to alter our emotional temperature in just a few pages. At the recent World Writers' Conference at the Edinburgh International Book festival, writer and cultural critic China Mi\u00e9ville spoke about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/21/china-mieville-the-future-of-the-novel\" title=\"\">\"the remorseless prioritisation of recognition over estrangement\"</a>, the relentless privileging of one kind of story told in one kind of way. Wouldn't it be nice if here, upon the occasion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/14/shortlist-bbc-international-short-story-award\" title=\"\">the varied and textured shortlist that marks the 2012 prize</a>, we thought about what the short story <em>could</em> do - rather than simply reiterate what it's always done?</p> <p>That would be a twist indeed.</p>",
  "<p>The threat to close the Irish Daily Star in the wake of the decision to publish the controversial pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless appears to be receding, with Irish shareholders trying to walk the paper \"back from the edge\".</p> <p>Independent News and Media (INM), which owns 50% of the paper, believe it has taken the heat out of the situation and is now working with the other shareholder, Richard Desmond, who had threatened immediate closure, to find out what led to the decision to publish without either owner being informed.</p> <p>After telephone exchanges on Monday, the two shareholders both agreed to look at the circumstances surrounding publication afresh with the launch of a joint internal investigation and the suspension of the editor, Mike O'Kane, pending the results of the inquiry.</p> <p>The decision to publish the photos infuriated Richard Desmond on Saturday, when he declared that he would take \"immediate steps\" to close the paper with the loss of 120 jobs. But by Monday his company, Northern &amp; Shell, was indicating that the company's focus was on exiting the publishing joint venture.</p> <p>One informed source said INM were \"trying to walk it back from the edge\". That person added: \"If it's the case of [Desmond] being very much incensed and offended, then the passage of time might ease that, but if there is a commercial imperative at stake, the outcome of the inquiry won't matter.\"</p> <p>The INM Ireland chief executive, Joe Webb, described the closure of the paper as \"disproportionate\" over the weekend, but said he had no warning of the Star's decision to publish the long-lens, topless photos which were taken without permission in France. Webb added that the decision to publish was regrettable.</p> <p>The paper's former editor Ger Colleran, a well known figure in Ireland, was quoted in INM's Sunday Independent saying he was \"surprised about the furore ... particularly in a British media that gave freedom of speech to the world and is rightly called the mother of parliaments, underwritten by freedom of expression and a free press.\"</p> <p>Colleran, now managing director, pointed out that the paper had taken care not to publish the pictures in Northern Ireland where UK laws apply and where there may be more sensitivity towards the royal family.</p> <p>The decision to publish has threatened the end of self-regulation of Irish newspapers, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/17/irish-justice-minister-privacy-media\" title=\"\">justice minister Alan Shatter threatening privacy legislation</a>. He said the publication of the pictures was down to \"perceived financial gain\" and not \"principled freedom of expression\" and a belief by certain sections of the print media that \"public figures are fair game\". He declared he was going to revisit the 2006 privacy bill.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists said it would fight against any \"knee-jerk\" reaction. The NUJ's Irish secretary, Seamus Dooley, said the threat of privacy legislation was \"a worrying development with serious implications\".</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>There can be a number of reasons for looking beyond the standard means of funding a business such as the bank. Even when times are less tough, an alternative channel may offer benefits the banks can't. All of the ordinary business rules apply \u2013 have a solid plan, know your figures \u2013 but the other stuff can become interesting.</p> <p>David Fishwick opened the so-called Bank of Dave specifically to support local businesses. His solicitor, Keith Arrowsmith of JMW, explains that the structure was an issue. \"It's not possible to set up a small-scale bank,\" he explains. European rules and guidance mean that any size of bank needs a huge amount of reserves in order to avoid a repeat of Northern Rock. \"Even though every loan was going to be 100% funded and 100% matched by loans from Dave's personal assets, that wasn't sufficient to meet the liquidity tests,\" Arrowsmith says.</p> <p>So it's technically not a bank. JMW looked into credit unions but while rules have been updated, these need to show a link between the members. Two other ideas had more appeal. One was crowdsourcing and the second was peer-to-peer lending, which Fishwick opted for. \"It's a way of allowing deposits to pass from lenders to borrowers without taking deposits,\" explains Arrowsmith. This is important because taking deposits is much more regulated.</p> <p>Jonathan Markwell, revealed by the Guardian as the first person in the UK to join Twitter, is an app writer who obtained funding from the Chilean government to develop his projects \u2013 on condition that he worked in Santiago for six months to help develop a technology hub.</p> <p>Markwell had been involved in working with startups for 10 years, he explains, mostly in consulting, and wanted to build a product that would generate some income. He was on honeymoon when he found out about a programme called Start-Up Chile through a website. There was funding in return for moving to Chile for six months, focusing on building the product there but without losing equity. \"The judging criteria was on the product you were working on, a third was on the market for the idea and the remainder on your background,\" he says. This, plus what the idea would do for Chile, won him the award.</p> <p>With a scheme like this, you have to be ready to move abroad, which won't fit into everybody's working or living pattern. However, unorthodox funding can still be a good idea, even when there's a substantial business involved. Khurshid Valli is a corporate partner at national law firm Gateley, and is advising the Blackburn Rovers Supporters Investment Trust, on raising \u00a310m from supporters to buy the club.</p> <p>This is classic crowdfunding. \"Crowdfunding is a very inclusive type of investment that enables most people to participate, depending on their pocket and their individual appetite for risk and reward,\" says Valli. \"It often allows individuals access to a greater number of diverse opportunities that would not have been advertised generally, or would be considered too risky or offbeat for more sophisticated investors to back.\"</p> <p>If a business is considering crowdfunding it needs to be aware of the legal framework. Jas Purewal, a digital media lawyer at Osborne Clarke, points out that in cases where there's no financial reward on offer, the regulations are not as stringent because it's considered marketing rather than investment. So if you're a movie producer who offers 'investors' a chance to have a walk-on non-speaking part and a copy of the DVD when it comes out, you're in marketing rather than in anything governed by the FSA.</p> <p>\"Investment crowdfunding, where the user is offered, for example, shares or a return on investment, is under significant regulatory restrictions at the moment under UK law,\" Purewall says. \"Crowdfunders, crowdfunding platforms and users therefore need to be very careful when considering investment crowdfunding.\"</p> <p>Going to the crowd for money is increasingly big business with organisations such as Seedrs and CrowdCube facilitating this for many people \u2013 and companies like Brewdog going straight to its public with its two rounds of Equity Punk offerings. These offered shareholdings to members of the public choosing to invest small amounts.</p> <p>Going through an intermediary is an easier option, although business planning will still need to be solid. CrowdCube, for example, insists that candidate businesses submit a full plan and doesn't accept everyone who applies to go onto the site. To the successful it has delivered \u00a33.9m to 24 pitches from 17,500 small investors. In one instance it raised \u00a31m, although the company in question put restrictions in place so only reasonably large investors could take part.</p> <p>CrowdCube funded a recent expansion by going to its own investors and pitching its own business, raising \u00a3300,000 in 10 days. However there's another side to external investment: should you look for it at all?</p> <p>Kevin Byrne of Checkatrade thinks not. \"Having a firm hold on the financial affairs of your own company with careful budgeting has enabled us to take the Checkatrade service across the whole of the UK with no external financial help,\" he says. \"To me an entrepreneur is very much a self-motivator and having or not having money will have little to do with the actual act of starting.</p> <p>The key is cashflow, not so much to push the company forward as most of this can be done by the efforts of the individual, but to feed and house the start-up entrepreneur and their family. As long as this is covered the real entrepreneur can act.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by a media academic, <strong>Barry Turner</strong>, who examines the way in which some of the main questions originally set by the Leveson inquiry have been answered, or not.</em></p> <p><em>I have selected just three of the questions highlighted by Turner and begin with one that concerns the effects of competition and asks whether it impacts on the way in which journalists operate...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396302543\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347951165808/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles, emphasised in his witness statements to Leveson that the readers of his paper had an editorial role. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am held to account by my readers every day. The act of paying 55p for a newspaper is a voluntary one. If I do not connect with my readers' values and reflect their interests and aspirations, or if I offend them or am unfair or prurient, they will stop buying our newspapers. </p> <p>If that happens in great numbers I will lose my job. Newspapers only survive by connecting with their readership, by representing their interests, reflecting their aspirations and guarding them against injustice.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a problematic answer to a question about morality and ethics. Dacre is talking about the newspaper as a product and his use of the word accountable is irrelevant to the question of press ethics. </p> <p>The editors of the News of the World could easily have deployed such an argument. They could argue, and in fact did frequently, that their readers had a right to the type of story produced by that paper. The question of whether a newspaper survives is naturally second to whether it is ethical.</p> <p>Dacre was vigorous in his rebuttal that he, as editor of the Daily Mail, imposed his will on journalists. In oral testimony, he dismissed the idea that he imposed his will on the newspapers' writers, suggesting that it would be incredulous that he could tell people like Alex Brummer, Simon Heffer, Max Hastings, Janet Street-Porter or Craig Brown what to write. He went on to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All our writers \u2013 and I'm leaving out some brilliant ones \u2013 have their strongly held views, many of them different. It's a rich, diverse spectrum of opinion that permeates the paper.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This rich, diverse spectrum permeating the paper, according to Dacre's witness statement, represents the interests of and reflects the aspirations of its readership, a readership with a well established right wing perspective making this \"diverse spectrum\" largely a spectrum of right wing political and economic views. </p> <p>It is quite correct that writers such as these would be unlikely to submit to editorial control and could, as suggested in his evidence, simply leave to work elsewhere. That is hardly representative, however. </p> <p>This group of individuals who write as columnists enjoy much more autonomy than the regular newsroom journalists who perhaps have rather less opportunity for walking out and into a new job.</p> <h2>Why don't we leave it to the law of the land?</h2> <p><em>Turner then deals with the matter of constraints on the press. Several publishers and editors argued that the press should not be subject to any additional constraints in relation to behaviour and standards other than those imposed by existing laws...</em></p> <p>Commentators too numerous to count have pointed out that phone hacking is illegal and many question why there is need for an inquiry in the light of that. This is fair comment; there is no set of circumstances where the hacking of a mobile phone could be legal as a news-gathering tool. </p> <p>Sufficient law exists to protect individuals from this kind of behaviour and if, in the face of criminal charges, reporters are not deterred what use is a code of ethics or set of regulations?</p> <p>Since the purpose of the press is to inform the public is it not reasonable to suggest that it should be constrained by the same laws that apply to the public?</p> <p>Well, of course that is the case but it is also clear that the press even if it is serving the public is different from the public in a number of ways. The press is a powerful institution, sufficiently powerful to make or break individuals or even governments. </p> <p>The press, even in what some describe as its decline, is a very rich institution with the mainstream media having deep pockets that protect it from legal consequences. In effect, the press is far more powerful than the individuals it serves.</p> <p>Thomas Gibbons, professor of law at Manchester university, submitted evidence suggesting that some form of \"enforced ethics\" was required to prevent media distortion since the law was silent on matters of editorial control. </p> <p>He pointed out that self-regulation failed because the economic pressures on the press were greater than the journalistic ethics. This is an interesting point. He is correct in identifying media distortion as an ethical problem and one that is not directly addressed by the law. </p> <p>The concept of an enforced code of ethics to prevent distortion of stories is indeed an interesting concept. The problem is in the definition of distortion.</p> <p>The British press has a long tradition of partisanship arising out of its evolution from an overtly and ostensibly political, even seditious origin. Britain is curious in that it effectively has two forms of press/media regulation both very different for historical and political reasons. </p> <p>Distortion is the stock in trade of some of our largest circulation newspapers and is a result of their political bias. Withholding elements of a story and exaggerating others is as old as news-gathering itself and, while it may appear disingenuous and even dishonest, it is difficult to see how any system could control this without entirely changing the traditions and practices of our free press.</p> <p>Our right wing populist press has a fascination with asylum seekers, economic migrants and benefit cheats. These three groups fit neatly into one of the oldest and most popular categories of news, that of the moral panic. </p> <p>The stories are often distorted to ridiculous extents, especially by the use of irrelevant analogies such as comparing the arrival of immigrants with the population of a large city or exaggerating the scale of benefit fraud by targeting either huge frauds or the number of cheats prosecuted in one day. </p> <p>These stories, spun to the benefit of \"Outraged of Tunbridge Wells\", are a distortion and of little value to anyone looking for accurate information about any of these undoubted problems in society but they represent freedom of expression and that includes freedom to be prejudiced.</p> <p>Where distortion is serious the law can, in fact, intervene. We have draconian defamation law in the UK and it is well established that distortion can amount to defamation. A distorted story can impute dishonesty, unfitness or incompetence.</p> <p>One area of inaccuracy that does need some oversight is the lurid publishing in tabloid papers of health stories that are usually focussed on two main themes: health risks or dramatic breakthroughs in research and treatment. </p> <p>These stories suffer from very poor corroboration of often tenuous information and range from the faintly ridiculous to the downright dangerous. </p> <p>There is no excuse for not employing ethical principles. Facts can be validated when interviewing the scientist or medical professional. A couple of standard questions can put the story in context. Has this experiment/observation been corroborated elsewhere? If not, it is not scientifically valid and can be a potentially inaccurate and misleading story.</p> <h2>Why should ethical standards chill investigative journalism?</h2> <p><em>Turner then considers why, if statutory regulation and impartiality requirements do not chill investigative reporting on television, similar constraints should not apply to the press. It is further claimed that broadcasters rely on the press to break controversial stories and then follow up.</em></p> <p>There is little, if any, evidence that broadcasters wait for the printed press to break stories. David Levy of the Reuters Institute told Leveson of a 2009 study:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Broadcasters who do as much if not more investigative journalism than the press have to meet a two stage test set by Ofcom: first, is the infringement warranted: second, can you justify what you broadcast? </p> <p>There is no pre-broadcast censorship but a requirement to explain and defend your approach to the public interest... [the study's authors] found no evidence that the requirement has either hindered or prevented hard-hitting and important investigations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement describes the tried and tested methods of ensuring ethical standards are maintained in broadcast journalism, a platform already under tight enforceable guidelines. </p> <p>What appears to be suggested is that since broadcast can manage quite well that the imposition of an Ofcom-style regulation on the print media would not chill investigative journalism. </p> <p>But the hacking scandal is not about investigative journalism. The Leveson inquiry is not about investigative journalism, it is about media ethics and ultimately criminality. We have already seen that the two journalistic traditions of print and broadcast have starkly contrasting cultures as one would expect from beings born in different eras and for different reasons. </p> <p>Witness after witness stated that the purpose of the press is to inform the public and to hold powerful people to account. The purpose of the print media is principally to make money as was succinctly put by Jeremy Paxman in his statement to the inquiry:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The only thing that seems to concern newspaper proprietors more than articulating their prejudices is accumulating money.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The question is not therefore whether a new Ofcom-style regulatory body for the press would deter investigative journalism but would it so materially affect a newspaper tradition as to make it no longer viable.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Chris Atkins</strong>, the man who made the <em>Starsuckers</em> documentary, argues that the industry needs an independent regulator with a statutory backstop</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.

  "<p>I recently moved back to Berlin after four years in London, and it seems half of London had the same idea. When I walk down the familiar streets of my old neighbourhood, where the most exotic sight used to be the local kebab shop, I now hear posh kids from the home counties discuss their nightly exploits and see stylish Swedes sipping espressos. It all suddenly feels like Dalston.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to be able to move back into my old flat in Neuk\u00f6lln, one of Berlin's poorest districts with high crime rates and crumbling infrastructure, but ridiculously cheap rents. The money I used to pay for my room in north-east London would easily get you a decent two-bedroom flat here. Or, rather, it used to: rents here are suddenly skyrocketing. According to a recent article in Die Zeit, they rose <a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/2012/08/GS-Immobilien-Neukoelln/komplettansicht\" title=\"\">over 23% between 2007 and 2010</a>, the biggest increase over the whole city. Many locals are blaming \"the foreigners\", the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/no-entry-for-hipsters--berliners-unhappy-with-tourist-boom-20120917-2618m.html\" title=\"\">tourists and bohemians from Britain, Spain or Scandinavia</a>, for this sudden rent hike. Last year, Der Spiegel reported on a <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/neukoelln-nasties-foreigners-feel-accused-in-berlin-gentrification-row-a-750297.html\" title=\"\">backlash against the growing international community in the district</a>, spearheaded by one of the local bar-owners whose<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16116523\" title=\"\"> video manifesto</a> against \"the fucking students, artists and layabouts\" went viral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/16116523?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/16116523?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"460\" height=\"283\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16116523\">Offending the Clientele</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/retsina\">Sender FN / Retsina-Film</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p> </figure>  <p>Just a few months ago, a grumpy local told an English friend of mine who was having fun in one of the pubs in the area to \"go and laugh in your own country\".</p> <p>As understandable as this rage against supposedly gentrifying hipsters might be, it is odious and it is misdirected. Neuk\u00f6lln's rising rents are a just one symptom of a much broader development. While house prices continue to fall worldwide, they are on the rise in Germany, and the country's unlikely property hotspot has been Berlin. The capital has long been notorious for its languishing housing market, and its reputation as a mecca for alternative culture is very much founded on the oversupply of affordable living space. But these days might soon be over: according to a study by the economic thinktank Institut der Deutschen Wirtschaft, <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/money/20120802-44133.html\" title=\"\">property prices in the capital rose nearly 40% between 2003 and 2011</a>, far more than in the rest of Germany. And my run-down, dirty and scruffy old home is in the centre of the capital's housing boom. According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine, property auctions of the district council are suddenly <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/immobilien-berlin-berlin-wir-kaufen-in-berlin-11860667.html\" title=\"\">packed with estate agents, young families and professionals from around the world</a>. House prices in Neuk\u00f6lln have doubled in the last few years, and the new owners often try to get back their investment by raising the rent.</p> <p>How did it come to this? Ironically, it is the international financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble, that led to Berlin's property boom. Germans who normally would have invested their savings on the stock market are now putting their money into relatively secure real estate. This run on property is fuelled by historically low interest rates. And it's not only scared Germans who are looking for a secure investment: in their yearly forecast published in February, the self-styled \"wise men of the real estate industry\", an expert council of economists and analysts, glowingly reported on Germany's status as <a href=\"http://www.iz-shop.de/buch-1030/fruehjahrsgutachten-immobilienwirtschaft-2012-des-rates-der-immobilienweisen\" title=\"\">a \"safe haven\" for international property developers</a>. The boom has already alarmed the ministry of finance, which in June warned of <a href=\"http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/098/1709871.pdf\" title=\"\">\"first abnormal developments\" of the housing market in parts of the country's metropolitan areas</a>. Even the chairman of Berlin's association of estate agents has <a href=\"http://www.immobilien-zeitung.de/116882/trotz-preisanstieg-keine-blase-in-sicht\" title=\"\">recently spoken</a> out against unsustainable property prices in Neuk\u00f6lln. These are the weird ways of globalisation: a real estate crash in the US leads to a housing bubble in a run-down city-centre district in Germany a few years later.</p> <p>But these are no natural forces. They can be kept in check with the right policies, like a cap on rents or laws against property speculation. Decent, affordable housing is a basic right, for locals as well as for international students, artists and layabouts.</p>",
  "<p>Lonmin has moved closer to a deal with striking platinum miners after it emerged that workers had cut their basic wage demands.</p> <p>Miners at the Marikana mine in South Africa <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/south-african-unions-resume-talks?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">have been on strike for more than five weeks</a>, halting production and causing the mining company to warn it could breach its banking covenants at the end of this month.</p> <p>The strike turned violent last month, culminating in police shooting 34 miners. The unrest has since spread across the country's 60-mile-wide platinum belt, leaving a total of 45 people dead.</p> <p>The militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) was demanding a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3940) a month, but Lonmin said that would put thousands of jobs at risk and challenge the viability of the business. On Monday, the company said it would stop work on a new shaft and would not be hiring 1,200 contract workers.</p> <p>Bishop Jo Seoka, who has been mediating in the talks between Lonmin and workers at the Marikana mine, said the workers' demands had come down to below 11,000 rand a month, although this is still significantly more than the offer on the table. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/14/south-african-miners-reject-lonmin\" title=\"\">Lonmin has offered pay rises of 9-21%</a>,which at most would mean an increase to just 6,534 rand a month.</p> <p>Seoka remained upbeat about negotiations. He told Reuters on Tuesday: \"I'm very confident that something is going to happen today.\"</p> <p>Anglo American Platinum has also been the subject of violent protests and suspended operations last week when strikers marched on its shafts wielding machetes.

  "<p>Profits at JD Sports plunged in the first half of the year, hit by \u00a310m-worth of losses from Blacks, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/06/jdsports-wins-control-of-blacks\" title=\"\">it took out of administration in January</a>.</p> <p>The company, which paid \u00a320m for Blacks, said the outdoor chain was in a dire condition when it got the keys from the administrators, with a \"critical lack of stock and unsustainable cost base\".</p> <p>JD is best known for the eponymous sportswear chain that targets 18 to 24-year-olds with fashionable brands such as Adidas Originals, Converse and Fred Perry. Like-for-like sales in its core retail business ticked up 1.1% in the first half.</p> <p>The company's executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, said: \"As ever, the group result for the full-year remains very dependent on the sales and margin performance in December and January.\"</p> <p>Despite pressures on margin and rising taxes and other levies across Europe, he said full-year profit before tax should come within expectations of \u00a365-\u00a370m.</p> <p>That will take a monumental effort in the second half, as first-half pre-tax profits came in at just \u00a32.9m, tumbling from \u00a320.1m in the first half of last year. Revenues, meanwhile, rose 26% to \u00a3556m.</p> <p>Recent trading has been mixed with like-for-like sales in the sports shops up 3.2% in the six weeks to September, while like-for-like sales at JD's fashion stores dropped 6%.</p> <p>The company said the vast majority of losses at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/23/blacks-la-senza-head-administration\" title=\"\">Blacks</a> fell in the first three months of ownership and that business was stabilising. Stores are fully restocked, it said, and it continues with its programme of reorganising central costs. Cowgill expects Blacks to break even in the second half, before any restructuring costs.</p> <p>Elsewhere in retail, Debenhams said like-for-like sales rose 1.6% (excluding VAT) this year, despite \"extremely challenging market conditions\". In a trading update ahead of its full-year results, the store said pre-tax profits in the year to September should beat last year's total of \u00a3160m.</p> <p>The Debenhams chief executive, Michael Sharp, said: \"To deliver like-for-like sales growth in these extremely challenging market conditions is highly creditable.\" He said he did not expect a significant change in the economic environment in the near future.</p>",
  "<p>I'm in Thessaloniki, Greece's second city, which nestles on the coast next to Halkidiki's three peninsulas, snaking into the Aegean sea like tentacles. The peninsulas are an understandable tourist spot in Northern Greece, with their expansive beaches, street cafes and pine forests. Unfortunately, I can only visit two of them, Kassandra and Sithonia, because the third, Mount Athos, has banned all women for the past thousand years.</p> <p>Athos is a monastic peninsula, but also a state within Greece, with carefully secured ports and borders, preventing all women, and men without the necessary permits, from entering. Women aren't banned purely because their natural charms are prone to distract the monks from their prayer and study. Hundreds of years ago after several monks reported visions of the Virgin Mary, it was decided that the Athos monks should devote themselves to her, and that no other woman should be allowed to outshine her.</p> <p>All women were duly banished, from the peninsula, and with them all female animals. Sows, cows and ewes, even chickens were expelled. It was conceded that female songbirds and insects were allowed to remain, purely because it was impossible to keep them out. It's unclear exactly how plausible the danger of a chicken outshining the Virgin Mary is, but still. A rule's a rule.</p> <p>Nonetheless, women have managed to make it to the peninsula: the Orthodox monks harboured women and female children during the Greek civil war, in addition to men and boys. In 2008, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7421157.stm\" title=\"\">Ukrainian smugglers dropped four Moldovan women</a> on the coast of Athos, who were quickly apprehended by monks and police. The women were apologetic, but must have been cursing their bad luck at being dropped at the spot least likely to permit surreptitious entry into Greece.</p> <p>Not all interlopers were so innocent, though. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/month-among-men-Maryse-Choisy/dp/B0007HMRL6\" title=\"\">Maryse Choisy</a>, a French writer and patient of Freud, claimed to have undergone a double mastectomy in order to sneak into the monastic republic and pose as a servant boy. Suspicions grew, and Choisy was ejected after a month. A handful of women, including Syriza MP Litsa Ammanatidou-Paschalidou, scaled a fence and broke into Mount Athos in protest over a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Jan09/0,4675,GreeceMonasteryProtest,00.html\" title=\"\">long-running land dispute</a> with the monks. There's a long-running history in Greek political protest of <a href=\"http://exiledonline.com/dispatch-from-greece-yogurt-as-a-form-of-political-protest/\" title=\"\">hurling yoghurt at politicians</a> to make them look ridiculous. Hurling women over the fence of a male community loth to pay their taxes is a fitting adjunct to this fine tradition.</p> <p>Plotting to get on the peninsula doesn't get me very far. In order to enter Athos, you must apply for a pilgrim's pass, or \"patriarchal privilege\". I've spotted a fancy dress section in a shop at the top of Aristotelous Square, selling ostentatious fake beards and moustaches. Could this work? It seems not. I need to show my passport, and there is a very authoritative black \"F\" under the \"Sex\" section of mine, giving me away. I could parachute into Athos. But I lack the time or money to rent a helicopter and learn to parachute. Besides, I'm having horrific visions of landing chaotically, taking out a few monks and having to explain that I did it for feminism.</p> <p>After boarding a bus, and trekking to Ouranoupouli, the departure point for ferries to Athos, I approach the harbour. Yiannis, who works in the harbour and is easily bribed with a takeaway frapp\u00e9 into speaking to me shakes his head when I ask him if it's possible to get to Athos. \"Why would you want to?\" I like a challenge. He laughs again. \"The boats will take women no closer than half a kilometre to the beach. Some people say women have swum there, but I have never seen them\". Swimming! Of course. Apparently there are men patrolling the shores of Athos, watching for this sort of stunt. Though if the EU parliament presses ahead with legislation that will force Athos to admit women, having <a href=\"http://www.greekembassy.org/embassy/Content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&amp;folder=360&amp;article=11935\" title=\"\">declared in 2003</a> that the republic \"violates the universally recognised principle of gender equality\", they may need new jobs.</p> <p>Just before Yiannis finishes his coffee and heads off, leaving me to ponder the distance and whether my front crawl is strong enough, he has one more question. \"What would you do once you got there?\" He has a good point. Probably revel in triumph for a few minutes before realising that I had to find a way back; then feel increasing guilt that my symbolic stunt had caused a considerable amount of distress for any monks I happened upon.</p> <p>I decided to leave the monks in peace. Besides, their outfits are nearly as hot and uncomfortable as burqas. Why should a feminist punish them any more?</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft is urging Windows users to install a free piece of security software to protect PCs from a newly discovered \"zero-day\" security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser which hackers are already exploiting to take remote control of computers.</p> <p>\"We're aware of targeted attacks potentially affecting some versions of Internet Explorer,\" Microsoft said in a statement. </p> <p>The bug is found in IE 7, 8 and 9 and can be exploited on computers running XP, Vista and Windows 7, according to the security company Rapid7. </p> <p>With versions of IE in use on those platforms by hundreds of millions of people, Microsoft has taken the interim measure of offering free security software on its website (the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, EMET, at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29851\">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29851</a>) while it works on rolling out an update to harden the program. </p> <p>Zero-day vulnerabilities are rare, mostly because they are hard to identify \u2013 requiring highly skilled software engineers or hackers with lots of time to scrutinise code for holes that can be exploited to launch attacks.</p> <p>Security experts only disclosed discovery of eight major zero-day vulnerabilities in all of 2011, according to Symantec.</p> <p>Eric Romang, a researcher in Luxembourg, discovered the flaw on Friday when his PC was infected by a piece of malicious software known as Poison Ivy that hackers use to steal data or take remote control of PCs.</p> <p>When he analysed the infection, he learned that Poison Ivy had gotten on to his system by exploiting a previously unknown bug, or zero-day vulnerability, in IE.</p> <p>He suspected that it was the work of a hacking crew dubbed \"Nitro\" by the company because they had previously used zero-day exploits to hack into PCs used at chemicals companies, apparently to steal corporate data. </p> <p>\"Any time you see a zero-day like this, it is concerning,\" said Liam O Murchu, a research manager with antivirus software maker Symantec. \"There are no patches available. It is very difficult for people to protect themselves.\"</p> <p>But that makes zero-day flaws valuable to commercial and government hackers, and there is known to be a thriving underground business in which companies discover and sell zero-day hacks to others, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/secrecy-surrounding-zero-day-exploits-industry-spurs-calls-for-government-oversight/2012/09/01/46d664a6-edf7-11e1-afd6-f55f84bc0c41_story.html\">sometimes for hundreds of thousands of pounds</a>.</p> <p>Efforts by Microsoft, Google and Mozilla, whose IE, Chrome and Firefox browsers respectively make up the majority of desktop use, to offer bounties for telling them about zero-day flaws has had little effect on the business \u2013 although <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/exploits-security-tools-disappear-as-german-anti-hacker-law-takes-effect/444\">trading in them or distributing them for free is illegal in Germany</a>.</p> <p>Internet Explorer used to be the world's most widely-used browser, thanks to its position as the default on Microsoft's Windows software. But Google's Chrome, launched only in September 2008, has overtaken it, according to the web monitoring company StatCounter, which says that Chrome has 34% of the world market.</p> <p>IE has 33%, it says, and Firefox 23%. The next largest is Apple's Safari at 8%, it says.</p> <p>Symantec and other major antivirus software makers have already updated their products to protect customers against the newly discovered bug in Internet Explorer. Yet O Murchu said that might not be sufficient to ward off adversaries.</p> <p>\"The danger with these types of attacks is that they will mutate and the attackers will find a way to evade the defenses we have in place,\" he said.</p> <p>Some security experts said computer users should avoid Internet Explorer, even if they install Microsoft's EMET security tool.</p> <p>\"It doesn't appear to be completely effective,\" said Tod Beardsley, an engineering manager at Rapid7.</p> <p>Rapid7 released software on Monday that security experts can use to simulate attacks that exploit the security flaw in Internet Explorer to see whether corporate networks are vulnerable to that particular bug.</p> <p>But in a world where many businesses rely on software written specially to run on IE to carry out corporate functions, avoiding IE may simply not be feasible.</p> <p>And Marc Maiffret, chief technology officer of the security company BeyondTrust, pointed out that it may not be feasible for some businesses and consumers to install Microsoft's EMET tool on their PCs.</p> <p>He said the security software had in some cases proven to be incompatible with existing programs already running on networks.</p> <p>Dave Marcus, director of advanced research and threat intelligence with Intel's McAfee security division, said it might be a daunting task for home users to locate, download and install the EMET tool.</p> <p>\"For consumers, it might be easier to simply click on [Google's] Chrome,\" Marcus said.</p>",
  "<p>The trial of the flamboyant Chinese police chief who brought about the downfall of leader Bo Xilai concluded in south-western China on Tuesday, one day after a secret hearing took place behind closed doors.</p> <p>Wang Lijun faced charges of taking bribes and \"bending the law for selfish ends\", state news agency Xinhua reported.

Last month, a court <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/gu-kailai-suspended-death-sentence\" title=\"\">handed Gu a suspended death sentence for the murder of the 41-year-old.</a></p> <p>But it remains to be seen whether authorities will also try Bo, who has been under investigation by the party for unspecified disciplinary violations since April. Some analysts believe those at the top of the party are reluctant to do so because it would shed an unflattering light on senior leaders and might stir up Bo's supporters. Others think that indicting Wang for offences related to his duties indicates they are preparing the way for a criminal trial of his boss.</p>",
  "<p>The US military has suspended joint operations with Afghan forces because of a collapse in trust after a surge in the number of Americans and other Nato soldiers killed by the men they are fighting alongside or training.</p> <p>The chief US military officer, General Martin Dempsey, described the sharp rise in \"insider attacks\" by rogue Afghan soldiers and policemen, which saw four American and two British soldiers killed at the weekend, as \"a very serious threat to the campaign\" against the Taliban.</p> <p>American commanders said that joint operations on the ground will be suspended \"until further notice\" in a dramatic admission that the strategy to shift responsibility for fighting the insurgents to local forces has been deeply compromised by Afghan government soldiers and policemen killing 51 Nato soldiers in 36 attacks this year. At least 12 attacks were carried out last month alone, leaving 15 dead.</p> <p>The US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, described the attacks as the \"last gasp\" of a weakened Taliban. But the admission that Nato troops are no longer safe from the forces they are relying on to keep the Taliban at bay after the final US pullout in 2014 is a severe blow to Washington's military plans. </p> <p>Under the strategy, members of the soon to be 350,000 strong Afghan security forces gain experience patrolling and fighting alongside American and other foreign soldiers. But the killings have led to a collapse in trust.</p> <p>The US army said it is \"not walking away\" from Afghan military units and will continue to advise them. But Nato troops will patrol with them only when specific approval is given by a regional commander.</p> <p>American officials say the insider attacks are carried out by a mix of Taliban infiltrators dressed as soldiers, by insurgents who have got themselves recruited and Afghan soldiers angry about their treatment because of personal insults or cultural differences.</p> <p>US commanders had already assigned soldiers to guard their comrades as they slept, ate or interacted with Afghan forces because of the increasing number of \"insider killings\". American troops were also ordered to carry loaded weapons at all times, even inside their own bases.</p> <p>Nato attacks on Afghan civilians have added to the strain. In the latest, an air strike killed eight women and girls collecting firewood.</p> <p>The loss of trust in the force the US is relying on to prevent the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan again, compounds other concerns about Washington's strategy. The additional 33,000 soldiers Barack Obama despatched two years ago as part of the \"surge\" are expected to complete their withdrawal this week. The remaining 68,000 US troops are supposed to gradually shift responsibility to Afghan forces which, under the American strategy, are to take the lead in combat as early as next year.</p> <p>But despite gains on the battlefield, questions persist about whether the Afghan forces will have the ability and will to keep an undefeated Taliban at bay once Nato forces have left.</p>"
