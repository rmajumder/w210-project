  "<p>The fiasco of the west coast main line rail franchise bids could have been avoided if the government had not cancelled an external audit to save money, according to people who have worked at the Department for Transport.</p> <p>The fiasco, revealed after First Group won the contract to run the line instead of Virgin Trains, could end up costing the government up to \u00a3100m, while the financial audit would not have cost more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>Patrick McLoughlin, the minister of transport, will give a statement to the House of Commons this week on an investigation into the bid and the arrangements for management of the line when Virgin's contract runs out in December. The government has asked Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, who also sits on the board of the DfT, to carry out an inquiry. Critics point out that Laidlaw's inquiry cannot be independent if he's a board member.</p> <p>Civil servants and ministers say that it was normal practice to employ financial auditors, such as PwC, to check the calculations and methods used by civil servants in awarding contracts. An independent audit is also a useful way of deflecting charges or accusations of incompetence or bias.</p> <p>A spokesman for the DfT refused to confirm while Laidlaw was carrying out his inquiry that a financial audit was not carried out on the bid.</p> <p>McLoughlin described \"serious errors\" in the bidding process carried out under Justine Greening, who is now minister for international development but was then transport secretary. The initial cost of the suspension of the franchise is estimated to be \u00a340m but three other franchise bids have also been suspended, which will incur further costs.</p> <p>Stephen Joseph of the Campaign for Better Transport said he had also been told that the absence of an external financial audit was a factor. \"What we have heard is that the government completely changed the nature of the franchise, cut the number of civil servants by one third and then would not allow them to employ external auditors. None of this has been passenger-focused, it has all been about the bottom line,\" he said.</p> <p>The civil servants' error was in producing spreadsheets that mixed up real and inflated figures and included double accounting. A financial audit would have uncovered mistakes and could have saved the government from the massive costs it now faces.</p> <p>Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said the government's rush to cut spending was instrumental in the franchise failure. \"It will add insult to injury if \u00a340m and rising of taxpayers' money has gone down the drain because of shortsighted shortcuts made by ministers, designed to save money but ending up costing vastly more,\" she said.</p> <p>Three members of the Professional and Commercial Services Union, who have been suspended by the DfT for their role, are understood to be furious that they have been made scapegoats for ministerial mistakes. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: \"Having cut resources to the bone, in the name of austerity, ministers have shamefully sought to blame civil servants.\"</p>",
  "<p>It has become a bellwether for the City, its fortunes closely mirroring those of the Square Mile's high rollers. So perhaps unsurprisingly, given the current economic turbulence, Britain's most famous chain of lapdancing clubs appears to have been experiencing a bumpy ride of its own.</p> <p>In the week that it applied to run the country's first 24-hour lapdancing club, in London's Tottenham Court Road, Spearmint Rhino has filed accounts showing that it ran up a loss of \u00a32.1m in 2011.</p> <p>The figure \u2013 some \u00a31.4m more than the loss from the previous year \u2013 was despite the company's clubs pulling in an impressive \u00a39.9m in revenue, up from \u00a38.5m the previous year.</p> <p>But the chain's critics are unlikely to shed too many tears. \"Any profit that lapdancing clubs like Spearmint Rhino make is off the back of exploiting women. It is time that councils use their licensing powers effectively to clamp down on these sexist sex establishments,\" said Anna van Heeswijk, acting chief executive of Object, the campaign group that opposes lapdancing clubs.</p> <p>Operating profits at the chain fell to \u00a3429,000, down from more than \u00a3500,000, but rising administration costs and ill-fated business ventures drove the company's figures deeper into the red.</p> <p>The small print reveals that the company, which paid \u00a33.5m in wages to its 162 employees in 2011, was forced to write off a \u00a32.8m loan to a related company. It also shows that the company's founder and director, John Gray, believed to have been paid a salary of \u00a3304,000, resigned in April and that no dividend was paid.</p> <p>And there are further financial demands on the company to be resolved. The accounts reveal that the company owes HM Revenue and Customs more than \u00a32m, which it has agreed to repay under a \"time to pay\" agreement.</p> <p>In addition, the accounts confirm that the chain owes Spearmint Rhino Worldwide Inc, the company that owns 12 clubs in the US, almost \u00a33m.</p> <p>An HMRC spokeswoman said that it could not discuss the tax affairs of an individual business. She explained: \"A time to pay arrangement is given on a case by case basis. The amount of tax and revised payment schedule can vary dependent on how much is owed and over what period of time. Interest is still payable on tax paid late, even if through a time to pay arrangement.\"</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino's battles with the Revenue go back years. In 2007, it successfully appealed against a ruling that it had to pay VAT on the earnings of its dancers. David Milne QC, representing Spearmint Rhino, argued that the club should not pay because it was \"the dancer and not the club that provided the services\". The ruling meant that the chain's lapdancers were potentially liable for VAT.</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino has been at the forefront of the UK's lapdancing revolution, which has seen the number of clubs soar to 300 \u2013 a 50% increase compared with 10 years ago. The Lapdancing Association claims that 25,000 people in the UK now work in an industry that generates \u00a32bn a year.</p> <p>But the rise in the number of clubs now appears to have been checked. A law change in 2009 meant that the clubs were classed as a \"sex encounter venue\" and subject to more stringent licensing conditions.</p> <p>Many cities have now stopped granting licences to new clubs while others, notably Oxford, has declined to renew them.</p> <p>Spearmint Rhino, whose Birmingham club is reputedly the largest lapdancing venue in the UK, has itself retrenched. It now runs only five clubs, compared with nine in 2008. However, its management has said it has plans to expand and to take on 60 new dancers.</p> <p>Requests for comment from the company were not returned.</p>",
  "<p>Police have been accused of luring young&#xa0;people to commit crime after a \"honey trap\" pawn shop staffed by undercover officers was used to trade stolen goods.</p> <p>More than 100 people are believed to have been convicted, many for illegally trading passports and driving licences, at the covert Scotland Yard store in Cricklewood, north London.</p> <p>Lawyers have condemned the ploy, claiming it may have encouraged young people to commit offences by giving the impression that they could make easy money by trading ID documents at the shop.</p> <p>Up to half of those convicted, they believe, had no serious history of criminality and some of those convicted sold their own passports or those of consenting relatives for up to \u00a3200 at the store, called TJ's Trading Post.</p> <p>Jennifer Twite, policy adviser at Just for Kids Law, a legal charity that helps young people caught up in the criminal justice system, said: \"It concerns me that this operation may have encouraged people to commit crime, which is damaging both to society and to those who may not have otherwise ever received a criminal record.</p> <p>\"Particularly unfortunate were those cases where people were selling their own passports or those who had never been in trouble before.\"</p> <p>Shauneen Lambe, executive director of Just for Kids Law, added that the operation was costly to the taxpayer but that also a criminal record would limit job prospects for the young people who had been caught.</p> <p>\"I believe a police force should exist to prevent crime, not create it. But this use of police resources is concerning to me not only as a lawyer for young people but also as a taxpayer.\"</p> <p>Lambe, whose early career was spent fighting death row cases in the US alongside campaigning lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith, added: \"The cost for imprisoning these people is likely to run into the millions let alone the increased costs of criminalising people who will now struggle, if they didn't before, to get employment. It seems to me to be a singular action driven by the police to show statistical success.\"</p> <p>David Wilson, professor of criminology at the Centre for Criminal Justice Policy and Research at Birmingham City&#xa0;University, said: \"I hope this has not been an attempt to create better clear-up statistics. We need to prioritise crimes that do the most damage to communities&#xa0;\u2013 do they really feel this was the best use of police time and resources?\"</p> <p>Police masqueraded as staff in the store for 12 months from February 2011 as part of Operation Gemini, which was designed to tackle \"high levels of acquisitive crime\" within the north London areas of Child's Hill and Barnet.</p> <p>Inside, TJ's Trading Post was wired with CCTV and recording equipment, with the vast majority of those subsequently charged pleading guilty, according to their lawyers.</p> <p>Operation Gemini was a component of Operation Galaxy, set up in October 2010 to identify and prosecute burglars in Barnet. In August, the Met announced that the operation had resulted in the arrest of 27 people during dawn raids across the north of the city.</p> <p>Although the Met does not discuss the frequency, type or location of similar undercover operations, the tactic has been used successfully before. In a \u00a3500,000 sting codenamed Operation Peyzac, undercover officers staffed a fully-operating rap and hip-hop music store whose private back room was used to carry out deals with drug and gun sellers.</p> <p>Peyzac resulted in a total of 37 armed criminals and drug dealers, including 30 gang members, being jailed for a total of more than 400 years following the operation in the shop, called Boombox, in Edmonton, north London.</p> <p>Wilson said that usually such elaborate undercover operations were, as with Operation Peyzac, reserved for tackling \"serious crime\"; he cited the routine success of undercover officers infiltrating internet chatrooms to catch paedophiles. Lawyers agree the two operations are not comparable because one targeted armed criminals while Operation Gemini, according to Lambe, appeared to end up targeting \"low-hanging fruit\".</p>",
  "<p>Shisha cafe culture is spreading across the UK, prompting health campaigners to call for venues allowing customers to smoke the distinctive pipes to be subject to tough new licensing laws.</p> <p>Experts fear many shisha smokers are unaware of the health risks they are taking. They claim that shisha smoking \u2013 inhaling flavoured tobacco smoke after it has passed through a water basin \u2013 is significantly more damaging than smoking normal cigarettes.</p> <p>A survey soon to be published by the anti-smoking group Ash says an increasing number of people have tried smoking shisha pipes. \"Around one in 10 adults have tried shisha but sustained use is very rare,\" an Ash spokesman said. \"Users are typically younger men and from particular ethnic communities.\"</p> <p>Figures collected by the British Heart Foundation detail a 210% increase in the number of shisha bars in the UK over five years. In 2007, there were estimated to be 179 bars, compared with 556 this year.</p> <p>In some cities the number of shisha cafes is soaring. Manchester City Council has launched an eight-week health awareness campaign warning of the health risks of smoking shisha pipes after finding that around 30 new shisha bars had opened in the city since 2009.</p> <p>\"There has been an alarming rise in the number of shisha bars and the number of young people taking up smoking through this route,\" the city's public health director, David Regan, told <em>Environmental Health News</em>.</p> <p>Experts said they were concerned many people were unaware of the risks associated with smoking shisha pipes. The BHF survey found that 84% of people thought that using a shisha pipe for an hour was equivalent to inhaling the smoke of 10 cigarettes. In fact, according to the BHF, it is like more than 100.</p> <p>\"The worrying perception is that shisha is safer than cigarettes, but it's not,\" said Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation. \"Despite the wholesome-sounding flavours, shisha tobacco is just as dangerous and is linked to the same life-threatening diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.\"</p> <p>Knapton said there was a need for a change in the law.</p> <p>\"At the moment, you don't need a licence to sell tobacco and shisha but we'd like this to change,\" he said. \"Positive licensing means local councils would have the power to control the number of places selling tobacco and shisha in their area and monitor places for harmful activity such as underage smoking, or smoking indoors. It also means we'd know definitively how many shisha bars there were, and where they were located, so we could target health awareness campaigns more effectively.\"</p> <p>This year the BHF staged pretend shisha lounges at a number of festivals around the UK, which showed a short film on the health risks of shisha pipes.</p> <p>In Westminster, there are now an estimated 150 shisha cafes. The council says some are allowing customers to smoke inside \u2013 the equivalent of a pub lock-in \u2013 and it has taken action in recent months against a number of shisha cafes that let customers smoke in their basements.</p> <p>\"The smoking ban was introduced for health reasons and there have been several prosecutions where shisha has been smoked in the basements of premises, whch really is playing fast and loose with people's wellbeing,\" said Alastair Moss, Westminster city council's deputy cabinet member for the built environment.</p> <p>\"Because of the smoking ban, more and more shisha activity is appearing outside the front and rears of cafes. The trend shows no signs of slowing and the concentration of smells appears to be another issue we will have to look at.\"</p>",
  "<p>Such were the state-level machinations behind the failed merger of BAE Systems and EADS, both companies should put the UN on a retainer alongside their investment bank advisors in case they attempt to go through that tortuous rigmarole again. History enthusiasts will have revelled in the revival of Bismarck-era realpolitik by Angela Merkel, who saw through the benefits for Britain's largest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus, and decided there was nothing in it for Germany.</p> <p>But if the past is to be a guide to what BAE does next, then we should cast our minds back to the 1970s, when the British state owned equity in industrial champions such as Rolls-Royce and British Leyland. The Unite trade union had called the proposed BAE/EADS merger an \"unequal negotiation\" because Britain did not own a block of shares in its biggest manufacturing employer, while France and Germany owned 22.35% each. Without such an interest, Unite argues, it does not have the leverage to seek a jobs guarantee from talks. Instead the UK has a \"golden share\" in BAE that blocks foreign ownership but leaves it in a more passive role when France and Germany are actively negotiating the future of EADS and what happens to its 133,000 employees.</p> <p>However, this deal was about Britain trying to reclaim a golden share in another business: Airbus. BAE, and thus much of our high-skilled manufacturing base, is wired into mature defence markets in the UK and US, with Airbus offering lucrative diversity as a civil aerospace powerhouse. The UK used to, effectively, own a golden share in Airbus through BAE's stake in the business, which it sold in 2006. The consequences of that have been clear to view over the past month: David Cameron cheerleading BAE's reintegration into Airbus as a means of securing the future of one of the UK's remaining industrial giants. The government has returned to the 1970s with a strategy of picking industrial winners and aerospace is one of them, but the damage was done when Labour sold the Airbus stake in 2006.</p> <p>Now we must ensure that, having been locked out of the Airbus tent by the French and German governments, the UK remains a leading player in aerospace. The government must act as though it has a golden share in the entire industry and pump money, policy efforts and diplomacy into maintaining Britain's status as the go-to nation for everything from carbon-fibre wings and airliner engines to search-and-rescue helicopters.</p> <p>The UK does 15% of Airbus manufacturing work, at world-class wing facilities in Broughton and Filton, but that used to be closer to 20%. Only by continuing to produce the best aerospace whizzes in the world will it have any hope of maintaining that. Tom Enders, boss of EADS, warned last year that aircraft manufacturing would no longer be a Eurocentric activity at Airbus. \"The best way [to retain Airbus work] is for governments to finance and invest in intellectual infrastructure and support research and technology so that we have a basis to work in the UK in the long term,\" he said. Despite his German nationality, Enders is concerned only with competing in a global market where China is set to break open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly.</p> <p>Maintaining the UK's position as an industrial power \u2013 which it still is, once you cast aside nostalgia for the 70s \u2013 in the face of this competition requires political consensus, as any aerospace executive will tell you. The seeds of the technological breakthroughs in Broughton and Filton were sown decades ago, as evidenced by the number of former apprentices at the top of BAE's and Airbus's UK operations.</p> <p>If France and Germany will not let the UK have corporate influence over the commanding heights of civil aerospace, then successive administrations will have to keep the country there on merit. That means announcements such as this year's \u00a360m investment in a centre of excellence for aerodynamics need to come regularly, and often.</p> <h2>In Love with Swann<br></h2> <p>WH Smith: isn't it wonderful? Don't you love being badgered at the till to buy a cut-price chunk of chocolate? Isn't it great how it's one of the few places at airports you can buy a bottle of water to replace the one that's just been confiscated at the security gate?</p> <p>For most shoppers, the answers to these questions will be a resounding \"no\". It's irritating to be invited, by staff clearly bored of repeating their lines, to load up on Terry's chocolate oranges. And it's only natural to resent the chain's status as near-monopoly supplier of water at airports. A WH Smith's is not a place to cheer the soul.</p> <p>But the business is a minor retailing miracle. WH Smug, as it was dubbed decades ago by Private Eye, has become WH Savvy during Kate Swann's nine years at the helm.</p> <p>As she announced her departure as chief executive this week, the financial statistics for Swann's reign are impressive. Total shareholder return \u2013 dividends plus increase in share price \u2013 since 2004 has been roughly 300%, second only to Next among major retailers. Yet back then, sceptics thought WH Smith was travelling the same sorry road as Woolworths because of its reliance on CDs and DVDs.</p> <p>Swann's key strategy \u2013 and where the leaders of Woolies failed \u2013 was to act early and boldly. The old entertainment lines have been shrunk from 25% of the business to 2%. She also recognised that shops in airports and railway stations offered two gifts to any retailer: they have a captive audience, and the rents are usually turnover-related, which substantially reduces risk. So get more of them. Much of the rest of the revolution relied on a never-ending search for efficiencies in the distribution network.</p> <p>A retail genius? No, just a skilled nuts-and-bolts operator who doesn't waste time on visionary flim-flam. Any number of large retailers could use one of those \u2013 the job offers will come thick and fast. Just don't expect the shopping experience at Swann's next employer to be as uplifting as the share price.</p> <h2>Branching out<br></h2> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland was forced to announce on Friday that it had abandoned its attempt to sell off 316 branches to Santander. That's bad news for Stephen Hester, for whom the deal was meant to mark the latest successful stage in the complex task of shrinking the bailed-out bank.</p> <p>He will now have to cast around for other potential buyers, whose bargaining power is bound to be boosted by the fact that he is under pressure to pull off the sale by the end of 2013, the deadline set by the European commission when the taxpayer rescued the bank.</p> <p>For any of Britain's put-upon bank customers hoping for an upstart to shake up the market, however, Santander's withdrawal could just be good news. The government has been angling for new \"challenger banks,\" to threaten the stranglehold of the Big Four. Whether it's Virgin, the Co-op \u2013 which is already buying more than 600 Lloyds branches \u2013 or startup NBNK, a cut-price fire sale may be another small step towards giving the big boys a run for our money.</p>",

In one scene the boy's parents are watching a horror movie on TV as he creeps back from the pet cemetery having dug up his dead pup. The parents (voiced by Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short) are cuddling on the sofa in front of what turns out to be the 1958 Hammer Horror version of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051554/\" title=\"\"><em>Dracula</em></a>, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and, of course, restored by BFI and Hammer in 2007.

She does it very well \u2013 so well, in fact, that I hear <em>Pusher</em>'s original director, Nicolas Winding Refn, is writing a follow-up movie for her character. \"I think she's brilliant,\" Nicolas told me. \"There's much more to her in <em>Pusher </em>that we had to leave out but she's so beautiful on screen. She could have been a silent movie star.\"</p> <p>Despite moving to Hollywood, Agyness will often be back in Britain as the film parts roll in. She's shooting <em>Sunset Song</em> for Terence Davies in January, opposite Peter Mullan, who will play her father in the adaptation of&#xa0;Lewis Grassic Gibbon's tough Scottish tale. I jokingly mentioned that this being a Terence Davies movie, she'd probably be roped into a pub singalong and she squealed: \"Yes, we just did a script reading the other day, and there's a singalong.

In his tough-talking yet warmly delivered LFF keynote speech to the industry at BFI Southbank, Harvey swore that, after the US elections, he would be getting together with internet companies such as Apple and Google and, on what he said would be \"a day of&#xa0;reckoning\", would be making them \"an offer they can't refuse\".</p> <p>Harvey likened the free availability of films and other content on the internet to going into a clothes store and taking some shirts, \"because we believe in free shirts. It's a nonsensical idea.\" He then treated the audience to clips of some of his favourite movies, many of which featured John Wayne, including <em>Rio Bravo</em>, <em>Fort Apache</em> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038160/\" title=\"\"><em>They Were Expendable</em></a>.</p> <p>Harvey also took a swipe at Clint Eastwood following the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-obama-gop-convention-video\" title=\"\">actor's recent appearance</a> at the Republican convention. \"I love the man, but I just don't like his politics.

  "<p>Both of Britain's Royal Ballet companies have been dancing <em>Swan Lake</em> this month, and both have seen significant debuts. In Birmingham, Trinidad-born C\u00e9line Gittens became the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/23/celine-gittens-tyrone-singleton-interview\" title=\"\">first black dancer to perform the lead</a> with a British company, while at&#xa0;Covent Garden former Bolshoi star&#xa0;Natalia Osipova gave her own highly individual account. Both dancers were visibly feeling their way in the dual ballerina roles of Odette and Odile.</p> <p>Gittens is not by nature a lyrical, legato performer, but she dances from the heart and with her huge, expressive eyes, and involves you from the first moment in her character's story. As <a href=\"http://www.brb.org.uk/masque/index.htm?act=Production&amp;urn=537\" title=\"\"><strong>Birmingham Royal Ballet</strong>'s Black Swan</a>, she is less vamp than exultant teenager, thrilled at her newfound sexual power and dispatching her fouett\u00e9s with breathless, look-at-me excitement.</p> <p>But then this is a performance of touchingly blurred boundaries. Gittens is not yet a dancer of consummate fluency, but she offers herself to the audience with a trust that is as moving as it is irresistible. It helps that she is framed by one of the world's finest productions of the ballet. Peter Wright's choreography (after Petipa and Ivanov) is crystalline in its beauty and narrative clarity, while Philip Prowse's darkly atmospheric designs suggest the 19th-century gothic revival of Pugin. Tyrone Singleton's sensitive, world-weary Siegfried provides Gittens with a fine romantic foil, partnering her with self-effacing tact, and William Bracewell is a sympathetic and elegant Benno. Delia Mathews, who also made a notable debut as Odette-Odile this month, commands the attention with a Swan Maiden of serene authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397637566\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/11/1349975599352/Swan-Lake-by-the-Royal-Ba-008.jpg\" alt=\"Swan Lake by the Royal Ballet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Swan Lake at the Royal Opera House. Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The contrast with the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/swan-lake-by-anthony-dowell\" title=\"\"><strong>Royal Ballet</strong> production</a> is striking. Few would take exception to Anthony Dowell's assiduously researched choreographic text, but aside from the swan passages, this is now buried under layers of specious business.</p> <p>Act 1 is a near-illegible rout, with Carlos Acosta's Siegfried pacing for what seems like hours among fatuously quaffing courtiers, emptily gesturing bystanders and tidal waves of gurning peasantry. Act 2 starts badly too, with an inane scene of comedy drunkenness from Siegfried's companions. And then, effortlessly transcending the foolishness around her, Osipova makes her entrance.</p> <p>Like Gittens she is not a natural Swan Queen. Petite and gamine, she is a natural soubrette, and it's unlikely that she would have been given Odette-Odile at the Bolshoi (which is undoubtedly one of the reasons why she left, and is now principal dancer with the Mikhailovsky Ballet in St Petersburg and with American Ballet Theatre). If she doesn't quite succeed in convincing us of Odette's tragedy, however, she does give us dancing of exquisite assurance and control. No grandstanding, no exhibitionistic Russian port de bras; all is pared back to choreographic first principles, to steely line and form. It's an affecting, intelligent and closely considered reading. This is Odette as creature of&#xa0;the wild, flinchingly shy but gradually and warily warming to Acosta's courtship.</p> <p>As Odile, Osipova is on more familiar ground, cutting loose with a display of minxy mischief culminating in fouett\u00e9s of eye-popping speed and virtuosity. At times her comic playing becomes a little broad, but in this she may be influenced by the breathtaking vulgarity of the Act 3 set and the dismayingly low-camp behaviour around her. Acosta provides noble support, and there are fine individual performances by Claire Calvert, Paul Kay and Yuhui&#xa0;Choe, but not even a star of Osipova's lustre can disguise the&#xa0;fact that this production has long since run its course.</p>",
  "<p>It's a shame that while the latest instalment in the near-universally praised <em>NBA&nbsp;2K</em> series is certainly a highly polished and impressively deep basketball sim, it doesn't feel quite as good as its immediate predecessors.</p> <p><em>2K13</em> has everything in the right place; it's undoubtedly one of the finest representations of NBA basketball that's ever been developed. Gameplay is frenetic and thrilling, and easily tweaked to forgive novice players or challenge veterans as needed. The control system offers an almost unfathomably large number of ways to outplay your opponent, while the \"My Career\" mode fleshes out the self-indulgent joy of guiding a created character to fame and glory in entertaining ways. Even the slick presentation, overseen by rapper Jay-Z, feels smartly placed and exciting (providing you like Jay-Z).</p> <p>What seems lacking is any great leap forward. The numerous tweaks and adjustments are almost all wisely handled, but anyone with a well-worn copy of <em>2K12</em> may wind up feeling a little underwhelmed.</p>",
  "<p>The traditional <em>Fable</em> games, with their complex RPG mechanics, aren't the sort of titles you'd expect to find using Microsoft's Kinect motion sensor, a device best known for its simplistic dancing and sports titles. But for <em>Fable: The Journey,</em> developer Lionhead has tried to prove the two can work together, but with mixed results.</p> <p>The title puts players into the role of reluctant hero Gabriel, who must drive a horse-drawn cart and use magic to defeat an ancient evil. So far, so <em>Fable</em>. But here, the game is entirely on rails and plays a little like an interactive movie, with pretty visuals, a strong story, impressive voice acting and the series' trademark British humour.</p> <p>But the real star is Gabriel's horse Seren, who you'll develop a genuine bond with throughout the adventure. Unfortunately, despite the developer's best efforts, the Kinect controls don't always work. Whereas one moment deadly accuracy is displayed when shooting a goblin-like Hobbes from afar, the next might result in missing an immense troll staring you in the face, annoyingly leading to you being killed for no discernible reason.</p> <p>While <em>Fable: The Journey</em> is by no means a bad game, you can't help but feel it would have been far better with a controller.</p>",
  "<p>\"IT'S RADIOHEAD NIGHT!\" shouts the menu poster outside the bar'n'grill just inside the O2 Arena's doors. \"PARTY LIKE A ROCK STAR!\" At first you just roll your eyes at the crater-sized disconnect between knee-jerk corporate food marketing and the ethos of the band whose name is being taken in vain in block caps. Even when Radiohead were a conventional outfit, singing grunge-pop ditties such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkzRNyygfk\" title=\"\">Creep</a>, their image was that of haughty refuseniks, not shirtless Lotharios lairily gnawing buffalo wings. Thom Yorke had publicly aligned his band with the aesthetically disaffected, the creeps and the weirdos.</p> <p>Twenty years on, Radiohead remain one of the biggest bands in the world, one uncommonly in control of their own destiny. They are label-less and immune to corporate pressure. The last laugh is very much theirs. So your eye-roll becomes more of a subtle air-punch. There is no little heroism in the fact that the Oxfordshire five-piece can come to giant sheds like these and sell them out with their jazz-tinged electronic rock, sung in falsetto by a nervy mendicant type sporting a beard and a top-knot.</p> <p>Thom Yorke \u2013 just a day past his 44th birthday \u2013 is an especially magnetic presence tonight, dancing like a marionette plugged into the mains, his good mood evident. He has to break off from the start of Daily Mail, he's chuckling so much. \"A quality newspaper,\" he mugs.</p> <p>The slightly nerdy impression of Radiohead's first London gig in four years is that tricksy, headphone-friendly albums such as last year's <em>The King of Limbs</em> can, when placed in an arena, sound quite like proper arena rock. Radiohead's songs can be simple, of course. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYayAL-Mal0\" title=\"\">Karma Police</a>, from 1997's <em>OK Computer</em>, gets an airing and a huge cheer. By contrast, Like Spinning Plates, previously a staticky wobble on record, becomes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJh03drmvxI\" title=\"\">an affecting piano ballad</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWuqnZJgtCU\" title=\"\">Separator</a>, too, has easy-going breakbeats, country guitar and a consolatory air that is rare in Radiohead's emotional palette. It's not all cerebral stuff.</p> <p>But mostly, Radiohead are here to unleash fiercely discomfiting rhythmic workouts that, tonight, require two real drummers (Phil Selway and touring helpmeet Clive Deamer, of Portishead) and quite often some programming too. On an emotional There There in the encore, it's four drummers: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8n6g6waZqc\" title=\"\">guitarists Jonny Greenwood and Ed O'Brien get to bash mini-kits</a>.</p> <p>It all sounds utterly live. A tricksy Lotus Flower is the opener, and it virtually roars with real-time musicianship, not mere harnessed technology. Fringe flapping, Jonny Greenwood dashes around all night, playing a sequence of alternative instruments \u2013 tambourine, keyboard, laptop, some kind of Theremin and effects pedals.</p> <p>The visual technology is impressive. An arrangement of 10 screens hang in the air, tilting at a different angle for every song. Radiohead frequently make the most of the dead air space between their heads and the ceiling; their 2008 tour featured some terrific light-up stalactites. This year's hanging screens display live feeds of the various band members playing intently (they are probably counting hard in their heads). At one splendid point, on 15 Step, the screens unite and point downwards to form a bright turquoise light-roof over the band. It's like one of those lights that helps seasonal affective disorder, but on an industrial scale.</p> <p><em>The King of Limbs</em> was not quite the big-selling, high-charting two fingers to corporate convention that its predecessor, <em>In Rainbows</em>, was. It was the first of their albums to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Limbs#Reception\" title=\"\">fail to claim the Number 1 chart spot in the UK since 1995's <em>The Bends</em></a>. And this tour is pushing it a year late, and relatively gently in this country: this is one of only three UK gigs. By contrast, their summer tour of the US was more comprehensive. But the prevailing mood in the crowd is one of rapt attention, repaid by a double encore.</p> <p>Post-<em> Limbs</em>, Radiohead's direction of travel seems to be signposted by the slinky new track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJ8WuueP7s\" title=\"\">Identikit</a>, which features the dual vocals of Yorke and O'Brien. It's by far their most accessible&nbsp;tune for some time. Whether or not it signposts anything of significance is, of course, unclear. What's plain tonight, though, is that this is a band taking their rock responsibilities seriously. Having picked up an entire demographic and, with 2000's <em>Kid A</em>, plonked them down somewhere very much left of field, Radiohead can still do arenas very nicely indeed.</p>",
  "<p>The first two books I bought when I arrived in New York as a graduate student in August 1957 were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/william-h-whyte\" title=\"\">William H Whyte</a>'s <em>The Organization Man</em> and a special edition of the avant-garde quarterly <a href=\"http://www.evergreenreview.com/b/\" title=\"\"><em>Evergreen Review</em></a> on the \"San Francisco scene\". They complemented each other. Whyte's book is a devastating assault on American conformity by a senior editor of the business magazine <em>Fortune</em>. The <em>Evergreen</em> special was a celebration of the countercultural artists soon to be famous as leaders of the beat generation, and the writers featured as members of the San Francisco scene were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/allen-ginsberg\" title=\"\">Allen Ginsberg</a>, whose poem \"Howl\" was published earlier that year, and Jack Kerouac, whose <em>On the Road</em> was to be the literary sensation of 1957 when it appeared a month or so later.</p> <p>During that autumn my principal term paper for a class on magazine writing at Indiana University's journalism school was called \"The Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men\", contrasting the revolutionary cultural movements on either side of the Atlantic: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/kingsley-amis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a>'s <em>Lucky Jim</em>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/john-osborne\" title=\"\">John Osborne</a>'s <em>Look Back in Anger</em> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/colin-wilson\" title=\"\">Colin Wilson</a>'s <em>The Outsider</em> up against \"Howl\" and <em>On the Road</em>. They were all reacting against hollow, regimented postwar societies, but as I recall it I found the American writers altogether more positive, expansive and ebullient than their bitter British&#xa0;contemporaries.</p> <p>These memories are prompted, of course, by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's film version of \"Howl\", which opened here last year, and the Brazilian Walter Salles's bold, faithful adaptation of <em>On the Road</em>, some five years or more in preparation. Salles made a fine film in 2004 of <em>The Motorcycle Diaries</em>, Che Guevara's account of discovering his native continent and finding himself while travelling around Latin America with an Argentinian friend. This can be seen as preparation for the larger task of bringing to the screen Kerouac's autobiographical novel of crisscrossing the United States in battered cars, by bus or hitchhiking in the years immediately after the second&#xa0;world war, constantly meeting up with the charismatic Neal Cassady. A hard-living, yea-saying individualist, Cassady is an extreme egotist, constantly on the move, who exploits the women around him. Kerouac, who&#xa0;figures in the novel as Sal Paradise (Sam Riley), is a shy, academically inclined 25-year-old in 1947 when he and Cassady, called Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund) in the book, meet and agree to tutor each other. Sal becomes Dean's literary mentor; Dean&#xa0;instructs introvert Sal in the liberated beat existence of sex and drugs and bebop.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9vsE0llyBM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9vsE0llyBM?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In addition to being a Bildungsroman about Kerouac/Paradise's own development as man and writer, <em>On the Road</em> is about the creation of a new literary wave, the soubriquet \"beat generation\" obviously echoing \"lost generation\", the title Gertrude Stein bestowed on Hemingway, Fitzgerald and their expatriate comrades in arms after the first world war. So the novel and film also feature Allen Ginsberg, thinly disguised as the bearded, bespectacled Carlo Marx (Tom Sturridge), and William Burroughs (played by Viggo Mortensen) figures as Old Bull Lee. In a brilliant cameo, Mortensen gets Burroughs's flat, wry voice exactly right as he denounces Moriarty as psychotic, exposes how the English translation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/classics/9781847492401/journey-to-the-end-of-the-night\" title=\"\"><em>Voyage au bout de la nuit</em></a> bowdlerises C\u00e9line's original, and hilariously demonstrates his version of Wilhelm Reich's ludicrous, once fashionable orgone boxes for the control of psychic energy.</p> <p>Back in 1980, John Byrum made <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080854/\" title=\"\"><em>Heart Beat</em></a>, an interesting, highly romantic movie about the triangular relationship between Kerouac (John Heard), Cassady (Nick Nolte) and Cassady's first wife, Carolyn (Sissy Spacek). It had an outsize performance by Nolte (with echoes of Anthony Quinn's Zorba) and a visual style that resembled, and at certain points recreated, paintings by Edward Hopper. Salles's film is much harsher visually, and often as not he shows the itinerant life \u2013 winter on the road, life in seedy hotels, badly paid casual work \u2013 as no better than it was for the unemployed back in the 1930s. Salles is also more critical than the novel is of Moriarty's casually exploitative attitude to women, and by assembling a remarkable cast \u2013 Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, Amy Adams, Elisabeth Moss \u2013 he gives far greater depth and substance to Kerouac's thinly conceived female characters. The overall effect, however, is to make Moriarty a far less attractive figure than he is when seen exclusively from Kerouac's point of view.</p> <p>Salles and his screenwriter Jos\u00e9 Rivera give shape to what many have seen \u2013 wrongly I think \u2013 as a rambling, incoherent narrative. They make powerfully affecting the final break between a dispirited Moriarty, who meets up with a newly confident, smartly dressed Sal Paradise just off to a Duke Ellington concert at the Metropolitan Opera. And they create a striking image of the tearing in two of a photograph taken in a Greyhound station booth of Sal, Dean and Carlo as they split up early on. This picture is eventually restored when Sal sets about&#xa0;writing the novel that he has spent five years living. There he is at last with the seemingly endless scroll of paper that will allow him to type uninterrupted using the new mode of \"spontaneous bop prosody\" he's created. (The scroll, now a revered historical object, is <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/kerouac/index.html\" title=\"\">currently on show</a>&#xa0;at the British Library.) But this is ultimately a rather sad film, as most road movies are, because the restless travelling life can never bring peace and contentment. Arguably the&#xa0;finest example of the genre, Monte&#xa0;Hellman's&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/29/two-lane-blacktop-classic-dvd\" title=\"\"><em>Two-Lane Blacktop</em></a>, ends with the film burning up inside the projector and uses as its leitmotif the refrain from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-J7mLyD3yc\" title=\"\">Me and Bobby McGee</a>, Kris Kristofferson's great song&#xa0;about life on the road: \"Freedom's&#xa0;just another word for nothing left to lose.\"</p>",
  "<p>'It's all over,\" says TC Boyle. \"This planet is doomed. In a very short time, we're probably not even going to have culture or art. We're going to be living like we're in Cormac McCarthy's <em>The Road</em>.\" In 2000, Boyle published <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747553465\" title=\"\"><em>A Friend of the Earth</em></a>, a novel set in 2025 in a California recently devastated by ecological collapse, where numerous animals have become extinct and rain falls heavily for the majority of the year. \"Looking back,\" he says, \"I should have probably moved the date forward to 2015. We live in a very different world to the one that 19th-century novelists lived in. It's a godless world, without hope.\"</p> <p>Going right back to his astonishingly assured 1982 debut novel, <em>Water Music</em>, in which explorer Mungo Park travels to a pungent west Africa to find the Niger river, Boyle's work has shown a fear and respect for the power of nature. Recently, however, he has seemed more concerned with environmental issues than ever. Again and again in his fiction, man butts up against animal and environment and comes off second best. This was true of <em>Drop City</em>, his 2003 novel about 1970s hippies attempting to live the communal life in Alaska; of the weatherbeaten tales contained in his recent collections <em>After the Plague</em>, <em>Tooth and Claw</em> and <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408809495\" title=\"\"><em>Wild Child</em></a>; and of last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408821701\" title=\"\"><em>When the Killing's Done</em></a>, about conflict between biologists and animal rights protesters. And it's certainly the case in his new book, <em>San Miguel</em>, set on one of the Pacific Channel Islands between the 1880s and 1940s.</p> <p>Boyle grew up reading Kafka and Flannery O'Connor, and was taught in the 70s at the Iowa Writers' Workshop by John Irving and the \"absolute master\" John Cheever, but these days he is just as likely to be reading scientific non-fiction with such ominous titles as <em>The Coming Plague</em> or <em>Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic</em>.</p> <p>\"I worry about everything \u2013 every sick baby, every vanishing species \u2013 all the time,\" says Boyle. He says that the lack of control he feels in the rest of his life has led to him becoming a \"complete control freak\" as a writer. \"I've been lucky in my career in that nobody has ever said 'no' to me. I don't require much editing. The book you see on the shelves is pretty much the book I hand in. I'm not a member of any organisation or team. I was in a band once, but I was the singer. I'm enslaved to writing to the point where I sacrifice almost everything else.\" Since 1979, when his first short story collection, <em>Descent of Man</em>, was published, this obsessive work rate has resulted in six further story collections and 14 novels, all of them written with a breakneck energy that comes across on the page.</p> <p>Boyle says he was \"essentially a good kid\" but \"a hyperactive one\" who got up to a fair bit of mischief in his home town of Peekskill, 30 miles outside New York City. In his teens, he took drugs and raced cars around the town with friends: \"The normal stuff when there's nothing going on in your life and you need something to prove you're unique and show you're a man.\" Does he still think there's a touch of that hyperactivity in him now? \"Well, look at me,\" he says. \"What do you&#xa0;think?\"</p> <p>Boyle is sinewy, apparently fatless, with frizzy, thinning hair the colour of beach sand that's just been slightly dug into, a piercing stare and a goatee beard that looks at home in its environment in a way very few goatee beards do. At well over 6ft, his tallness is not that of a 63-year-old man, but that of a teenager who comes back from a school holiday unexpectedly&#xa0;elongated.</p> <p>In his early 20s, he took heroin, lived the hippie life in a communal house in Peekskill (he'd later reinvent the town as Peterskill in 1987's three-century-spanning settler-Native-American-hippie opus <em>World's End</em>), until a friend overdosed and he realised \"there was more to life than sitting about on bar stools with a bunch of down and outs\". Perhaps as a result of those years, there's something just a bit more of the rebel about Boyle's work than there is in the work of most literary novelists writing about America and its history on an epic canvas.</p> <p>I started reading Boyle when I was 20, around the time his brilliant <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747525721\" title=\"\"><em>The Tortilla Curtain</em></a> \u2013 which is to affluent LA and Mexican immigrants what <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em> is to Park Avenue and the New York projects \u2013 was published. Cred-conscious, music-loving friends had recommended Jack Kerouac's <em>On the Road </em>to me, which seemed just as fantastic and magical as they said it was until I actually tried to read it. Boyle's work, though, was everything that I'd been promised <em>On the Road</em> would be: it was rock'n'roll, full of exciting, vivid American landscapes, utopian, manic, but it felt like there was something chunkier to bite into, something that would stay with me.</p> <p>Boyle actually has fond memories of reading <em>On the Road</em> in his youth, but he did write a story, \"Beat\", for his 1994 collection <em>Without a Hero</em>, in which he painted Kerouac as a somewhat laughable mummy's boy. Then again, taking a much romanticised utopian concept and tearing it down is one of his favourite pastimes. It's perhaps not surprising that he served time as a hippie <em>and</em> a punk. Whether he's severing a foot in a motorbike accident in <em>World's End</em> or making a gentle, dying woman live in a glorified shed in an almost constantly howling gale on an island known as \"the graveyard of the Pacific\" in <em>San Miguel</em>, he seems to delight in putting his characters through misery, but his books are never without hope, never quite doomy, always propelled by a frenzied desire to push on towards a brighter future.</p> <p>By his standards, <em>San Miguel</em> is quite sedate. By the standards of most other historical fiction, it's a bareback ride into the abyss. He calls it his \"first non-ironic, non-comic historical book\", although some might say there is a black comedy in the repeatedly dashed hopes of the three women, Marantha, Edith and Elise, all of whom have to put up with extremely isolated life on their island with bull-headed, delusional men. \"In the end, it's exploring the same idea as my other books,\" he said. \"As humans, we all want our own island.\" He pauses, takes a sip of water. \"Of course, the truth is, we're never going to get it.\"</p> <p><em>San Miguel is published by Bloomsbury </em></p>",
  "<p>On the porch of the Red Pines, a restaurant on the outskirts of Onalaska, Wisconsin, Brian Meeter and Anthony Larson are shooting the (nonexistent) breeze. \"People round here, they like to help,\" says Meeter, a&#xa0;tall athlete with a long livid scar from a recent operation on his pitching arm. The heat is weighing heavily, moths battering against the blue electrocuting lights above our heads. \"Take Nasa, the North American Squirrel Association \u2013 they're a bunch of guys working with the disabled.\"</p> <p>\"Why squirrels?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"They hunt them.\"</p> <p>I put down my beer: \"They take disabled people shooting squirrels?\"</p> <p>\"Sure. Why not?\" I consider this. Why not indeed? If they'd made it a&#xa0;paralympic sport, perhaps Team USA might have done better.</p> <p>Just out of sight, the great Mississippi flows past. We are a&#xa0;little upstream of La Crosse, a pretty university town named when a white explorer saw Native Americans playing a similar game. Wisconsin, if you haven't been there, is one of the northernmost states, lying west of Chicago, and home to Paul Ryan, US congressman and Mitt Romney's vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>Since Romney made his pick, newspapers have been full of pictures of Ryan grinning beside dead animals. Like Sarah Palin before him, the politician Republicans want to be one heart attack away from the Oval Office loves bloodsports. He hunts with a&#xa0;bow, shooting turkeys and deer, and apparently enjoys \"catfish noodling\". This involves putting your hand in the holes the giant fish dig in riverbanks and when they chow down on you with their rubbery mouths, you grab them by the jaw and drag them out into the air.</p> <p>That sounds like fun, I'd thought, and jumped on the first BA flight out.</p> <p>\"I'm pretty sure that catfish noodling is illegal in Wisconsin,\" Meeter grumbles when I track him down at the La Crosse Area Sports Commission. \"You have to go to Oklahoma.

This is the Driftless Region, a&#xa0;beautifully poetic name for a&#xa0;technical idea. It is driftless because the glaciers never drifted here, leaving hill country filled with cliffs, woods, tiny limestone-fed streams and some of the best dairyland to be found in the States.</p> <p>Within an hour I've met Larson, owner of Coulee Region Adventures, who's brilliant fun. If something goes awry, instead of swearing, he barks: \"Son of a buzzard!\" He refuses to talk politics beyond telling me: \"I&#xa0;have views.\" He uses the phrase \"like a&#xa0;broke-dick dog\" and repeatedly impresses on me that he's a \"Yankee\".</p> <p>He gives me one of two canoes he's pulled off the top of his car (\"Lifting those off I was like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest,\" he says) and we take to the Black River, a tributary of the Mississippi, paddling upstream, past clapboard houses that back on to inlets holding fan boats. A large pool opens up and we attach lures that look like frogs to our spinning rods, flick them out and pull them back, trying to mimic the amphibian's swim. There are splashes, and the big-mouth bass (remember Billy the singing fish) attack. Or else it is the torpedo-fast take of a northern pike. Or a dogfish. \"Anthony, I wanted a&#xa0;catfish,\" I shout. Or crappies, which are better than they sound.</p> <p>Mostly we just drift nearby and chat. Larson, despite catching fish at four times the rate I do, is more interested in the nature around us. He points out muskrat trails, snapping turtles, blue herons, a bald-headed eagle and cranes. And then an osprey that dives into the water and takes a bass less than 100ft from where we are. \"Minnesota says it is the land of 10,000 lakes,\" he says. \"But we've got 10,500.\"</p> <p>The NEXT day I leave the river and head into the rolling pasturelands. My plan is to drift through the driftless lands, first with a guide in the form of Mike Warren, proprietor of Trout Buddy fishing guide service.</p> <p>Unlike me (and Paul Ryan), most people find fishing a bit of a yawn. But here's a thing: there is no right to roam in the US, yet nearly 20 years ago Dave Vetrano, a visionary worker from Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources, began restoring the state's streams, hundreds of miles of them. He cleaned up the water and built little ledges for trout to hide under (lunker lodges, we fishermen call them), but most importantly he cut deals with the farmers to allow anglers access.</p> <p>The result is that even if fishing isn't a passion for you, a trout rod gives you the ability to walk unhindered up the water's edge, through rich grasslands and willow woods, among carpets of blue and pink flowers, amid the perfect storybook barns and wooden grain silos of the Amish. It is heart-meltingly beautiful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397706030\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350037609493/Traditional-barns-in-Coon-001.jpg\" alt=\"Traditional barns in Coon Valley\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traditional barns in Coon Valley.

I follow a path up through a&#xa0;thick wood beside the Bad Axe River, upstream from where the followers of Black Hawk were slaughtered by US forces at the end of the 1832 war, an insurrection notable for giving a&#xa0;23-year-old Abraham Lincoln his first taste of conflict. The woods are so thick the sun is hidden and the smell of rotting vegetation is rich in my nose. A young man walking his dog, who tells me he has downshifted from a job in Minneapolis to work on a nearby organic farm, points me to the stream, and I fish for trout until it's too dark to see and then make the nerve-jangling walk back through the tendrils of mist in the gloom of an increasingly noisy wood. \"Some of the people out here, they are what you'd call entrepreneurial hippies,\" Warren had told me the day before. He meant that a lot of people grow pot in the forest.</p> <p>The winding roads hereabouts draw Harley Davidson enthusiasts from across the US, and a couple of them are staying in the Westby House Inn that night.

In its construction, the architect drew sharp lines in the rolling Wisconsin landscape. The hills curve like odalisques beyond the windows, which must have pleased a man who had more than his fair share of wives. For that quality, and his inability to pay his bills, Wisconsin residents maintain a deeply ambivalent attitude to this native son. \"Do you admire him?\" I&#xa0;ask the guide.

  "<p>Andrew Watts, 52, is looking nervously at the darkening sky. We are standing at the edge of a field, where his new red-and-yellow seed drill is sowing wheat at an impressive clip. The vast machine can cover six hectares (15 acres) an hour but it may not be fast enough to get the whole field done before the rain starts.</p> <p>Watts runs 2,500 hectares of farmland in Hertfordshire from a cluttered office, its walls adorned with pictures of tractors. It has been a difficult year, he says. Having just come through the second-wettest summer on record, he is already two weeks behind schedule, and is anxious about pushing next year's harvest out too far.</p> <p>\"What farmers mustn't do is let one bad year become another bad year. You have to believe next year is going to be good, otherwise ...\" he tails off.</p> <p>He admits the weather in his area was better than in some parts of the country, particularly around harvest time: \"We didn't fare too bad in pockets. At one point we were lagging behind 2008, which was my latest harvest in recent memory, but then we just had a couple of little windows and we cracked into it.\"</p> <p>Other farms were not as lucky, and last week the National Farmers' Union said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">wheat yields were at their lowest point since the late 1980s</a>.</p> <p>It is not just British farmers who are worried. While we have been drowning in rain, the US has suffered one of the worst droughts in more than half a century, which has ravaged its corn crop. The resultant shortage has driven animal feed prices so high that there have been reports of farmers feeding their cows with chocolate bars and ice-cream sprinkles. A heatwave in Russia, meanwhile, has stoked fears that Moscow may impose an export ban, further exacerbating global shortages and fuelling fears of food riots.</p> <p>This combination of freak weather has led to one of the worst global harvests in years. With demand still rising, policymakers have entered crisis mode, reigniting a furious debate about whether we should be using agricultural land to grow crops for biofuels.</p> <p>This week, the European commission will fan the flames with a proposal that will tear through the biofuels industry, effectively ensuring the decline of a European sector estimated to be worth \u20ac17bn (\u00a314bn) a year. Industry associations say millions of pounds of investment could be wasted in the UK alone.</p> <p>The proposal was leaked in September and came as a huge shock to the industry and to campaigners. It proposed to limit the use of crop-based biofuels to meet the EU's 10% target for renewable transport energy by 2020. The leaked document suggested that only half of that target be met with biofuels from food crops \u2013 such as wheat, sugar cane and oilseed rape. Clare Coffey, policy advisor at ActionAid, which has been campaigning against biofuels for the past two years, said: \"Nobody was expecting the 5% cap, that was totally new.\"</p> <p>The most controversial part of the proposal, however, was the inclusion of new ways of calculating how green biofuels actually are. For the first time, the EC will take into account the extra carbon emitted when farmers switch from growing crops for food to growing crops for fuel. The theory is that demand for food remains more or less constant, so production will move elsewhere.</p> <p>Indirect land-use change (ILUC) theory attempts to measure the carbon emissions associated with clearing new land \u2013 by cutting down rainforests, for example \u2013 to grow food. The theory has split scientists, farmers, policymakers and industry, causing lengthy delays in legislation. The NFU maintains that there are huge flaws in the science, while the UK Renewable Energy Association (REA) says objections are not based on science at all but are purely political.</p> <p>The arguments hinge on the fact that, when you take ILUC emissions into account, biodiesel appears to be as harmful to the environment as fossil fuels, if not more so. And if biodiesel does nothing to help fuel suppliers meet emissions targets, demand for it will disappear overnight.</p> <p>On top of that, the draft law introduces a new requirement that all biofuel plants achieve at least 60% greenhouse gas emission savings. Robert Vierhout, secretary-general of the European renewable ethanol association, ePURE, says: \"It is like being shot, not once, but three times.\"</p> <p>Perhaps in an attempt to soften the blow, the commission said it would double- or quadruple-count certain advanced biofuels in the race to reach the 10% renewable transport fuel target. As such, it hopes to drive investment in so-called second-generation biofuels: those produced from waste, algae or residue from other processes. But the industry remains wary. Many of these processes have not yet been proven, and investors who lost money on first-generation biofuels will be unwilling to provide more funding to push the technology forwards.</p> <p>The proposal will be published on 17 October and may have changed slightly since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/21/biodiesel-industry-eu-policy-changes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">it was leaked last month</a>, but the basics are expected to remain the same. It will go before the European parliament and member states, and talks will probably drag on throughout 2013. No law could realistically come into force until the beginning of 2015. But the industry will feel the effect of investors running scared given the apparent shift in policy.</p> <p>Coffey at ActionAid says, with just a hint of schadenfreude: \"It will be a black day for the biofuel industry. The basic message is that there is no future in crop-based biofuels.\"</p> <p>Back on Mentley Farm, Watts says a collapse in the biodiesel industry would be a disaster for Britain's farmers. He was one of many to cash in on the rising price of oilseed rape as demand from biodiesel producers increased. Production has increased by 50% over the past decade, and anyone who has travelled through Britain in early summer will have noticed the prevalence of the crop, which has bright yellow flowers. Though oilseed rape is also turned into vegetable oil, Britain's farmers export almost 70% of their crop, and most of that goes into the biodiesel market.</p> <p>It is no surprise the farmers are fighting any change to current targets. Consistent demand for their crops from biodiesel producers protects them against the volatility of global food prices. And the productivity of their land is also increased, because a byproduct of making wheat into ethanol can be used as a high-protein animal feed, so farmers get two products for the price of one. This factor became even more crucial, this year, as the price of soya shot up by more than 30%.</p> <p>\"What's killing the pig and poultry industry at the moment is high feed costs,\" says Watts. \"One of the major reasons for that is because they are reliant on imported soya, and that's really causing them grief.\"</p> <p>Then there is the argument that farmers simply respond to demand. Watts says he switched to growing oilseed rape when the biofuels market wanted it. Before that, there was simply not enough demand for it as a vegetable oil.</p> <p>At this, Coffey lights up: \"That is why we are absolutely not against biofuels per se, but we are against a target that creates massive demand, and that demand is met with the cheapest and easiest feed stocks.</p> <p>\"We would much rather see a system that encourages genuinely sustainable biofuels, and does not encourage turning food into fuel.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is the National doing its job. Nicholas Hytner's theatre is behaving as if it were a federation of varied talents: the good, the very good and the not so good. The big popular success is in the smallest auditorium, although since the production is sold out, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/this-house\" title=\"\"><strong>This&nbsp;House</strong></a> looks destined for another place. It is perhaps procedure rather than principle that lends itself most naturally to theatre. This is supplied by James Graham's quick, informative and amusing play about parliamentary whips, which began with uncanny topicality: its original press night, postponed when Phil Daniels had temporarily to withdraw from the production, coincided with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a>'s police outburst.</p> <p>Set in the mid-70s, when the Labour party's precarious grip on power meant&nbsp;that the whips' role was magnified, it offers a brisk canter through shenanigans \u2013 I'll vote for you if I get a new carpet in my office \u2013 fisticuffs and desperate measures: crocks being wheeled in to vote while hooked up to oxygen cylinders.</p> <p>Inevitably, since it's set in the House of Commons, this is Boys' Own theatre. Wall-to-wall chaps being boisterous, with only an occasional bit of skirt to disconcert: Audrey Wise, the doughty Grunwick fighter; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hayman, for ever dubbed the breastfeeder; Ann Taylor, the rising star. Graham, who is recording not proscribing, tips a witty hat to the feminist position. \"Have a seat,\" says one bewildered bloke when Taylor cuban-heels her way into the whips' office: \"She's a woman, not an invalid,\" growls another. You get a whiff of the atmosphere from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/09/australia-pm-gillard-misogynist-video?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">Julia Gillard's impressive invective</a> in the Australian parliament last week.</p> <p>Nearly everyone smokes. There are spider plants and a truly terrible set of camel-coloured flares. There are overweight northern Labour MPs and over-preening Tory southerners; wily Philip Glenister and sleek Charles Edwards are supreme. This is caricature rather than character-based, saying more about how the world is run \u2013 and wangled \u2013 than about the world itself. Both Graham's script and Jeremy Herrin's production are lively rather than innovative, though Rae Smith's design is immersive: she has transformed the Cottesloe into a mini House of Commons, with wood panelling all around the walls: some of the audience sit on slippery green parliamentary benches, others are up in the gallery.</p> <p>The surprise is in the Lyttelton, where Howard Barker must be furious. The staging of his 1985 play \u2013 about a woman artist whose explosive work challenges the orthodoxy of 16th-century Venice \u2013 marks the first time his work has been performed at the National. Barker has said that a successful play should be \"a certain ordeal\". He has also said there is too much comedy on the stage: that it is tragedy that's needed, because tragedy \"liberates language\".</p> <p>Yet Tom Cairns's production of <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/scenes-from-an-execution\" title=\"\"><strong>Scenes from an Execution</strong></a> reveals it to be not only powerful but also highly enjoyable. The debates are not soft-pedalled, yet Barker's targets, neatly pleated together, are sufficiently varied for the drama not to seem narrowly didactic. His concerns \u2013 the conflict between art and state, the patronising of women artists, the onset of celebrity worship \u2013 have not dated. If anything, the play now seems more prescient, since the painting at its centre is of the Battle of Lepanto, fought by a Christian alliance against the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>If Maria Miller is going to consider the theatre in her arts brief, she may wish to attend to see how to co-opt subversives. If directors of historical drama want to know how to thwart accusations of fustiness or of anachronism, they should look at what Cairns has done. Hildegard Bechtler's design is an argument between the 16th and the 20th century: costumes in ochres and rust-red have the richness of old master colours, while the background is made up of abstract, acidly coloured slabs.</p> <p>Fiona Shaw's performance is at the core of the production's success. This is one of the least vain performances I have ever seen an actress give, and certainly the most natural that Shaw, whose intelligence can make her mannered, has ever given. She is so focused on her subject, so strong in gesture, that she looks entirely capable of painting a masterpiece. As she shoulders her way towards the canvas, she allows no space between her subject matter and her self. Speech comes out of her like an art-seeking missile.</p> <p>This is not a piece of grandstanding. Shaw is surrounded by fine cameos, particularly from Jamie Ballard as a more compliant painter, Phoebe Nicholls as a sharp-tongued critic and Tim McInnerny as a complicated authority figure: \"It's no fun being a doge.\" Oh lord, please don't let me be understood has been Barker's plea: the creative cast have let him down here.</p> <p>The disappointment is in the Olivier. It is right that the National should tackle the important plays of the Spanish golden age. It is promising that they should alight on <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/damned-by-despair\" title=\"\"><strong>Damned by Despair</strong>:</a> Tirso de Molina's glowering 1625 drama, which follows the twinned fates of a holy recluse and a violent criminal, contains intense faith-versus-works, justice-versus-mercy arguments and the potentially arresting theatrical notion of the doppelganger.</p> <p>It's encouraging that the production's cast should include two striking acting talents from different realms of the stage: Bertie Carvel has been magnetic in <em>Rope</em>, <em>Parade</em> and <em>Matilda</em>; here he is a thug. Amanda Lawrence brings to the Devil the morphing, insinuating qualities that made her unforgettable in <em>Brief Encounter</em> and her extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zss9QTT-qig\" title=\"\">one-woman show about Charles Hawtrey</a>. It's disastrous that all these possibilities should be clubbed to the ground by Frank McGuinness's new version and by Bijan Sheibani's crudely updated production.</p> <p>Set partly in a Neapolitan pizzeria (swagger, scooters and stilettoes) and partly against Giles Cadle's crude design of a flinty mountainscape, crucial moments are bathed in Dan Jones's obtrusive music, as if we were watching an ad for damnation. McGuinness's version \u2013 \"Enrico, grab a pew, old pal\" \u2013 is thumpingly idiomatic. In Sheibani's jerky production the action doesn't flow but sputters, so that what is presented is less a play than a series of expostulations. Carvel's promising psychopathic tremor does not so much develop as explode. Lawrence's Devil livens things up with her hissing, bending presence, but is not often enough there. Bathos hovers throughout, not least when what looks like a thurible is reverently lowered from the roof \u2013 and turns out to be a lampshade.</p> <p>What is lacking from this National? Site-specific work and ground-breaking new studies. You get some of this in the interstices, on roofs and terraces and outside, during the summer, and also in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DE67813461897E6&amp;feature=plcp\" title=\"\">video installation by Katie Mitchell</a>, which features the marvel that is Michelle Terry.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>It is stage five they fear the most. Stage five is the mysterious sickness in its deadliest form. \"I'm entering stage five,\" Edilberto Mendez tells me as his wife looks on fretfully. I'm in their small home on the floodplains of Lempa River, in the dank sugar-lands of rural El Salvador, where they live in a community with about 150 other families. \"How many others in the village have died of this?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"Three close friends, just last year,\" says Edilberto. His wife interrupts, counting out on her fingers. \"And my nephew, my brother, and Ramon, Carlos, Pablo\u2026\" She pauses. \"I know <em>three </em>Pablos who have died of this.\"</p> <p>Edilberto's kidneys are beginning to fail. It means dialysis. \"This is what they've told me,\" he says with a defensive shrug. \"But I'm still walking around. I've seen many people have dialysis. As soon as they try it, they die. I don't want it.\" Edilberto has his wife to support, his deaf-mute 27-year-old son, and his six-year-old granddaughter.</p> <p>\"If you don't have dialysis you'll die,\" I say. \"And then what will happen to your family?\"</p> <p>\"They will be homeless.\"</p> <p>Behind him, Edilberto's wife has started to cry. Holding a tissue to her face, she weeps: \"He's the only one I have.\"</p> <p>\"Of those you know who have already died of the disease,\" I ask, \"how many have worked in the sugar fields?\"</p> <p>\"All of them.\"</p> <p>It goes by many names, but around here they call it \"the malady of the sugar cane\". It's a quiet epidemic that has been preying on Central America for at least 20 years, killing impoverished landworkers in their tens of thousands across Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala. And it is becoming ever more deadly. Between 2005 and 2009, incidents in El Salvador rose by 26%. By 2011 the chronic kidney disease (CKD) that is killing Edilberto had become the country's second-biggest killer of men.</p> <p>That year the health minister, Mar\u00eda Isabel Rodr\u00edguez, made a dramatic appeal to the international community for help, telling them: \"It is wasting away our populations.\" But nobody knows what to do about it, because nobody knows what exactly it is. In the wealthier west, CKD is largely caused by hypertension or diabetes, but most of the victims here have neither. And it attacks the kidneys in an unusual way. Rather than damaging the filtering system, as in ordinary CKD, this disease seems to have an impact on the tubules \u2013 the part of the kidney where the composition of the urine is determined. At the moment, the only scientific consensus is that it's real, and unexplained. I have travelled to El Salvador to investigate the mystery of the malady.</p> <p>Since its discovery, a near-silence has cocooned the disease \u2013 a situation that has benefited the industry that so many victims work for. Profitable and vast, Central America's sugar-cane industry supplies 23% of the US's raw sugar imports. In 2011 the EU imported El Salvadorian sugar worth more than \u20ac4.7m: it is the country's second-biggest export. The companies themselves say they are not to blame. Nicaragua Sugar Estates, one of Central America's largest plantations, has conducted internal studies, and one in 2001 pointed to \"strenuous labour with exposure to high environmental temperatures without an adequate hydration programme\" as an important factor. Still, in December spokesman Ariel Granera told the Washington-based Centre for Public Integrity: \"We're convinced that we have nothing to do with kidney disease. Our productive practices do not generate and are not causal factors for CKD.\"</p> <p>But an increasing number of researchers in the US now believe the CKD is being caused by heat stress and dehydration \u2013 that the labourers are, in effect, working themselves to death. A standard day for an El Salvadorian sugar worker lasts between four and five hours, with double shifts during the summer planting season, when temperatures top out at 40C.</p> <p>\"It's suffocating,\" Edilberto says. \"In the five hours there's no break. Many of my workmates have fainted in the fields. Sometimes they vomit, too.\" Water, he says, is not supplied. \"I bring my own. Perhaps two to three litres.\"</p> <p>As I toured the villages I heard many accounts of barbaric suffering beneath the equatorial heat. H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda, 33, a stage-two patient, told me: \"It's very hot; we suffer. People sometimes collapse. More often they vomit, especially when the heat is worse. They do two shifts to earn more money.\" Ismael Ramos, 40, who is at stage five, said: \"In those cane fields, I can't stand it. I'm dizzy and sweating like crazy. I've vomited. I've fainted. I drown in sweat. When I come home, I feel surrendered. Sick. Headache. I can't shower because the water [from the roof-mounted tank] is too hot.\"</p> <p>Has he ever seen anyone die?</p> <p>\"Once. A 50-year-old. The big heat can cause a heart to give in.\"</p> <p>Scientists first became aware that there was a problem in the early 2000s, and yet this is thought to have been going on as long ago as the 1970s. It remained unknown partly because in the deep countryside there are no kidney specialists to identify such an unusual condition. Out there, the poor simply die. And the majority of sufferers do not even know they are ill: CKD is asymptomatic until its latest, most deadly stages. Even when they feel unwell, many don't want to know they have it \u2013 they can't afford the medication or the recommended diet of fresh vegetables and chicken breast. Everyone I speak to fears dialysis. They have seen a correlation, in their communities, between the start of treatment and painful death and have wrongly concluded that the one causes the other. The sugar companies certainly don't appear to be encouraging diagnosis: reports from Nicaragua suggest that workers who test positive are simply fired.</p> <p>In the rutted streets and chicken-pecked yards of rural El Salvador, I hear many theories. Something in the air or something in the water. Something in tyres, in painkillers or in Chinese herbal medicine. Leftover DDT from the prewar years, when the land in the region was all cotton fields. There is a common belief that modern agrochemicals, as used by the sugar companies, are responsible. The health minister believes this \u2013 she has told a press agency so \u2013 as does Edilberto. Now 46, he worked the sugar fields for 15 years, where his job was to plant seeds and to spray pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser. \"I took the risk, always the risk,\" he tells me, shaking his head.</p> <p>But academics in the US who have been trying to solve the mystery believe these El Salvadorians to be mistaken. Professor Daniel Brooks, of Boston University's School of Public Health, tells me: \"It's natural to think that, on the one hand, workers have been exposed to pesticides and on the other they have this disease, therefore pesticides must have caused the disease. It's very human to make that connection. But that doesn't necessarily mean they <em>are</em> causing CKD. While I'm aware that the group in El Salvador has this hypothesis, and I'm always open to being convinced, our data just don't seem consistent with it.\"</p> <p>Brooks's team began studying the disease in 2009. In the Nicaraguan sugar fields they found rates of CKD in cane cutters and seed cutters \u2013 the most strenuous jobs \u2013 to be higher than in pesticide applicators, who have greater exposure to agrochemicals. In short, it's more heat that seems to correlate with more disease, and not more chemicals. \"We also tested construction workers, stevedores and miners, excluding people who had ever worked at a cane company,\" he says. \"They had elevated levels, too. And what do they all seem to have in common? They're high manual-labour jobs.\" A further study, published in the <em>American Journal of Kidney Disease</em>, found increased levels of kidney damage in El Salvador's hot, low-lying areas but not in its cooler high-altitude sugar plantations, despite similarities in agrochemical use. But is it really heat that's killing the thousands?</p> <p>We are speeding along the storm-wet roads of Bajo Lempa, on El Salvador's low-lying western coast, past roadside pineapple sellers and one-storey dwellings of brick and wood when I see them, a fleet of them, disappearing into a field. The immature sugar cane grows up past their shoulders, rows and rows of it, the narrow leaves forming spiny corridors whose ends are so distant they are impossible to see. The workers have blue containers strapped to their backs. They are spraying.</p> <p>I ask the driver to stop, and we climb our way delicately over the barbed-wire fence. To my surprise the boss, the <em>jefe</em>, nods permission for me to photograph the process. A tractor is pulling a flatbed trailer along the plantation's edge. On it, two workers mix a livid-yellow potion in huge plastic barrels. They wear no protection. One of the men stirs the mixture with a tree branch. He has a wounded finger tied in a rudimentary bandage. Soon the sprayers emerge from cane, sodden from the rain-drenched foliage. They refill their packs, pouring the thick, acrid-smelling liquid from buckets. There's no drinking water in evidence, nor any for washing skin. They have yellow stains on their clothes and on their bare fingers.</p> <p>Even being close to the barrels gives me a spinny, achey pressure in my temples, of the kind you might experience when sniffing too much amyl nitrate. They wear trainers, cotton shirts and tracksuit trousers, old football tops tied around their faces. One has a baseball cap with a big black dollar sign.</p> <p>I learn that the mixture is of five chemicals: amine, terbutryn, pendimethalin, 2,4-D and atrazine. I don't know what they are, but can Professor Brooks's theory really be correct? That they have nothing to do with the disease in all these sugar workers?</p> <p>In a nearby village I knock on the gate of 37-year-old Omar Rojas, a <em>jefe</em> who I've heard is responsible for paying the wages of the sugar sprayers. \"We pay them $5 a day,\" he tells me. It's raining, lightly, and his pig is causing a commotion behind me, pushing its snout over the wall of its small pen and blowing bubbles of muddy snot. \"And whose responsibility is supplying the safety gear?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"It's up to everybody individually,\" he tells me. \"There are recommendations on all the chemicals, but nobody regulates it. Nobody pays any attention.\" What does the protective gear cost? \"Boots are $10. I don't know how much anything else costs because I never bought it.\" How many of your men have got sick from doing this work? \"A lot,\" he says. \"Many people don't get checked. They don't know they have it. People say: 'Don't examine me \u2013 it's better not to know.'\"</p> <p>Have you been checked?</p> <p>\"I'm in the third stage.\"</p> <p>I'm momentarily confused. \"But I thought you didn't do any spraying,\" I say. \"I thought you just paid the men. Do you work in the sugar fields, too?\"</p> <p>\"No, but I spray my own property,\" he says. \"I use the same chemicals.\"</p> <p>Later that day I meet Wilfredo Ordo\u00f1es, 48, a stage-five sufferer who has been on dialysis. \"I had lower back spasms and I would vomit often,\" he tells me. He seems a classic case of CKD by heat stress due to overwork in the sun, until I ask about his work. \"I grow rice, cassava. I farm my own land. About a hectare.\"</p> <p>These men, I realise, could hardly be working <em>themselves</em> to death. And neither, for that matter, can all the dying women who haven't worked the cane. In the villages, many believe the sickness in females and teenagers is a result of the annual crop sprayings that \"burn everything \u2013 the people, not just the crops\", as Edilberto told me. \"Your nose itches, your eyes tear, headache, vomiting. Animals die. You see them on the street.\"</p> <p>His wife interjects: \"You can't hide from it. Even if you close your window, it penetrates. You cover your mouth but it enters anyway.\"</p> <p>These low-lying areas are also susceptible to flooding. The floods could wash toxins into other areas and the water supply. One sufferer, Victor Rivas, 55, a sprayer for 25 years, is convinced this caused his illness. The water from the well, he says, tasted strange, \"salty\".</p> <p>Back in the city I arrange a meeting with Dr Carlos Orantes, of El Salvador's ministry of health. Orantes is a kidney specialist who began a formal study of the problem in 2009. His team tested and surveyed six communities in Bajo Lempa \u2013 775 individuals in 375 families. After analysing blood and urine samples, they found that 25.7% of the region's men and 11.8% of its women had the disease.</p> <p>Dr Orantes sits back in his chair, loosens his tie, takes a sip of cappuccino and announces grandly: \"There are three factors: prohibited pesticides, combinations of pesticides, and no protection from pesticides.\" I am bewildered by how sure he seems of himself. Everybody else speaks of this disease as a mystery. I show him a cutting from the US research pointing towards heat exhaustion as a cause.</p> <p>\"I respect their opinion,\" says Dr Orantes. \"But these scientists have not put on their boots and gone into the countryside like I have. Until they do, they don't know. My opinion is: to have kidney damage you have to be exposed to a nephrotoxic agent. I agree that dehydration is a factor, but you would have to be very, very dehydrated for it to damage your kidneys.\"</p> <p>\"But the farmers spoke of horrific conditions in the summer,\" I tell him. \"They've seen people vomit and faint from the heat. One even saw someone die! This paints a picture of acute dehydration of exactly the kind that you say is necessary to cause kidney damage.\"</p> <p>Dr Orantes is unmoved. \"There are agrochemicals that make you vomit and dizzy,\" he says. \"It's not the heat \u2013 it's the chemicals.\" Did his survey include any questions about dehydration? \"We didn't ask about that,\" he admits. \"But we will. You know, I'm not obsessed by agrochemicals. I'm obsessed to find out the causes. If we could show that it's dehydration, I'd be happy. It would be really easy to solve.\"</p> <p>I phone Professor Brooks. He says that this dizziness and vomiting in the fields would signify CKD in its late stages which, if you're well enough to be out working, you're unlikely to have. \"We know heat can do that to you, and we know it's hot,\" he says. \"So I think it's more likely to be heat. But things are messy. One possibility is that heat is not the starting factor, but that it takes some initial damage and progresses it to kidney disease.\"</p> <p>I wonder if this \"initial damage\" of the kidneys could be agrochemical poisoning. I send the recipe for the yellow potion I saw being sprayed in Bajo Lempa to Professor Andrew Watterson of the University of Stirling \u2013 an authority on agrochemicals and health. They were herbicides, he says. Atrazine can cause kidney damage at high levels; acute exposure to 2.4-D can cause chronic kidney damage; pendimethalin, says Watterson, is \"harmful through skin contact and inhalation\"; in lab tests, long-term feeding of terbutryn to rats caused kidney damage. None of them was acutely toxic, but this combination, plus the tropical climate, could worsen their effects. Moreover, sprayers are required to avoid contact with skin; to wear face shields, respiratory protection, rubber boots and specialist coveralls. Viewing the photographs, Watterson says the use in Bajo Lempa represents \"a terrible system of work\" and is \"a potentially serious threat to public health\".</p> <p>And then, a twist. A new professor with a new idea. Richard J Johnson, of the University of Colorado's Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, thinks the problem might have its genesis in a strange mechanism that his team discovered in rats. When they were fed vast amounts of sugar, an enzyme in their kidneys reacted with the fructose in a way that was \"like a little bomb\". It caused tubular damage, just like that found in Central American CKD. But how could humans ingest enough sugar to trigger these quasi-explosions? \"We discovered that the [human] body can make its own fructose,\" he explains. \"And this process gets turned on when you get dehydrated. So suddenly we have a mechanism of how dehydration might cause [tubular] kidney damage.\"</p> <p>Johnson wonders if dehydrated workers with already sugary kidneys are rehydrating with soft drinks or fruit juice, thus piling on a potentially explosive fructose load. \"It's not proven, so we don't want to get ahead of the gun here,\" he says, of the as-yet unpublished work. \"But the experimental data is quite compelling, and it could explain what's going on.\"</p> <p>Whether the final explanation turns out to be fruit, heat or chemicals, or none of them, the answer could not come sooner for the family of Ismael Ramos. \"For 10 years I worked with the pump,\" Ismael tells me. \"We used seven chemicals. There was no choice, no other jobs. When I found out I had the disease, I went crazy. I wanted to kill myself.\"</p> <p>I ask how parents like Ramos feel, sending their youngsters to work the cane. \"We have no choice; it's the only work there is. But we're very scared for our son.\" He glances towards 18-year-old Carlos, who has been watching from the background. \"Sometimes, down here, he has pain,\" Ismael says. He rubs the sides of his lower back, in the region of his kidneys.</p> <p><em>Will Storr travelled to El Salvador with the help of Christian Aid (</em><a href=\"http://christianaid.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>christianaid.org.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Heralded by a laugh-out-loud trailer that painted it as the kookiest comedy of the year, Tim Burton's <strong>Dark Shadows</strong> (2012, Warner, 12) arrived in cinemas as a head-scratchingly weird mess of a movie more notable for its deadpan drollery and bizarre tonal shifts than for the advertised rib-tickling kitsch. Based on an arcane TV show little known here in the UK, this casts Johnny Depp as 18th-century vampire Barnabas Collins, escaping centuries of entombment to reclaim his now ruined family estate in the cultural void of 1972.</p> <p>Faced with rebellious teens, garish wardrobes and \"tiny songstrels\" hiding within television sets, Barnabas attempts to reassert his authority over Eva Green's witchy temptress, with the help of Michelle Pfeiffer's haughty matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter's sozzled shrink and an apparently ageless Alice Cooper. Flitting from frothy pop-culture riffs about the Carpenters to grim gags involving drinking the blood of dopey but innocent hippies, <em>Dark Shadows</em> is Burton's oddest film since <em>Big Fish</em>. At its best it recalls the blackly comic tone of <em>Beetlejuice</em>, tapping into the director's cherished closet of affectionately ghoulish memories.</p> <p>Elsewhere it seems simply out of control, like an extravagant in-joke played more for the benefit of the participants than the audience. Personally (and doubtless perversely) I rather enjoyed the fact that the film often didn't seem to know where it was going (in contrast to the by-numbers box-ticking of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>), but clearly that's a quality that many will find more annoying than enchanting. Burton has since redeemed himself in the eyes of his critics with the delightful monochrome <em>Frankenweenie</em>. In the meantime, anyone interested in getting to the roots of this strange hotch-potch can pick up <em>Dark Shadows: The Original TV Series (The Barnabas Collins Episodes)</em> on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Shadows-Original-Barnabas-Episodes/dp/B0077NF7AQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349864509&amp;sr=8-3\" title=\"\">DVD for under a tenner</a>.</p> <p>After the breast-beating tedium of <em>Clash of the Titans</em> (tagline: \"Titans will clash\") comes more of the same in <strong>Wrath of the Titans</strong> (presumably \"Titans will wrath\"?), in which Greek mythology is once again transmuted into campy Hollywood cheese. Silly wigs are duly donned, ponderous dialogue deadeningly delivered, sandy swords soporifically swung and CGI scenery splashed around dazzlingly, presumably hoping to distract us from the wooden performances. To be fair, it's not quite as boring as <em>Clash\u2026</em> and nothing like as inappropriately nasty as <em>Immortals</em>. But nor is it ever as sparkily inventive as the Ray Harryhausen movie that inspired this apparently ongoing series and which was itself far from perfect in the first place.</p> <p>Anyone harbouring a residual affection for the long-running Hanna-Barbera TV cartoon series that was retitled <em>Boss Cat</em> for legal reasons in the UK (blame cat food) will be rightly outraged by<strong> Top Cat </strong>(2011, EntertainmentOne, U) a Mexico/Argentina/UK co-production that poops on the memory of the original like a diarrhetic kitten in a celluloid litter tray. Ludicrously released in 3D in cinemas, this mirthless bore is unlikely to divert even the most malleable child for more than a few moments while setting grown-ups' teeth on edge from the start. As with <em>Dark Shadows</em>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Top-Cat-Complete-Box-Set/dp/B001675TRA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349864629&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">the source TV show is readily available on DVD</a> (the <em>Top Cat Complete Box Set</em> compiles all 30&#xa0;original episodes), but this time that's less of an addendum and more of an (obligatory) alternative.</p> <p>In<strong> Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap</strong> (2012, Kaleidoscope, 15), Ice T goes in search of his musical roots, using his industry clout to bag interviews with an impressive array of players and practitioners including Afrika Bambaataa, Chuck D, Melle Mel, Snoop Dogg, Grandmaster Caz et al. Eschewing the usual amalgam of archive footage, this comes alive when interviewees are invited to busk their way through a few bars that hold particular personal resonance, with performance often speaking volumes about the history, meaning and raw power of the music. Sharing directorial credits with Andy Baybutt, Ice T proves an engaging host in whose presence the contributors are clearly at ease.</p> <p>A tale of two sisters locked in a twisted tug-of-love/hate, the ambitious low-budget Brit-pic<strong> Strawberry Fields</strong> (2012, Soda, 15) benefits from strong performances (Anna Madeley and Christine Bottomley are both excellent), evocative camerawork by Dave Miller and an atmosphere dripping with sensual dread. While talented director/co-writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/09/frances-lea-film-maker-women\" title=\"\">Frances Lea</a> may sometimes struggle to reconcile the complex themes wrestling for our attention here, there's no faulting the heady air that she conjures, blending the intoxicating promise of the Kent countryside and the stifling grip of tightening family coils amid the overarching landscape of a self-destructive psychological drama. Although overall the film troubled me on first viewing, I found individual moments from <em>Strawberry Fields</em> coming back to haunt me in the days that followed \u2013 always a good sign.</p>",
  "<p>It's strange how easy, and comfortable, living with someone can be. After years of deliberate bachelordom, I&#xa0;imagined the upheaval would be far more momentous than having a few quibbles over furniture and the pesky dog. The children seem to adore Simon, this week he and I are having supper with my mother-in-law (we've remained close despite my wife and me separating) and in a&#xa0;fortnight's time we're attending the wedding of one of his cousins. The latter I am rather nervous about: I will have to meet the whole clan in one fell swoop and \u2013 pathetic, I know \u2013 I&#xa0;feel uncomfortable about turning up to the wedding as the boyfriend; it's being held in Cheshire, and I'm convinced everyone will stare at the only gays in the village.</p> <p>The reality, of course, is that I'm very lucky. Each night we fall asleep, our limbs entwined, as if we've been sharing a bed for centuries. And each morning, as the alarm cruelly rings, unwrapping myself from around his warm, soft body becomes increasingly difficult.</p> <p>Today I stayed in bed for five minutes or so after the alarm went and stared at his sweet, sleeping face. He looked so peaceful and at home. It seems incredible that nine months ago I didn't even know who he was. Then, out of nowhere, the Spice Girls song \"2 Become 1\" started playing in my head. God, I really am gay.</p>",
  "<p>Gerald Hughes's memoir of his little brother, Ted, has a muted, soul-swelling intensity, and the kind of holiness that requires no mention of God. Hughes's purpose is not priestly, though, or psychoanalytic, but botanical \u2013 to sift through old childhood soil which was fertile enough to grow a poet.&#xa0;</p> <p>In 12 concise chapters Hughes describes the years from childhood in Yorkshire to Ted's death in 1998. Brotherly love suffuses each memory, and Hughes's earth-scented descriptions of Yorkshire show a love of nature&#xa0;reminiscent of Ted's, as similar to it perhaps as their ears or hands to each other's. It was an inheritance received in different ways: Ted became a great nature-poet and Gerald a farmer in Australia.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gerald was 10 years older than Ted \u2013 a gap large enough to accommodate Ted's hero worship for which Gerald waited ready-made, with his rat-shooting skills, his knowledge of trout and the weather and of how to tie knots. Gerald's account of their early relationship is moving both as a portrait of sibling love and as one of a rural innocence that no longer exists. They didn't have Facebook, but \"a message tree\" on&#xa0;which they pinned notes to friends.&#xa0;</p> <p>Life in Hebden Bridge blooms from the page \u2013 a sepia-tinted world of tram rides, box Brownies, Royd's ices, and Sunday hats. \"Whip and top were the rage\", \"Granny\" owned a sweet shop, \"Mam\" was \"selfless\". The description is strewn with parenthetical wonders: \"(Farmers always spoke loudly \u2013 from working in wide fields in windy weather)\". Recollections are tiny blueprints for an emerging design: aged four, after burning himself, Ted exclaimed: \"Fires can jump up and bite you.\" At six, he sighed: \"What a dull old world it would be without wildlife.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Gerald's tutelage of Ted \"in natural country life\" supplies the greatest pleasures of the memoir, its tone recaptured by Gerald's enduring fondness for its details. On one occasion the future poet laureate tore a page from his notebook and, under Gerald's supervision, practised shooting at it, his&#xa0;bullets landing, as his words would, in perfect formation on the page.&#xa0;</p> <p>During the second world war, Gerald was stationed in North Africa with the RAF, so Ted \"came under the influence\" of his elder sister, Olwyn, an \"academic star\". As Ted later remembered in a letter, his teacher pointed at a line in his notebook \u2013 it described \"the frost-chilled snap\" of a wildfowler's gun \u2013 and said, \"That's poetry.\" Ted thought, \"Well, if that's poetry that's the way I think so I can give you no end of it.\"</p> <p>When Ted went to Cambridge, Gerald emigrated to Australia. Whether Ted experienced this as a betrayal goes unexamined, but his immediate idea was to join Gerald after university. This \"well-formulated\" plan was abandoned when Ted met Sylvia Plath. &#xa0;</p> <p>Even though they never met, Gerald felt \"close\" to Sylvia, receiving many letters from her and Ted. One of Sylvia's begins in a characteristic tone, both accusatory and self-belittling: \"Ted had already sealed up your letter in his secretive way, but I made him open it up again to let me gossip for a bit.\" Ted was, Gerald remembers, \"overwhelmed by his American family\", their \"opulence\" and \"social rounds\". Estrangement was apparent on both sides: photographs showing Sylvia's first visit to her parents-in-law are full of smiles (Sylvia's face is the \"tight ball of joy\" Ted describes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/poetry/9780571194728/birthday-letters\" title=\"\"><em>Birthday Letters</em></a>) but there is no doubt which of the group was not born in Yorkshire.&#xa0;</p> <p>A letter from their mother to Gerald a few years later contains a speaking non sequitur: \"Sylvia is strong-willed, but I think left alone they are very happy together.\" \"Strong-willed\" was a euphemism designed to contain whatever behaviour led Mrs Hughes to believe Sylvia \"resented\" Ted's closeness to Olwyn.</p> <p>That Sylvia's anxieties and depression were exacerbated by a cocktail of ineffective medication and an \"awareness that Ted had become infatuated by another woman\" \u2013 Assia Wevill \u2013 was inevitable. Gerald sidesteps the question of his brother's culpability by depicting him as a bystander: \"Sylvia talked of divorce, but Ted balked at this, believing they could get back together.\" But Ted continued to love Assia, whom he later described in \"Dreamers\" wearing \"Soot wet mascara, in flame-orange silks, in gold bracelets,/ Slightly filthy with erotic mystery.\"</p> <p>On the subject of Ted's love life, Gerald's humility, so vital to his portrait of boyhood, leaves the reader wishing he would risk more insight. Perhaps his evasions signal, like the doze of a benevolent grandparent, that certain complexities are beyond his understanding. Assia's suicide is merely reported by him as an uninterpretable fact. Ted's final marriage to Carol Hughes \u2013 a farmer's daughter \u2013 represented for Ted, and perhaps also for Gerald, a return to intelligibility. Ted felt \"as if my real life had been suspended since the age of 16\". A predestined muddle, perhaps, for a poet who looked like a film star.</p> <p><em>Ted and I</em> supplies ample explanation for Ted's belief that \"Poetry is a way of contacting your family when they are gone\". Ted's lifelong yearning for Gerald is heartbreakingly particular, and universal: who has not felt the need of a wise older brother? Ted was lucky enough to have one, and unlucky enough to be separated from him by half the Earth. Until death, Ted felt that if only Gerald lived nearby, \"My life would not be half as crazy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jack Straw is a supreme connoisseur of politics and his memoirs are for political connoisseurs: very much in character, crafted with literary elegance \u2013 erudite, forensic and fascinating. Always a consummate politician \u2013 possessed of \"guile and low cunning\", as his old ministerial boss Barbara Castle memorably put it \u2013 his book is a tour de force through the fluctuating fortunes of the Labour party from the mid-1960s to the 2010 election defeat.</p> <p>Our two stories ran in parallel, but on quite different trajectories, from youth radicalism to cabinet office. In his early 20s, Jack was the bright president of the National Union of Students when in 1969-70 the anti-apartheid campaign I found myself leading burst on to the rugby and cricket fields of Britain with direct action against all-white South African teams. He was supportive but careful to distance himself from our controversial militancy.</p> <p>His account, laced with memorable anecdotes about Labour's tortuous journey into self-destruction in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then eventual recovery and success in the 1990s, is a sound guide to outsiders wanting some insight into this crucial period. He is rightly generous to Neil Kinnock who, he remarks persuasively, would have made an excellent prime minister. But he also rejects the conventional wisdom on Kinnock's successor, the widely admired John Smith, with whom he had a breach when he bravely argued for the abolition of the iconic Clause&#xa0;4 of Labour's constitution nearly two years before Tony Blair reformed it. Straw believed Smith was not fit to be prime minister. The reason, he rather brutally gives, albeit \"with some trepidation\": Smith's heavy drinking. Such frankness about senior colleagues applied also to the Commons office of Mo Mowlam, \"whose floor was littered with her underwear, and who might, if you were unlucky, suddenly decide, in the middle of a conversation, to change some of it\".</p> <p>He is also disarmingly but engagingly revealing about the pain of his father's anger toward his mother (never witnessing \"any tenderness between them\") and then his father's abrupt departure, leaving her alone to bring up her children. An even more startling revelation \u2013 especially to those like me who worked closely with him in government \u2013 was: \"I'd always been prone to 'impostor syndrome' and felt what I had achieved was bound to be taken away from me.\"</p> <p>He gives a real insight into being a cabinet minister \u2013 what the Private Office is like, the ministerial car drivers, the close protection officers, and the role of cabinet committees \u2013 laced with exquisite incidents that carry the reader along.</p> <p>With an impressive grasp of history and a deep Labour party hinterland, he stood out among younger, more technocratic ministers. I found him commendably outspoken in cabinet, not least over the growing collapse in public trust suffered by both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments. But then Jack also lost the trust of Blair because of his manoeuvring on Europe and a calculated shift of allegiance to Brown \u2013 to be arbitrarily demoted after five years as a respected foreign secretary, though his own explanation is growing differences over the Middle East.</p> <p>As a formidable constant in top cabinet posts throughout Labour's 13 years in government \u2013 home secretary, foreign secretary, leader of the Commons and lord chancellor \u2013 he is well placed to give his take on the dominant issues, including Iraq, and the frustrated plots of colleagues as Gordon Brown's premiership disappeared into a quagmire. He ends with a hilariously self-deprecating description of getting lost on London's buses and learning to drive again, after 13 years of being guided and transported by protection officers.</p> <p>A big hitter with acute political antennae, he nevertheless gained a reputation for delivering legislation that bit back in unexpected ways; his well-intentioned but deeply flawed 2000 act reforming party financing a good example. A senior Labour MP was recently acclaimed by colleagues when he quipped sourly: \"We need a one-clause bill to repeal all Jack's acts.\"</p> <p>As a self-confessed \"anorak\", Straw had a nerdish obsession for factual detail, which often got in the way of his ability to win an argument. But his photographic memory and prodigious appetite for devouring official documents left colleagues in constant awe. He was also good to work for, delegating well, listening and encouraging a team spirit.</p> <p>Some memoirs by former Labour politicians generated headlines and big serialisation fees \u2013 promptly to disappear, quickly remaindered. This book will stand the test of time. Straw's account of Labour's journeys in and out of power over nearly five decades is a must for serious students of government and politics.</p> <p><em>Peter Hain's own memoirs Outside In (Biteback) are just out in paperback</em></p>",
  "<p>At one point sitting opposite Dame Judi Dench over a pot of tea at a hotel in Covent Garden, I find myself asking her if she has that recurrent dream, the one in which you are on a stage and the curtain is about to go up but can't remember any of your lines or the part you are supposed to play. It seems, as I'm saying it, a bit ridiculous to ask that question of Dench, who not long ago was by a margin voted \"the greatest actor of all time\" in an exhaustive poll of the readers of <em>The Stage </em>magazine. She is a&#xa0;woman who has hardly put a foot wrong, or missed a beat, since she first performed for an audience 60 years ago. I'd imagine any deep-seated anxiety about being caught out melted away long since. But no, she admits, suddenly slightly grim-faced, that she has the dream all the time. \"I'm standing there, all dressed up, and whispering: 'What do I say now?'\" she says. \"It's awful, really, but it's the big fear. The one that never goes away.\"</p> <p>Is this anxiety true? I guess so. Though talking to Dench you do have the occasional nagging reminder of what she is so profoundly good at having you forget: that if she puts her mind to it, she can probably make you believe in anything. In the previous few days I have watched her and re-watched her as Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth I, as Iris Murdoch losing her mind, as J Edgar Hoover's mother, as a widow discovering India in<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/26/best-exotic-marigold-hotel-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em></a>, and have been immediately in thrall each time. Now here she is, oddly, in front of me, profoundly familiar, conspiratorial, engaged, gossipy, a good listener, seamlessly inhabiting the role of eager interviewee even at the age of 77, and delivering polished versions of stories that she has honed for just such an audience. The one about how her mother and father came to see her in <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>early in her career, and her dad was so engrossed in her performance that at the line \"Where are my mother and father?\" he responded: \"Here we are, darling, in row H.\" The ones about being giggly and starstruck on Oscar night.</p> <p>Two years ago Dench published a memoir, dictated to a ghost writer, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Furthermore-Dame-Judi-Dench/dp/1780224400/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349954440&amp;sr=1-2\" title=\"\"><em>And Furthermore</em></a>. It's a breezy, curious book, which treats her life as a never-ending series of wonderful adventures on the stage and in front of the camera. Parents and siblings, her late husband Michael Williams and her daughter Finty get supporting roles from time to time, but anything in the way of revelatory emotion or psychological insight is saved for Cleopatra or Mother Courage. In the past six decades Dench has only twice had any time off from working: when she gave birth to Finty, and when she was nursing her husband, who died of cancer in 2001. She talks about her thespian fears of not being in work, but she has never experienced that state. She likes to recall how Trevor Nunn was a bit sniffy when she mentioned she had been asked to do the sitcom with her husband that became <em>A Fine Romance</em>. Her response was something of a&#xa0;statement of intent: \"I think it is our business to do as many things as we can\u2026\"</p> <p>I'm struck, talking to her, that when you ask her about her life, she thinks first of her work. What have been the best of times, I wonder. She immediately thinks of \"going to the Vic and all those plays. Stratford days on bikes. Then theatre in Oxford and Nottingham and being in West Africa with the company\u2026\"</p> <p>We are here on the occasion of another of those ongoing adventures: Dench's seventh outing in a Bond movie as M, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2012/oct/05/skyfall-bond-daniel-craig-video\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>, a film of which I have been allowed to see three explosive and chaotic minutes. In those minutes she appears to announce the death of 007, an obit that quickly seems greatly exaggerated. There have been rumours that this will be Dench's last outing as M, that in the film she identifies her successor, a shady Ralph Fiennes, before saying a brutal goodbye to Her Majesty's Secret Service. She's too practised a Bond girl to give any of this away before the closely guarded opening night, though.</p> <p>The role has become a nice punctuation mark in her life in recent years, she suggests, and of course \"great fun\". Playing with gadgets as M in her first film she recalled how she became \"completely drunk with power, because I can't mend anything, or even put the ironing board up properly\". She still likes the fact that she gets to be imperiously bossy in it, though is quick to also say that: \"I would hate people to think bossy is all I can do.\" She gets on well with Daniel Craig, but not well enough for him to let her in on the secret of his Olympic parachute jump with the Queen. She's been thrilled this time around to be directed again by Sam Mendes, whom she first worked with on <em>The Cherry Orchard </em>20 years ago. \"You feel great when there is someone you trust there on the bridge, a firm hand.\"</p> <p>Dench talks about M with the kind of self-deprecating matter-of-factness with which she discusses all her roles. It's good for her because, she says, unlike Craig, on whose shoulders the whole thing rests, she gets to take it lightly, be a bit irresponsible. It's not her most onerous assignment, even in terms of travel: \"This time I got to Pinewood. And I got to Glencoe, which was very beautiful. And I got to Aldershot, which was slightly less so,\" she says. The character has developed \"necessarily, just by the fact I have got older, and she has to work even harder to prove she is up to it...\"</p> <p>Bond was important for Dench in one way, in that it has given her an international audience. Before 1995's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/60213/goldeneye\" title=\"\"><em>GoldenEye</em></a><em> </em>she was little known in America. She still gets asked sometimes: \"Apart from M, have you done anything else?\" and no doubt demurs from mentioning the record seven Olivier awards and indelible roles that included her Juliet for Franco Zeffirelli in 1960; the first London Sally Bowles in <em>Cabaret</em> in 1968; Lady Macbeth in Trevor Nunn's landmark 1976 production; Cleopatra opposite Anthony Hopkins in 1987 and on and on.</p> <p>One of the more curious aspects of Dench's career is how long it took filmmakers to realise what she might be capable of in front of the camera. At the first screen test she went to, while she was starring at the Old Vic, a man looked at her for a long time and said: \"Well, Miss Dench, I have to tell you: you have every single thing wrong with your face.\" When she walked out, she vowed never to try it again. She didn't properly for a long time.</p> <p>She still feels like a beginner on screen, she suggests, typically separating her own efforts from those of \"really good film actors, proper ones, who will always look at a take after it is done\". She can't do that. \"I find it too hard to cope with that idea that you can't change it. I&#xa0;love the way in the theatre that you can change it every night.\"</p> <p>She tries to avoid seeing herself on screen at all, she says. I mention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/22/j-egar-leonardo-dicaprio-review\" title=\"\"><em>J. Edgar</em></a>, in which, directed by Clint Eastwood, she plays Leonardo DiCaprio's domineering mother to scene-stealing effect, and she says brightly: \"What's it like? I suppose I should see it.\"</p> <p>Has anything she has done on screen pleasantly surprised her, I wonder.</p> <p>\"Never,\" she says. \"I think it is always appalling to see yourself on film. I think John Gielgud used to say that he would love to have had a&#xa0;performance of a play he had been in to put on his mantelpiece so he could live with it&#xa0; and see exactly the ways he could have done&#xa0; it better. Because there are always ways. In the&#xa0; theatre you can change things ever so slightly; it's&#xa0;an organic thing. Whereas in film you only have that chance on the day, and you have no control over it at all.\"</p> <p>When I mention <em>J. Edgar</em> she mentions, too, being \"completely daunted\" by Clint Eastwood. \"He rang me up, and I thought at first it was a friend sending me up. So I didn't take it seriously to start with. And then I realised it was really him and that was a tricky conversation. I hadn't met him by the time I got on set, really. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder and there was this immensely tall man standing there, a bit terrifying, but brilliant\u2026\"</p> <p>She still likes to think of herself a bit as an interloper in that world; it makes it easier. Who else has she been overawed by, I ask.</p> <p>\"Oh, lots of them. George Clooney \u2013 I was bit in awe there. And my daughter was mad about Antonio Banderas, and we were at a party and he came over and asked for a light. I thought she was going to faint. We love going to awards for that reason, to see these huge larger-than-life figures\u2026\"</p> <p>It's quite endearing, this insistent modesty \u2013 but it's also, you guess, a way of taking pressure off herself for anything other than acting itself. She has developed other strategies for this. Infamously she has a habit of turning up for a new part without having once read the script. She has always liked to have things read to her rather than reading them herself, and now she has the \"perfect excuse\" of an eye condition, macular degeneration, inherited from her mother, which makes a lot of reading impossible (though the disease will not, as some reports have had it, lead to loss of vision). \"Even before that, though,\" Dench says, \"I have always had a director tell me the story. I want them to put it into words for me. And I am interested in what they choose to put in and leave out. That, after all, is what you are going to do for the audience. I like to have it presented to my mind's eye.\"</p> <p>She adopts this approach even when choosing parts. Her husband Michael would read scripts for her and give her a line or two and she would immediately have a sense of whether she wanted to do it. Finty, also an actor, does it for her now. \"I have always said that phrase: 'What larks, Pip,'\" Dench recalls, \"and when Finty saw that line in the script of <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>, she told me I just had to do it. I was having doubts about going to India and so on, but she was right.\" In all of this she seems to want to hand over responsibility, to restrict her choices to her acting.</p> <p>In her spare time on set, she often paints landscapes \u2013 \"So much better than taking photographs, because it really makes you look and remember,\" she says. I ask her if the process of constructing a character is similar.</p> <p>\"No, a painting is your decision when it comes to it, whereas if you are playing a character it is also everybody else's decision, really, what it should be.\"</p> <p>Does she ever paint her characters from her mind's eye, as Antony Sher, for example, always does?</p> <p>\"I don't, although when I am with a script or in rehearsal I might doodle a character's face or something. I nearly always do that. But what I do is listen to what everybody says about you and try to assimilate that.\"</p> <p>She is careful about what information she takes on board. Her next role is in a film directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-frears\" title=\"\">Stephen Frears</a>, <em>Philomena</em>, the true story of an Irish woman who searched for 50 years for the son, born illegitimately, taken from her by nuns and \"sold\" to a wealthy American family. Steve Coogan will play the journalist Martin Sixsmith, who helped the woman in her quest, and wrote the original story. \"I&#xa0;can go and meet Philomena Lee,\" Dench says, \"though I am not yet sure that I&#xa0;will. I remember playing <em>On Giant's Shoulders </em>about that lovely thalidomide boy Terry Wiles. The first day of filming we were up near Sandy on the A1, and I came face to face with his mother and she just burst into tears and went to pieces. I&#xa0;was shaken by that, and ever since I have been wary of meeting the people whose lives I have been playing. But I think I will meet Philomena Lee. I think it would be good for me to meet her and get the tone of her.\"</p> <p>Does she always start with an inkling of tone?</p> <p>\"In some ways,\" she says. \"But anything can be useful. I wanted to be a set designer when I&#xa0;was young. And I still think I am as interested in a set and the costumes as anything else. I remember I was in Stratford once and only doing one play, so in my afternoons I&#xa0;went off and learned how to knot a wig as they would have done back then. That gave me a wonderful insight\u2026\"</p> <p>Her daughter has said she knows her mother inside out, except for one thing. She has no idea what motivates her to work, the continuing compulsive drive. Does she have any idea herself?</p> <p>\"I just feel I have to keep doing it,\" Dench says. \"I never want to stop. I need to learn every day. I don't question the curiosity. It's&#xa0;like I&#xa0;love quizzes and things. Did you know what Nostradamus's first name was? Michel! It's not likely, is it?\"</p> <p>I wonder how often she feels she comes up against the edge of what she is capable of.</p> <p>\"That's always what you hope,\" she says. \"I&#xa0;long to be asked to do, you know, the Afghan woman who learns the tightrope late in life. I&#xa0;remember reading the novel<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/04/drama.features\" title=\"\"><em>Notes on a Scandal</em></a><em> </em>and thinking: I would love to play that woman, to try to find a humanity in that dreadful person. I was thrilled to be asked to do that.\"</p> <p>One role that Dench did shy away from playing was that of a widow after she became one herself. She allowed herself to be cast in that role by John Madden for <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>, however. What made her change her mind?</p> <p>\"Well, to begin with, I didn't want people to make that connection, in a way. And what I found hardest about the <em>Marigold Hotel</em> was that I looked so much like myself. I kept asking John if I could dye my hair or something. I wanted it one step removed. I think a lot of actors are very shy people, and you can only properly express yourself if you are endeavouring to be another person. It is like those moulds for gingerbread men, I sometimes think. You have to inhabit another body in a way, make yourself another shape.\"</p> <p>She and Williams were famously devoted; he bought her a red rose each Friday of their married life. Did acting become even more crucial to her after he died?</p> <p>\"Yes, it came to my rescue, really,\" she says. \"I went out to Nova Scotia almost immediately after Michael's funeral and made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/03/philipfrench\" title=\"\"><em>The Shipping News</em></a> with Kevin Spacey for four weeks. And then I&#xa0;came back and the day after started <em>Iris</em> and did all of that. And&#xa0;then I immediately went back to Canada to finish <em>The Shipping News</em>. And then I was into <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em>. People, friends, kept saying: 'You are not facing up to it; you need to face up to it,' and maybe they were right, but I felt I was \u2013 in the acting. Grief supplies you with an enormous amount of energy. I needed to use that up.\"</p> <p>Dench by all accounts is the consummate team player, and she seems to have something of a dread of being alone. Her daughter and&#xa0;grandson, now 15, live with her part of the&#xa0;time at her house in Surrey, and on her five acres she also has the company of \"a dog, four cats, two guinea pigs, a lot of ducks and a lot of coots and 10 water voles, and a huge goldfish that has died twice and I blew into its mouth twice and revived it. Lazarus.\" She grew up in a&#xa0;noisy household in York with&#xa0;drama-loving parents, her father a doctor, and two older brothers, and 17 cats (\"During the&#xa0;war,\" she says, \"nobody had enough food for animals so we took them in.\") Part of her&#xa0;impulse to work has always seemed to recreate that, to be a spirited part of something bigger than herself. Before she goes on stage she always has the audience hubbub piped into her dressing room \u2013 \"I need that sense of life,\" she says. Her worst fear is \"a one-woman show\". One gap in her compendious CV I&#xa0;note is any Beckett.</p> <p>\"I was asked to do that play <em>Happy Days </em>once,\" she says. \"But she is on her own on stage with a thing in her left hand and one in her right. I&#xa0;thought: I can't do that. So yes \u2013 I was beaten there. I don't want to do anything on my own, not at all. I like that thing of actors coming together and doing that thing that evening for that particular audience. Not any audience, but this one in front of you.\"</p> <p>There must have been times, I say, when she hasn't got on with her fellow players in a long theatre run\u2026</p> <p>She thinks for a moment. \"No, I've never been in anything when I have wished it would be over, or when it hasn't come together,\" she says.</p> <p>I was, I say, marvelling at her Wikipedia page earlier. Does she ever allow herself the satisfaction of feeling like she has done enough?</p> <p>She looks a bit shocked, takes a sip of tea. \"I&#xa0;hope not,\" she says with a smile. \"It might well feel like enough for someone else. But it always feels like nowhere near enough for me\u2026\"</p> <p>Skyfall<em> is released on 23 October</em></p>",
  "<p>George Osborne was increasingly isolated over energy policy last night, after the head of the CBI said that too much reliance on gas as a future source of energy would leave consumers and businesses dangerously exposed to further sharp price rises on global markets.</p> <p>After a week in which two of Britain's biggest energy suppliers shocked customers by announcing increases of up to 9% on gas and electricity bills from next month, business leaders are warning that the chancellor's enthusiasm for a \"dash for gas\" looks like a recipe for economic and environmental disaster.</p> <p>In the latest blow to Osborne \u2013 before a crucial ministerial meeting to determine government energy policy this week \u2013 the director general of the CBI, John Cridland, said it was \"crucial\" to avoid too much reliance on one energy source, particularly if, as in the case of gas, much would have to be imported.</p> <p>Many business leaders, together with the environmental lobby, argue that investment in green energy will not only be good for the UK economy in terms of investment and job creation, but will also mean the UK has more control over its own future energy provision, rather than being reliant on imports.</p> <p>In a clear warning to the chancellor, who has made no secret of his support for greater use of gas and less government support for renewable energy, Cridland said: \"Gas has a big part to play in the UK's energy mix in the years to come, but we cannot become dependent on any one source of energy.</p> <p>Over-reliance on new gas would leave us exposed to global price and supply fluctuations and jeopardise our carbon targets, so we need to build more of everything, including renewables, nuclear and CCS [carbon capture and storage].\"</p> <p>Last Monday, seven global electricity and nuclear technology companies, including Siemens and Mitsubishi Power Systems, threatened to withdraw hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in new energy projects in Britain because of uncertainties of about the government's commitment to green, low-carbon policies. The withdrawal of so much investment would mean the loss of thousands of jobs. The firms said the lack of certainty and absence of decisions \"have caused us to reassess the level of political risk in the UK\".</p> <p>This Thursday, the so-called Quad of senior ministers, which includes David Cameron, Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander, Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, will meet to decide on the content of the energy bill, which aims to set the framework for a future of affordable, clean energy in the UK.</p> <p>Sources say Osborne may push for cuts to offshore wind subsidies from government and for reductions in support for carbon capture and storage projects from four to two or even one, in return for agreeing a flexible decarbonisation target for the industry.</p> <p>Joss Garman, the political director of Greenpeace, called on Clegg to stand up for the green agenda at the meeting: \"When rocketing gas prices have already driven up bills for millions of families, and when both business and consumer groups are warning that gas is likely to get even more expensive, it would be idiotic for ministers to give the green light to a big increase in our reliance on pricey imports of this polluting fuel. The Liberal Democrats should insist on stabilising consumer bills with clean, home-grown renewables instead.\"</p> <p>Writing in today's <em>Observer</em>, Lord Stern, author of the 2006 Stern review on the economics of climate change, said that, while subsidies for green energy would eventually have to end, it was \"crucial\" that any reductions in subsidies for low-carbon energy were not imposed so suddenly that they would \"undermine the confidence of the private sector and hold back badly needed investment in the power sector\".Osborne's support for a new dash for gas was revealed in a letter he wrote to Ed Davey, the Libl Dem energy and climate change secretary, in July.</p> <p>\"We need a statement which gives a clear, strong signal that we regard unabated gas as able to play a core part of our electricity generation to at least 2030 \u2013 not just providing back-up for wind plant or peaking capacity,\" he wrote.</p> <p>\"This will provide context for the gas strategy and will help reassure investors, enabling investment in new gas power stations and the infrastructure that supports them such as pipelines between Norway and the UK which could enable us to become a gas hub.</p> <p>\"We should commit publicly to ensuring that British consumers will be able to get the benefits if the price of gas falls.\"</p> <p>However, speaking at an IMF/World Bank conference in Japan last Friday he admitted he was unhappy that energy prices were rising so fast: \"Of course I'm concerned when I see electricity bills going up, partly that is because of things beyond our control \u2013 what's happening in the world with oil prices and gas prices.\"</p> <p>Today an investigation by consumer magazine <em>Which? </em>finds that only one in 10 people can identify the cheapest energy deal when presented with a range of standard energy tariffs. When shown the tariffs in a simpler form, in the style of petrol forecourt displays, the number shot up to nine out of 10.</p> <p>Only 8% of the people could identify the cheapest deal out of the six leading suppliers' standard electricity tariffs, 60% got the answer wrong and 32% said they simply didn't know.</p>",
  "<p>It is not surprising that there was the shake of long-suppressed rage in Australian prime minister Julia Gillard's voice last week as<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEkPvPWFTj4&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\"> she gave the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, a pasting over sexism</a>, footage of which has attracted more than a million YouTube hits.</p> <p>Last year, Abbott stood on stage attacking her climate change policies in front of crude signs saying \"Ditch the Witch\" and referring to her as a male green politician's \"bitch\". Abbott has, she claims, regularly cat-called sexist remarks across the parliamentary dispatch box at levels too low for the Hansard recorders to pick up.</p> <p>\"I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man, I will not\u2026 if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia\u2026 he needs a mirror,\" Gillard said in the speech that won her worldwide plaudits, including from the US-based feminist site Jezebel, which called her a \"badass motherfucker\". She quoted an interview in which Abbott said that while he agreed that sons and daughters should have equal opportunity: \"What if men are by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command?\"</p> <p>Her attack followed a messy debate over the attempt by Abbott's opposition, made up of Liberal and National party members, to force out the speaker of the House of Representatives for the first time in history. They accused the speaker, Peter Slipper, of misogyny after text messages emerged from a sordid court case revealing that he sent a gay male staffer sexually charged messages in which he used unusual euphemisms for female genitalia.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Gillard and her Labor party, which relies on support from independents, stood by the speaker and narrowly defeated a motion of no-confidence. Slipper resigned anyway. But in the meantime, Abbott, a political pugilist, insulted Gillard in a way that any politically engaged viewer instantly knew would cut her deep. Every day that she supported Slipper, he said, was \"another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame\".</p> <p>Mentioning dying may have been insensitive. Gillard had been forced to fly from Russia, where she was attending a meeting, to her hometown of Adelaide only one month before when her beloved Welsh-born father, John, to whom she ascribed her values, died following a long illness. But Abbott went further by extending the gibe to refer to dying of shame. That had Gillard burning. Only nine days earlier, Sydney's <em>Sun-Herald</em> reported that a conservative Sydney radio shock jock, Alan Jones, had told a Liberal party dinner that Gillard's father had \"died of shame\".</p> <p>As Gillard rose to her feet, she ditched the robotic delivery that has sometimes made her seem distant and inhuman, forged by a political lifetime of living in a gender warzone, while seeking to give the public impression of being unruffled, a woman in control. It is a paradox of her position that, in a post-feminist world, women in power are expected publicly to forget their gender and to affect apathy when confronted by misogyny, lest they be accused of behaving badly.</p> <p>As she has made her way, Gillard has encountered strange strains of sexism. With arts and law degrees, she has been an industrial lawyer and federal education minister. Yet there has been criticism of her red hair, her voice, the size of her bottom and even, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSPdIlt5yOg\" title=\"\">when she lost a shoe as police rather clumsily wrestled her away from a Canberra Aboriginal demonstration</a>, her choice of footwear.</p> <p>Gillard's parents, John and Moira, emigrated to Australia from Wales when she was five, hoping the warmer climate would assist their daughter's weak lungs. She says her father taught her to believe in the Labour movement and trade unionism and to understand the power of learning to change lives. The family admired Gough Whitlam, Australia's reforming Labor prime minister of the 1970s. \"She was steeped in political discourse around the table. When Gough came on TV, the shout would come out, 'Quick, Gough's on,'\" her father once said of her.</p> <p>He appears to have been something of a feminist himself. Asked about his daughter's decision not to have children, he said: \"Women are not breeding machines, you know. If they want to marry and have children, that's lovely. If they want to remain single and build a professional life, that's wonderful.\"</p> <p>Gillard is not single, but she has never married and lives with her partner, Tim Mathieson. An atheist and former student politician , Gillard has been prey to the barbs of socially conservative voters, fellow politicians and media shock jocks since it first became clear that she had leadership ambitions.</p> <p>Seven years ago, as a backbencher exploring the possibility of toppling then Labor leader, Kim Beazley, she was photographed at her home in Melbourne beside an empty fruit bowl. Critics said her kitchen was \"eerily stark\" and \"lifeless\" and questioned the absence of fruit, as if it was a metaphor for her childlessness and her lack of attention to the housewifely duties to which \"ordinary\" women must attend.</p> <p>She was amazed that \"anyone could really contend that my life, my thoughts, my character and my worth could be defined by the state of my kitchen,\" she said. The following year, Bill Heffernan, a blustering bull of a man and a Liberal senator, claimed she could not, as then deputy Labor leader, understand her voters because she was \"deliberately barren\".</p> <p>In a 2003 Australian Federal Parliament paper, Gillard said that when women are written about, no matter what their past careers, \"it is with a sort of breathless 'Will they cope in this tough world?' kind of spin\". She added: \"Women in parliament should not be judged as if they are in some sort of concessional class.\"</p> <p>In office, Gillard's government has pushed through a carbon pricing scheme linked to rigorous emission cuts by 2050, a national disability insurance scheme and the world's first legislation forcing plain packaging on tobacco companies. The economy is weakening but remains stronger than most.</p> <p>In more conservative mode, her government has re-established offshore processing centres for asylum seekers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea to try to stop people dying as they chance life in unseaworthy boats, but also bowing to a racist undercurrent in Australian society. As a social liberal on most matters, Gillard continues to confuse by opposing gay marriage herself, but allowing the Labor caucus a conscience vote.</p> <p>\"Foreign policy is not my passion,\" she told ABC TV in Brussels the month after becoming prime minister. She went into politics to make a difference to \"opportunity questions\" and particularly to make a difference in education. Reading to children in a school came more naturally to her than attending international meetings, she said.</p> <p>Although in Australia, most power to run schools resides with the states, as prime minister, she is pushing through federal reforms. There is a question mark, however, over who foots the \u00a34.1bn bill. More generally, Gillard's opponents continue to keep alive a question of legitimacy about her incumbency because of the way she won her prime ministership some 28 months ago.</p> <p>Kevin Rudd, whose leadership won Labor power in 2007 following a decade of conservative rule, was sliding in the polls and a parliamentary party, tired of his explosive temper and thuggish management style, seized on Gillard's move to oust him.</p> <p>But the electorate, seeing only an articulate leader seemingly adept at foreign policy who had finally got a Labor government back with the \"Kevin 07\" campaign, could barely grasp why it had happened. Labor insiders, especially Gillard, were loath to tell their secrets. And because of the nature of her ascension to power, she could not, as one of the prime movers in getting women elected, afford any feminist triumphalism.</p> <p>Australian celebrations of a first female prime minister were curiously muted and while Rudd's attempt to replace Gillard failed, he is still an aspirant. And stories about a scandal over work she performed with a past boyfriend while she was a lawyer continue to appear, despite her denials of wrongdoing.</p> <p>For many, the \"real Julia\" is still an enigma. She has a \"blokey\" penchant for Australian rules football and rugby league, but appears otherwise to live for her job. As she faces two hostile men who want that job \u2013 Abbott and Rudd \u2013 her speech has regenerated debate about the treatment of women.</p> <p>Now Abbott's deputy, Julie Bishop, is calling for Gillard to apologise for branding him a misogynist. Meanwhile, certain members of the Australian press gallery, stung by criticism that they were busy having a go at Gillard themselves while local social media users and political analysts overseas recognised the power in her outburst, are having a rethink. The times perhaps are changing.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9s Segovia is revered as one of the greatest guitarists of the 20th century. But, 25 years after his death, his reputation is being challenged by one of his former students, the guitar virtuoso John Williams, who has attacked him as a musical and social snob who stifled creativity among his students.</p> <p>Williams, an Australian who lives in the UK, studied with the Spanish maestro in the 1950s and believes that Segovia looked down on music without the right classical provenance and bullied young musicians with teaching methods that were unsympathetic and unhelpful.</p> <p>His disparaging comments are to be published this month in a new biography, entitled <em>Strings Attached: The Life and Music of John Williams</em>. The author, William Starling, a friend, has had Williams's full co-operation.</p> <p>Starling told the <em>Observer</em> that Williams was \"famously private\", resisting the very notion of a biography until now: \"His family and friends were amazed when he agreed to do it.\"</p> <p>He added that, despite being a pupil of Segovia, \"he is very outspoken about [him] and the way Segovia is hailed as being the most important person in modern guitar\".</p> <p>Starling reveals that Williams remembers Segovia making his students copy his every inflection \u2013 demands that he believes \"undermined any sense of personal ownership of a piece\".</p> <p>The biographer adds: \"It was as if Segovia had\u2026 ordained that there was but one valid transcription, one interpretation and one fingering of anything in the repertoire and they were his own. John feels that, perhaps because of this, he never played his best for Segovia and that many of the maestro's students would have been better if they were not so constrained.\"</p> <p>Segovia is credited as the father of the classical guitar, having widened the repertoire, transcribing works originally for lute and harpsichord and breathing new life into the instrument. Williams studied under him at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, and is regarded as one of the foremost musicians of his generation, a master of the classical repertoire who brought the guitar to a wider audience with the group Sky and through collaborations involving the music of South America, Africa and jazz.</p> <p>Williams, whose recordings include Cavatina, a worldwide hit after it became the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, reveals through the biography that, on a visit to London in 1977, Segovia heard him play Cavatina. The Spaniard commented that it was \"a very pretty tune\" and asked who wrote it, declining to add further praise or comment when told that it was Stanley Myers. Starling writes: \"This is a perfect illustration of what John Williams characterises as the musical conservatism and snobbishness of Segovia. He liked the piece but was reluctant to give it credit because it did not have the right classical provenance.\"</p> <p>Segovia's snobbishness, Williams told Starling, included a dislike for South American music, especially that with popular roots.</p> <p>Williams struggles to understand why the Spaniard was dismissive of the Venezuelan guitarist Antonio Lauro and why he banned the Paraguayan Agust\u00edn Barrios from his classes. He also claims, through the biographer, that Segovia \"sought to conceal his background\" and \"spun an image that he was from a cultured class. Segovia's desire for status was finally sated when he was ennobled in 1981 by King Juan Carlos.\"</p> <p>Graham Wade, classical guitarist and author of books on Segovia, defended the Spaniard, describing Williams's criticisms as unfair: \"Segovia's pupils all played very differently. Segovia's guitar was always absolutely lyrical. He saw the guitar as a melodic instrument\u2026 John is perhaps the most technically accomplished guitarist the world has seen\u2026 A worthy successor to Segovia.\"</p> <p>EMI Classics, whose recordings include Segovia's performances, declined to comment.</p>",
  "<p>As Lord Forsyth of Drumlean pointed out last week, there are many weighty issues to be considered before Alex Salmond is allowed to bounce the whole of the UK into extending the vote to 16-year-olds, purely because he hopes the Scottish ones will be keen on him.</p> <p>\"Matters of electoral importance and the extension of the franchise are not matters to be carried out in hole-in-the-corner negotiations,\" said Lord Forsyth, a person who, 16-year-olds may be interested to hear, owes his seat in the Upper House to a hole-in-the-corner system that we older people call \"patronage\": synonyms \"sponsorship\", \"cronyism\", \"rewarding loyalty\". This means that no one, literally, as in not even people over 18, voted to empower Lord Forsyth, who is a banker in his spare time. Funnily enough, even the Labour party likes this system so much they just voted to save it.</p> <p>But of course Lord Forsyth is right. There are hugely important questions to answer before 16-year-olds can be invited, just like that, into the complicated electoral process. Are they sufficiently mature? Can they tell one party from another? Are they, as some fear, too busy with their exams and hectic social lives to be arsed? Even the care and suppression of spots, a priority with some teenagers, has been cited as a reason under-18s might struggle, unlike older voters whose complexions have settled down, to give adequate thought to the case for further quantitative easing.</p> <p>There was a long period, between being 16 and then, decades later, getting to know some living teenagers, including the one in my own house, when I would have agreed with champions of the status quo. Presumably \u2013 without knowing any \u2013 these 16-year-olds were as clueless as my younger self, but with an increased obsession with their peer group that comes of being more affluent and better entertained, with unpatrolled access to social media.</p> <p>If these conditions were not enough to guarantee extreme teen disengagement, scientists have supplied biological reasons to disregard their BlackBerry-fixated frontal cortexes. Last time there was a significant move to reduce the voting age, Richard Dawkins set out the potential risks posed to our current epistocracy by the undeveloped teenaged bonce. An epistocracy, as older voters will know, is government by wise people, with fully developed brains. In practice, it means that a grown-up who believes in magic can be health secretary, or a grown-up bully can be chief whip, but a schoolgirl the age of, say, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/malala-yousafzai-fatwa-gunmen-pakistan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the 14-year-old Pakistani blogger, has yet to acquire the intellectual credentials to vote.</p> <p>In a 2003 article, Dawkins and his co-writer, Elisabeth Cornwell, cited evidence from neuroscientists that \"the brain undergoes major reconstruction from the onset of puberty which continues until 20 or beyond\". Crucial, if I understand them correctly, is the importance of this continuing development to the frontal lobes, \"the very bit that enables us to think in the abstract, weigh moral dilemmas and control our impulses\". Without a fully developed lobe, for example, our own, superbly frontally endowed mayor of London would not be the dedicated family man many Conservatives still hope to see as prime minister (that's the person who runs the country, kids).</p> <p>It was not even clear, the authors said, that teens are developed enough to \"be making life-changing decisions for themselves\". This comes as no news, of course, to all those already working to extend childhood ever further, by keeping all teenagers at school until they are 18, or by denying them proper wages, or by confining them within the parental home until their frontal lobes are ready to explode.</p> <p>Dawkins and Cornwell quoted a neuroscientist, Jay Giedd, stressing that teens are not stupid or incapable, but \"it's sort of unfair to expect them to have adult levels of organisational skills or decision-making before their brain is finished being built\".</p> <p>On the other hand, the unfinished brain can be pretty good at sport, music, creating computer software. So what are its key disadvantages? True, 16-year-olds can be rude, sulky, reckless, ignorant, violent and unreliable. It worked for do John Prescott. Even if \u2013 as politicians must hope \u2013 most children are know too little about Westminster to make unflattering comparisons with the brainpower on show at PMQs, the evidence of their own eyes confirms that they barely compete, in terms of incivility, temper, swearing, impulsivity, prejudice, time-wasting and an unedifying dependency on the <em>Daily Mail</em> website, with millions of fully enfranchised grown-ups. If they ever think of restricting voting by the inadequately brained, illiterate, non-taxpaying or irredeemably ignorant, the consequences for adults are chilling.</p> <p>It's natural, if unlikely to cultivate teenage responsibility, that opponents of age reduction should dwell so unforgivingly on misbehaviour that corrects itself, presumably, the minute they turn 18. No, teenagers don't always evince much money sense, although they do, as consumers, pay sales tax. Yes, if voting booths were bedrooms they would probably leave wet towels all over them or worse. And supposing you could get in a voting booth and drive it away at 80mph, enhanced teen access would indeed be extremely worrying. But having now witnessed some of the more lovable teenage qualities \u2013 idealism, energy, a sense of injustice, open-mindedness \u2013 these seem to be exactly the ones of which modern politics is starved. If it's obviously placing too much faith in citizenship classes to think that enfranchised year 11s would emerge like so many wee Milibands, agog for manifestos and fratricide, how could this new chance to connect their hopes with political action not be an improvement on reality?</p> <p>Even a limited turnout by young voters, minus all the ones who are too apathetic or too busy insulting policemen or holding Nazi-themed drinking parties, might inject some life into the next election.</p> <p>Naturally, engaged teenagers would want answers on stuff such as unpaid interns, their chaotic exam system, tuition fees, the minimum wage, workfare, eroding benefits and also perhaps any military engagements in which they might be invited to serve.</p> <p>More important, given existing parental interest in the above, would be a fresh look at policies that affect future generations, by voters who do not expect to be dead soon. If voting has to be rationed, maybe it should be non-taxpaying elderly citizens, who will not live to see the impact, say, of political betrayal on pollution and climate change or of carelessness about fuel sustainability, who should give way to the 16-year-olds?</p> <p>We could compromise: make it 17. So that teenagers only had a year to wait, after they had already married, donated an organ, bought fireworks, left home and signed up to fight for their country, before they were allowed to choose, alone in an exposed voting booth, between one nation and aspiration nation. To judge by the resistance, you'd think we were doing them a great big favour.</p>",
  "<p>One of the more memorable scenes in 1980s cinema comes in <em>Witness</em>, when detective Harrison Ford mucks in with the Amish community among which he is hiding and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wo_VSc9iyc\" title=\"\">helps them raise a barn</a>. In a few minutes dozens of men and boys lift its timber frame to the sky, hammering and slotting it together as they go. There are some unfortunate aspects \u2013 the women's role is to serve drinks and lock meaningful looks with the men, and the music is stomach-churningly heartwarming \u2013 but the scene shows something powerful: the idea of building as something direct and shared, not divided into many specialisms.</p> <p>In 1985, the year <em>Witness</em> was released, Walter Segal died. He was an architect who spent his last years trying to apply the principles and techniques seen in the barn-raising to everyday use in Britain. He wanted to help people build their own houses, because it might be both cheaper and more rewarding than buying them from others, and because when people have built something together they are more likely to value it, use it and look after it together. And, as a satisfied self-builder put it, you have the \"indescribable feeling that you finally have control over what you are doing\".</p> <p>Segal, the son of a Romanian painter, grew up near the artists' colony of Monte Verit\u00e0 in Switzerland, a prototype hippie community that practiced nudism and vegetarianism and \"rejected convention in marriage and dress\", as he put it. He was inspired by the colony's idealism, but also \"longed for ordinariness\" and decided early on that he wanted to build. After a lifetime of designing and teaching he devised a method based on timber frames. It used the standard dimensions in which materials come from builders' merchants, to minimise the work required, and employed basic skills. His approach also made houses easy to adapt and rework over time, and gave them a certain spare elegance of structure and proportion.</p> <p>It was an outstandingly good idea, realised most famously with <a href=\"http://www.segalselfbuild.co.uk/projects/waltersway,lewis.html\" title=\"\">groups of houses</a> in the London suburb of Lewisham, on sloping sites too awkward for the local council to develop themselves, which have since grown old gracefully. But it was a good idea at the wrong time. For, since the 80s were also the decade of Margaret Thatcher, the dream of self-build was swamped by the notion of home-as-asset, home-as-investment, and the preservation and increase of property prices at all costs. Unorthodox ideas like Segal's did not flourish.</p> <p>Now two architecture students, Matt Atkins and Ben Barfield Marks, have revived a fragment of the Segal legacy. They have designed an office and playspace for <a href=\"http://oasisplay.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Oasis Children's Venture</a>, a charity that runs a nature garden, a karting track and an adventure playground in Stockwell, south London. It is made out of another building, an office built in the 1980s for Coin Street Community Builders in Waterloo, using the Segal method, which became&#xa0;available at short notice. Barfield Marks is the son of <a href=\"http://www.marksbarfield.com/\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;architects who designed the London Eye</a> and worked tirelessly to get it built, and he seems to have learned something from them about spotting an opportunity to build something unexpected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397497570\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349868766347/coin-street-oasis-childre-010.jpg\" alt=\"coin street oasis children's project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original building being dismantled in Coin Street. Photograph: Ben Barfield Marks & Matt Atkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Barfield Marks &amp; Matt Atkins/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as Segal buildings are easy to put up, they are easy to take down, and the old building was dismantled in two weeks and shipped in a minibus to its new location. Its parts were then rearranged into a new plan, with a generous veranda that wasn't there before, and a raised ceiling in what is now the play and performance space. It was not possible to reuse everything, and things like insulation had to be updated to modern standards, but Atkins and Barfield Marks say that 70 to 80% of the structure is reused.</p> <p>The taking down and putting up again has involved 200 volunteers, with levels of skill ranging from almost nonexistent upwards. The benefits are partly to do with cost and partly environmental, as the new building is made of stuff that would otherwise have gone to landfill. The simple aesthetic of the Segal method, with light playing across the rhythmic structure, is augmented by the effects of ageing and working on the old timbers. There is a sense of time.</p> <p>Most of all the project motivated people to collaborate on making something, which then meant more to them than if it had been handed over by a builder in the usual way. It \"galvanised people\", say the two architecture students, \"it made people want to work on it\". Sponsors from the building industry, the <a href=\"http://www.bauder.co.uk/about-us\" title=\"\">Bauder Group</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.breyergroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Breyer Group</a> and others, were inspired to donate materials; if the chance of remaking the Coin Street building had not come up, Oasis would certainly still be waiting for their new office and play space.</p> <p>There are signs now that self-build is coming back into fashion. Kevin McCloud <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/kevin-mcclouds-man-made-home/4od\" title=\"\">champions it on TV</a>, and it suits the current mood of improvisation and doing much with little. It also suits the nicer end of current Conservative party thinking, and there are mutterings of some self-build being encouraged around the Olympic park.</p> <p>A lot more than muttering will have to happen if self-build is to become more than a niche pursuit on odd scraps of land. Obstacles of planning, land ownership and investment, which discourage it at a large scale, would have to be overcome. A system tilted in favour of the production of standard units by volume house-builders would have to be re-tilted.</p> <p>Perhaps, for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/sep/23/liverpool-biennial-review-hmr-anfield?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the wastelands created in Liverpool</a> and other northern cities by Housing Market Renewal might be dedicated to serious self-build projects. Frankly I'm not holding my breath that anything that could conceivably come under the heading of big society might actually happen. But the Oasis building gives a glimpse of why it's worth hoping for.</p>",
  "<p>If the <em>Observer</em> had sent me to a Conservative party conference 20 years ago, I'd have written that seeing Tories herded together made me realise how much I hated them. A little late in life for my own comfort, I have since learned that every man and woman must cross-examine their prejudices before they can truly grow up. After scrutinising mine, I realised that my taboos against Tories had to go.</p> <p>If you had been in Birmingham, you would have seen that Conservative activists are no different from activists in other parties: admirable and, alas, rare people, prepared to give up private pleasures to try to change their country. As for the politicians, we met a health minister and former obstetrician called Daniel Poulter, who was so obviously committed to the NHS, so clearly concerned about the sick, that only my promise to the <em>Observer</em>'s political editor not to embarrass him in front of his contacts stopped me reaching for his lapels and bellowing: \"What the bloody hell are you doing in the Tory party?\"</p> <p>According to leftist orthodoxy, Tories are sexist and racist. On the sex question, it is true that our upper-class leaders condescend to women as if the second wave of feminism had never reached the shore. Nothing they have done, however, matches the spectacle of the \"socialist\" government of Ecuador and assorted celebrities and conspiracy theorists helping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/julian-assange\" title=\"\">Julian Assange</a> evade charges of sexual molestation and rape. It was hard to be too harsh on Tory sexism last week when others of a leftish perspective have denounced women who allege that they are victims of abuse and the due process of laws against sexual exploitation as a CIA plot.</p> <p>As for racism, you will find figures on the Tory right who go along with prejudices about blacks and Asians. But then there are Labour leftists who go along with radical Islamists and their prejudices against Jews (and women and gays). You choose your politics and you picks your prejudice. Although it is better to resolve when you make your choice to take on the bigotries on your own side with as much determination as you lacerate the failings of your opponents. For as a rule you will find that the great questions of an age create divisions within the left and within the right rather than between the left and the right In every instance, that is, except one.</p> <p>More significant than any party conference speech was the admission last week by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/08/imf-warns-global-crisis-eurozone\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a> that the assumptions about austerity it shared with the British Treasury, the finance ministries of the eurozone and the Romney campaign were hopelessly wrong. The IMF thought that every \u00a31 of cuts or tax rises took 50p off GDP growth. In those circumstances, getting control of the budget deficit quickly seemed a hard but practical task.</p> <p>Only now, after all these years, has the IMF noticed that the great crash of 2007/8 paralysed the banking system. Only now has it grasped that if, say, every country in Europe is cutting spending and raising taxes no country in Europe will be able to expand by increasing its exports to its depressed neighbours. Its long struggle to see the blindingly obvious completed, the IMF decided that, in fact, every \u00a31 in tax rises and spending cuts takes between 90p and \u00a31.70 of GDP. Far from setting us on the road to recovery, austerity has pushed us into stagnation without end.</p> <p>The consequences for Britain have not been as grave as for the eurozone. We do not have the 50% youth unemployment of southern Europe. There is no fascist movement that apes Greece's Golden Dawn by attacking immigrants and proudly displaying a party flag that does not even bother to pretend that it isn't a swastika.</p> <p>For all that, Britain has not escaped the suffering brought by a monumental economic blunder. As our business editor, Heather Stewart, reports, the TUC says that if the coalition had merely taken a modest estimate from the middle of the IMF's range, and assumed that every \u00a31 in tax rises and cuts would take \u00a31.30 from GDP, it would have realised its austerity programme would suck an extra \u00a376bn from the British economy. It did not and delivered recession, an assault on public services and the fastest collapse in living standards since the 1920s.</p> <p>The coalition and the Bank of England never admit their failure. But you could sense the fear that failure brings in Birmingham last week. The press said that the Tory leaders were frightened of Ed Miliband because he made a decent speech at the Labour conference. I suspect the knowledge that history was proving Ed Miliband and Ed Balls right frightened them more. George Osborne did not mention the word \"growth\" once. He and his colleagues said they wanted to help the \"strivers\": the broad mass of working- and middle-class families who are finding the cost of the weekly shop or of filling up the car ever more burdensome.</p> <p>I am sure they were sincere. But because they cannot match their words with actions, they retreated to offering cheap and pointless gestures on crime, the last resort of the despairing politician. The Conservatives in Birmingham were happy to talk to householders who want to kill burglars. But they had nothing to say to the young who cannot afford to pay for a home or to the middle aged and elderly who are finding it harder to afford to heat a home.</p> <p>Beyond the strivers lie the poor. The failure of austerity economics has hit them hardest, although Establishment commentators will not admit it. They praised David Cameron's \"moral\" mission to grind down welfare benefits. They applauded his declaration that he was cutting only because he wanted the unemployed to enjoy the independence and self-respect that work brings. Neither they nor Cameron acknowledged that with six unemployed people for every vacancy, it is disgraceful to cloak the slashing of benefits with windy moralising. The state may force a few into finding work by threatening them with penury. But it cannot compel the majority because there is no growth and hence not enough work to find.</p> <p>Cameron did not come to power wanting to deepen poverty, but that's not the point. His economic failures leave him with no choice. You do not need to believe that Tories are necessarily wicked people to see that their refusal to rectify their mistakes has wicked consequences.</p>",
  "<p>Appropriately enough, this fascinating documentary is the first feature of a British film-maker whose previous work has largely been in casting, because its subject is a New Yorker legendary in the movie business for hanging around the sets of pictures made on location to get free food and be seen on camera. Aged around 60 and&#xa0;from a lower-middle-class Brooklyn family, he's known in the business as \"Radioman\" because of the&#xa0;portable radio he wears round his neck, but his real name is Craig Castaldo (or perhaps Craig Schwartz).</p> <p>A short, bearded, scruffy motormouth, he first became interested in moviemaking when he mistook Bruce Willis, who was playing the boozy writer in <em>The Bonfire of the Vanities</em>, for a fellow drunk living on the streets. From then on he has stalked locations and appeared in over 100 movies, becoming acquainted with dozens of stars and something of a talisman for film people shooting in New York. However, when he makes a trip to Hollywood and puts on a dinner jacket to infiltrate Oscar parties, he's given the cold shoulder in a manner that resembles the rejection of Falstaff at the end of <em>Henry IV, Part 1</em>. A fascinating, rather discomforting film.</p>",
  "<p>The day after she was appointed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/joanna-coles-editor-us-cosmopolitan\" title=\"\">editor-in-chief of US <em>Cosmopolitan</em> </a>last month, the British-born journalist Joanna Coles found herself chairing a town hall event at the Democratic National Convention. The panel discussion on female leadership was attended by some of the most senior women in the party, including Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Senate, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services.</p> <p>Coles was anxious to explore what might happen if the Republican nominee Mitt Romney managed to close the gap on President Barack Obama and whether this might have harmful consequences for the nation at large. But the politicians had other, more pressing, issues at the forefront of their minds.</p> <p>\"They said, 'Never mind the election, what's going to happen to <em>Cosmo</em>?'\" Coles recalls drily.</p> <p>The first three weeks of her new job have passed in \"an extraordinary blur. I can't remember a single moment\". She has been inundated with congratulations, including a letter from her fellow Yorkshirewoman, the author Barbara Taylor Bradford, who also lives in New York. The two of them are due to have lunch soon.</p> <p>\"It's absolutely astonishing,\" says Coles. \"<em>Cosmopolitan</em> is just this huge, iconic brand in America.\"</p> <p>She is talking over the phone from her office on the 42nd floor of the Hearst Magazines headquarters and overlooking a swath of midtown Manhattan. I imagine her on the other end of the line, a bit like Melanie Griffiths in the final scene of <em>Working Girl</em>: the gutsy blonde who has finally made it big.</p> <p>If she is nervous about taking on a publishing industry behemoth, she shows no sign of it. Born and raised in West Yorkshire, the 50-year-old Coles has been a New York resident since 1997, working first as US correspondent for the <em>Guardian</em> and then the <em>Times</em>, before making the switch to magazines just after the birth of her second child with her husband, the author and screenwriter Peter Godwin.</p> <p>\"It became clear to me at that point that it was difficult to do a job where I couldn't predict my schedule,\" she says of her decision to leave newspapers. \"I remember missing my older son's first birthday party because two professors at Dartmouth had been brutally murdered and I was sent to cover the story. My husband had been away in Africa and he came back the morning I was leaving and we literally passed in the lobby\u2026 I remember thinking, 'This isn't good.'\"</p> <p>It was a canny move. Coles went on to work for <em>New York Magazine</em>, then became executive editor of <em>More</em> in 2004 and editor-in-chief of <em>Marie Claire</em> in 2006, staying there for six years. Legend has it that Coles was so determined to get the top job at <em>Marie Claire</em> that she ambushed the chief executive of the publishing house by clambering into his taxi and pitching for the editorship en route to the airport. The gamble paid off: in 2011, under her tenure, advertising revenues at <em>Marie Claire</em> leapt by 31%.</p> <p><em>Cosmopolitan</em> is in similarly rude health: its US circulation has risen steadily over the last four years and peaked in the first half of 2012 at more than 3 million. There are 64 international editions, including Slovenia, Ecuador and China, and it attracts 8.5 million unique visitors to its website each&#xa0;month.</p> <p>But is a magazine that carries features on \"How to please your man in bed\" and promotes a daily \"sex position\" through an online app still relevant? In 1965, when the pioneering Helen Gurley Brown was appointed editor, her insistence on including frank discussions on sex within the pages of the magazine was considered a move towards greater female liberation. In 2012, however, when a generation of young women are latching on to a new feminist consciousness typified by the anarchic spirit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/08/lena-dunham-girls-book-deal-new-yorker-festival-talk?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+(Media)\" title=\"\">Lena Dunham's acclaimed HBO comedy series <em>Girls</em></a>, does <em>Cosmo</em>'s approach seem wilfully&#xa0;outdated?</p> <p>\"No,\" says Coles. \"I think the size of it is testament to its relevance. It's the biggest women's magazine in the world.</p> <p>\"What magazines do is curate: we give accurate and trustworthy information. If you have a problem, it's very difficult to go to the web and get accurate information\u2026 magazines at their best should be an incredible voyage of discovery.\"</p> <p>Does she feel at ease talking about sex?</p> <p>\"Yes, I do actually. I think it's an important part of our lives. I feel some regret at the pornification of culture. I think that does us a disfavour because people forget that, actually, sex is this great connecting tool between men and women.\"</p> <p>She does, however, intend to broaden <em>Cosmo</em>'s focus and incorporate more stories about women in the workplace, political issues and religious discussion.</p> <p>\"It's important that women voters understand there's something at stake in this election and that the Republican party has very different views on access to abortion and contraception,\" she says. \"If they repeal Obamacare, these women will lose their first chance to have free contraception. Over here, you have to get your prescription for contraception renewed every month\u2026 it's such a hassle. It's a real anxiety for women: have they run out? Can they get to Duane Reade [a US pharmacy chain] in time? Are they going to let it slip? It's physically harder to get contraception, which is something that, as a European coming to America, I found astonishing.\"</p> <p>Coles is part of a phalanx of British women now at the helm of some of America's most influential glossies: Glenda Bailey, the editor-in-chief of <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>, comes from Derbyshire and <em>Vogue</em>'s Anna Wintour was born in London and is the daughter of a former editor of the <em>Evening Standard</em>. What is it about British female editors that makes them so successful across the Atlantic?</p> <p>\"I think people seize on it because it's something we have in common,\" says Coles.</p> <p>The comparisons end there. Whereas Wintour has earned a reputation for terrifying aloofness (and was rumoured to be the inspiration for Meryl Streep's hard-bitten magazine editor in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>), Coles is known for her down-to-earth approachability and sense of humour. While at <em>Marie Claire</em>, she produced <a href=\"http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/running-in-heels-2009\" title=\"\"><em>Running in Heels</em></a>, a reality TV show about interns at the magazine. It was syndicated to 16 countries and portrayed Coles as an astute and encouraging mentor.</p> <p>\"I like being a boss. It's fun working with smart, young women. They're so much more together than I was at that age. Thank God!\"</p> <p>She is being disingenuous. Coles was together enough to have had her first article published at the age of 10 in the children's section of the Y<em>orkshire Post</em> for the princely fee of \u00a32. She says she always knew she wanted to be a journalist and graduated from the University of East Anglia with a degree in English and American literature before starting her career with a job at the <em>Spectator</em>.</p> <p>What do her parents \u2013 her mother was a medical social worker and her father a teacher \u2013 make of her job? \"I think they're relieved that I'm not calling them for money,\" she says, half-joking. She makes a point of going back to Yorkshire regularly and recently went there on a family holiday, incorporating a trip to the National Coal Mining Museum in Wakefield: \"So my children went down the mines.\" A pause. Then, deadpan: \"Which was good.\"</p> <p>Is there anything she misses about Yorkshire? \"I miss the sort of grit of the people. They have this fantastic 'Keep Calm and Carry on' attitude.\"</p> <p>Indeed, in an industry that, to the untrained eye, can appear synonymous with superficiality and bitchiness, Coles values the art of saying what you mean. \"I'd much rather know if you have to go to a pre-school meeting or an open day or get your kids vaccinated than for someone to feel they have to make something up,\" she says. \"I remember once when I was working on a magazine and one of the male editors was going on a field trip with one of his sons. The office was full of 'He's such a good dad' whereas I came in late from a doctor's appointment for one of my children and was asked, 'Where were you? You'll need to make up the time.' There's still a double standard.\"</p> <p>She disagrees with the premise of Hanna Rosin's recently published polemic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-end-men-extract\" title=\"\"><em>The End of Men</em></a>, that women are adapting better to the significant shifts in economy and culture and outstripping their male counterparts at home and at work. \"What's interesting about her thesis is that it's not backed up financially and not backed up by the number of women in government or senior women in business. There's a feeling that offices are becoming more feminised, the culture is becoming more feminised and there's a 62% female intake in college in the US, but it's not actually backed up in terms of money or power yet. Right now, there's a lot of noise in the culture about women on the rise but it hasn't actually been borne out financially [in terms of equal pay] or real leadership.\"</p> <p>Coles describes herself as a feminist and genuinely seems to like other women and to want them to do well. But at the same time she expects the best from them (a couple of times she asks me to clarify what I mean by a certain question in the laser-sharp manner of an intimidating university professor).</p> <p>\"What is important for women is they can want it all but they don't have to have it all at the same time,\" she says, describing the ideal <em>Cosmo</em> reader as \"a young female striver, probably coming out of college, saddled with debts and loans but who has high ambitions for herself and is thinking, 'How am I going to do this?'\"</p> <p>Her conversation is peppered with enthusiastic references to female teenage celebrities. A mild inquiry about her ideal cover star prompts a gushing monologue on the myriad virtues of the Olsen twins (\"old souls\"), Miley Cyrus (\"phenomenally smart and fun\") and Taylor Swift (\"who, at 14, made her parents move to Nashville!\").</p> <p>\"I'm fascinated by these young women who are so smart, business-wise and who have an understanding of their brand and the need to protect it and who have control over it. You talk to women now and they say their absolute idol is Natalie Massenet [the founder of Net-A-Porter], who sold her business and made a lot of money, or Sheryl Sandberg [the chief operating officer of Facebook], who is managing to infiltrate the culture of young working women. There weren't really any women like that when I was coming in. I had Margaret Thatcher, who might have been iconic for all sorts of reasons, but now there are lots of different role models.\"</p> <p>This is all very well, but I'm aware there is one pressing question I haven't yet asked. As the editor of a magazine that prides itself on its sexual adventurousness, I wonder whether Coles has a favourite \"sex position of the day\"? She laughs.</p> <p>\"Well I've only been here three weeks,\" she replies. \"I'm starting right at the beginning.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The feminist writer and political activist Naomi Wolf, 49, is the author of <em>The Beauty Myth</em>. She recently published </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/society/9781844086887/vagina-a-cultural-history-a-new-biography\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Vagina: A New Biography</em></strong></a></p> <p>When Obama was elected I was hopeful and fearful at the same time. I was excited about his inaugural promise to close Guant\u00e1namo and I believed that he meant it. The suppression of civil liberties is more critical than any other issue we have right now in America, and I would say globally as well. I was hopeful but I knew that the vested interests that benefit from terror theatre and endless war are so powerful that no single president is powerful enough to completely resist that pressure.</p> <p>So you know where I'm going here: I'm awfully disappointed. In terms of civil liberties his record has been shockingly, alarmingly disappointing. He has carried on the policies initiated by Bush's justice department of suppressing information under the guise of state secrets. I've been witnessing his personal appeal to pass the National Defence Authorisation Act, an unspeakable legislation that would give him the power to detain any US citizen indefinitely without charge or trial. He's covered up efforts to investigate torture. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guantanamo-bay\" title=\"\">Guant\u00e1namo</a> still has almost 170 men in it who have never been charged or tried, and there's no hope of getting them out anytime soon.</p> <p>It's hard to know how much power any American president has at this point in time. We're much more like many Latin-American \"democracies\" in which there is a nominal head of state who cannot really take on the military-industrial complex. But he could certainly have tried harder than he has.</p> <p>Has there been anything positive about his presidency? The symbolic value of having an African-American president has certainly eased some racial tensions in America but they're not gone. We drew down some of our presence in Iraq and we're minimally drawing down some of our presence in Afghanistan but at the same time we're enshrining abuses in prison systems there that aren't going away. Has he passed important environmental legislation? I'm not aware of it. Has he bucked up the failing public schools? Not substantially. His big \"achievement\" is Obamacare, but I'm not at all sure that it isn't actually a gift for the insurance industry.</p> <p>Has he changed the way Americans are perceived abroad? Yes, but not in a good way. He raised hope throughout the Middle East that he'd have a more international perspective and a more even-handed approach to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but if you go to Egypt now people feel incredibly betrayed. He's perceived as locking up Muslims against process and not punishing people who abuse Muslim prisoners. America used to stand for something in the world \u2013 we set a benchmark on human rights. Now we can't even challenge China for locking up Ai&#xa0;Weiwei, because we showed the world how to lock people up without charge or trial. If I could ask Obama one question, I'd ask him this: how do you sleep at night?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tour\u00e9, 41, is an American novelist, essayist, music journalist, cultural critic and television presenter based in New York </strong></p> <p>I became a Democrat when I was a child, hearing stories of John F Kennedy, who was heroic, inspiring and critical in pushing forward civil rights legislation. I had not then heard Dr King's great sentence, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\", but I felt that to be true, that history had to be moving toward doing the right thing, and I felt that Democrats would lead us there. I was born almost a decade after Kennedy was assassinated.The years after his death were spent waiting for another JFK, a new, charismatic justice spreader who would make Democrats proud. It was a long wait. Between 1969 and 1993, a Democrat was president for just four years, Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, and he was not a new JFK. Clinton showed us his charisma and his heart but it wasn't until the emergence of Barack Obama that it was certain that a new Camelot was in place. Here was an inspiring man whose candidacy had a historic underpinning.</p> <p>Where Kennedy had to overcome a bias against Catholics, Obama had to break the racial glass ceiling without talking about race too much. Obama's victory helped push the arc of the moral universe along its way toward justice, sounding a powerful note in America's centuries-long turbulent blues song about race. It was not the arrival at Dr King's mountaintop but it was extraordinarily important for the soul of the nation. And while it did not end racism \u2013 no serious thinker expected that \u2013 it did change the soul of America. To see a brilliant black alpha male be embraced as leader at a very difficult time of frightening recession and seemingly endless war made many black Americans feel fully at home for the first time and made many others reconsider what it means to be&#xa0;black. That Obama's mother is white adds another twist to the story and makes him the embodiment of modern America's multiracial society and a man with the twoness that WEB Du Bois spoke of, the double consciousness, almost in his blood.</p> <p>But if the story of Obama as justice spreader was limited to identity issues and the challenge of branding and marketing a black man to a nation that still has racist impulses, well, that would be a rather sad story, which this is not. Obama has continued spreading justice for all sorts of people. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter act, which protects women against discrimination in pay, and nominated two pro-choice women to the Supreme Court, which had had only two female justices in its history. He extended justice to gay Americans by passing a hate crimes law that makes gay-bashing a federal crime and repealed \"don't ask, don't tell\" in the military. He refused to enforce the Defense of Marriage act and announced his support for gay marriage. Obama also issued a directive that changed immigration enforcement, allowing people brought here as children a reprieve from deportation and a path to becoming part of the American family, a huge victory for Hispanics.</p> <p>It's those social, cultural and political victories that extend liberty and justice to blacks, women, gay people and Hispanics that confirm my certainty that the arc of the moral universe is bending toward justice and we have a president who's helping guide it there.</p>",
  "<p>Tommy Cooper's comedy centred on perfecting his inept conjuring show. Les Dawson attempted the same trick with a piano, and now our nation's economists are freshening up the concept with a very respectable stab at spoofing a clairvoyant act.</p> <p>If this happens to be your type of comedy, prepare for a delicious treat this week, when the dismal scientists' equivalent of the Perrier Awards comes to town. First up will be that famed double act Ernst &amp; Young, who perform at a venue called the Item Club.</p> <p>There has hardly been a dry seat in the house there since the start of the financial crisis with the act's hilarious predictions of a return to health for the British economy, including this cracker from early 2011, when the pair reckoned that UK GDP growth would be \"just\" 2.3% last year (and 2.8% in 2012).</p> <p>There are plenty more like that, but if you haven't been stretchered off at the Item, perhaps you might also enjoy taking in Tuesday's Office for Budget Responsibility gig. The body will be running over some of its favourite gaffes from the past year with the publication of its \"annual forecast evaluation report\" \u2013 and it's even got a decent gag about that. \"[The report] helps us improve our future forecast judgments and techniques,\" it deadpans. Pure gold.</p> <h2>Star turn at the committee<br></h2> <p>There's an argument that if the parliamentary commission on banking standards could only call one witness, it would call Paul Volcker, the towering (in every way) former chairman of the US Federal Reserve.</p> <p>The 6ft 7in-tall 85-year-old sage came up with that corker of a line about the one useful innovation devised by the financial sector in the past 30 years (the cash machine). Such nuggets will juice up his appearance on Wednesday in front of the Andrew Tyrie-chaired enquiry, called to scrutinise the banks after Barclays was fined for manipulating interest rates.</p> <p>We already know what Volcker thinks about most investment banks (jumped up bookies who shouldn't be allowed to punt government-guaranteed savings on their own account) as well as the UK's preferred solution to the financial crisis of ringfencing casino banking operations (it doesn't work, he says).</p> <p>Even so, most of the City will be eager to hear if he's been working on any more pithy one-liners to share with Tyrie, although it's debatable whether the banking lobby itself will be listening: it is hosting its annual conference at the same time.</p> <h2>Scoring points at News Corp <br></h2> <p>In April 2010, just before the last general election, News International's James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks famously stormed the offices of the <em>Independent</em>. Their mission was to complain about an advertisement campaign being run by the newspaper that read: \"Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election \u2013 you will\". This week, independent shareholders in the Murdoch-controlled News Corporation might muse that they should be so lucky.</p> <p>The media group is holding its annual meeting on Tuesday, which is a largely academic affair as the Murdochs control about 40% of the votes. Even so, shareholders can still have plenty of fun with these people and there are a number of resolutions introduced by disobedient owners determined to irk the ruling family.</p> <p>Christian Brothers Investment Services (owner of 517 shares) is fronting a campaign backed by British investor Hermes and US shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis, which proposes News Corp's chairman should be an independent director (ie, not Rupert). The board's response to that is to \"unanimously recommend\" shareholders vote against the plan, while giving identical advice in response to other similar resolutions.</p> <p>That's a victory, of sorts. Point proven.</p>",
  "<p>Karl Benz's patent for the first automobile came in 1886. The first film was projected in 1895. Very soon thereafter came the first movie car chase, and Hollywood has never looked back, except in the rear-view mirror or to fire a Tommy gun at a pursuer. The comedy thriller <em>Hit &amp; Run</em>, scripted and directed by Dax Shepard, is pretty well an extended chase in which Shepard himself plays a good-natured former getaway driver who breaks the condition of his status as a beneficiary of the witness protection scheme to drive his academic girlfriend to be interviewed for a professorship of&#xa0;nonviolent conflict resolution. Chasing him 500 miles to Los Angeles are his assigned federal marshal, his girl's jealous ex-boyfriend, the accomplice he informed on (and who got raped in jail), and a gay sheriff. It's highly entertaining with cameos by several of the director's pals and pit stops for delivering sub-Tarantino dialogue.</p>",
  "<p>Droughts, storms, floods \u2013 after this year's washout of a summer, it is hardly a surprise that farmers are warning of rising food prices on supermarket shelves.</p> <p>The price of wheat is<strong> </strong>16<strong>%</strong> higher than this time last year; corn costs are up 7<strong>%</strong>; and there is an increasingly fierce battle about how to make the best use of agricultural land.</p> <p>But don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple tale of supply and demand \u2013 crops keeling over in the baking midwest sunshine and hungry mouths to feed thousands of miles away. The world market for food includes not just farmers and shoppers, but hundreds of millions of dollars of complex financial bets.</p> <p>Wall Street's geniuses are forever looking for new products to package and sell. Over the past decade, helped by a convincing pitch about hungry Chinese factory workers and harvests ravaged by climate change, they have persuaded investors, including ordinary pension funds, to plough billions of dollars into commodities, including food.</p> <p>The Institute of International Finance has estimated that by the middle of last year, $450bn of financial assets was invested in commodities \u2013 or derivatives, betting on future price movements.</p> <p>In principle, there would be nothing wrong with financiers moving into the food market if it directed billions of dollars of investment towards expanding production, bringing new land into cultivation and developing new technologies to boost yields.</p> <p>But \u2013 as the thoroughly mad market for mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the credit crisis, and the resulting building boom across the US, illustrated very clearly \u2013 the price signals emerging from the stampeding herds of Wall street can be deeply misleading.</p> <p>In a recent paper, provocatively titled <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/presspb2012d1_en.pdf\" title=\"\">\"Don't Blame the Physical Markets,\"</a> the UN's trade and development arm, Unctad, argued that the wall of money flooding into commodities has badly distorted the price signals a well-functioning market should send to producers and consumers.</p> <p>\"It is not commonly recognised that demand from financial investors in the commodity markets has become overwhelming during the last decade,\" Unctad says.</p> <p>It uses a striking pair of charts to show that over the past 10 years, the prices of food, and of commodities more generally, have moved closely into synch with other financial assets, such as stocks and shares.</p> <p>In 2002, west Texas oil prices, and an index of other commodities, shifted up and down largely independently of European equities \u2013 due to fluctuating supply and demand in those markets. But by the early part of this year, the three indices were moving in lockstep; and responding dramatically to each twist and turn of the ongoing eurozone crisis. \"Eurozone events and market sentiment determine commodity prices, regardless of trade logistics issues, war, drought and other ongoing supply shocks,\" Unctad says.</p> <p>In other words, the financialisation of the market for basic foodstuffs has led to prices drifting far away from the fundamentals of supply and demand, as investors treat betting on the future price of food as just another asset for their portfolio, bringing uncertainty and volatility, and masking the true balance between supply and demand.</p> <p>When the sub-prime bubble burst, it wrecked the livelihoods of millions of Americans who had battled hard to afford their own home. But in this case, it is the very lives of poor consumers that are at stake, as the price of food zig-zags about because of all-but-irrelevant events in Brussels or Berlin.</p> <p>Unctad urges the world's regulators to take a series of measures to check speculation. One of the steps it recommends, a financial transaction tax, now looks almost certain to be adopted by a coalition of at least 11 willing European countries, though it seems most likely that trading will simply shift to other jurisdictions \u2013 including the UK.</p> <p>Any tougher crackdown \u2013 forcing greater transparency about who is betting on what, with whom, for example \u2013 looks highly likely to be scuppered by the same kind of concerted lobbying that sank proposals for regulating other derivatives markets in the years before the crisis.</p> <p>In the US, for example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is facing a legal battle over its attempts to impose \"position limits\", constraining the share of the market single investors can hold in a number of commodities, including corn and cocoa. The proposal was <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/be191d8e-09a8-11e2-a424-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28nUufvsk\" title=\"\">struck down by a court in Washington</a>, in a case brought by several financial sector trade bodies \u2013 though the CFTC has not given up on introducing position limits in some form.</p> <p>As the world struggles to adapt to a changing climate, and a rapidly expanding population with shifting nutritional needs, it is as important as it has ever been to ensure that farmers, policymakers and consumers are receiving the right signals about supply and demand.</p> <p>But as we should now have learned repeatedly, allowing the financiers to pile in en masse brings not the hard-nosed judgement of the market, but uncertainty, chaos and confusion.</p>",
  "<p>He shakes as he speaks and at moments his eyes fill. \"It's certain that the people who killed my colleague were criminals,\" he says. \"The killing had the modus operandi of organised crime. But who sent them and why? That's the question, that's the smokescreen.\"</p> <p>This is a colleague of V\u00edctor Manuel B\u00e1ez Chino, whose mutilated body was found in June in the main square of Xalapa, capital of the Mexican coastal state of Veracruz. B\u00e1ez was the state's crime editor for an online edition of the national newspaper <em>Milenio</em> and editor of the Police Report website (currently down) which covered crime.</p> <p>In August, state prosecutors declared the case closed. Witnesses, they said, had identified the bodies of two men killed in a shootout as the same people who had kidnapped the reporter. B\u00e1ez's circles were \"entirely unconvinced\", says his colleague.</p> <p>B\u00e1ez is one of 56 journalists killed during Mexico's drug war since 2006 (a figure calculated by the New York-based <a href=\"http://cpj.org/\" title=\"\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>). The war reached a climax last week with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/zetas-leader-heriberto-lazcano-killed\" title=\"\">killing by Mexican marines</a> of the leader of the wildest \u2013 albeit not the biggest \u2013 narco cartel: the paramilitary Zetas, which counts Veracruz, with its strategically crucial gulf port, among its strongholds.</p> <p>After a spate of further killings this year, Veracruz became the focus for this war against the press: six reporters were killed in Mexico within a month leading to mid-May, three of them in Veracruz.</p> <p>This is no sideshow in a wider war involving the drugs cartels, argues the committee's representative in Mexico,&#xa0;Mike O'Connor. He insists that&#xa0;\"the silencing of the press and killing of journalists is integral to the reality, the big story, of what is happening here: that the cartels are taking territory\".</p> <p>Furthermore, he says: \"The inability of the government to really solve hardly any of the crimes against journalists during the four years I've been here is a metaphor for its inability to solve crimes against common citizens. They simply cannot do it. And you wonder: if they can't solve these crimes, why not? Is it because they don't want to?\"</p> <p>Of course, the threats and killings proliferate beyond Veracruz, across Mexico. In the border town of Nuevo Laredo, Ram\u00f3n Cant\u00fa, publisher of the local <em>El Ma\u00f1ana</em>, said, after his paper's offices were attacked by the Zetas: \"We are censoring the paper because we have to get our children to school.\" In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, my friend Sandra Rodr\u00edguez is among the reporters who work on bravely, despite the killing of two colleagues, \"because we have to carry on with this task, to expose what is going on\".</p> <p>Among those brutally killed in Veracruz was Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz, whose decapitated, tortured body was found in July last year, dumped near the offices of her newspaper, <em>Imagen</em>, two days after she was seized by armed men as she left home.</p> <p>State prosecutor Reynaldo Escobar P\u00e9rez insisted the killing was not linked to her work and state governor Javier Duarte de Ochea said authorities were pursuing \"multiple lines of investigation\". Another was Miguel Angel L\u00f3pez Velasco, columnist for the daily <em>Notiver</em>, who was killed along with his wife and son the previous month.</p> <p>Apart from the barbarism of his killing, V\u00edctor B\u00e1ez's death bore another hallmark of a narco execution: a note pinned to his torso, this one reading: \"Here's what happens to traitors and people who act clever. Sincerely, the Zetas.\" But B\u00e1ez's colleague says that he learned from the marines \"that the note was not there when the body was discovered by a neighbour who found V\u00edctor's door open \u2013 it was put there later\u2026 by someone, for some reason\". All of which compounds the strangeness of B\u00e1ez's death, the explanation for which anguishes his colleague, as we sit in a cafe, shielded by the sound of the grinding of fresh coffee grown in the hills beyond the city.</p> <p>\"He had no connection to the cartels. V\u00edctor knew how to stay independent. I was one of the last people to see him \u2013 he seemed tranquil, he had nothing to do with the government or the narcos.\" But B\u00e1ez did know some background to the most infamous murder of a reporter in Veracruz: that on 28 April this year of Regina Mart\u00ednez, a friend of his.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez was Veracruz state correspondent for <em>Proceso</em> magazine, by repute one of Mexico's most prestigious. She was found dead in her lavatory, beaten and strangled to death.</p> <p>\"Others have died in worse ways than Regina,\" said a friend and one-time source of Mart\u00ednez in Xalapa last week. \"In some ways, I'm amazed she wasn't killed before. She was working for some time on dirty police\" \u2013 and her voice trails off. \"Regina was a good friend of mine and one of the few who dared to write about what is happening here.\"</p> <p>There has been public outrage in Veracruz over Mart\u00ednez's murder, as there has been across Mexico at the others. Mart\u00ednez's killing provoked street demonstrations demanding that the perpetrators and those who gave them orders be brought to justice. On Saturday in Xalapa, an assembly was hosted by a new student movement in Mexico, I Am 132, with local reporters, to discuss common cause and strategies for mutual protection.</p> <p>I Am 132 is so called after 131 students appeared on YouTube to give their names and ID numbers and deny allegations that they had been paid to disrupt a meeting addressed by the incoming Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The skirmish had been over development of land for an airport, but the movement expanded into narco war, free speech and assaults on the press.</p> <p>\"At first, we thought the reporters were part of the problem,\" says the movement's humblingly brave young spokesman in Veracruz. \"Then we saw the big picture, and how it must be for them, and the idea this weekend is for an assembly that can work towards a safety network of some kind.\"</p> <p>Into all this, last week, the Mexican branch of the Hay-on-Wye literary festival arrived \u2013 Hay Xalapa \u2013 guest of the state government. Hay had been criticised from some quarters for accepting the hospitality, but rode it to stage an event of intellectual effervescence and allow the opening of an international window to Xalapa's journalists. Representatives of the freedom of expression group PEN arrived to make preparations for a campaign over the murder of reporters in Mexico, to be launched on the next Day of the Dead, on 2&#xa0;November.</p> <p>The president of PEN America, Peter Godwin, found himself present at an unexpected photo opportunity between state governor Duarte and Nigerian poet and playwright Wole Soyinka. Godwin petitioned the governor \"to express\", he said afterwards, \"PEN's grave concerns about the killings of journalists in Veracruz in particular and the climate of impunity in Mexico generally. I concluded my questioning of the governor by saying that I hoped that there would be no more journalists killed in Veracruz province between this Hay and the next.\"</p> <p>(To complete the surreality of the occasion, <em>Proceso</em> magazine posted on its website a detailed account of a supposed meeting in the Crowne Plaza hotel in Xalapa, at which Duarte supposedly \"exploded\" with recrimination at Godwin, esteemed American writer John Lee Anderson and me for speaking badly of Veracruz. The story was a fabrication \u2013 denied by the governor's office and all three of us. )</p> <p>It happens that the Committee to Protect Journalists is represented in Mexico by one of America's most experienced and renowned reporters. Mike O'Connor is a veteran of the \"dirty wars\" in Central America during the 1980s for CBS television and of other conflicts thereafter for the <em>New York Times</em>. For nearly four years now, he has documented and investigated the intimidation and murder of Mexican reporters and toured the country consulting those under threat. He is uniquely qualified to explain how the war against the press speaks to Mexico's carnage.</p> <p>\"The government and authorities are ceding territory to the cartels and, for the cartels to take territory, three things have to happen,\" says O'Connor. \"One is to control the institutions with guns \u2013 basically, the police. The second is to control political power. And, for the first two to be effective, you have to control the press.</p> <p>\"Every journalist I've spoken to says that the corruption of forces is such that the cartels control the politicians.&#xa0;That does not say that the cartels get money from this \u2013 there are rewards for the politicians and there's a very strong disincentive not to&#xa0;co-operate. I'm not quite sure what&#xa0;the word is to describe the relationship, but ultimately the capo is in charge.\"</p> <p>However: \"When I\u2026 say to a roomful of journalists, 'Ask the question, <em>Quien manda aqu\u00ed?</em> (Who's in charge?'), they take a virtual step backwards, wide-eyed. That's the question you ask yourself at night when you're drunk and your wife is asleep and you hope no one hears you.\"</p> <p>O'Connor argues: \"You can't have a democracy without an informed public\u2026 Mexico has all the structures of a democracy, but it does not have an informed public. It has a public which knows the starting lineup of the Green Bay Packers, but doesn't know who runs the city or the state they live in. It does not know who is in charge. People know it's corrupt, but they don't know what's going on, because the reporters cannot ask: 'Who's in charge?' You cannot find in your newspaper, in most parts of the country, information about the big story \u2013 and the big story is that organised crime has taken over, or is working very successfully at taking over, your city, town or village.</p> <p>\"And if you report that, you get killed. Mostly, you don't think about reporting that.\"</p> <p>O'Connor summarises government officials as insisting that all Mexican journalists are corrupt and the victims are working for the cartels \u2013 \"as if they could possibly know\". Working on the ground, he says: \"Look, I don't have the FBI crime lab behind me \u2013 I do the investigations I can within the&#xa0;environment I have. And I know that at some times and in some places, a reporter might get approached by someone with a pistol, and told to write&#xa0;this but not that, and there may be some money in it. And if you don't, we know where you and your family&#xa0;live.</p> <p>\"Is that working for the cartel? Federal officials use that context to make out that the dead are working for the cartels. I know reporters who get asked by the police chief, 'Why are you so curious?' That's a threat.\"</p> <p>However, he says, \"the people I know in Xalapa say that Regina Mart\u00ednez was looking into the political and economic elite. That is what she wrote about\". Then O'Connor qualifies the judgment, only slightly, with a favourite dictum of his, that \"Mexico is a country where you do not need facts to arrive at a conclusion. People will hold on to a belief without being able to give it a factual basis. But that does not mean it is not true.\"</p> <p>The atrocious news arrived just as the Hay festival left Xalapa: that while it was in town, another reporter from a journalistic family, and his daughter, had been killed \u2013 both decapitated. Roberto Rizzo Murrieta who worked for the <em>Mundo de C\u00f3rdoba</em> paper, was murdered at home with his child, Mar\u00eda Antonia. The state prosecutor said again that \"multiple lines of investigation\" had been opened and a domestic employee was under suspicion.</p>",
  "<p>Wayne Rooney claims he has grown up and matured, and Roy Hodgson is prepared to believe him. The England manager was delighted with the way Rooney led the side against San Marino at Wembley, and though Steven Gerrard will be back as captain for the game in Poland on Tuesday the Manchester United striker can now regard himself as his deputy.</p> <p>\"Wayne was my vice-captain during the Euros, that was always clear, at least it was from the moment he started playing again,\" Hodgson said. \"I know Frank Lampard is coming back into contention and he has captained the team but I always had it in my mind that Wayne would be the player I'd turn to if Steven Gerrard was unavailable.</p> <p>\"It's something he's very proud of, something he really wants to do, he does take playing for England unbelievably seriously and the good thing for us is that we are now seeing the best of Wayne Rooney. In earlier games since I took over, for various reasons, maybe he wasn't at his best. I've got to hope now that he stays at this level, stays fit and healthy, and continues to do what he's doing for Manchester United and England.\"</p> <p>There is no official position of vice-captain, though Hodgson feels England need a player of experience and proven ability to turn to when necessary, a player respected by the rest of the team who is confident of keeping his place in the side. \"My idea of a vice-captain is the best person for the job when the captain cannot be there,\" Hodgson said, perhaps mindful of the fact that Gerrard misses his share of games through injury as well as suspension. \"Wayne is always going to be a contender for that.\"</p> <p>It is exactly a year since Rooney needlessly earned a suspension that almost put him out of the European Championship by earning dismissal for kicking out at an opponent in Montenegro, yet the player now says he has grown up and calmed down, and is more in control of his temper. Hodgson is not about to suggest otherwise. \"If you are asking about maturity you are asking me to take on board previous games and situations, things that happened before I became England manager,\" he said diplomatically. \"I don't like to talk about Rooney and England before I became involved in May. I'm not naive, I am aware that various things have happened over the years, but I don't want to dwell too much on that. I only want to judge him on what I have seen since I began working with him.</p> <p>\"When he first came back, during the Euros, he was not as sharp as he is now, and I think Wayne himself would be the first to admit it. All the time I have been with him since, in terms of his commitment and his desire, his wanting to do the job, he's the same reliable player every time. So I will continue to judge our relationship since May, there's no need for me to be looking back over four or five years before I arrived.\"</p> <p>Friday's victory over the lowest-ranked side in European football meant Hodgson now has 10 England games under his belt, and has still to suffer a defeat in normal time. \"Results so far have been satisfying,\" he said. \"I don't really make constant appraisals of how I'm doing, there are plenty of other people doing that. I just try and get on with the job and make sure the players are prepared for the games. I will be making a few changes for Poland, we have several players to come back into the side.\"</p> <p><strong> </strong>Poland away represents a much tougher challenge than San Marino, and a good result could leave England in charge of the group following Friday's other results, though after 10 games Hodgson knows that every game brings its own pressures. \"At this level of football I'd like to see a non-pressure game,\" he said. \"Even against San Marino there were 85,000 people there [at Wembley] to see us play, all wanting to be entertained, all wanting to see some good football. I think we managed that, at least we didn't just win and have people shaking their heads saying they didn't enjoy that game at all. I thought we were good value, entertainment wise.</p> <p>\"Five goals is plenty in my book. We were still playing the same way at the end as we were at the beginning and I thought that was encouraging. I should think one or two of those San Marino fellows won't be doing too much walking around for the next couple of days. They will be lying on a bed somewhere.\"</p> <p>Though resigned to the fact that the visitors would only attempt to stifle England and stay in their own half most of the time to defend, Hodgson saw plenty of positives. \"Those types of game can become real damp squibs, without much football to talk about, but we produced some good passing and movement and lots of skilful moves for the crowd to enjoy,\" he said. \"Five goals was scant reward for the amount of pressure we had and the chances we created, but that is what San Marino are all about. We should give them a little credit because several of the blocks and last-ditch tackles they made were really fantastic efforts.</p> <p>\"At least half of the England team against San Marino could have played for the Under-21s, especially when Jonjo Shelvey came on, and I think that is encouraging. I am also encouraged when I watch Arsenal and see their two Arsenal full-backs are doing extremely well, [Jack] Wilshere is back playing some football now and I hear Chris Smalling is back in training, so at the moment I see no reason not to be optimistic about the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>Friday night's \"home international\" at the City of Cardiff Stadium stirred those of a certain generation to recall the shock and sadness which shrouded a previous World Cup qualifier in the city between Wales and Scotland at splintery old Ninian Park 27 years earlier when the Scotland manager and mightiest of tartan touchline totems, Jock Stein, collapsed and died at the end of the game.</p> <p>England's World Cup qualifier against Poland on Tuesday evokes far less ghastly and disturbing reminiscence in the so-long-lumbered faithful follower of football and the remembrance of the two qualifying ties of 1973 provides a warning for Roy Hodgson's England.</p> <p>Truth is that Sir Alf Ramsey's men 39 years ago were eliminated not so much through the fabled goalkeeping gymnastics of Poland's apparent \"clown\" Jan Tomaszewski in the second leg at Wembley on 17 October but in England's earlier defeat in Katowice when two goals were given away by England's now suddenly rickety <em>preux chevalier</em> Bobby Moore. It was seven years after their 1966 World Cup victory.</p> <p>Almost 40 years on, the three other \"home\" nations have long settled, in truth, to being permanent qualifying cannon fodder, but if England fail to qualify this time will they ever make the final stages again? Any World Cup future has to be with Team GB.</p> <p>Nor would a single Rest of Britain squad be obviously overweighted with Englishmen. After Friday's match in Cardiff I was diverted with some doolally daydream doodles which helped down a few amiable late-night slurps. Well, oldie-style formations and semi-colons in place, of course, wouldn't this all-time England team of mine \u2013 Shilton; Armfield, Cole; Bryan Robson, Moore, Edwards; Matthews, Greaves, Shearer, Charlton, Finney \u2013 probably be well beaten (sure, eight times out of 10, I hear you brag up there) by this bunch of immortals from the north \u2013 Cowan; Gough, McGrain; Bremner, McNeill, Baxter; Johnstone, Gallacher, Dalglish, Law, Liddell.</p> <p>A victory soon trumped, however, for Wales would play the decider and I reckon these princely history boyos red in tooth and claw would resplendently do for the cocksure Scots \u2013 Southall; Barnes, Ratcliffe; Keenor, Charles, Giggs; Cliff Jones, Ford, Rush, Allchurch, Meredith. What an attack. What an attitude. Grand Slammers, for sure. Ah daydreams.</p> <p>And dreamy nostalgia \u2026 even outer space must know by now that this October has been a significantly super-duper month for seminal anniversaries. Half a century ago on 14 October 1962 a US spy plane photographed Soviet nuclear missile launchers in Cuba and a near-end-of-world crisis shuddered the planet. Three days earlier on 11 October the pope opened the Second Vatican Council and, they say, the worldwide Catholic church was never the same.</p> <p>A week before on Friday, 5 October the Beatles released their first record: four scallies, three words, two chords, one tin harmonica and Love Me Do was to change the souls and spirits of a generation. On the very same day Monty Norman's far more orchestrally vibrant and original title music introduced the premiere of a new film, Dr No, about a British spy named Bond, James Bond.</p> <p>It has been useful to keep tattered juvenile diaries. That 5 October 1962 came a red-letter phone call. I was a scruffy cub on the <em>Slough Observer</em>. Could I cover a county hockey match in the town in a couple of weeks' time? Three hundred and fifty words \"on the whistle\". I was thrilled. The <em>Manchester Guardian </em>represented the shining light of all ambition. Bucks 0 Surrey 4 \u2013 Surrey Slow To Find Form \u2013 and though they ruthlessly cut a few of my florid flourishes, 335 of my very own words were in print next day (18 October). Hey Ma, I'm in <em>the Guardian</em>! And in no time it was to be my home-from-home for just days short of a half century \u2013 because this week, as you see, I've taken a new guard and moved house.</p> <p>For all Castro and the pope, 007, the Beatles \u2013 and me \u2013 I've heard no mention in the log of those famous 50 Octobers ago of a truly profound event. After a dismal World Cup in 1962, England needed a new team manager.</p> <p>A handful of likely candidates \u2013 Jimmy Adamson, Bill Nicholson, Stan Cullis \u2013 all declined the poisoned chalice. On 1 October the despairing FA international committee agreed its chairman, upright Graham Doggart, should write to Ipswich Town's Alf Ramsey \u2013 or rather to his chairman, John Cobbold of the brewing family, a gay, endearing, usually and cheerfully tipsy millionaire, to ask permission to speak to Alf. That was the way then.</p> <p>No reply for a week. On 10 October Doggart telephoned the patrician's stately pile at Kirton, near Felixstowe. The butler said Mr John was away rough-shooting on his Scottish lands for another fortnight and nothing could disturb him. Persuasive dialogue made the butler agree to pass on a Scottish phone number, but it was still a full week later \u2013 with Fleet Street hysterical for action \u2013 that Doggart of the FA met Ramsey at Portman Road on 17 October.</p> <p>And English international soccer was never quite the same for a whole string of Octobers thereafter.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's election win in 2008 was hailed by some as ushering in a post-racial age in the US. However, recent books and surveys have shown that black American progress has often either halted or declined.</p> <p>From increasing segregation in the workplace, to hundreds of thousands of young black men in prison, to stuttering levels of black voting and a black middle class sent into reverse by the recession, the election of America's first black president \u2013 and his fight to win a second term \u2013 seem to have had little impact on any of this.</p> <p>Some of the most shocking revelations are detailed in a new book called <em>Invisible Men</em> by sociology professor Becky Pettit from the University of Washington. Pettit realised that many surveys conducted by government agencies exclude people in the prison population from their research and findings. When Pettit added them in, she found that it dramatically altered the picture of the status of black America, as the number of black Americans in jail is disproportionately high. About half of the 2.3 million people in US prisons are black.</p> <p>The results of Pettit's work, some argue, have exploded what she calls \"the myth of black progress\" since the civil rights era of the 1960s.</p> <p>\"This work dispels the notion that we live in a post-racial society. It not only deconstructs the myth of black progress, but also the myth of American progress overall,\" said Inimai Chettiar, a director at the Brennan Centre for Justice at New York University's school of law.</p> <p>For example, adding the prison population to the voting statistics shows that black voter turnout in 2008 \u2013 believed to have been a historic high as Obama was elected \u2013 was overestimated by 13%. A greater percentage of young black high school dropouts turned out to vote in the 1980 election, when Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan, than when Obama beat John McCain in 2008.</p> <p>When prisoners are included, the employment rate for young black men who have dropped out of school sinks from an already low 42% to 26%. Far from advancing over the past half-century since Martin Luther King championed the civil rights struggle, the picture being painted is one of troubled decline. \"We have developed a distorted view of how black Americans are faring in our society,\" Pettit said. The reason given for this in Pettit's work is the high rate of incarceration of black Americans. The rate is so steep that government estimates suggest that eventually one in three of all black male adults will spend some time in prison if current trends continue.</p> <p>In the 1930s, blacks were three times more likely to be incarcerated than whites, but the figure now is seven times more likely. Some experts put this down to the \"war on drugs\", which has affected black communities far more than others, seeing increased arrests of blacks, often for non-violent offences. \"There is no evidence that drug use is dramatically different by race or ethnicity, but the pattern of arrests is very different,\" said Ernest Drucker, author of a recent book, <em>A Plague of Prisons</em>.</p> <p>The recession, too, has taken a huge swipe at what gains the black middle class may have made. A swath of recent data has revealed a major reverse. The Pew Charitable Trust showed that 68% of middle-class Americans are predicted to see their economic status decline in the next generation. The National Urban League civil rights group also showed that from 2005 to 2009 the average black household's wealth fell by more than half. Nor has economic decline stopped. From 2009 to 2012, median annual household income for blacks fell by 11.1%, compared with a drop of 5.2% for whites and 4.1% for Hispanics. The current black unemployment rate of 14% is roughly double that of the white jobless. However, it is not just recent economic turmoil that has dampened black progress in America.</p> <p>Another new book, <em>Documenting Desegregation</em>, has examined racial equality in the workplace since the 1960s and found that progress largely halted in 1980 and has gone into reverse in some industries since then. Racial segregation between white and black men is increasing in one in six industries.</p> <p>In fact, far from painting a picture of black progress, the book's examination of more than five million private sector workplaces revealed that it is white men who have gained access to managerial jobs since the 1960s.</p> <p><em>Documenting Desegregation</em> has a grim but simple conclusion that stands in stark contrast to the general perception of a racial breakthrough that accompanied the election of Obama as the country's first black president. \"The United States is no longer on the path to equal employment opportunity,\" it says.</p>",
  "<p>Widespread allegations of sexual abuse against Sir Jimmy Savile, which Scotland Yard has confirmed stretch back six decades, have seen victims' groups swamped with pleas for help.</p> <p>The case has dredged up painful memories for other victims of child abuse, who are now also coming forward in their hundreds to seek counselling.</p> <p>Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), said its hotline had received 1,400 calls in the last 10 days \u2013 seven times its normal amount.</p> <p>\"If there is anything beneficial from this, it's that it's allowing victims and survivors of abuse to come forward and speak out,\" Saunders said, adding that the Savile affair marked a shift in how abuse was perceived. \"We are beginning to see a change in the consciousness of the country. People are starting to realise how damaging child abuse is and are seeking help.\"</p> <p>Six of the calls related to Savile, including one from a 15-year-old girl who alleged she had been abused on the set of <em>Top of The Pops</em> and in the BBC presenter's van, according to Saunders. The information has been shared with the Metropolitan police, which confirmed it was investigating allegations from 1959 to 2006.</p> <p>\"Having now had the opportunity to review progress one week on I have revised my estimate of the number of likely victims to be about 60,\" said Commander Peter Spindler, head of the Met's specialist crime investigations.</p> <p>Napac said a further three allegations it had received were made by women who claimed to have been abused by a former doctor at Stoke Mandeville hospital, where Savile was a regular visitor. The doctor is believed to have known Savile. In 1990, a doctor at the hospital was jailed for three years after admitting three charges of indecent assault.</p> <p>\"This is not just about what happened at the BBC but what happened in hospitals,\" Saunders said. \"Multiple people seem to have known what was going on.\" The scandal has raised questions about whether survivors' groups have sufficient resources to help victims. Napac said that so far it has responded only to 400 of the 1,400 calls it had received.</p> <p>The NSPCC said it had referred 95 Savile-related calls to police. It said another 19 calls, which were not Savile-related, had been passed to Scotland Yard. \"While the Savile case may be unusual it is certainly not unique,\" said Peter Watt, head of the charity's helpline. \"There are many children at constant risk from sex offenders, as well as adults who are trying to recover many years after being abused.\"</p> <p>The claims against Savile have intensified the focus on institutions that worked with him. Met officers will travel to Broadmoor on Monday to study claims Savile abused patients at the top security psychiatric hospital. The Department of Health is investigating a decision to appoint Savile head of a taskforce overseeing Broadmoor in 1988. Law firm Pannone confirmed that it had received instructions regarding an alleged assault by Savile on a 10-year-old boy while he was in care at the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey.</p> <p>\"I would urge other victims and anyone who has information regarding alleged abuse by Jimmy Savile to come forward,\" said Alan Collins, a partner at the firm.</p> <p>Jane Root, controller of BBC2 from 1999-2004, told the <em>Observer</em> there needed to be a \"kind of truth and reconciliation commission\" into not just Savile but the casual sexism that was rife in the organisation in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>\"There was a generalised level of sexist behaviour towards adult women throughout television, not just at the BBC, that was seen as acceptable then and which is, I hope, unimaginable now,\" Root said. \"And it was this sexist atmosphere, although a totally different thing, that assisted a very dedicated paedophile such as Savile to operate in the middle of it all. The two things overlapped and the first helped the second to function unchecked.\"</p> <p>Claims the BBC could be held \"vicariously liable\" for crimes committed by Savile are problematic, say legal experts. \"There are two issues with vicarious liability,\" said Matthew Nicklin of 5RB legal chambers. \"Savile would have to have been employed by the BBC, but most talent has been engaged on contract for some time now.</p> <p>\"The second way the BBC could be held liable is if a member of staff had knowledge something was going on that they could have stopped and they didn't. At this distance of time, though, it would be extremely difficult to prove.\"John Whittingdale, chair of parliament's culture, media and sport committee, said he was consulting colleagues on whether to summon the director general of the BBC, George Entwhistle, for urgent questioning.</p>",

  "<p>Health officials have confirmed another death of a patient injected with a contaminated steroid shot, bringing the number of people killed in a growing outbreak of fungal meningitis to 15.</p> <p>On Saturday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the figure for known cases of the illness had hit 197, up by 13 on the previous day.</p> <p>The health scare's latest victim was identified as a patient in Indiana, a state that has now reported two deaths from the rare form of meningitis.

  "<p>As an unveiling of the power to be found at the top of the English game, in these days of playing for control on and off the field of Europe, this was a visual feast. Harlequins made Biarritz look sluggish and unsure of foot, brushing aside not only these opponents but also the loss of their playmaker Nick Evans with an ankle injury. In the fly-half's place they introduced Ben Botica, who calmly helped himself to 18 points in this four-try, bonus-point victory.</p> <p>Only occasionally did Biarritz find their rhythm. For the most past they looked muddled. They were certainly outgunned, not bothering to challenge at an early lineout, allowing Chris Robshaw to drop the ball down to Danny Care who side-stepped past a somnolent defender.</p> <p>Biarritz entered the fray in perverse fashion. Dane Haylett-Petty, the Australian centre in the middle of a very un-Basque back-line \u2013 it contained the Englishman Iain Balshaw, the Welshman Aled Brew and the American Takudzwa Ngwenya \u2013 chased a kick and clattered into Tom Williams while the wing was still aloft. Haylett-Petty was sent to the bin and his team fell seven points behind. When he returned, the scores were level.</p> <p>Arnaud H\u00e9guy emerged from the bottom of a driving maul after Ngwenya, the flying machine, had approached the line at greater pace than the hooker. The wing had caught, kicked and chased; you could sense the nervousness of all who had to turn in defence, aware that Ngwenya may be about to come purring past. The ball was bustled into touch but from the lineout the heavyweights gathered and drove for the line.</p> <p>The next hooker to score was Rob Buchanan, the finisher of an emphatic start to the second half by Harlequins. They were transformed after the break, the example set by Care, who had been precise in the first half, but who now put some real zip into his running game. Botica had come on as early as the 18th minute and had kicked well. Now he began to be cheeky on the ball, making a clean break by cutting past H\u00e9guy, the hooker who had been sent to man-mark him at the end of a lineout.</p> <p>Biarritz had been caught on the hop early in the game and in the space of five minutes in the second period their defence was being exposed again. The only danger was that the game was now looser. This seems to be Botica's default approach: exciting and inviting. He slipped a pass one-handed beneath two defenders who were approaching him in a pincer movement. His opponents, by way of contrast, are less enthusiastically drawn to adventure. Julien Peyrelongue, for example, had chosen to thump the ball into the darkening sky, an echo of how Dimitri Yachvili usually keeps his forwards going in the right direction. With, that is, his boot. The scrum-half is injured but Peyrelongue had kept the kicking tradition alive.</p> <p>Until now. Suddenly Ngwenya was visible again, swooping into the midfield or bearing down on Mike Brown. In the third quarter it threatened to grow a little too loose for comfort for Quins. Biarritz may have been reluctant to open up but they looked instinctively good at it.</p> <p>The scrum came, if not exactly to the rescue, then to the fore as a game-swinger. This was not the plodding pack-horse scrum of the England club game of yore. All evening, Harlequins had had the edge at the set piece; now they launched themselves into it with gusto, sensing that against tired legs they could make a real mess.</p> <p>Off they went, Joe Marler and James Johnston providing the initial thrust and allowing Nick Easter, who had been growing in stature throughout the game, to run from the back. The No8, reinvented and reinvigorated in these days away from the England setup, placed the ball quickly for Care to pick up and escape into space. The scrum-half, freshly reacquainted with England after a spell of his own in the wilderness, twisted and turned with his run to connect with Seb Stegmann, the replacement wing. This surge from the scrum ended with Jordan Turner-Hall crashing over.</p> <p>Now the hunt was on for the fourth try and with it the bonus point in the group that offers the easiest route for an English club to the quarter-finals. Zebre and Connacht, the other teams in Pool 3, are not giants of the European game. Any bonus point gained by Harlequins and Biarritz against each other may be decisive.</p> <p>With seven minutes to go, Chris Robshaw opted to scrummage rather than allow Botica a penalty shot at goal. The first attack was foiled but from another scrum, the drive continued, converting into a maul and finishing with Stegmann diving over while Biarritz were complaining about something or other on the floor. They were, that is, standing and talking while Harlequins were scoring: 27 points in the second half with not one yielded. As a European declaration of intent this was loud and clear.</p>",
  "<p>This time last year, New Zealand was under the spell of the Rugby World Cup, with host nation enthusiasm going a long way to realising the organisers' vision of a \"stadium of four million\". In 2012, the big event features hairy feet of a different sort, with the New Zealand-made film <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey </em>opening with a world premiere in Wellington, the home town of director Sir Peter Jackson, in six weeks.</p> <p>A decade after Jackson's three-film adaptation of JRR Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>emerged to critical and popular acclaim, the countdown to <em>The Hobbit </em>\u2013 in its film form, also a trilogy \u2013 began last week in earnest. In earnest and in fact: Wellington mayor Celia Wade-Brown unveiled a giant clock, complete with an image of Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins, counting down the minutes to the 28 November premiere.</p> <p>The clock sits atop the Embassy Theatre, the handsome 1920s cinema that will host the screening. A bevy of international stars, led, it's safe to predict, by Freeman, will return to Wellington to walk the red carpet down Courtenay Place. The last time the 500m carpet was unrolled, for the world premiere of <em>The Return of the King </em>in 2003, about 120,000 people came to watch the procession. Organisers expect a similar turnout this time. \"It will be a real carnival atmosphere,\" promises Wade-Brown.</p> <p>There is nothing subtle about efforts to piggyback. The national tourism slogan \"100% Pure New Zealand\" has become \"100% Middle-earth\", while in the days leading up to the premiere Wellington will be \"renamed\", Wade-Brown announced last week, as \"Middle of Middle-earth\".</p> <p>It would all no doubt bewilder Tolkien, who conjured up his Middle-earth from Oxfordshire in the 1930s, and never travelled as far as New Zealand.</p> <p>The cinematic Middle-earth, however, is becoming hard to avoid. Last week saw the launch of commemorative stamps and coins sporting the images of Freeman's Bilbo and Ian McKellen's Gandalf. A dollar coin will sell for NZ$30 (\u00a315). A set of three $10 coins retails at $11,000 (\u00a36,000).</p> <p>Elsewhere, hints of the approaching publicity deluge keep appearing. At the top of the website for TVNZ, the country's biggest broadcaster, lining up alongside generic categories such as \"news\", \"sport\" and lifestyle is \"The Hobbit\". Passengers on Air New Zealand will soon find themselves lectured on the location of their lifejackets by crew dressed as characters from <em>The Hobbit </em>in a new inflight safety video.</p> <p>A shire of four million, then? Not quite. Broadly, New Zealanders are behind Jackson's project, and appreciative of what the films have done for the film and tourism industries (the combined value of the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>trilogy to the New Zealand economy is estimated at more than NZ$700m, or \u00a3350m). But reports of \"Middle-earth fever\" are misplaced. The novelty of the scale and ambition of the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>project has dissipated, and for the most part enthusiasm is muted.</p> <p>If there is feverishness, it is in the efforts of the tourism industry to \"leverage <em>The Hobbit</em>\", as the Tourism New Zealand chief executive has put it. The \"100% Middle-earth\" campaign, it is hoped, will be a shot in the arm for an industry that has seen growth in visitor numbers stall in recent years.</p> <p>It is all a huge contrast from the <em>Lord of the Rings </em>experience. Back then, tourist operators felt \"ambushed\" by fans of the films, says Melissa Heath, owner of Southern Lakes Sightseeing, which specialises in <em>Lord of the Rings </em>location tours. \"I don't think anyone in New Zealand was ready for it.\"</p> <p>Her company, based in the South Island tourist hub Queenstown, fielded numerous calls after the first release in 2001 from visitors eager to see the film locations \u2013 those that weren't created digitally, at least. By 2004, the company had become exclusively focused on <em>Lord of the Rings </em>tourism. \"It was initially full-on Ringons,\" says Heath. \"People would be speaking elvish in the van, dressed as Sam or Frodo. Now it's settled back to everyday people. But most of our clients are absolutely committed, dedicated fans.\" They are also almost invariably from overseas. \"New Zealanders are completely bemused by the interest here,\" she says.</p> <p>Heath is expecting business, which has remained steady since hitting a peak in about 2005, to grow again with the <em>Hobbit </em>films. Her company, along with similar operators around New Zealand, is eagerly awaiting the likely release of location details. \"We have an idea about them, but like everybody we don't know exactly where.\"</p> <p>The attraction most certain to enjoy a boost is Hobbiton Movie Set and Farm Tours. Nestled in undulating hills near the quiet rural town of Matamata, in the North Island Waikato region, and half-owned by Jackson, this is where the hobbits really lived. Or near enough: large parts of the <em>Rings </em>and <em>Hobbit </em>films were shot here \u2013 and the current visitor numbers, about 20,000 a year, are expected to rapidly swell.</p> <p>Tourism aside, the great economic legacy of <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>is in production expertise \u2013 highly skilled crews and digital animators \u2013 backed by a \"phenomenal investment in computer technology\", says John Yeabsley, a senior fellow at the NZ Institute for Economic Research, and co-author of a 2002 report on \"the lasting effects of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>\". \"Once all the mania was over, what it really left was&#xa0;an amazing increase in human capital, in skills and reputation, in proven capability on the ground,\" Yeabsley says.</p> <p>That is echoed by the Wellington mayor. \"The Tolkien transformation has been absolutely extraordinary for our capital,\" says Wade-Brown, a British expatriate. \"There will be short-term gains for the city, in tourism especially, but the big Wellington story is really one of technology and talent.\"</p> <p>The threat today for that skilled workforce, as for tourism, says Yeabsley, comes both from the the global economic slump and the strengthening New Zealand dollar. When Jackson began on the first trilogy, the American dollar bought almost exactly twice the amount of the New Zealand currency that it does today.</p> <p>It is against that backdrop that John Key, the New Zealand prime minister, embarked earlier this month on a tour of Hollywood, to \"sell New Zealand\" to studio bosses. He had an able chaperone in James Cameron, who spent more than NZ$350m making <em>Avatar </em>in New Zealand, and is in the process of moving his family to live there.</p> <p>With the screen industry contributing close to NZ$3bn a year to New Zealand's economy, said Key, \"in simple terms, this visit is about jobs for New Zealanders\". Part of his message was that \"we have made sure our law is flexible\".</p> <p>For some, however, such flexibility was taken too far in 2010, when New Zealand labour legislation was changed in the face of Warner Brothers' threats to move production of <em>The Hobbit </em>elsewhere. The \"<em>Hobbit </em>law\", together with fresh tax breaks to offset the shifts in exchange rate, saw the films stay in New Zealand. But with the Tolkien catalogue just about run dry, the next challenge is to sustain life after Middle-earth.</p>",
  "<p>Given the crises facing the planet, with the population set to reach the 9 billion mark by 2050 and increasing strains being placed on water, energy and food supplies, it would be wrong to hope there could be a single solution to the storms that lie ahead. As the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, once put it in an <em>Observer</em> interview: \"There will be no silver bullet.\"</p> <p>However, the population biologist added a crucial caveat. It would also be foolish not to make the maximum use of the new technologies that we are developing in order to alleviate some of the worst dangers we will face in the decades that lie ahead.</p> <p>And among those scientific wonders, the use of genetically modified crops has a particularly rich potential, Beddington added. \"Just look at the problems that the world faces: water shortages and salination of existing water supplies, for example. GM crops should be able to deal with that.\"</p> <p>It is a good point. Consider the simple issue of food that is lost before it can be harvested because it has been eaten by pests that humans have never learned to control. That loss comes to around 30%, agriculture experts calculate, a rate that cannot be allowed to continue. And GM crops are perfectly placed to solve that sort of problem.</p> <p>The work of scientists at the Rothamsted research station in England provides a good example of the sort of benefits that can be achieved through genetic modification. They have engineered a strain of wheat so that it emits a chemical called E-beta-farnesene which is also emitted by aphids when they are threatened. In effect, it tells other aphids to fly away. For good measure, E-beta-farnesene also attracts aphid predators such as ladybirds and wasps. In short, it delivers a double whammy \u2013 and one with rich potential. Aphids cause an estimated \u00a3100m of damage to crops every year in the UK alone.</p> <p>At present, the effectiveness of Rothamsted's anti-aphid GM wheat has only been demonstrated in the laboratory. Earlier this year field trials were prepared but were threatened by anti-GM campaigners. However, their protest fizzled out, a development that suggests the green movement is growing up over its opposition to genetically modified crops.</p> <p>In the end, however, science can only delay the inevitable, as Lester Brown of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington has made clear. We need to act now to start to cope with crises over water supply, world population numbers and rising carbon emissions in the hope that advances in agriculture and genetics can give us time for such measures to be introduced and take effect.</p> <p>Or, as Beddington has made clear, there are almost a billion people today who are suffering from serious food shortages and who face starvation. \"It is unimaginable that in the next 10 to 20 years there will not be a worsening of that problem unless we take action now, and we have to include the widest possible range of solutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's top animal disease scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/14/letters-observer\">have launched a devastating attack</a> on the government's \"mindless\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/badgers\" title=\"\">badger cull</a>, accusing ministers of failing to tell the truth and demanding the immediate abandonment of the killings.</p> <p>The intervention by dozens of the nation's most senior experts, in a letter in the <em>Observer</em>, comes as farmers prepare to begin the cull in Gloucestershire and Somerset, possibly as early as tomorrow. The government's own chief scientist has refused to back the killings.</p> <p>More than 30 eminent animal disease experts describe the cull as a \"costly distraction\" that risks making the problem of tuberculosis in cattle worse and that will cost far more than it saves.</p> <p>TB in English cattle is an increasing problem, with the 26,000 infected animals slaughtered in 2011 costing \u00a390m in compensation. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, argues that more than a decade of research shows that culling badgers, which can carry bovine TB, could reduce infections by 12%-16% if undertaken intensively for many years and over large areas.</p> <p>However, the scientists reject the idea of scientific support for the cull, which could wipe out 100,000 badgers, a third of the national population. The cull policy is \"mindless\", according to Lord John Krebs, one of the UK's most eminent scientists and the architect of the landmark 10-year culling trials that ended in 2007. \"The scientific case is as clear as it can be: this cull is not the answer to TB in cattle. The government is cherry-picking bits of data to support its case.\"</p> <p>Another signatory, Lord Robert May, a former government chief scientist and president of the Royal Society, said: \"It is very clear to me that the government's policy does not make sense.\" He added: \"I have no sympathy with the decision. They are transmuting evidence-based policy into policy-based evidence.\"</p> <p>The current government chief scientist, Professor Sir John Beddington, refused to back the cull. Asked if it could make a meaningful contribution to tackling TB in cattle, he said: \"I continue to engage with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] on the evidence base concerning the development of bovine TB policy. I am content that the evidence base, including uncertainties and evidence gaps, has been communicated effectively to ministers.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"The leading experts Defra brought together in April 2011 agreed that the evidence shows that culling done in the right way can reduce the spread of the disease to cattle, with benefits remaining for many years. The culling policy has been developed to maximise the benefits shown in previous trials, and to minimise the impact of badgers spreading disease beyond the cull area by including hard boundaries such as motorways and rivers.\"</p> <p>But scientists say the <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">two-page document</a> produced by the April meeting does not support the cull. Professor Rosie Woodroffe, of the Zoological Society of London, said: \"The document simply does not endorse the policy.\"</p> <p>The cull has provoked the largest animal rights campaign since fox hunting in the 1990s, with some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">activists pledging to disrupt the nocturnal shootings by</a> marksmen. More than 150,000 people have signed a <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">government e-petition to stop the cull</a>, entitling it to be considered for a debate in parliament. MPs say they are confident this will be granted when the decision is made on Tuesday.</p> <p>The scientists, whose letter is also being sent to Paterson, claim scientific opinion in the UK is overwhelmingly against the cull. \"I just don't know anyone who is really informed who thinks this is a good idea,\" said Professor John Bourne, who led the decade-long trial.</p> <p>The scientists reject other statements from ministers and even David Cameron, who said last week: \"I believe this is the right policy for healthy badgers as well as healthy cattle.\"</p> <p>Woodroffe pointed to research showing that just 14% of badgers in previous culls had TB and just one in a hundred had severe symptoms. \"Furthermore, all the evidence shows that culling badgers increases the proportion of badgers that have TB,\" she said.</p> <p>In a separate development, nine leading vets have written an open letter, co-ordinated by <a href=\"www.hsiuk.org\">Humane Society International/UK</a>, to Defra and Natural England. They warn that the shooting permitted by the cull licences \"will inevitably result in the targeting of many pregnant sows and, if culling extends towards the end of the open season, could result in the shooting of lactating sows, leading to the starvation of dependent cubs\".</p> <p>Naturalist and broadcaster Bill Oddie said: \"I cannot believe they are going to be able to go out in pitch darkness \u2013 badgers are nocturnal \u2013 and shoot them. It is truly a horrific situation.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012 to correctly identify Humane Society International/UK.</p>",
  "<p>The head of the NHS has laid bare his fears that the government's controversial reforms of the health service could end in \"misery and failure\".</p> <p>Sir David Nicholson, chief executive of the NHS, said high-profile, politically driven changes almost always end in disaster. He warned against \"carpet bombing\" the NHS with competition but said that competition was best used like a \"rifle shot\" to fix problems.</p> <p>The outspoken comments, made to GPs at a conference held by the Royal College of General Practitioners, puts Nicholson on a collision course with the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Last week Hunt told the Conservative party conference that the NHS reforms devised by Andrew Lansley to open up the NHS to private providers and give extra powers to GPs were \"brave and right\". But Nicholson, who has until now kept his concerns private, revealed tensions between the government and the highest echelons of the NHS at the meeting held just over a week ago.</p> <p>Nicholson said that he believed the reforms could serve patients well by offering them choice, and testing current failing services with competition. But the <em>Observer</em> has learned that he also voiced his worries about the potential burden of extra responsibilities given to GPs, including negotiating with private health providers. He said: \"If we are creating a system where general practitioners feel it is their job to do all that, then I think we have a massive problem. We need to create the right kind of people with the right kind of skills, which we are trying to do at the moment through commissioning support, to enable people to focus their attention on clinical decision-making.</p> <p>\"My advice to anyone \u2013 and I have been involved in the last five or six years with the national programme for IT, and I have, as they say, the scars on the back around all of that \u2013 is that big, high-profile, politically driven objectives and changes like this almost always end in misery and failure.\"</p> <p>Lansley was removed from the Department of Health in the last reshuffle but the government continues to pursue its \u00a33bn shakeup of the NHS. This month 6,000 NHS services are up for tender to the private and third sector \u2013 such as voluntary and community services \u2013 including diabetes education, glaucoma treatment, abortion clinics and minor oral surgery.</p> <p>Nicholson told GPs that he believed competition could be healthy, but reiterated a warning issued by the chair of the health select committee, Stephen Dorrell. Nicholson told the meeting: \"It is very effective when it is used as a rifle shot to deal with specific issues rather than a carpet bombing.\"</p> <p>Nicholson added that he believed the reforms were an opportunity to keep the politicians out of the NHS. He added: \"I'm an optimist by nature, I have been a health service manager for the last 35 years.\" But in regard to the reform programme, he added: \"What it does do is change the nature of the relationship between government and the NHS in a really profound way. We can conspire to stop it if we want to. We now have an NHS commissioning board, clinical commissioning groups, whose responsibilities are in law, statutory bodies with a legal framework. No longer is the NHS what the secretary of state said it would be. It creates much more difficulty for politicians to arbitrarily get involved in the day-to-day operations of the NHS.\"</p> <p>A source close to Nicholson said the NHS chief had been attempting to rally GPs involved in the reforms to work with the changes.</p> <p>Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham seized on Nicholson's comments. He said: \"David Nicholson is a man who has the NHS at heart, so it is worrying to hear him talk in these terms. He has put on a brave face in public, but clearly has private concerns about the real damage this reorganisation is doing.</p> <p>\"His open acknowledgment of the possibility of it ending in failure will send shock waves through the NHS and provide a stark illustration of the sheer scale of the gamble the government is taking.\"</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"David Nicholson was speaking in favour of increased autonomy of our NHS and about strong local leadership of healthcare, which is something the government supports.\"</p>",
  "<p>The ailing former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, together with Venezuela's recently re-elected leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, played a critical role in bringing the Colombian government and the deadly Farc guerrilla group together for peace talks that could end one of Latin America's longest-running civil wars, the <em>Observer</em> has learned.</p> <p>According to sources closely involved in the peace process, which sees historic talks opening in Oslo on Wednesday, the key breakthrough after almost four years of back-channel talks between the two sides came during a visit earlier this year by Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, to Cuba, where he met both Castro and Ch\u00e1vez, who was in Cuba being treated for cancer.</p> <p>That meeting was the first of many in Havana between the two sides, facilitated primarily by Cuba and Norway with the backing of Venezuela, which saw agreement on the detailed agenda for the first round of talks this week. \"Officially President Santos went to Cuba to discuss the Americas summit,\" said a source intimately involved in the peace negotiations. \"But the purpose of that trip was to discuss the peace initiative.\"</p> <p>The meetings earlier this year followed the decision last year by Santos to take the step of recognising that an \"armed conflict\" existed in his country, an initiative encouraged by Ch\u00e1vez since 2008. Those contacts also came in the same period that Farc announced it was ending kidnapping, one of five preconditions for talks that had been set down by Santos as a gesture of goodwill.</p> <p>Farc and the government have been at war since 1964, with the group more recently accused of having taken a directing role in coca production in areas it controls, an issue that will be on the agenda for the talks.</p> <p>But in what is being billed as the best chance to bring about a negotiated end to the long-running conflict, the Colombian government delegation will sit down with Farc leaders whose Interpol arrest warrants have been suspended to allow them to travel to Oslo without fear of arrest.</p> <p>The government delegation, for the first time ever, will include retired generals with the trust of the country's military and representatives of Colombia's business elite, whose presence, it is hoped, will help sell any peace deal that emerges to those hostile to the process.</p> <p>After the failure of the last round of peace negotiations, which foundered 12 years ago, top of the agenda will be the issues of land reform \u2013 Farc's key demand \u2013 political participation, the disarmament of the guerrilla group and the issue of paramilitaries who have in the past sought to torpedo any deal.</p> <p>The disclosure of the key role of Cuba in organising support for the peace process marked the culmination of a long period of back-channel talks first initiated by Santos's predecessor as president, Alvaro Uribe, under whom Santos served as minister of defence.</p> <p>During those four years contacts continued despite the death during an army operation of Farc's leader, Alfonso Cano, last year.</p> <p>Others credited with having created the conditions for the talks in Norway are unnamed former participants in the Northern Ireland peace process.</p> <p>The talks are due to begin amid warnings from both sides, as well as observers, that a serious threat exists from those on both sides of Colombia's political divide who might attempt to use violence to derail the process.</p> <p>The attempt to reach a negotiated peace settlement foundered over a decade ago as both sides accused the other of stalling and rebuilding their forces, a period, observers say, that saw a doubling of anti-Farc paramilitaries.</p> <p>A senior Colombian government source, who briefed the <em>Observer</em> on condition of anonymity, described the chances for talks as the best ever, adding that the Santos government had already enacted a new law for land reform and victim restitution. \"President Santos is a pragmatist. He has already presented to congress a framework for an agreement. Colombia was already moving into a post-conflict phase, in some respects, even as the conflict continues. It is the right moment. Farc have a historic opportunity \u2013 probably the last \u2013 to find a solution to this conflict with dignity. To go into history and say they fought for social justice. To say they fought for land reform.</p> <p>\"We want to see 'Timochenko' [Rodrigo Londo\u00f1o Echeverri, who took over command of Farc after Cano's death in 2011] in Colombia's congress just as we have seen Gerry Adams in the Northern Ireland assembly.\"</p> <p>The sense of a guarded new optimism is shared by outside observers, including Marc Chernick, a US academic who has followed the history of Colombian peace negotiations and written <em>The Farc at the Negotiating Table</em>. Speaking from Colombia on Friday, Chernick said: \"I've observed all the previous negotiations and I have been optimistic before, but this time I believe there is a real seriousness on both sides that has not been shown before.</p> <p>\"In the past Farc has always asked for a demilitarised zone as a precondition and this time it has not pressed for that. Four years ago it started to release prisoners, first civilians then military, and then renounced kidnapping.</p> <p>\"Clearly they want to talk. And they stayed at the table for the pre-negotiations even though three senior leaders were killed, including Alfonso Cano.</p> <p>\"Santos is clear, too. He was former minister of defence under President Uribe. They pushed the war as hard as they could and killed leaders. Now he has recognised that it will go on indefinitely. So Santos has come to the conclusion that only a negotiated solution is possible.\"</p> <p>Chernick \u2013 like the senior government source \u2013 warned of the risk of violence during the peace talks from those, particularly on the right, opposed to peace with Farc, not least, he says, from paramilitaries who, although officially \"disbanded\", are still active and supported by elite sectors of society.</p> <p>\"What is different this time,\" added Chernick, \"is that both sides have signed up to the idea that the intended end of the peace talks is the end of the conflict.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jim Bolger was provided with extra cause to celebrate a fifth win in the last seven years of the Dewhurst Stakes, as Sheikh Mohammed altered course by announcing that Dawn Approach would remain with the trainer next season.</p> <p>The decision, preceded by the battling victory of the 3-10 favourite, further cemented a unique relationship between Bolger and the Sheikh's racing and breeding operation that has previously seen Bolger's most talented performers moved to join the Dubai team.</p> <p>It was in the colours of Princess Haya, the Sheikh's wife, that Dawn Approach's sire, New Approach, sold by Bolger after winning the Dewhurst in 2007, took the following year's Derby. But, as part of that deal, the trainer was able to send a number of his mares each year to the stallion, and it was one of those matings which produced gold in the form of Dawn Approach.</p> <p>Although the decision to leave the colt in Bolger's care could not be considered a complete surprise, it is nevertheless noteworthy with the Emirati trainers employed in Newmarket under the Sheikh's Godolphin flag having nearly always assumed control of horses bought by the operation as two-year-olds.</p> <p>\"It was Sheikh Mohammed's decision,\" said the Godolphin racing manager, Simon Crisford. \"The colt won't run again this year. He'll go back to Ireland, he'll come back for next year's 2,000 Guineas and we'll take it from there. He could be aimed at the major 10-furlong races in the summer.\"</p> <p>One and a half furlongs out, Leitir Mor, the stablemate of Dawn Approach sent across to perform pacemaking duties, was still in front and briefly giving concerns to those who took the odds on the winner. \"We might have to buy that one as a lead horse too now,\" was Crisford's comment.</p> <p>But the unflappable Bolger insisted that he had never been concerned about the prospect of saddling a one-two in the wrong order.</p> <p>\"There were no anxious moments,\" he said. \"He just has a lazy style of racing. There were never any concerns.\" Deflecting admiration over his record in the race, he went on: \"I haven't looked at the statistics. I'd maybe be wondering what happened the other two years.</p> <p>\"As soon as I saw this horse last October as a yearling I liked the look of him. In fact it was then that I first thought of the Dewhurst. But he can be a very gross horse and it won't be easy over the winter to keep the weight off him.\"</p> <p>Bolger and the jockey Kevin Manning were in the Newmarket winner's enclosure again when Trading Leather took the Autumn Stakes.</p> <p>Sheikh Mohammed has been a less frequent visitor to British racecourses than usual in recent months but, with the meeting sponsored by Dubai, his return was rewarded with further well-timed successes. In the Middle Park Stakes, Reckless Abandon, bought to stand at his Darley Stud from 2014, pluckily maintained his unbeaten record by taking under an inspired ride from the veteran Frenchman Gerald Moss\u00e9.</p> <p>The colt, who had already given his trainer Clive Cox the first Group One success of his career when taking the Prix Morny earlier in the season, was allowed to get across to the stands' rail from an unfavourable position in stall two and relished the role, rallying when challenged to hold off fellow 9-4 joint-favourite Moohaajim by a neck.</p> <p>Moss\u00e9 had already performed a miracle just to stay on board the well-named Reckless Abandon who had charged towards a running rail when first coming out on to the track. \"Just as the lads let him go, he jumped forward and he did get close to the rail,\" Cox said. \"Gerald did a pretty amazing job to sit tight but it all ended well. He is a very talented horse. He can be quirky but we can deal with that. For now, I just don't want this feeling to end.\"</p> <p>With Dawn Approach remaining as 5-1 favourite for the 2,000 Guineas, bookmakers quoted Reckless Abandon at around the 20-1 mark, but Cox was coy about moving up in trip next season. \"I think we need to digest this and we'll see,\" he said. However, it would not be surprising if the Sheikh's men offer some input into the decision and vote against allowing a Classic clash with another of their own.</p> <p>A crowd of 9,514, representing a modest increase on the previous year's total, also saw Aaim To Prosper become the first horse to win the Cesarewitch Handicap twice. Having not found his way to the winner's enclosure since his 2010 success in the race, punters had long since abandoned hope and he was returned at odds of 66-1.</p>",
  "<p>As many as 58 victims of the Hillsborough disaster might have been saved if the emergency services had responded better, far more than estimated by the recent report into the 1989 tragedy.</p> <p>The Hillsborough Independent Panel said last month that 41 of the 96 Liverpool fans who died could have survived if the response had been quicker. However, further analysis of the medical documentation has led to that figure being revised sharply upwards, according to sources close to the families' campaign for justice.</p> <p>The news that more than 60% of those who died at Hillsborough could have lived will intensify pressure on the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, to reopen inquests into the tragedy. During the original inquests, the coroner imposed a 3.15pm cutoff on evidence, creating the erroneous impression that an effective emergency service response could not have saved&#xa0;lives.</p> <p>Sources caution, however, that the figure of 58 is not yet definitive and may be slightly lowered: medical evidence is still being examined.</p> <p>\"This question about the numbers is incredibly important, the figure has gone up from 41 to 58 but it is obviously a delicate situation that will greatly add to the distress of the families,\" the source said.</p> <p>A number of families have recently met Dr Bill Kirkup, the medical expert from the panel, to discuss the evidence on their loved ones' deaths. One of Britain's most prominent pathologists, Dr Nat Cary, is preparing to brief victims' families individually.</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who is due to meet Cary, hopes to learn more about the details surrounding the death of her 18-year-old son, James. \"But it is crucial to everyone involved that the figure of 96 remains the most important. We want them to start quashing the inquest verdicts,\" she said.</p> <p>The development comes as Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, begins to evaluate the 450,000 pages of evidence uncovered by last month's report to determine whether criminal charges can be brought. The involvement of the CPS brings the prospect of manslaughter charges against senior police officers, the board of Sheffield Wednesday and FA officials over the failures that led to the deaths.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched the largest ever investigation into police misconduct in connection with the disaster. Up to 200 officers from different forces are facing claims they tried to deflect the blame for the fatal crush.</p> <p>Lord Falconer, a former lord chancellor, said it was imperative that the IPCC investigation was well-resourced and had \"high-quality investigators\" to ensure past mistakes were not repeated. \"This is a real test for the IPCC,\" he said. \"It has to be clear that the motive is to get to the truth rather than look after their own, to get rid of the taint of corruption that hangs over the last police inquiry.\" Falconer was referring to the investigation by West Midlands police into the South Yorkshire force's handling of the tragedy, which families believe was biased and which the IPCC on Friday admitted had led to ongoing \"questions about [its] adequacy and thoroughness\".</p> <p>The chief constable of South Yorkshire police, David Crompton, will appear before MPs on the home affairs select committee on Mondayto answer questions on Hillsborough. Crompton has admitted \"grave errors\" were made by the force during the disaster, saying that if \"people are shown to have acted criminally then they should face prosecution.\"</p> <p>Sir Norman Bettison, the chief constable of West Yorkshire police \u2013 an inspector in South Yorkshire at the time of the disaster \u2013 is already facing demands from a Merseyside MP, Maria Eagle, that he be suspended.</p> <p>The families are also keen that the match commander on the day, Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, should not escape possible criminal charges. Duckenfield opened the Leppings Lane gate that led to the fatal crushing, but then claimed supporters had forced open the gate themselves.</p> <p>Senior lawyers who have been trawling through the newly released documents are confident that charges of corporate manslaughter could arise. Any possible charges relating to Hillsborough would have to be brought under common law corporate manslaughter rather than the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act, 2007, which is not retrospective. The traditional obstacle with bringing successful corporate manslaughter charges is difficulties establishing that senior people were aware of the failings. Lawyers say the documents show negligence at the highest levels.</p> <p>\"The issue is that these people were aware of the danger and did nothing about it,\" one said. The senior QC, who requested not to be named, added: \"Corporate manslaughter charges against these bodies is not too late, you need to establish gross negligence and that the senior boards and committees knew of the dangers but did nothing about it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Residents of a small seaside town in Maine are on tenterhooks awaiting the release of the names of more than 150 suspected clients of a secret brothel prosecutors claim was run out of a local Zumba dance studio.</p> <p>Kennebunk is more usually known for its quaint shops, picturesque coastline and sailing, but it has hit national headlines for speculation as to just who might be on that list. Town residents have reportedly heard rumours that the clients could include lawyers, law-enforcement officers, firemen, local officials and other well-known people.</p> <p>All apparently frequented the prostitution ring that is alleged to have been run by fitness instructor Alex Wright, 29, from the nearby town of Wells, under the guise of a Latin-flavoured dance exercise programme.</p> <p>Wright has pleaded not guilty to prostitution, invasion of privacy and other charges for allegedly accepting money for sex and secretly videotaping her encounters.

On Wednesday, Turkey intercepted a Syrian passenger plane en route from Moscow to Damascus and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/11/turkey-accuses-russia-syria-munitions\" title=\"\">said it had seized military equipment</a>.

  "<p>Authorities in Massachusetts have been accused of failing to properly enforce regulations aimed at protecting patients from contaminated drugs, after the death toll from an outbreak of meningitis linked to a medicine made in the state rose to 14.</p> <p>The specialised compounding pharmacy at the centre of the escalating health scandal is being investigated for breaches of state and federal laws.</p> <p>A patient from Minnesota, one of almost 14,000 patients at risk of contracting the disease after being injected with the potentially tainted steroid produced by New England Compounding Center, has filed what is expected to be the first of many lawsuits against the company.</p> <p>Now state agencies are facing questions over their enforcement of existing regulations. On Friday, a congressional committee called on the state's pharmacy regulator to provide information about its oversight of the company.</p> <p>Massachusetts is one of just 17 states with regulations designed to protect patients from the sort of health scare which has now spread to 11 states. Two former compounding pharmacists who now work in the quality control industry told the Guardian that the risk to patients would have been minimal had the regulations, known as USP 797, been enforced.</p> <p>\"It's abysmal that the local authorities are calling for greater oversight\" said Eric Kastango, a voluntary committee member of US Pharmacopeia (USP), the industry body behind regulations governing compounding sterile drugs. \"If someone just enforced Massachusetts law, these cases could have been avoided. They failed in their responsibility for enforcing what they already had.\"</p> <p>The scale of the outbreak makes it by far the worst of a series of fatal infections and overdoses connected to specialised \"compounding\" pharmacies.</p> <p>Each case has prompted calls for federal oversight of the drug-producers, which are not subject to the same controls as mass manufacturers but whose regulation falls between the state board of pharmacy, the state department of health and the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>Kastango questioned how closely the state board of pharmacy had inspected NECC's books and said that the regulations adopted by the state to protect patients, if properly applied, should have avoided contamination.</p> <p>\"If they had complied with USP 797 they would have avoided contamination. They would have found the source of it and remediated it. In my heart of hearts, I believe that.\"</p> <p>He said a company complying with the regulations would have more effectively \"tested and they would have been monitoring their environment. They would have been cleaning the facilities. They would have been able to detect deviation in the process and they would have picked this up.\"</p> <p>The process to make the steroid was \"extremely complex\", requiring two major compounding procedures, one of which involves taking the solution and pumping it into vials without contamination. It would have been considered \"high risk\", he said.</p> <p>Kastango, a consultant in quality control who has 30 years experience in compounding, said that he had carried out as-yet unpublished analysis which found that in almost all of the recent cases where there have been health scares linked to compounding pharmacies, a breach of regulation USP 797 had been involved.</p> <p>The analysis included the infections from Avastin, which affected 16 people in Tennessee and Florida, leaving some of them blind, that was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/health/31drug.html?_r=1\">linked to a compounding company in Hollywood last year</a>.</p> <p>\"There is a need for states to enforce the USP and to hold people to account to existing regulation and to ensure that people who are doing this know what they are doing\" Kastango said.</p> <p>There have been 200 adverse events involving 71 compounded products since 1990, some of them with \"devastating repercussions\", according to the FDA. Three patients died of infections from drugs used in open-heart surgery in 2006 and two patients were blinded at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington due to a compound product that was used in cataract surgery in 2005. Last year, <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthcare/Lots-to-learn-from-recent-IV-compounding-deaths-in-Alabama-La.html\">contaminated nutritional supplements from an Alabama company killed nine patients and injured 10 others</a>.</p> <p>Kate Douglas, a former director of a compounding pharmacy who is now president of Performance Strategies LLC, which consults sterile compounding pharmacies on safety issues, said not enough was being done by state boards to enforce regulations and called for more funding for states to ensure compliance.</p> <p>\"I can walk into a pharmacy and tell you within an hour whether they are following USP 797,\" she said. \"But they need to find a way to get them inspected and hold them accountable. It's a challenge for state board of pharmacies. They need to make sure they are knowledgeable about 797 and maybe more funds are needed for states to do that.\"</p> <p>She added: \"If you are a nurse or physician, you are held accountable to state regulations and you have to do the right thing and sometimes doing the right thing takes time. We can only reduce the risk of contamination, it can never drop to zero but if you follow the standards of practice you won't be killing people.\"</p> <p>The Massachusetts office of health and human services said it had taken \"swift action\" against the NECC, but pointed to loopholes in regulatory requirements which left them powerless. The state department of public health called on Congress to act to address the need for new laws.</p> <p>On Thursday, it accused the company of violating one state law which requires compounding pharmacies to only produce drugs to specified patients with a prescription.</p> <p>In a joint press briefing with the FDA and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Madeleine Biondolillo, the department's director of heathcare and safety, said: \"So, you know, NECC under Massachusetts board of pharmacy licensing regulations was licensed to deliver compounded products in response to individual patient specific prescriptions.</p> <p>\"And it looks through the investigation as though they have violated that aspect of the state licensing regulation despite their assertion that they were operating under the regulations.\"</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the department said: \"The FDA and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy have conducted joint reviews of NECC for more than a decade. These collaborative investigations are essential to maximizing regulatory oversight, and ensuring public safety.</p> <p>\"We've taken swift action to date, including securing the surrender of the company's license, obtaining a recall of all of its products and promptly notifying all providers and patients. We are jointly examining all root causes of these events with the FDA, and we are committed to ensuring that all responsible parties are held accountable.</p> <p>\"We urge Congress to act quickly to address the need for new laws on the federal level to fill in the regulatory gaps, so that there is clear authority over regulating these practices.\"</p> <p>Federal and state regulators have also come under scrutiny for allowing a previously unknown pharmaceuticals sector known as compounding to grow at such a pace without much federal oversight. The industry has grown so large that some of the companies operate more like drug manufacturers than pharmacies, critics say.</p> <p>In 1997, the FDA got Congress to pass a law giving it more power to regulate compounding pharmacies. But in 2002, the US Supreme Court struck down its no-advertising provisions on First Amendment grounds, leaving the rest of the law in limbo.</p>",
  "<p>Radio 4, the jewel in the crown of the BBC's radio empire, is to enter a new era next month, seeking to become an online information and entertainment service as well as a national broadcasting station.</p> <p>The aim is to create a \"bigger Radio 4\" by rapidly improving access to the station's vast archives, as advances in technology make live radio and daily schedules less central to the BBC's output.</p> <p>The first stage of the opening up of Radio 4's cache of speech, news and drama programming to the public is timed to coincide with the US presidential election on 6 November. \"Radio 4 can now offer listeners much more as we break out of our schedule and begin to reveal our archive,\" said Gwyneth Williams, the station's controller, this weekend. \"We are just beginning to test the considerable potential the website has by using some of the best of Radio 4's past content on a subject and joining it to current events.\"</p> <p>Radio 4's editors will select current and past programmes organised around contemporary topics which listeners can choose online.</p> <p>The experiment begins on 1 November with the release of many of the late Alistair Cooke's Sunday-morning <em>Letter from America </em>programmes. Cooke, a Radio 4 institution, broadcast his personal views of politics and culture from across the Atlantic for more than 50 years. Listeners will be able to download any of 920 episodes from an archive that reaches back to the 1940s and covers many significant events up to Cooke's death in 2004.</p> <p>\"Alistair Cooke \u2013 his very name invokes the art of writing for radio,\" said Williams. \"I am hugely excited about this extraordinary archive. I can see Alistair, as I listen, telling his stories and drawing in listeners with his easy authority and knowledge of history, his reporting skills and his passion for America.\"</p> <p>Williams's personal highlights include Cooke's dramatic letter describing the assassination of Bobby Kennedy, which he witnessed from an adjoining room (he said the shots sounded \"like someone dropping a rack of trays\"), and a letter about George Romney, Mitt Romney's father and governor of Michigan, who led a national poll for president in 1968 but went on to lose the Republican nomination.</p> <p>The Radio 4 controller's wider aim is \"to burst out of the schedule\", she says, with collections of related programming \u2013 including arts interviews with American authors and composers, while <em>Desert Island Discs</em> will feature American guests.</p> <p>\"We can point our audience, for instance, to Melvyn Bragg's brilliant <em>In Our Time</em> on the Statue of Liberty, broadcast in 2008, or to his programme on Benjamin Franklin, as well as to the <em>News Quiz USA</em> that has just been broadcast,\" she said.</p> <p>In many homes the tuning dial on a radio set is already obsolete and it seems likely that, within a decade, the set itself will have been replaced by computers, tablets and smartphones. Listeners will choose programmes by theme and genre, instead of simply tuning in to their favourite station. This switch in behaviour is already established in the nation's television viewing habits.</p> <p>The <em>Letter From America </em>archive launch is part of a range of events also planned to mark BBC Radio's 90th year and it will add to more than 16,000 hours of audio already available on the station's website, including every Reith Lecture since they began in 1948.</p> <p>Cooke was born in Blackpool in 1908, but his fascination with America began in the early 1930s when he studied at Yale and Harvard as a Commonwealth Scholar. He spent a summer in Hollywood, befriending Charlie Chaplin and became the BBC's film critic in 1934.</p> <p>A 1946 letter from the BBC Talks Department describing the new Cooke show to the editor of the <em>Radio Times </em>has been unearthed by Zillah Watson, who compiled the archive.</p> <p>\"<em>American Letter </em>will be something new in British broadcasting,\" the document reads. \"In this weekly personal letter to Britons,&#xa0;Alistair Cooke will try to give listeners in this country some of the intimate background to American life, pictures of regions and places, and profiles of important American personalities.\"</p> <p>Accurately predicting the tone of the 2,869 instalments of the programme that followed, the note explained there would be a stress \"on the springs of American life, whose bubbles are the headlines, rather than on the bright headlines themselves\".</p> <p>To accompany the archive, Radio 4 and the BBC World Service will both broadcast <em>In Alistair Cooke's Footsteps</em>, a four-part series presented by Alvin Hall in which Hall travels across America to find out whether Cooke's letters are still relevant today.</p> <p>\"Rediscovering these vital broadcasts has been a riveting journey through recent American history,\" said Watson. \"From the golden age of 50s America, to the disillusionment of the Bush years via JFK, civil rights and Watergate, this is an astonishing record of the great years of the American century.</p> <p>\"And now they will all be available, crisply digitised from the original tapes and supported by transcripts for reference.\"</p>",
  "<p>Under the influence of the painkiller Dilaudid, and dog-tired after another day of fighting for my life with my private health insurance company, I glimpsed Mitt Romney and his running-mate, Paul Ryan, entering my Los Angeles hospital room dressed in surgical gowns with scalpels in their hands ready to fatally operate on me.</p> <p>It was a drug-induced hallucination, of course. But the mirage made me sit bolt upright in bed and, fully awake, start to rethink my previous, bitterly dissenting view of Barack Obama.</p> <p>For the past year, I've been in a death spiral without knowing it. The occasional fainting spell, sprawls on the street and a dramatic weight loss were shrugged off as merely a cost of doing a writer's business. Denial is a most powerful analgesic. Even when paramedics first rushed me to the hospital, I angrily argued with the doctors.</p> <p>But when a lightning-bolt sciatica pain, triggered by a car accident, brought me down like a bull under the matador's sword, more or less paralyzing the left side of my body, the health gods decided it was time to shut down my hubris. Like something out of the TV's \"House\" or \"General Hospital\", suddenly there were midnight ambulances, emergency room traumas, drip feeds, oxygen tubes up my nose, renal failure, suspected meningitis, pneumonia and a minor heart attack. </p> <p>Thankfully, working as a team at my local Cedars-Sinai hospital, whole platoons of neurosurgeons, cardiologists, nurses, infectious disease experts, radiologists, physical therapists, pulmonologists and hospitalists (whatever they are) dragged me back from the edge. Emergency surgery in a special spinal unit was successful, and today I'm back on my feet \u2013 I'm a product of American medicine at its best.</p> <p>Ah, if only the doctors were free to do their jobs!</p> <p>My private insurance company, a subsidiary of Wellpoint Inc \u2013 America's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WellPoint\">largest \"managed healthcare\"</a>, for-profit company \u2013 interfered at almost every stage of my treatment. They were aggressive and shameless. At my most vulnerable, with tubes sticking out of me, they phoned my hospital room \u2013 kicking my anxiety level sky-high \u2013 to let me know that Wellpoint's profit-seeking radar had targeted me. The anonymous voice warned, with a kind of smiling threat, that they were on my case: meaning, some bureaucrat \u2013 was he or she even medically competent, or just an IT geek \u2013 in a far-off, distant corporate office believed that my treatment was violating a mysterious insurance algorithm.</p> <p>Here in California, Wellpoint and its member plans are notorious, as Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/23/us-wellpoint-breastcancer-idUSTRE63M5D420100423\">reported</a>, for \"using a computer algorithm that automatically targeted [women] and every other policyholder recently diagnosed with breast cancer \u2026 the insurer then [allegedly] canceled their policies based on either erroneous or flimsy information.\"</p> <p>The practice is called rescission. To put it bluntly, the company collects your money when you're healthy, but cancels if you get sick. In the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-insure9nov09,0,4409342.story\">case of another insurance company, Health Net Inc</a>, employees were actually paid bonuses based on how many cancellations were carried out; at other insurers, like Wellpoint, <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/17/business/fi-rescind17\">staff were praised in performance reviews</a>. Wellpoint's California subsidiary, Anthem Blue Cross, has raised premiums capriciously <a href=\"http://www.healthreform.gov/reports/insuranceprospers/index.html\">by as much as 39%</a>. Politically, Wellpoint is, in effect, a rightwing \"political action group\" that <a href=\"http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content/HOM-240210/Group-charges-health-insurers-are-violating-state-labor-code.html\">lobbies hard against healthcare reform \u2013 even calling upon employees to do their share</a>. In other words, it's the ogre in the medicine cabinet.</p> <p>Perversely, none of the bad stuff would have come down if my primary insurance had been traditional, government-paid Medicare, the closest America has to a single payer. But a quirk in my union benefits put me in the sweaty hands of Wellpoint. I wasn't threatened with recission, but almost daily, and sometimes several times daily, my doctors were interrogated about practically every measure they took to keep me alive. Again and again, I saw caregivers, even the most skilled and courageous, retreat with an embarrassed, impotent shrug of resignation that said, \"what can I do; it's 'the system'?\"</p> <p>So I \u2013 and my courageous tiger wife \u2013 fought, wangled, yelled, protested until I ultimately squeezed past the algorithm. The surgeon of my choice skillfully removed the whatsit that was pressing on an inflamed nerve that had been beating up my spine, and I even won a little rehab time before the insurance computer forced my early discharge. Along the way, anguish over near-daily arguments with the faceless insurance hanging judges almost gave me another heart attack.</p> <p>Need it be this way?</p> <p>Obamacare \u2013 also known as the Affordable Health Care Act \u2013 isn't medical heaven, or single payer, or anything like the \"socialized\" NHS that kept me well for the 30 years I lived in the UK. The new law, an obvious compromise with the corporate sickness industry, still keeps us in the hands of private insurance companies. But when the law fully kicks in for the first time, all Americans \u2013 regardless of <a href=\"http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/publications/reports/health-reform/helping-families.html\">income</a> and \"<a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/timeline/index.html#event7-pane\">preexisting medical conditions</a>\" \u2013 must have health coverage. Individuals up to the age of 26 are covered by their parents' plan. Low-income Americans <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/health/policy/this-election-two-profoundly-different-visions-for-health-care.html?pagewanted=all\">will get subsidies</a> to help them buy insurance, and doctors and hospitals <a href=\"http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2012-09/health-care-close\">will be paid for outcomes not \"procedures\"</a>. Starting in 2014, insurers are forbidden to deny coverage to anyone <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/06/nation/la-na-obama-record-healthcare-20121006\">who has no workplace</a> \u2013 the jobless and freelancers will be able to get a government-mandated, insurance plan; indeed, they must or pay a \"fine\". And under the new law, \"federal parity\" means <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/blog/2010/08/mentalhealthupdate.html\">mental healthcare will be more accessible</a> to more people.</p> <p>Granted, that all depends on this upcoming election day. If Romney and Ryan win \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-11/romney-narrows-gap-with-obama-in-swing-state-polling\">latest polls</a> tell us this is a real possibility \u2013 they, a vengeful Republican Congress and their insurance lobby allies <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/06/25/busted-health-insurers-secretly-spent-huge-to-defeat-health-care-reform-while-pretending-to-support-obamacare/\">have sworn to sabotage</a> healthcare-for-all. As for repeal and replace, Mitt's prescription for uninsured folks is that emergency room care is a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/23/mitt-romney-60-minutes-health-care_n_1908129.html\">good enough</a> substitute: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We do provide care for people who don't have insurance \u2026 If someone has a heart attack, they don't sit in their apartment and die. We pick them up in an ambulance, and take them to the hospital, and give them care.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Here and elsewhere, I have written bitterly attacking Obama's serial betrayals. He's no street-scrapper, our Barack. Prior to falling sick, I pined for a third-party candidate, and seriously thought about not voting. But a drug-induced vision of a Romney/Ryan medical hell changed my mind. On 6 November, I'm pulling the lever for Obama: my arrogant, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20121010/us-presidential-campaign/\">self-sabotaging</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/25/study-obama-drone-deaths\">drone-happy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/biden-republicans-think-compromise-is-a-dirty-word--20120925\">compromise-addicted</a> war president.</p> <p>I never want to see Dr Romney in my hospital room again. Damn it, I want to live.</p>",
  "<p>Before I begin: a caveat. I know television drama is often fanciful and ridiculous. The West Country of <em>Midsomer Murders</em> would be the murder capital of Europe if you took it at face value; the London of <em>Spooks</em> a place of endless shootings, conspiracies and car chases.</p> <p>But fictional drama tells us truths about ourselves in ways that can be as uncomfortable as they are unintended. The Emmy-winning <em>Homeland</em> on Channel 4 is a case in point. Its plotting is as ridiculous as it is exciting. But what makes it difficult to watch is its treatment of Muslims.</p> <p>In the first episode of the new season we were confronted with a new character, a glamorous correspondent with a cutglass English accent, a Palestinian family and access to both the CIA and the US Congress. Like the Saudi prince from the last series and the academic, behind the scenes these high-profile Muslims living in the US share a secret: both willingly or otherwise they are covert helpers of Abu Nasir, the al-Qaida terrorist leader.</p> <p>In other words, it does not matter whether they are rich, smart, discreetly enjoying a western lifestyle or attractive: all are to be suspected.</p> <p>I admit I have no idea how the story arcs in <em>Homeland</em> will develop and what surprises are in store. What I do know is how both Arabs and Islamists have been portrayed thus far as violent fanatics, some of whom are powerful and influential infiltrators.</p> <p>As someone who has spent much time in the Middle East, I find the depictions not only crude and childish but offensive. There is more to it than the portrayal of individuals. For <em>Homeland</em> presents an odd and unbelievable image of relationships between countries and identities in the region, where Palestinians, Iraqis, Saudis all share an agenda regardless of background, culture and history.</p> <p>Should any of this matter in a fictional series? The answer is yes.</p> <p>It has not only been Damian Lewis, the British actor who plays the character Brody, who has insisted that its appeal is that its \"action is grounded in a political reality\". Reviewers have also praised the \"credibility\" of a programme whose fans include the president of the United States.</p> <p>The reality is that what <em>Homeland</em> portrays is a peculiar view of the Islamic world, one rooted, perhaps, in its genesis as an Israeli drama, where the view of the surrounding neighbourhood is more paranoid and defensive. It matters for this reason. Popular culture both informs and echoes our prejudices.</p> <p>How we portray the \"other\" \u2013 those whom we fear or are suspicious of \u2013 reinforces cultures of conflict. In some respects it has always been thus. The author and journalist Robert Winder detailed in his book <em>Bloody Foreigners</em> how Charles Dickens, in creating the character of Fagin for <em>Oliver Twist</em>, refashioned a real social problem. The boys' \"rookeries\" were run by Italian gangmasters in Clerkenwell's Little Italy, but in keeping with contemporary suspicion and hostility to Jews Dickens made Fagin Jewish \u2013 something he later regretted.</p> <p>Indeed, popular literature, plays, films and television have often been crude in their representation of perceived enemies \u2013 Jews, Germans, communists, Irish \"terrorists\" and now Muslims, amplifying concerns that may be based in some reality like the phenomenon of al-Qaida terrorism to represent it as some vague, universal truth.</p> <p>In some respects the negative portrayal of Arabs in US film and TV dramas is not a new phenomenon, as documented by academic Jack Shaheen in his studies <em>The TV Arab</em> and <em>Reel Bad Arabs</em> where he has argued that historically Arabs in US dramas have, since the 1920s, been depicted as being one of the \"three Bs\u2026 bombers, belly dancers or billionaires\".</p> <p>The impact of television portrayals on perceptions of minorities is not a new issue. In the 1970s \u2013 in the aftermath of the US civil rights movement \u2013 there was sufficient concern for a presidentially appointed commission to study it. The subsequent report suggested strongly, as suspected, that both the \"invisibility\" of minority presentations on television as well as how minorities were portrayed when they did appear \u2013 for example, as criminal or lazy \u2013 did influence the way both whites and non-whites see minorities.</p> <p>Research conducted by social scientists in the 1990s in the US examined how exposure to fictional portrayals of both stereotypes and counter-stereotypes influenced how credibly a study group of 400 students believed real and high-profile cases then in the news.</p> <p>\"[Exposure] to a stereotypic portrayal of a female,\" wrote researcher Sheila Murphy in <em>The Impact of Factual Versus Fictional Media Portrayals on Cultural Stereotypes</em>, \"led individuals to doubt the credibility of Anita Hill (the woman who accused supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment) and Patricia Bowman (the woman who accused William Kennedy Smith of rape), whereas exposure to a counter-stereotypical portrayal increased the perceived credibility of these women\".</p> <p>While many have pointed to the extraordinary success of <em>The Cosby Show</em> as a turning point in TV depiction of minorities, a study by Dana Mastro and Bradley Greenberg in 2000 into racial stereotyping on TV discovered that inherent biases continued, with only 3% of characters being black, and that of the three groups examined \u2013 Caucasian, Latino and African American \u2013 African Americans continued to be the most negatively stereotyped \u2013 representation and attitudes that barely changed almost a decade later when the exercise was repeated.</p> <p>Indeed, when there are inherent biases in the way that TV portrays groups and individuals \u2013 as in <em>Homeland</em> \u2013 they seem to reflect widespread and widely held attitudes.</p> <p>Stuart Hall, the cultural theorist who has examined the phenomenon of \"reception theory\" as applied to televisual media \u2013 building on the work of Hans Robert Jauss in the late 1960s \u2013 has argued, indeed, that the messages in television drama \"intersect with the deep semantic codes of a culture and take on additional, more active ideological dimensions\".</p> <p>In other words, television drama such as <em>Homeland</em> not only reflects cultural and social anxieties at any given time, it reflects back those anxieties, reinforcing and shaping them. Crucially there is strong evidence that counter-stereotypical fictional depictions in popular culture may have a positive impact, with some arguing that it can help turn around prejudicial attitudes.</p> <p>What is intriguing is that <em>Homeland </em>seems out of step with trends in characterisation post-9/11, in US TV and film at least. After a period when \u2013 as even Howard Gordon, the executive producer of <em>24</em>, admitted in 2009 \u2013 the trend for depicting Muslims as terrorists seemed to be in decline, it sticks out like a sore thumb.</p> <p>Then, Howard described the reason for that change at least in terms of his own show's development, not least as public attitudes began to alter in the wake of the Abu Ghraib abuse scandal in Iraq. \"We began to realise,\" he said in remarks to Souheila al-Jadda, co-producer of the American TV series <em>Who Speaks for Islam?</em>, \"that by portraying Muslims strictly as terrorists on the show we were... unwittingly exploiting some of the fears of our audience members.\" He added: \"I think that the impact of our content or creative content is one of our greatest exports. It becomes a very powerful instrument for understanding each other in this terrible... divide we find ourselves in with the Muslim world.\"</p> <p>That coincided, too, with emerging criticism from both Muslim advocacy groups in the US over depiction of Muslims in drama as well as the refusal by actors to play \"sinister\" Arabs.</p> <p>Perhaps, in the end, <em>Homeland</em> will surprise and conclude with a more challenging and nuanced picture of Islam and the Arab world that goes beyond the stereotypes.</p> <p>I am not holding my breath.</p>",
  "<p>With the support of the international community, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi came to power in Yemen as the consensus candidate \u2013 when the opposition coalition and the former ruling party signed an agreement on political transition put forward by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p> <p>After months of turmoil, the agreement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/24/yemen-ali-abdullah-saleh-resigns\" title=\"\">ended the 33-year rule</a> of Ali Abdullah Saleh but it marginalised a large segment of Yemeni society, including those who led the movement for change.</p> <p>Hadi's \"election\" in February \u2013 in a national poll where he was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/21/us-yemen-idUSTRE81J0RQ20120221\" title=\"\">the only candidate</a> \u2013 did not sit well with many, but others welcomed it as a symbolic step to steer Yemen away from a potential civil war.</p> <p>Some of Hadi's initial decrees surprised critics, giving people hope that he would lead Yemen independently. His decisions to reassign military and security officials from their posts, and his appointments \u2013 such as replacing the governor of Taiz \u2013 were widely welcomed.</p> <p>Also, on 22 September he signed a decree authorising the creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights violations during the 2011 uprising \u2013 though with the immunity law, the chances of prosecution are near impossible.</p> <p>The immunity law, stipulated in the GCC agreement, is not the only obstacle. A continuing problem is that the GCC's transition agreement places a lot of importance on President Hadi, without any reference to what would happen in his absence. Analysts worry that this makes him an easy target for those who would benefit from derailing the transitional process.</p> <p>Fearing for his life, Hadi has been protected by the military's First Armoured Division (FAD) which supported opposition protests against Saleh last year. The head of the FAD, General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar (a kinsman of ex-president Saleh who eventually turned against him) is known for his bloody past, making him more valuable as a friend than an enemy.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hadi's relationship with Ali Mohsen is seen by many as one of convenience, where protection is exchanged for loyalty, and there are some worrying indicators that Ali Mohsen may be gaining influence through President Hadi's tacit and sometimes declared approval.</p> <p>For example, people welcomed the creation of a new Presidential Protection Force made up of three brigades of the Republican Guard, headed by Saleh's son Ahmed Ali \u2013 and one brigade from the FAD \u2013 as essential first steps towards unifying the military.</p> <p>However, the 314th brigade of the FAD that was affected by this decree was one that had refused to defect with Ali Mohsen during the uprising and always remained loyal to Saleh. Hence, this decree only reduced the power of Saleh loyalists, leaving intact Ali Mohsen's influence over the military.</p> <p>The Hadi-Mohsen relationship instilled fear in people that the patronage system \u2013 one of the hallmarks of Saleh's rule \u2013 may continue under a different guise in favour of the Islamist party Islah, the dominant force in the traditional opposition, due to its close ties with Ali Mohsen.</p> <p>According to reports by local newspapers, employees at the ministry of electricity filed an official complaint against the minister for employing his relatives and friends without merit. They listed 19 new employees all of whom are affiliated to Islah.</p> <p>One government employee stated on condition of anonymity: \"In the past, the minister would only employ his pro-regime friends. Today, the new minister brought his friends from the party to take over the leadership of some divisions without the required skills. It's like one mafia replaced another.\"</p> <p>These practices might affect Hadi's credibility and thus affect the goals of the National Dialogue, which is one crucial test for the president.</p> <p>Among other things, the dialogue intended to begin next month needs to build trust with the rebellious Houthis in the north and the separatists in the south. It is of vital importance for Hadi to address their grievances and include these marginalised yet powerful groups in the process for a successful dialogue.</p> <p>So far, no members of the important technical committee for the National Dialogue are affiliated to the Southern Movement, though there is talk of the state issuing a public apology for past wars in the south and north \u2013 which may restore trust in the process and facilitate their involvement.</p> <p>A widespread perception, though, is that the National Dialogue will only empower political parties and will neglect the people and their needs.</p> <p>Last month, Hadi issued another decree to add six new members to the technical committee, four of whom are from the Islah party, shifting the balance. It also decreased the number of women to less than 30%, which has been commonly accepted as the minimum quota for women's participation in the various committees.</p> <p>For Yemen to move forward, a sincere healing process needs to begin, and a bottom-up approach needs to replace the top-down elite model for the dialogue to succeed or else it will become just another political conference. If the National Dialogue fails, so will Hadi's legitimacy.</p> <p>Another indicator that the leadership is not taking people's opinions into account is Hadi's recent statement praising the efficiency of drones and acknowledging his approval of the strikes which have resulted in many civilian deaths.</p> <p>With no mention of the civilian casualties from his home province of Abyan, Hadi's legitimacy is slowly fading. A backlash against his statement was immediately felt in the country.</p> <p>After his speech, Hadi quickly acquired new nicknames including \"Abdu Drone Hadi\", coined by activist Abdulrahman Alansy. \"Exchanging local support with international glamour rather than striking balance between both will simply turn him into a Yemeni version of the weak and ineffective Karzai,\" said Ibrahim Mothana, youth activist and co-founder of the al-Watan party.&#xa0;</p> <p>More than seven months into his presidency, it appears that Hadi is not interested in bargaining with the masses, and instead is focused on pleasing the inner political circle, extending the exclusionary politics of the Saleh era into the new transitional government.</p> <p>Hadi should take on this historic responsibility with a vision for the country and move beyond managing the power struggles, which is what Saleh did for 33 years and which cost him the presidency. With all the difficulties Yemen is facing, it is not to his advantage to sideline revolutionaries and other important and powerful groups in Yemen, from whom he should gain his legitimacy.</p> <p>Gone are the days when legitimacy only comes from a small inner circle. The extent to which the people are able to push for reforms will demonstrate whether Yemen will move towards a more inclusive political process.</p>",

Several of the wounded were in a critical condition.</p> <p>The bomb was detonated outside the offices of tribal elders.

Police official Naeem Khan said passers-by as well as local elders were among the victims. At least 35 shops and eight vehicles were destroyed.</p> <p>Some of the wounded were reportedly being taken to hospitals in other towns, including Peshawar, a 30-minute drive away, because local facilities could not cope.</p> <p>With the backing of the US, the Pakistani government has fought to bring the tribal region under control, but has so far failed to break the network of militants.

  "<p>Millions of householders face record high heating bills this winter as two of Britain's biggest energy suppliers announced price increases of up to 9% on the same day.</p> <p>British Gas has announced a price rise of 6% for gas and electricity customers that will add \u00a380 to the typical household's annual bill, while npower has announced an 8.8% price increase for gas and 9.1% for electricity, adding \u00a3112 to bills.</p> <p>The rises, which come into effect on 16 November for British Gas and 10 days later for npower customers, will make the latter the most expensive supplier in the country. Customers on its most expensive tariff face a typical annual bill of \u00a31,356.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/22/sse-announces-energy-price-rise\" title=\"\">SSE has already announced price rises of 9%</a>, which take effect on Monday, making it the second most expensive supplier, at \u00a31,354 a year. British Gas is a close third with average bills rising to \u00a31,336.</p> <p>The move is a bitter blow for householders who suffered gas and electricity price rises in 2011 of 18% and 16% respectively from British Gas and 17% from npower. This was followed by a 5% drop in electricity tariffs by British Gas in January 2012 and a 3% cut in the same month from npower.</p> <p>George Osborne told ITV: \"We are doing everything we can to help people insulate their homes better. We've got government programmes which we urge people to take up to make sure that they can get their electricity bills cheaper but of course I'm concerned when I see electricity bills going up and partly that is because of things beyond our control \u2013 what's happening in the world with oil prices and gas prices.\"</p> <p>Asked whether energy companies are profiting too much, the chancellor said: \"Of course these companies need to generate money that they can invest in new power stations and new grids and the like but I'm also very clear that at a time like this we've got to help families.\"</p> <p>Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \"Rises in fuel costs are eating away at people's earnings, forcing them to make really difficult choices about whether to have a warm home, put food on the table, or fill up the car in order to get to work.\"</p> <p>A total of 8.5m households will be hit by the British Gas increase, though a further 1 million of its customers on fixed-price contracts will be unaffected. The 4,000 British Gas customers on its renewable energy tariff will face even bigger rises when their electricity bills rise by 11%. The company blamed the bigger rise on the higher cost of generating electricity from renewable sources. Three million npower customers will see their prices go up, while a further 500,000 on fixed tariffs will see no change.</p> <p>British Gas blamed the price increase on rising wholesale prices as well as increasing costs related to social and environmental issues. \"We simply cannot ignore the rising costs that are largely outside our control, but which make up most of the bill,\" said the company's managing director, Phil Bentley.</p> <p>\"Britain's North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global marketplace. Furthermore, the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers' homes, and the costs of the government's policies for a clean, energy efficient Britain, are all going up.\"</p> <p>Paul Massara, chief commercial officer at npower, blamed \"external factors\". \"We support moves to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, but new government schemes will mean energy bills will rise,\" he said.</p> <p>Consumer groups were quick to express their concerns, not only at the size of the rises but at the similarity between the resulting prices. Joe Malinowski, energy analyst at <a href=\"https://www.theenergyshop.com/HomeEnergy/\" title=\"\">TheEnergyShop.com</a>, said he did not agree wholesale gas prices could be to blame. \"Year on year these are down,\" he said. \"The price rise also makes British Gas's prices almost identical to that of SSE, once SSE's prices go up on Monday. So where is the competition in the market?\"</p> <p>Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: \"Price hikes on the same day will just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers \u2013 whether justified or not \u2013 about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the market.</p> <p>\"People are not convinced they are getting a fair deal. Unless they can be reassured about the relationship between costs, prices and profits, consumer distrust will continue, companies won't get their message across, and the success of the regulator will be questioned.\"</p> <p>It is widely anticipated the remaining \"big six\" suppliers will soon follow suit with similar price rises. E.ON has a price freeze in place until the end of the yearbut has refused to rule out an increase after that, but ScottishPower and EDF are expected to announce rises imminently.</p> <p>Some householders could still save close to \u00a3300 by switching supplier and tariff, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/29/fuel-bills-price-rises-best-deals-winter\" title=\"\">but many of the cheapest deals have recently been pulled</a>. Three of the cheapest five tariffs now come from two of the country's smallest suppliers, First Utility and Ovo Energy.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/12/british-gas-raises-electricity-tariffs\" title=\"\">See if you can save money with the Guardian Money Deals switching service</a></p>",
  "<p>Video footage on a laptop may provide investigators with crucial evidence as they probe the behaviour of seven Royal Marines arrested for the alleged murder of an insurgent in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The inquiry is understood to be focusing on what happened after the marines and the man were involved in a firefight, and whether he was unarmed when he died. The Ministry of Defence refused to give more details of the incident, which took place when the marines were part of 3 Commando Brigade's Afghanistan tour between April and October 2011.</p> <p>It is believed the investigation will look at footage taken at the time which came to light a few weeks ago. The film was found on the laptop of a serviceman being investigated on a separate matter. It is understood to show marines discussing what to do with an injured insurgent.</p> <p>The seven were arrested on Thursday by the Royal Military Police (RMP), and the inquiry will be run by officers from the force, who will decide if there is enough evidence to press charges. That will turn on whether there is evidence the men broke the strict rules of engagement (ROE) that all British military personnel are expected to abide by. The ROE are secret, but are largely derived from the Geneva conventions and dictate under what circumstances British troops can open fire.</p> <p>The Royal Navy made clear on Friday that it demands the highest standards from its personnel, and that the arrests showed the seriousness with which the incident was being taken.</p> <p>The decision on whether the marines face trial will be made by the military's director of service prosecutions. A court martial has the same sentencing powers as a crown court, so the marines could face life imprisonment if found guilty.</p> <p>The sensitivity of the case has led to a near news blackout at the MoD to allow the RMP to conduct an investigation that is thought to be the first of its kind involving British forces in Afghanistan. The marines are regarded as among the elite of the British armed forces, and commanders hailed their efforts in Afghanistan last year as having \"historical importance\" in the fight against the Taliban.</p> <p>The MoD would not say where the alleged murder took place or when, though sources insisted the dead man was a combatant, not a civilian, and that no special forces soldiers were involved. It also insisted that there had been an \"engagement\" between the insurgent and the marines. Nothing untoward was reported to commanding officers at the time.</p> <p>Afghan defence ministry spokesman General Zahir Azimi said the Afghan government welcomed the arrests because it meant the law was being implemented.</p> <p>Meanwhile it was reported that British military chiefs are planning for an accelerated withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Daily Telegraph said the move was prompted by an intervention by George Osborne who questioned the continued presence of British troops in the country.</p>"
