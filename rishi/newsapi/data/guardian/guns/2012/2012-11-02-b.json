  "<p>At the risk of mixing metallurgical metaphors Steve Diamond seems to be Sale's coach with a Midas touch. The abrasive Mancunian hooker turned chief executive has made an instant impact after taking charge of the team in each of the last two seasons and now his decision to reclaim control at the expense of Bryan Redpath has paid immediate dividends.</p> <p>Diamond and Redpath, who has been downgraded from director of rugby to head coach in a shake-up precipitated by seven straight Premiership defeats, sat together in the stands as the Sharks gained their first league win of the season. They remain bottom but are only four points behind Irish, who on this evidence could be in for a long hard winter themselves.</p> <p>\"I'm a relieved man,\" Diamond said. \"There was obviously a lot of commotion on Monday and Tuesday and we needed a performance. The lads delivered. When the shit hits the fan it's normally your players who fracture but they haven't done that \u2013 they're sorted.\"</p> <p>Sale seemed set for a comfortable night in miserable conditions as they took a 15-3 half-time lead through tries from Johnny Leota and Nick Macleod, who also kicked a conversion and a penalty. But they made desperately hard work of it, as is the wont of struggling teams, with Andy Powell making so many handling errors that he was hauled off with 16 minutes remaining.</p> <p>When Ian Humphreys kicked his third penalty Irish were within six points and Sale nerves were fraying, most obviously when Danny Cipriani fluffed a straightforward penalty \u2013 bad timing for him on his 25th birthday with Stuart Lancaster, the England head coach, watching.</p> <p>Irish handed Cipriani a couple more chances in the last five minutes and were denied even a losing bonus point. \"We were patched up and a bit of a motley crew,\" said Brian Smith, their director of rugby, referring to a short turnaround after the controversial defeat by Harlequins and the loss of several internationals.</p> <p>However, Sale were also without their Scotland lock Richie Gray, who failed a fitness test on his ankle and is expected to miss next weekend's Test against the All Blacks. They retained the game's liveliest performers in Richie Vernon in the back row and Cillian Willis, who was excellent at scrum-half until forced off by injury.</p> <p>Diamond was not getting carried away. \"This was the first step for us. We're in a dogfight until the end of April or May. This isn't going to get sorted by Christmas.\"</p> <p><strong>Sale Sharks</strong> Macleod (Miller, 41); Brady, Leota, Tuitupou (Addison, 64), Cueto; Cipriani, Willis (Peel, 73); Harrison (Lewis-Roberts, 69), Taylor, Buckley (Cobilas, 69), McKenzie (Gaskell, 73), Myall, Vernon, Seymour (capt), Powell (Easter, 64).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Macleod, Leota <strong>Con</strong> Macleod <strong>Pens</strong> Macleod, Cipriani 2</p> <p><strong>London Irish</strong> Watson; Ojo, Armitage, Tagicakibau, Yarde (Geraghty, 69); Humphreys, Allinson; Lahiff, Lawson, Aulika (Halavatau, 50), Evans, Garvey, Danaher (capt; Skivington, 50), Gibson, Hala'ufia (Treviranus, 50).</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Humphreys 3</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> S Davey (RFU) <strong>Attendance</strong> 5,723</p>",
  "<p>America's \"superstorm Sandy\" has once again thrown the spotlight on travel insurance, and the exclusions that frustrate so many people when they come to claim. Many insurers failed to pay after a volcanic ash cloud grounded hundreds of planes in 2010, and they have frequently left travellers stranded when airlines have gone bust.</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers (ABI) says that last year its members paid out \u00a3416m to policyholders. Mostly, it was for medical claims, which totalled \u00a3258m, with those for lost and stolen possessions just \u00a323m.</p> <p>But Money's Bachelor &amp; Brignall consumer column regularly receives complaints from readers whose claims have been rejected. So we posed a number of the most common dilemmas and asked the ABI for answers.</p> <p><strong>The area I'm going to has declared a \"state of emergency\". Will my policy pay for cancellation of my trip?</strong></p> <p>Probably not if it's something like a hurricane or \"post-tropical cyclone\". Cancellation due to adverse weather is \"unlikely\" to be covered, says Malcolm Tarling at the ABI; people should check their policy wording as this will vary between insurers.</p> <p>In general, travel insurance covers cancellation due to specific events \u2013 generally illness, being made redundant, jury service, a car being stolen or home broken into \u2013 which mean you have to stay in the UK.</p> <p><strong>While on holiday there was an earthquake. I'm safe, but the flights are cancelled and we're going to have to stay in emergency accommodation for a while. Will the policy cover the hotel, new flights home and expenses?</strong></p> <p>This will vary, says the ABI. For example, Churchill Insurance says on its website that, provided you've started your trip, you will be covered for travel and accommodation costs involved in moving to new accommodation, if the place you have already booked and paid for is in the earthquake zone. It adds that if the earthquake makes it impossible to continue, the company will cover the cost of getting you home. <strong>I've had to receive medical treatment as a result of a falling branch during a storm while on holiday. Will the policy pay out for the treatment?</strong></p> <p>Yes. \"It will pay the cost of emergency medical treatment, and, if necessary, medical repatriation,\" says Tarling.</p> <p><strong>I hired a scooter while on holiday, but came off as it was going downhill and I needed hospital treatment. Will the policy pay out for treatment?</strong></p> <p>Contentious. Plenty of insurance policies exclude scooters. \"Be aware that some policies may exclude motorbikes over a specified cc,\" says the ABI.</p> <p><strong>On my way to the airport in the UK, there was a pile-up on the motorway, causing a huge traffic jam, and I got to the airport too late to catch the flight. Can I claim for the cost of the flights and holiday on my insurance?</strong></p> <p>We receive lots of complaints about this. Policies rarely pay out in these circumstances \u2013 at best, it will only be if your car was involved in the accident. Contracts say it's your duty to leave enough time to get to the airport. You have more chance of receiving a payout if you travel by bus or train and the service is cancelled.</p> <p><strong>The flight has been cancelled because the airspace has been closed due to a volcanic eruption. (a) I'm in the UK. Can I claim for the cost of the flights and holiday on my insurance? (b) I'm abroad \u2013 will the policy cover the cost of extended accommodation while we wait for the ash to clear?</strong></p> <p>The ABI says that on (a), a claim will usually be made against the airline, not under your insurance: \"Some policies will have a volcanic ash exclusion.\" And (b) Unlikely. The airline/tour operator may provide accommodation, but your insurer won't. Some policies pay a set amount per day to cover delays, which could help towards the cost.</p> <p><strong>I'm going on holiday to Egypt tomorrow, but a terrorist bomb has just gone off in the area I'm visiting and I'm too nervous to go. Can I make a claim for cancellation?</strong></p> <p>Tricky. Some policies may cover you if the UK government issues specific advice against travelling to a particular area. In other circumstances it might be classed as \"disinclination to travel\", which is not covered, says the ABI.</p> <p><strong>My son is going on a gap-year trip and I'm arranging his travel insurance. Will the policy pay out if there is, say, civil unrest and he has to change his plans? Will it pay for him to come home if there is, say, a tsunami?</strong></p> <p>Civil unrest is not covered. Check the wording. The same may apply to tsunamis, though some companies will sell add-on policies for this type of thing.</p> <p><strong>The airline I'm flying with has gone bankrupt. Will my policy pay out for the cost of the flights?</strong></p> <p>Travel insurance is not designed or priced to cover this risk, says the ABI. However, some policies have started including \"SAFI\" (scheduled airline failure insurance). Always check, and if not, consider buying it as an add-on.</p>",
  "<p>Ole Schou was 27 years old when he had a dream. It was 1981 and he was a graduate student at a&#xa0;business school in the Danish city of Aarhus. In the dream, Schou saw an icy blue sea and, caught in the waves, hundreds of frozen sperm. \"It was such a peculiar dream that I could not forget it,\" he recalls, \"so sometime later I walked into the university library and asked for any literature on sperm and fertility.\" Schou started reading and became obsessed: he began experimenting with his own sperm, masturbating nightly and freezing the sperm into vials he would store in his fridge, much to the surprise of any visitors to his flat. \"My dream had given me another dream,\" Schou says. \"I was going to build a sperm bank.\"</p> <p>That dream came true. <a href=\"http://dk.cryosinternational.com/about-us/history.aspx\" title=\"\">Cryos</a>, the company Schou started up 25 years ago this month, is today the world's largest sperm bank. Schou estimates that Cryos has been responsible for more than 30,000 births, producing more than 2,000 babies a year, and \u2013 in what has been called a new Viking invasion \u2013 the company exports sperm to more than 70 countries. Cryos and similar companies, such as the <a href=\"http://www.europeanspermbank.com/\" title=\"\">European Sperm Bank</a>, have helped turn Denmark into the sperm capital of the world.</p> <p>Cryos operates from the fifth floor of a redbrick building in the centre of Aarhus, Denmark's second largest city. It is here that sperm is donated, analysed, studied and finally dispatched to clinics around the world. Hanging in the reception area is a large blue painting inspired by Schou's sperm dream. The walls of the corridors are lined with large photographs of smiling babies and magnified images of sperm. To the right of the reception are three brightly lit rooms, each containing a few porn magazines, a television screen transmitting hardcore films, a sink, tissue dispenser and toilet.</p> <p>\"The men can look at a magazine, watch a film or listen to music,\" Schou says. As we are talking, a young man in a green hooded jacket arrives at reception. He walks into a cabin and shuts the door behind him. A red light flashes on. \"The majority of donors come once or twice a week,\" Schou says. \"Some are even sent by girlfriends because his sexual needs are greater than hers.\"</p> <p>The Danish laws on donation have recently been tightened after a donor at a rival sperm bank was found to have passed on a rare genetic condition to at least five of the 43 babies he is thought to have fathered. New potential donors are interviewed, their health evaluated and checks made regarding any history of disease in their family. Cryos <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/8768598/Sperm-bank-turns-down-redheads.html\" title=\"\">attracted headlines</a> last year for announcing that red-headed men would not be able to donate, as there was insufficient demand for ginger babies. The truth, Schou told me, was the bank already had plentiful supplies of sperm from redheads and could afford to be picky about new donors.</p> <p>\"When I started out back in the 80s, it was not easy to get men to donate,\" Schou says. \"I&#xa0;would ride my bicycle carrying printed sheets of A4 paper that said 'Become a donor and help childless women' and people would look at me very strangely. I remember one time I was in a&#xa0;restaurant toilet and I saw a beautiful black man. At the time it was hard to get sperm from men of different ethnicities, so I told him I was in need of sperm. He became very angry and punched me.\"</p> <p>Schou no longer needs to advertise: Cryos has a&#xa0;bank of 170 litres of sperm and a waiting list of 600 donors. The reasons for wanting to donate, he says, are not just financial: donors receive around 500 kroner (\u00a354) a time, but when the rate was at one point increased, the number of donors did not change. Rather, men are driven by a mix of altruism and a desire to earn \"pocket money\" \u2013 many are students at the university nearby, for whom sperm donation has become almost a rite of passage.</p> <p>The young man steps out of the cabin and hands over a cardboard kidney-shaped tray. The sperm is left to settle for 30 minutes before a lab technician takes a sample and studies it under a microscope, measuring its health and speed. \"Good sperm quality is genetics,\" Schou explains. \"If you have big balls, you have good sperm.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398756717\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351782011954/Cryos-Denmark-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cryos, Denmark\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filling a shipping box with sperm samples. Photograph: Mads Nissen/Panos</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mads Nissen/Panos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freezing agent is added to the sperm to dehydrate it, before it is sucked into a straw; a&#xa0;single donation can produce anything from one to 20 straws, but five is typical. The straw is then labelled and heat-sealed before being frozen in a&#xa0;vapour of liquid nitrogen and, finally, deposited in a large grey metal tank of liquid nitrogen where it is stored at a temperature of -196C (-320F). Schou slowly lifts the lid from one of the tanks. He tells me they have around 130,000 sperm samples. In the room next to the tanks stands a pile of metal containers, holding sperm ready to be sent to fertility clinics in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Pakistan and Britain.</p> <p>It was one such straw of sperm from Cryos that gave Mary, from Edinburgh, the chance to have a&#xa0;baby. The 32-year-old teacher had been trying to get pregnant for six months. Tests revealed there was an issue with her husband's sperm and the couple decided to contact their local fertility clinic. But, she discovered, \"British sperm was not readily available. There just wasn't enough choice.\"</p> <p>According to Dr Richard Fleming, the fertility specialist who treated Mary, this is due to changes to the British law on anonymity. \"In 2000, the government decided to start a database of sperm donors and that led to a dramatic decline,\" he says. \"Then in 2005 came the loss of anonymity for donors, meaning that children had the right to contact their donor father when they reached 18. Those two changes stopped men coming.\"</p> <p>Faced with a lack of domestic sperm and unwilling to enter the potential minefield of asking a friend to donate, Mary and her husband decided to use Cryos. They began searching on the company's website for the right donor. The price of sperm ranges from around \u00a330 to \u00a3350<em> </em>a&#xa0;vial, depending on whether the donor is anonymous, on whether they have provided an extended profile and on the quality of the sperm.</p> <p>Donors can include basic details of height and weight alongside baby photographs, an extended personality profile and even recorded messages, where they explain why they have chosen to donate. \"It felt like shopping on Amazon,\" Mary says. In the end, she decided on gut instinct. \"We chose the donor and clicked to place the sperm in a cart. Once payment was made, we were told it was being flown to our clinic.\" That was five years ago. Today Mary is the mother of two girls \u2013 both from the same donor \u2013 and only her immediate family know the truth. \"It's hilarious \u2013 almost every day we are told one of our daughters is the spit of her dad. I guess people see what they want to see.\" One day, Mary plans to tell her girls the full story: \"Evidence suggests that donor-conceived children do best when told from an early age.\"</p> <p>\"If I can help someone to achieve their dream of having children, then I would like to do it,\" says Kristian, a 25-year-old engineering student from the north of Denmark who has been donating sperm once a week for two years. \"I believe in karma, and I come from a broken home. I think if you have considered having a child enough that you're contemplating insemination, then you have put more thought into it than most parents.\"</p> <p>Unlike Britain, Denmark allows anonymous donation and \u2013 as with around three-quarters of Cryos's donors \u2013 Kristian is anonymous; any children he has will have no way of being able to identify him as their biological father. With non-anonymous donors, the woman receiving the sperm will not know the identity of the donor, but any child would, at the age of 18, have the right to find it out. A British woman who imports sperm from Cryos has to choose a&#xa0;non-anonymous donor, as the donation would be subject to the regulations of the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, but if she chose to travel to Denmark, she could opt for an anonymous donor. The possibility of anonymity is one of the reasons Denmark attracts so many donors, Schou believes, and why its sperm is so popular around the world. \"Also, we are a pretty liberal country,\" he says. \"We don't have many religious complications and we are not so stressed by sex, but also we are a small country and so we are used to thinking about each other's welfare.\"</p> <p>It doesn't hurt that so many of the Danish donors are tall, fit, athletic young men. Lucas, 19, is blond-haired and blue-eyed, with a square jaw and wide smile that makes him look like a young Matt Damon. He plays football and lifts weights when not studying law. Lucas donates once a week and has given an extended profile online with childhood photographs and a statement about why he has chosen to donate. \"I would be happy if any baby that is mine contacted me when they were 18,\" he says, \"because by then I would be 40.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398756718\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351782381691/Sperm-donor-Pierre-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sperm donor Pierre\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sperm donor Pierre: \u2018It\u2019s a way of helping people, like giving an organ when you are dead.\u2019 Photograph: Sarfraz Manzoor for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarfraz Manzoor for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all donors are so relaxed about the prospect of meeting their children. Pierre is a 21-year-old student in European studies. He was born in France but is now living in Aarhus and has been donating sperm three times a week for the past month. \"It's a way of helping people, like giving an organ when you are dead, and I also make some money,\" he says. He is an anonymous donor who has given information only about weight, hair and eye colour: \"I want to be of help but I don't want people to buy some part of me.\" It was his girlfriend who suggested the sperm clinic to Pierre and, after our conversation, I spot him trying to persuade the lab technicians to allow her into the cabin with him next time. The request is firmly declined.</p> <p>Simon, 24, has receding sandy hair and a&#xa0;goatee. \"I moved to Aarhus four years ago and I&#xa0;couldn't find a job,\" he says. \"I didn't have any money, but I had an apartment I couldn't afford and that was how I came to be a donor.\" Simon would sometimes visit Cryos five days a week, but he has now cut it down to twice-weekly. \"It's such a weird experience,\" he says. \"You go in and everyone knows exactly what you are doing.\" Simon earns around 2000 kroner a month and he uses the money to buy treats such as an Xbox. The average donor at Cryos can assume he has fathered 25 children, but Simon is likely to have more than 100 offspring. \"The only time I&#xa0;think about it is when I worry that my anonymity will be taken away,\" he says. \"If politicians changed the law, suddenly all these children would be streaming to my door, wanting their father back. That would be horrible.\" He adds: \"My parents don't know I do this. My mother would find it hard to know she had grandchildren she would never meet \u2013 that would upset her.\"</p> <p>The more I talk to donors, the more I am struck by the disparity between these young, mostly single men and the women they help. When Cryos began, in 1987, their clients were mostly women like Mary \u2013 whose husbands had fertility issues \u2013 and men who had been diagnosed with cancer and wanted to store their sperm before it was damaged by chemotherapy. \"The profile has changed dramatically over the past few decades,\" Schou says. \"The women are getting older, and during the past few years we have seen two new types of client: lesbian couples and single females. Forty per cent of demand is now coming from single women. These are highly educated, economically successful women who have focused on their career but now the biological clock is ticking and they have to do something.\"</p> <p>At 41, Ellie was single and felt she was running out of time. She didn't have any single male friends she felt comfortable asking for sperm and she didn't want to take the risk of having a&#xa0;one-night stand. Ellie bought three vials of sperm from the Cryos website, delivered to a clinic in London where the insemination took place. Ellie now has a daughter and is already thinking of having another baby by the same donor. Everyone except her direct family and very close friends believes the child is the product of a&#xa0;relationship that did not work out. \"I'm grateful to the sperm donor, but he isn't really a person to me,\" she says. \"I have no concept of who he is or even if my daughter looks like him. If I could say one thing to him, I would say thank you.\"</p> <p>Schou, now 58, has a new dream. Cryos currently has the office in Aarhus, three sperm collection centres in Denmark and a small presence in New York. The new phase of the Viking invasion will see Cryos going international. \"The trouble with Danish sperm is that there is very little diversity,\" Schou says. \"The donors are almost all white and blond with blue eyes. If we want to help women in different parts of the world, we need to be able to access non-Danish sperm.\"</p> <p>Schou wants to set up sperm banks in Spain, South Africa and India. It is a grand and potentially lucrative vision, but at its heart it is the same dream Schou had 25 years ago when he started Cryos. \"In the end,\" he says, \"I am simply the middleman, between the young men who want to donate sperm here and the women out there who want to have babies.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>The culprits smuggled themselves into Alison Burt's home, hidden ingeniously in a piano. By the time she finally tracked down the source of the infiltration, it was too late: she had already torn up the carpet and been forced to throw out some clothes. \"Who'd have known you had to fumigate the damned piano?\" she says, exasperated.</p> <p>It is the felt wrapped around a piano's hammers that produces its distinctive sound, and to <em>Tineola bisselliella</em> \u2013 the pale gold, papery smudges otherwise known as clothes moths \u2013 felt is a veritable feast. Although not quite enough of a feast to stop them raiding the wardrobes, too, says Burt, a lawyer from London: \"They do prefer Cos to Uniqlo \u2013 that's been proved over and over again in my drawers. They like the good stuff.\"</p> <p>The final straw came when she suffered a second invasion, of tiny tropical ants. These turned out to have sneaked back to Britain via a&#xa0;neighbour's exotic holiday in the Dominican Republic. \"I just felt like going out to camp in the middle of the road and saying, 'Wildlife, it's all yours',\" Burt says.</p> <p>There is a grim war of attrition being waged in the nation's domestic nooks and crannies, and it's far from clear who is winning. Local authority pest controllers dished out a staggering 715,297 treatments for various infestations in 2010-2011, and that's not counting over-the-counter sales of nit shampoos and mothballs, or discreet calls to private exterminators. Rats and mice were the biggest problem, according to the <a href=\"http://www.bpca.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Pest Control Association</a> (BPCA) survey, with demand surging this year after widespread flooding flushed more rats out of sewers and riverbanks. And there were 167,000 call-outs for wasps and 35,000 treatments for moths, beetles, flies and fleas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahVine\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, wife of the education secretary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>, tweeted recently about being overrun by ants, while Downing Street famously acquired Larry the cat to see off the mice endemic in Whitehall. Even Madonna once informed a&#xa0;chatshow audience that \"there's some headlice going around in my house\": never let it be said she's not still busting the taboos that matter.</p> <p>For there's something about infestation that sends an instinctive shudder down the spine. It goes beyond the natural yuck factor of things that scuttle and crawl, or the primal fear of contamination and disease. Being held hostage by something you could squash between finger and thumb (if only you could catch the beggar) somehow reminds us what a puny species we are.</p> <p>Pests taunt us with the knowledge that for all our posh kitchens, we haven't moved so far from the cave: they represent the nameless wild things out there, barely kept at bay. No wonder plagues in the Bible are so closely entwined with shame. But the irony is that, in so many ways, the story of pests' success is also the story of our own.</p> <p>For a man whose life's work has been destroying them, Richard Moseley is commendably fair-minded about vermin. \"I've a grudging respect for pests,\" he says. \"I'm impressed by their ingenuity.\"</p> <p>Moseley has a desk job now, as technical manager of the BPCA, which represents private exterminators, but his old specialism was what's known in the trade as stored product insects: the tiny weevils and beetles that plague food factories, holing up in flour sacks and smuggling themselves inside machinery, occasionally achieving tabloid fame by being discovered dead in tins of beans.</p> <p>\"The complexity of working out just where, in a&#xa0;factory the size of a small town, these insects less than 3mm long are hiding, breaking down the machinery, tracing production lines to see where they come in and where they go out \u2013 I used to enjoy that,\" Moseley says. \"Whatever the species, a pest is a supreme survivor in its chosen field. The battle is to try to beat the pest at its own game.\"</p> <p>But it's also to realise their game is ours, too. What has allowed pests to flourish alongside us for so long is their ability to cling, sometimes literally, to our coat-tails; and it's our 21st-century lifestyle of material plenty that provides an unprecedented supply of crumbs from the master's table.</p> <p>Modern homes are heated to positively balmy temperatures, compared with the icy conditions of the average character-building 1970s childhood, which is why woodworm is now so rare: central heating dries out the timbers too much. But the downside of warmth is that the moth larvae that lurk in wardrobes no longer die off over winter. And when they hatch, we guarantee them rich pickings.</p> <p>We've come a long way from the polyester that moths can't digest: modern tastes are for their favourite animal-based fibres \u2013 wool and tweed, leather and cashmere. Some of us even stuff our cavity walls with insulation made of admirably green, but potentially moth-friendly, lambswool.</p> <p>We jet off on foreign holidays and business trips, blissfully unaware of the bedbugs hitching home in our suitcases. Our cupboards overflow with ant-friendly foodstuffs and we snack any time and anywhere, dropping high-calorie junk food on the street, then wondering why those streets teem with urban foxes. And quietly, constantly, our pest companions are evolving to exploit us.</p> <p>Moseley says he's now coming across mice that are not just wise to traps \u2013 a learned behaviour, passed down through generations \u2013 but won't touch the bait used in traditional insecticides, either. The problem is the bait is based on grain, as that's what rodents are supposed to eat \u2013 but sophisticated urban mice have moved on from all that: \"If they're living in an area with a lot of fast food shops, they will start to feed on things like proteins and will develop over time to prefer the new kind of food.\" The only hope, presumably, is that they'll grow as fat and listless on an exclusive diet of half-eaten cheeseburgers as we do.</p> <p>But town mice with fancy appetites aren't the only chink in our defensive armour. Resistance to commonly used pesticides is growing among rats and with many councils either raising charges for pest control or scrapping it due to spending cuts, it's likely more of us will try to tackle common infestations ourselves. The fear is that amateurish, half-successful attempts to handle outbreaks may create precisely the conditions for resistance to flourish \u2013 and nowhere is that more obvious than in the tale of every parent's bete noire, the headlouse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398757724\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769779016/Mouse-006.jpg\" alt=\"Mouse\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Sophisticated urban mice are not just wise to traps, but now feed on fast food rather than the grain used in bait .'

Her 10-year-old daughter Isobel has suffered outbreaks since infant school. \"I didn't realise how down I felt about it,\" says Julia, a beauty therapist from Aylesbury. Isobel had also started to feel self-conscious. \"She was worried. She was saying, 'What if a teacher sees one? What if my friends don't want to play with me?'\"</p> <p>Infested children are no longer routinely sent home from school \u2013 with about 15% suffering at any one time, it would be madly disruptive \u2013 but playground etiquette surrounding nits remains a&#xa0;social minefield. If you spot some on a child, do you tactfully tell the parents? Should you cancel playdates when yours has an outbreak, or stop them playing with a child who's infected?</p> <p>Julia tried to warn her daughter to limit close contact when she was infested, but says it's hard. \"She's always been an affectionate girl, she hugs her friends and she'll wrap her arms around them if they're worried. I said, 'Isobel, you might not want to do that until it's died down' but she said, 'You're asking me not to be close to my friends.'\"</p> <p>Headlice are a problem as old as humanity itself. Archaeologists have dug up nit combs carved from wood, bone and ivory dating as far back as 1500BC, while two specific strains of <em>Pediculus humanus </em>can be traced back more than a million years.</p> <p>What makes them so stubbornly successful is the speed of their life cycle: newly-laid eggs hatch within 10 days and a female louse can be ready to lay her own eggs at a precocious seven days old. Nits can't fly or jump, but small children \u2013 sociable, tactile, constantly tumbling over each other \u2013 are a perfect source of the close contact they need to spread from head to head. Which is why it's estimated that more than a third of primary schoolchildren will get them in a year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Having tried everything else, Julia eventually sent her daughter to <a href=\"http://www.thehairforce.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Hairforce</a>, nit-busters to the London middle classes. For \u00a3150 a go, the firm claims to delouse the most heavily infested offspring, using a special vacuum cleaner to suck lice out of the hair, followed by a heat treatment to shrivel the eggs, then a thorough combing, while the child watches DVDs from the comfort of a massage chair. For the publicity-shy, discreet home visits in an unmarked car can be arranged.</p> <p>That anyone would pay so much to get rid of nits seems staggering, but many clients are busy working mothers who don't want to spend their evenings combing \u2013 and founder Dee Wright says most have repeatedly tried and failed to treat it themselves. \"Everyone who comes to us has tried everything. We see some kids who have had nits for two, three, even six years, or their whole school lives. They may be bullied, they're not feeling that great.\" Besides, she says, parents already spend a&#xa0;small fortune on specialist combs or shampoos, because pest control is a big, booming business.</p> <p>The headlice industry in the UK is estimated to be worth \u00a333m, yet the grumbling refrain at every school gate is that too many of the lotions and potions don't work. Although in some cases the failure can be blamed on bad combing technique or not persevering long enough to get all the eggs out, Wright feels many parents are shelling out for products \"that don't do what they say on the tin\". And while she has every reason to be sniffy about the competition, official <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Head-lice/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">NHS</a> advice is that the older pesticides used in some products may be losing their effectiveness against nits (though they say resistance should be less of a problem with the new generation of silicone-based treatments).</p> <p>So perhaps it's no wonder there is a move afoot back towards natural remedies and good old elbow grease. There is talk now in playgrounds about teatree oil, despite the lack of hard evidence that it works, and nostalgia for the days of the school nit nurse. One survey by Netmums found 88% of parents wanted this annual humiliation reintroduced, even though many public health experts argue that it was phased out because it wasn't terribly effective, rather than to spare children's feelings. One inspection a year, at an estimated cost of \u00a3100m, isn't enough to get on top of the problem, though some schools are now responding to pressure from parents by instigating \"bug busting\" months where children are checked and parents exhorted to comb regularly.</p> <p>Wright, meanwhile, says old-fashioned prevention beats cure: girls with long hair should tie it back for school, and parents should do a&#xa0;weekly comb to catch invaders early. Sleepovers are also notorious hotspots, so if your children share beds with friends, get them to top and tail rather than sharing a pillow \u2013 and check for nits the next day. It may be mind-numbingly tedious and the source of many a bedtime row, but the cheapest solution \u2013 going through wet hair with a&#xa0;nit comb, a generous dollop of conditioner and a&#xa0;beady eye \u2013 is still one of the most effective.</p> <p>Many moth sufferers also swear by old-fashioned deterrents such as cedarwood and lavender oil, conkers in drawers or vigorous housekeeping.</p> <p>Helen Richardson-Foster, a PhD student from Hebden Bridge, discovered she had a problem when she opened a bag of old baby clothes she was saving for a friend and found the tiny hand-knitted cardigans were speckled with holes. A&#xa0;blitz involving hot-washing most of the family's clothes and giving the rest a blast in the freezer (which kills the larvae) seems to have cleared them out of her wardrobes, but they're now attacking the carpets. She uses a mixture of moth spray, vacuuming and laying pheremone traps \u2013 adhesive strips of paper impregnated with a substance mimicking the scent of female moths, which draw the male to its sticky doom. \"It's just damage limitation,\" she says, resignedly. \"It's about keeping your stuff washed and moving it around \u2013 and I'll happily swat them whenever I see them.\"</p> <p>The homespun approach has its limits, admittedly. When ants invaded my own kitchen two summers ago, a quick Google search suggested cinnamon was the answer: apparently, they hate the smell and won't cross a barrier of it.</p> <p>It seemed safer than putting down poison under the nose of our greedy dog, so I scattered some experimentally across the ants' preferred route. Sure enough, they marched up to the little pile of spice, skidded to a halt, weaved around in outraged circles for a while, then staggered away.&#xa0;</p> <p>The house smelled as fragrant as a gingerbread factory, and a smug feeling of living in harmony with nature ensued \u2013 until the morning the fruit bowl was heaving with tiny bodies, presumably from a cinnamon-resistant superstrain. The trouble with low-tech methods is they don't always work.</p> <p>Then again, when we were invaded this summer by a swarm of mosquitoes that had been breeding in the floodwaters, the answer turned out to be the therapeutic use of a rolled-up newspaper. So hard luck, if you're reading this on an iPad: prepare to welcome your new insect overlords.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I recently parked at a Roadchef services on the M1 for three hours without realising there was a fee if you park for longer than two. As a result, I have received a \"charge notice\" from a company called CP Plus which, I believe, manages the parking, demanding \u00a390, reduced to \u00a350 if I pay within 14 days. I checked the Roadchef website which confirmed there is a charge and a \"penalty\" if you stay beyond two hours.</strong></p> <p><strong>There is no facility to \"pay and display\". Motorists have to either pay by phone, or pay at the WH Smith store at the service station. How many people actually notice they are expected to pay if they stay for more than two hours, I wonder?</strong></p> <p><strong>After a bit of research on the internet I've discovered that parking at motorway service stations is not the same as using a public car park. Under normal contract law I understand that any attempt to impose a penalty is not enforceable and that a term in a contract which tries to impose a penalty can only work if it is a reasonable estimate of potential loss.</strong></p> <p><strong>As the charge for parking is \u00a310, that is Roadchef's loss and anything over and above that amount is a penalty and therefore not enforceable.

There is a very good website on this subject, <a href=\"http://www.appealnow.com/\" title=\"AppealNow website\">AppealNow.com</a>, set up by Barrie Segal who has been described as the UK's leading parking ticket expert. If you get a ticket from a private firm \u2013 rather than the local authority \u2013 then take a look at his site. He suggests doing exactly what you have done. If CP Plus, Roadchef's parking firm, wants to take up this matter it will have to sue you in the courts and win in order to get you to pay up.</p> <p>Segal's site says that in the past, where the car parking company has won the courts have cut down the award to such small sums it is rarely worth going to court.</p> <p>Your stay happened in the wee hours, so it is highly unlikely that Roadchef could argue it had lost more than the \u00a310, and, as such, it seems unlikely it will take you to court for such a trivial sum. Roadchef declined to discuss your ticket or the validity of pursuing its customers for penalty amounts.</p> <p>In a statement it said: \"At all Roadchef sites we offer free parking for two hours and after this time a standard charge for those who would like to stay longer.

  "<p>Betty, Earl and Joyce, the elderly puppets in Wonga.com's beguiling television adverts, promise \"straight talking money\". But what they don't tell viewers is that short-term loans are available for a tiny fraction of Wonga's 4,214% rate - and to people who have been turned down by their bank.</p> <p>London Mutual<strong> </strong>Credit Union is leading a drive by the not-for-profit sector to take on the payday loan pushers. It is offering one-to-three month loans, at <a href=\"http://www.cuok.co.uk/\" title=\"\">CUOK!</a>, at an interest rate of 26.8% and, crucially, is promising instant cash. It says borrowers can obtain \"cash when you need it quickly\" with payday loans in 15 minutes.</p> <p>Compared to Wonga.com, the savings are staggering. London Mutual charges \u00a38 interest on a 30-day loan of \u00a3400 while Wonga charges \u00a3125.48 interest and fees. What's more, London Mutual imposes no add-on penalties for late payment, just the interest, which on \u00a3400 is just 27p a day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398734273\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351852236963/Credit-Unions-table-001.jpg\" alt=\"Credit Unions table\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Credit Unions table Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what's the catch? Unfortunately there is a rather large one \u2013 it's only open to people who live or work within the London Mutual catchment area, which covers the boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Westminster. Nonetheless, that's still 1.2 million people. Like Wonga, London Mutual will run a credit check on an applicant, and, like Wonga, may turn down those with a very poor record. It also charges a membership joining fee of \u00a32.</p> <p>London Mutual chief executive Lucky Chandrasekera says it has already completed 1,500 payday loans, and will be gearing up to offer many more from December. \"We started offering them after seeing, on the bank statements of people applying for our longer-term loans, huge payments going to the payday loan companies.\"</p> <p>Local councils now include information about the cheap payday loans in rent statements to tenants, plus the credit union works with local employers, such as the London Ambulance Service, to promote its deals. \"It's not just people on very low incomes who apply. We've seen people on \u00a340,000 or even \u00a350,000 a year who apply,\" says Chandrasekera.</p> <p>What about borrowers outside London Mutual's area? There are 400 credit unions in Britain, with more than \u00a3600m out on loan, compared to \u00a3450m three years ago. Loans of just 30 days are still unusual, but those over six months to one year are plentiful. Note that many will ask that you become a member first and save for around three months before they will consider granting a loan.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.glasgowcu.com/content.asp?section=78\" title=\"\">Glasgow<strong> </strong>Credit Union</a> promises \"fast easy access to money \u2013 just when you need it\" with a rate of just 14.9% on sums from \u00a3500 to \u00a33,000. Borrowers agree a credit limit, and are then free to draw down the money when they need it, from \u00a3100 upwards. It is the largest and most successful in the UK, and even offers mortgages to those with just a 5% deposit.</p> <p>Head of operations Paul McFarlane says only 15% of applications are declined, and when the sums are in the hundreds, rather than the thousands, the decline rate is negligible.</p> <p>But like other credit unions, it is restricted by its \"common bond\" - only the 1.5 million residents or workers in Glasgow can apply - and you have to save first with the union. However, its instant access cash Isa rate of 4% is the best on offer in the UK. \"People are often put off by credit unions, thinking of them as the poor man's bank.

  "<p>There's a new add-on for Gmail called <a href=\"http://inboxpause.com/\" title=\"\">Inbox Pause</a>, which does something utterly simple \u2013 it adds a&#xa0;pause button to your inbox \u2013 but represents, I&#xa0;think, a new phase in our long war against information overload. Consider the absurdity. Inbox Pause doesn't reduce the quantity of emails that bombard you. Nor does it help you answer them faster. In any case, there's already a&#xa0;perfectly good way to \"pause\" your email: just don't check your damn email for a few hours. Or just resist the temptation to open new ones. But we're too weak-willed for that: instead we need a button that tricks us into thinking we're controlling the deluge. In short, Inbox Pause is an innovation for which there's no rational need, which treats its users like impulsive toddlers.

Unless you're willing to be radical \u2013 to give up the internet completely, say \u2013 the recommended cures don't work. Resolve to check your email twice daily, and you'll find many more messages waiting when you do. Go on an <a href=\"http://www.informationdiet.com/\" title=\"\">\"information diet\"</a>, and it's likely to end like any other diet: you'll succumb and consume the bad stuff, with extra guilt. So maybe we need to reframe things. The real problem isn't too much information: it's the feeling of being out of control. Why not focus, then, on finding ways to feel more in control \u2013 even if that's based, in part, on self-deception?</p> <p>When Google launched <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/priority-inbox.html\" title=\"\">Priority Inbox</a>, which sifts email into \"important\" and \"everything else\", I&#xa0;was sceptical: prioritisation systems mainly involve pointlessly reordering your to-do list. But friends who swear by it don't really use it to prioritise: they use it as a guiltless way to ignore the non-important emails entirely, and thus feel more in command. The Boomerang app, for <a href=\"http://www.boomeranggmail.com/\" title=\"\">Gmail</a> and <a href=\"http://www.baydin.com/boomerang/\" title=\"\">Outlook</a>, lets you fling emails away, then have them redelivered later; while they're gone, things are calmer, even though your email burden hasn't changed. I do something similarly delusional with&#xa0;the hundreds of web pages I&#xa0;bookmark for later reading. These used to exert a subtle, anxiety-inducing tug on me. Now I capture a&#xa0;page in <a href=\"http://evernote.com/\" title=\"\">the note-taking application Evernote</a>, label it with the tag \"to read\" and file it away. Frequently, I&#xa0;never read it. But it works: the information feels tamed. The tug is gone. I'm in control, so I'm happy.</p> <p>This is irrational, but then the whole idea of getting stressed by information is suffused with irrationality. There are millions of information sources we could, in theory, keep up with, but only a&#xa0;few&#xa0;that we tell ourselves we must \u2013 and the distinction's pretty arbitrary. I try to answer all personal&#xa0;emails, but I don't worry about answering all personal Twitter messages. The pile of books-to-be-read on my desk glowers at me, but I&#xa0;never feel anxious about the vast amounts of reading matter waiting, undiscovered, on the web. So why not fight irrationality with irrationality? Worry less about reducing the information tide. Look instead for ways to reduce its stressfulness \u2013 and if that means fooling yourself with pause buttons, boomerangs and the like\u2026 who cares?

  "<p>Even now the low white house comes as a shock as you approach it, defiantly purist in a bourgeois suburb of the Czech city of Brno. <a href=\"http://www.tugendhat.eu/en/\" title=\"\">Villa Tugendhat</a>, designed in 1928 by \"less is more\" architect <a href=\"http://www.miessociety.org/\" title=\"\">Mies van der Rohe</a>, is one of the great buildings of European modernism, rigorous but also subtle, flexible, poetic. Admirers of <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/books/simon-mawer\" title=\"\">Simon Mawer</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781408700778/the-glass-room\" title=\"\"><em>The Glass Room</em></a>, a strong contender for the Man Booker prize in 2009, will recognise the Tugendhat as the original of the Landauer House in this rare example of an architectural novel. The Tugendhat house is now open to the public, faithfully restored to Mies's original intentions after seven decades of extreme vicissitudes.</p> <p>\"I truly longed for a modern spacious house with clear and simple shapes.\" The initiative for the commission came from the strong-minded Grete Tugendhat whose father, a wealthy local Jewish industrialist, had given his daughter on her marriage a spectacular building site set on the high ground adjoining his own property, with vistas over to the fortress castle and ancient cathedral of Brno.</p> <p>There were modernist architects in Brno itself, birthplace of Adolf Loos and a progressive city in the 1920s when its avant-garde culture rivalled that of Prague. But Tugendhat decided to look further afield to Berlin, finding in Mies the architect who shared her vision of untrammelled living in expansive \"spiritual\" spaces. As he put it in a later interview in London: \"I would not like to live in a cubical house with a lot of small rooms. I would rather live on a bench in Hyde Park.\"</p> <p>The strange and special atmosphere of Villa Tugendhat cannot be fully grasped from photographs. This is a building to be walked through. Mies's juxtapositions of spaces and materials from high luxe to industrial have to be experienced at first hand. This is a villa that goes way beyond the standard mid-20th century rational and functional. Readers will remember how Mawer describes the hallucinatory glass space the architect evolved:</p> <p>Space, light, glass; some spare furniture; windows looking out on a garden; a sweep of shining floor, travertine, perhaps; white and ivory and the gleam of chrome. The elements moved, evolved, transformed, metamorphosed in the way that they do in dreams, changing shape and form and yet, to the dreamer, remaining what they always were.</p> <p>At the time he was designing Villa Tugendhat, Mies was also working on his famous Barcelona Pavilion for the International Exposition of 1929. He was developing his concept of free and open planning, architecture without walls. Villa Tugendhat is the very first example of the use of a steel structure for a family home. Seen from the street the building tells you little. Being sited on a slope, only the villa's upper bedroom floor is immediately visible. But once into the hallway, with its milky, glazed curved wall, outsize palisander veneer door, tall steel columns and Italian travertine floor, you begin to grasp the building's complex ambiguity.</p> <p>Villa Tugendhat is in fact a three-layer building. You descend the spiral staircase into a vast space which is sitting room and music room and dining room and library, with a glass-walled conservatory beyond, a winter garden connecting to the garden outside. Tugendhat loved to view the Brno city snowscape from her well\u2013heated inner greenhouse with its pool that reportedly contained live fish.</p> <p>Down again, and you arrive in a subterranean area, powerhouse for the sophisticated air controlling system and a unique mechanism that allowed the windows in the living area to be retracted into the floor, as if by magic. The ultimate luxury was the <em>Mottenkammer</em>, moth-resistant storage room for the Tugendhat fur coats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398630643\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/31/1351697936767/Tugendhat-Villa-Brno-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tugendhat Villa, Brno\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The onyx wall, which features in <em>The Glass Room</em>. Photograph: Stillman Rogers /Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stillman Rogers /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mies had originally trained as a stonemason. His search for building materials for the Tugendhat's villa became a perfectionist quest. In the Atlas mountains in Morocco he located a superb block of browny-gold onyx which he earmarked to make a dividing&#xa0;wall for the living area, supervising&#xa0;the cutting and finishing himself. This is the translucent wall Mawer's readers will recall glowing a sudden startling red as the setting sun penetrates the stonework, on the evening when Stahl and Hana H\u00e1nakov\u00e1 copulate on the \"unforgiving floor of the Glass Room\".</p> <p>Mies was a formidable philosopher architect, imbued with a belief in architecture as a moral question of truthfulness. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes\" title=\"\">Robert Hughes</a>, the late at critic, saw Mies's great importance in his period as bringing his individual buildings \"closer to the status of a pure Idea than any 20th-century architect had yet done\".</p> <p>But pure ideas came at a cost, and contemporary criticism of the villa questioned not only what was seen as its doctrinaire aesthetics (\"Can One Live in Villa Tugendhat?\" was the subject of one magazine article) but also the lavish level of expenditure. The villa cost 5m Czech crowns, enough to build many thousand workers' houses. Prague artistic activist Karel Teige called it \"modernist snobbery\", denouncing Villa Tugendhat as a revival of \"the spirit of fancy baroque palaces, the seat of a new financial aristocracy\".</p> <p>Over the next decade the building became vulnerable. It was so obviously the expression of a certain ultra-discriminating Jewish taste, the \"degenerate art\" the Nazis were reviling. As the political situation worsened, the Tugendhats made plans to leave the country. Grete and her children abandoned the villa in May 1938, just after the Anschluss in Austria. A few weeks later her husband followed them to Switzerland, managing to bring with him just a few pieces of furniture. The family moved again to Caracas in Venezuela in 1941.</p> <p>By now Villa Tugendhat, as a Jewish property, had been confiscated by the Gestapo. It soon became the property of the German reich. For an account of its dire condition at that time we are dependent on a soldier of the German occupying forces, Louis Schoberth, who had trained as an architect. His arrival in Brno and his instant recognition of the stark white Mies van der Rohe building on the hillside, is in its way much stranger than anything in Mawer's fiction. The house was already in a state of dereliction. The semi-circular Macassar ebony screen which had formed the dining alcove had been removed to be re-erected in Gestapo headquarters. The translucent onyx wall had been promised to a cemetery mason. Villa Tugendhat was in danger of total demolition.</p> <p>Its survival against so many odds has been astonishing. In 1942 the house was rented out as offices of the Messerschmidt airplane works which had moved to Brno out of reach of allied air raids. Willy Messerschmidt had his own apartment in the villa. In April 1945 the red army of Marshal Malinkovsky liberated Brno and a Russian cavalry unit stabled its horses in Villa Tugendhat where the horses' hooves did considerable damage to the once-immaculate white linoleum floor. Remaining furniture was used for firewood. Russian bombardments shattered the great glass walls.</p> <p>After the war the house was taken over by a private dance school and then used as a Czechoslovak state rehabilitation centre for children with spine defects. The living room became a gymnasium. By 1967, when Tugendhat returned on a visit to Brno, the house she had commissioned almost 40years before was virtually unrecognisable.</p> <p>It has only very gradually arrived at its present high level of restoration. The first attempt at renewal and reconstruction carried out in the years 1981 to 1985, when Brno was still in communist hands, was a half-hearted affair. After the Czechoslovak velvet revolution in November 1989 the villa became an official government hospitality building. Negotiations over the separation of Czechoslovakia actually took place in Villa Tugendhat in August&#xa0;1992.</p> <p>Through the 90s attitudes began to change. In 1995 Mies's building was declared a National Cultural Monument. It was registered on the Unesco list of world cultural heritage sites in 2001. The \u00a35m restoration of the villa has been largely financed from EU funds, with enormous extra input in terms of expert architectural research and local ingenuity. Only last year the original Macassar ebony curved screen, looted by the Nazis, was rediscovered in a university law faculty canteen.</p> <p>It is these precise layerings of history and memory that Mawer handles brilliantly in <em>The Glass Room</em>. But in Brno itself the novel is not lauded. Tugendhat descendants forbid it to be mentioned in public discussions of the restoration. There is no reference to Mawer in the guidebook to the villa. On my recent visit to Brno a city official, while admitting he had not even read it, referred to <em>The Glass Room</em> as \"probably pornography\".</p> <p>Such hostility is puzzling. The Landauers are quite evidently not the Tugendhats. The fictional nanny, who has a long intense affair with Mr Laundauer, bears little resemblance to the Tugendhat's governess, Irene Kalkofen, who left Brno to live blamelessly in London from 1938 until her death in 2004. Fiction is not fact, but it can amplify reality. Viewing Villa Tugendhat having read Mawer's novel is a doubly unforgettable experience.</p>",
  "<p>About a third of the way through his riveting but worryingly partial narrative, Andrew Adonis declares that his political intention is \"not to bury comprehensive education but to save it\". Really? One could easily be forgiven for missing this as the defining thrust of the book's argument. The former New Labour education guru is consistently dismissive of most aspects of the egalitarian revolution he claims to remake, while lavishing praise on all things privileged, powerful and private: looking ultimately to Them, not Us, to reform England's schools.</p> <p>Yet Adonis, a man of conviction and wide establishment reach, makes a serious pitch that deserves proper scrutiny. For all its wrong turnings, the sponsored academy programme of the New Labour years showed what impact government can have when it chooses to direct resources, administrative determination and aesthetic beauty into some of our poorest areas. (Adonis is amusing about the eccentricities of some of the famous architects brought in to build the new academies.)</p> <p>But it is the less appealing aspects of this legacy that the coalition has latched on to. To remake state education as a form of ersatz elitism \u2013 phoney blazered privilege for all \u2013 rather than a quality project grounded in fairness, is a stroke of twisted anti-genius. The Tories have already signalled their intention to make the academy and free school brand a central part of the party's 2015 pitch \u2013 look out for a free school opening soon at an empty fire or police station near you.</p> <p>Whatever the shape of the future, Adonis is keen both to secure for himself a place in modern administrative history and to be perceived as a figure of continuing relevance as the Gove bandwagon speeds recklessly on. So here we read of our crusader's singular efforts to think out, and push forward, the idea of the \"independent state school\": freed from local authority control in order to flourish under the dynamic branded management of a range of private and public institutions.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all this makes for a limited, contradictory and decidedly unprogressive piece of education history. Little homage is paid to the decades-long struggle to phase out the brutal and divisive 11-plus. And how can one castigate the failure of the \"secondary modern comprehensive\" without some acknowledgement of the continuing impact of selective and private education or national and local under-investment, or the unarguable impact of poverty on the ability of some children to learn? For Adonis, as for Gove, it sometimes seems that the only thing standing between a child on free school meals and a place at King's College, Cambridge, is a militant, clock-watching member of the NUT.</p> <p>But he is delightfully tactful in his descriptions of dealing with a series of Labour secretaries of state, some of whom laboured under the mistaken impression that they were in charge of government education policy. He even gets that cross Gordon Brown on his side! We also get an intriguing glimpse into the fast spreading networks of the socially concerned but hugely powerful entrepreneurs of new Labour/new Tory Britain: a glittering array of influential, titled and rich individuals who have now entered the education field.</p> <p><em>Academies, Academies, Academies</em> would be a more appropriate title for this book. The problem with it, as both history and politics, is what it leaves out. Forget the marked discourtesy to local authorities of the calibre of Hampshire and Tower Hamlets, that do not \"run\" education, Soviet-style, but who oversee, and support, a web of successful schools serving the rural affluent and inner-city poor respectively and with scarcely an academy in sight. Forget the dubious \"freedoms\" handed to academies and free schools around admissions and exclusions (neither of which merit an entry in the book's index) and now curriculum and teacher qualifications, which can release academies and free schools from the imperative of acting fairly and collaboratively, often to the detriment of other schools. Forget, too, the burgeoning financial and political unaccountability of the big academy chains or the sheer impracticability of 20,000 English schools run directly, via individual funding contracts, from Sanctuary Buildings in Westminster. &#xa0;</p> <p>More important is that there is no miracle academy effect. The evidence on the original, sponsored academies is now powerfully contested: the more prosaic truth is that systemic reforms \u2013 from more dynamic heads, improved teaching to inter-school collaborative schemes \u2013 have raised the quality of many state schools over many years. These slow but steady changes are now threatened, not enhanced, by the academy revolution mark two, unleashed by the coalition.</p> <p>It's the same story overseas. From the free schools in Sweden \u2013 anyone heard Gove mention these lately? \u2013 to the charter revolution in the US, more privatisation, increased testing and a narrower curriculum are delivering decidedly mixed results but increasing social and ethnic segregation and inflicting huge collateral damage on publicly funded, publicly accountable education.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398611288\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351682206688/pring-002.jpg\" alt=\"pring\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">pring book</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's interesting, then, to turn to Richard Pring, the distinguished philosopher of education, who offers up a radically different analysis, and alternative, to these knotty questions. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/unclassified/9780415536363/the-life-and-death-of-secondary-education-for-all-was-it-but-a-dream-after-all\" title=\"\"><em>The Life and Death of Secondary Education for All </em>(216pp, Routledge, \u00a324.99)</a> is a contemplative, honest deliberation on how a genuinely comprehensive, locally managed and democratically accountable system could help forge a \"common culture\" in our diverse, fragmented society.</p> <p>He is particularly convincing on the need for more practical education for all, to ensure genuine, deep learning: the importance of&#xa0;bringing a child's experience of the world to the classroom, there to meet \"the best that has been thought and said\", particularly in art, literature, music and drama: creative pursuits now being scaled back in many of our schools. He also persuasively rejects the ghastly language of \"deliverology\" and performance targets that kill off thoughtful teaching.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pring's book may lack a politician-friendly 140-character defining alternative vision. But his conception of an education system that places \"moral seriousness\" at its heart, with a respect for every child, not just the aspirational winners, has enormous appeal in these arid, narrow times. I certainly know whose school I would rather go to.</p> <p>\u2022 An updated edition of Melissa Benn's <em>School Wars: The Battle for Britain's Education</em> will be published by Verso this month.</p>",

  "<p>Ray squats down and inspects the tracks carefully, his rifle held in the crook of one arm. \"These are from yesterday,\" he says, pointing to where the fine dusty edge of the print has been blurred by the breeze. \"It's a big male \u2013 very big. The one we heard roaring just before dawn.\"</p> <p>That was an hour ago. I glance around the silent trees, half expecting to see a big cat staring back at me. Ray gets up and searches the ground nearby. \"Looks like there are two lionesses with him,\" he says.</p> <p>We walk on through the dry forest. At a glance the area looks dead, but closer inspection reveals signs of recovery: green shoots are appearing, the trees are gambling on rain coming soon. Ray leads on for about a mile then stops and inspects another lion print. This time the track is fresh. There is a stiff breeze blowing but the print is perfect. Ray nods and says: \"They were moving around this morning.\" He glances at me. \"Remember the rules. Stay with the gun. Never run.\"</p> <p>I was wondering how I could politely ask: \"Are you a good shot?\" But I knew the answer: all guides in Zimbabwe are great shots. It's part of their training, an apprenticeship that consistently produces top wildlife guides who are supremely competent in those awkward social moments, like a lion charge. In Ray's case, I knew he had spent his life handling such tricky situations, having been born and brought up in this place: Hwange national park. It's a giant of a reserve, 5,400 square miles, bigger than Yorkshire or the state of Massachusetts, but just one element in a vast ecosystem that extends into Botswana, Namibia and southern Angola.</p> <p>We move on again. The bush is thicker and visibility at times down to as little as 10&#xa0;metres. Then we come to a small clearing. \"They slept here,\" whispers Ray. He kneels down by a patch of wet, sandy earth \u2013 lion urine \u2013 and sticks his finger in to take the temperature. \"They are very close.\"</p> <p>He stands and finds the cats' trail leaving the clearing. We follow it. Then&#xa0;we see the dead buffalo, a female&#xa0;lying in the shade of a tree. Its eyes have been pecked out, but it has yet to be disembowelled. Ray touches the carcass.</p> <p>\"Cold.\" He frowns. \"It can't have been killed last night: the birds wouldn't have got to the eyes yet. But if it was the night before last, why have they eaten so little?\"</p> <p>I'm standing, camera at the ready. There are fresh tracks all around us. I feel like I'm watching a chef who is about to whip open the oven door: \"Voila! It's ready!\" All the ingredients in place for a feast of lion-watching \u2013 or maybe just a feast. Who is the masterchef here: is it Ray, or the lion? Three of them against two men and one gun \u2013 which is not with me, thankfully, but I&#xa0;do wish I'd brought something resembling a weapon. Will a&#xa0;Canon EOS 7D camera block up a lion's mouth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762412\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351789047738/Zimbabwe-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"Zimbabwe map\" width=\"460\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zimbabwe map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'd arrived in Zimbabwe expecting surprises and with lots of questions. This was a country that had gone from&#xa0;being the bread basket of southern Africa to a basket case in a few short years. The catalogue of disasters was damning: thousands of villagers in Matabeleland had been slaughtered; white farmers had been terrorised and robbed; thousands of black farmworkers had lost their homes and jobs; the economy had been&#xa0;ruined and much of the population had fled abroad. Now there was talk of a recovery and a tourist influx but in the face of such an indictment, I&#xa0;asked myself, should anyone go to Zimbabwe?</p> <p>No sooner had I arrived than I was asking that same question to everyone I met. The replies were always frank.</p> <p>\"It's different now,\" one man told me. \"We have a power-sharing government. Tourists should definitely come,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When there were no tourists,\" said another, \"I never knew if my family would eat.\"</p> <p>Others honed in on underlying issues. \"How much of your money actually goes to the government? I'll tell you \u2013 just the $55 visa fee.\" And, of course, land redistribution came up: \"It had to be done,\" was a common refrain. \"The British stole it, then sold it to each other and thought that was all fine. But the land seizures \u2026 aish!\"</p> <p>That sound: aish, you hear it a lot in Zimbabwe when words are inadequate. When people talk about the period between the 2002 and 2008 elections, you hear it constantly. This was a time when visitor numbers nosedived. Zimbabwe's market share of African tourism had peaked in the 90s at around 8% but that halved in five years. In Hwange the total number of permanent safari lodges and seasonal camps fell from around 35-40 into single figures.</p> <p>Tour operators in the UK had difficult decisions to make. \"We kept Zimbabwe in our brochures,\" says Chris McIntyre of Expert Africa. \"It was important \u2013 especially for the small, owner-run operations that we'd known for years \u2013 to show them that we wouldn't abandon them in the bad times and that we took our responsibilities to them seriously.\"</p> <p>Out in the country I found that loyalty did not go unnoticed. \"We had so few tourists,\" said one man who had kept his job, \"But those few kept us alive.\" When people say such things, the true significance of a decision to boycott a country sinks in.</p> <p>\"For evil to prevail,\" one black Zimbabwean hotel owner told me, \"it only needs good men to do nothing.\"</p> <p>These people, I thought, see tourism as something with real economic and moral power, something that can have a significant and beneficial effect on Zimbabwe's future.</p> <p>So, I am standing there, an hour after first light, watching Ray dip his finger in a dead buffalo, one that belongs to a lion pride that is undoubtedly only metres away. And I start grinning because I had never asked the question: \"Is Zimbabwe safe?\" And if I had, it would have been with people in mind: angry war vets, baton-wielding police, violent mobs. Any safety threat, I'd imagined, would come charging at me in a uniform, not a sandy yellow fur coat with canines as long as my hand. Why hadn't I thought of that? Because the short-term political world distracts us from the deeper, more eternal questions of the natural order, questions such as: am I about to become a feline breakfast?</p> <p>Ray motions with his rifle and moves off. I follow. It is almost impossible to be silent in these dry leaves but fortunately the lions have left a big dusty trail. We walk in their footprints. Then suddenly Ray is pointing. \"There!\"</p> <p>I catch sight of a lioness's backside, then a few flickers of straw-coloured bodies through the trees. Through one gap, a face pauses momentarily. My gaze connects for an instant with a pair of sombre, yellow eyes, then they are gone. We set off in pursuit, but after a few minutes Ray stops. \"They got spooked. We'll never catch them now.\"</p> <p>I hadn't expected that: the king of the jungle to be afraid of us. But Ray nods. \"Sometimes they will sit, rarely they will charge, but usually they run away.\" It doesn't matter to me. I'm elated. Seeing lions on foot is an adrenaline-charged pleasure even when very brief. We decide to call off our lion hunt and go find some breakfast back at Somalisa Camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762413\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774397239/Somalisa-Camp-Hwange-Zimb-001.jpg\" alt=\"Somalisa Camp, Hwange Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somalisa Camp</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A tented site, Somalisa is built with minimal impact under a bunch of tall acacia trees that spread between two waterholes. At each there is a small pool, not more than three metres across protected by a shallow moat. As the heat of the day fades, elephants come to both. Once there they drop their trunks in, suck up water, and then pour it down their throats. The particular experience here, however, is to slide into the pool and sit quietly in the water, the vast animals looming overhead as the evening comes. After their drink the giants stroll off through the camp \u2013 there is no fence.</p> <p>When Beks Ndlovu, a black, Zimbabwean wildlife guide, started Somalisa in 2006, it was his first venture and also the worst possible time: electoral violence and land seizures had brought economic chaos. By November 2008 basic commodities were doubling in price every hour of the day and the currency was, quite literally, not worth the paper it was printed on.</p> <p>But elections led to a power-sharing government the following February and after that came recognition that the Zimbabwean dollar was dead. No one would accept it any more. The US dollar was declared the main currency. Since then Zimbabwe has been crawling its way back from the edge of the abyss. \"Things are getting better,\" says Ndlovu. \"Our business has grown to eight camps in Zimbabwe and Botswana.\"</p> <p>Next day I find a sign of the growing confidence a few hours' drive away at Camp Hwange, a new operation set up by Dave Carson. In the dark days of hyperinflation, Dave moved his employees out to wildlife camps in Botswana, saving them from a fate that came to many black Zimbabweans: a border run and escape&#xa0;to Johannesburg. Now there is a new semi-circle of six luxury lodges strung around a waterhole that is filled from a&#xa0;borehole.</p> <p>\"Hwange is a very dry area,\" explains Dave. \"The boreholes and pumps were started in the 1930s and without them, the animals could not survive. They'd all have to move away,\" he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774570351/Female-elephant-charges-K-001.jpg\" alt=\"Female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with the extra water, this time at the end of the dry season is a deadly period. Everywhere we see baobab trees that have been gnawed through by hungry elephants, while each waterhole seems to have the carcass of a young animal that didn't survive, always presided over by a committee of vultures. That evening we see long lines of elephants marching towards the waterhole, a few of them running.</p> <p>\"Some come long distances,\" says Dave as we stand by the campfire, just a couple of hundred metres away. \"We don't know what those animals have been through. Some have probably had bad experiences.\" As if to prove him right, the herd is about to throw up an example of one such individual.</p> <p>Our original plan was to walk out to a hide that Dave has built under an African ebony tree next to the water. Unfortunately, we've left it too late and there are so many elephants rushing in that we need to drive. First, we skirt the pan. In the treeline we spot kudu, impala and sable, all waiting for the elephants to finish. The birds have no such qualms: lines of guinea fowl come chuckling along in the dust while the sky is strafed with pigeons. The elephants take long drinks, then chuck themselves in, throwing great splatters of mud over themselves, and us. The air fills with dust and the contented sounds of animals that know they have survived another day.</p> <p>We motor slowly around the back, attempting to reach the hide. One cow elephant is behaving aggressively, rushing at other animals, waving her ears and trunk. The object of her anger, however, always seems to be other females of similar age and size. She doesn't tackle the big males. She doesn't tackle Land Rovers. Dave goes&#xa0;slowly, keeping a respectful distance. \"We'll just see if she'll let us into the hide.\"</p> <p>No sooner are the words out of his mouth than she drops her head and charges. Our forward path is blocked by lines of elephants who are still pouring in towards the water. Dave slams us into reverse, wrenches the wheel around. We shoot back and around. Then for a split second we are motionless. The elephant is six or seven car lengths away and closing fast. Dave bangs the driver's door and shouts at her, but she is determined to show this tin pachyderm who is boss. We speed away. The mad cow stops, shakes her trunk and ears, then looks around, like a playground bully seeking any signs of mockery in the onlookers. There is another smaller cow elephant standing near. She'd seen everything. Maybe she sniggered. Next thing, the mad cow is chasing her off behind the ebony tree.</p> <p>\"Some of theses elephants might not have seen vehicles or even humans before,\" says Carson. \"So we are careful with them.\"</p> <p>Later on, when the skittish female has gone, we climb into the hide \u2013 a pile of protective logs around the bole of the ebony tree. All around are huge elephants and the sounds of water gurgling down large&#xa0;and thirsty throats. The sun dies in a blazing thorn tree behind us. After&#xa0;dark, when all the big animals have gone, I walk back to the lodge with Dave and we talk about tourism and conservation.</p> <p>\"The wildlife rangers do an amazing&#xa0;job keeping Hwange going,\" says Dave, shining his torch up into a tree to reveal an African scops owl. \"But without tourists it would be very&#xa0;vulnerable.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774877882/Mana-Pools-National-Park--001.jpg\" alt=\"Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mana Pools, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s\u2019s leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies.

Without the economic clout that tourism brings, wilderness areas can offer little resistance to pressure from other business interests, notably mining. Mana Pools, a world heritage site and one of the country's leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies interested in its mineral sands, and Hwange itself is bordered by open-cast coal operations that are spilling over into the park. Everywhere wildlife is being called on to justify its existence. Beks Ndlovu puts it like this: \"If it is to survive, wildlife must have a value and tourism provides that. When we say that these areas should be protected and not mined or exploited in any other way that appears economically viable, it is tourism that gives us a powerful argument.\"</p>",
  "<p>Letters arrive by email from two publishers, promising me that things can only get better. Andrew Phillips, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/en\" title=\"\">Penguin India</a>, writes to say that the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-book-publisher\" title=\"\">intended partnership between Penguin and Random House</a> would \"combine the strengths of both companies\" while at the same time maintaining the distinctive character of the imprints that shelter under the umbrella of each. Gail Rebuck, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/random-house\" title=\"\">Random House</a>'s chief executive, hopes I'll be \"excited by the news that we are seeking to combine \u2026 two of the world's leading English-language publishers \u2026 in&#xa0;a new home that continues to foster creativity, where our imprints will continue to enjoy independence, and our&#xa0;publishers and editors the freedom to decide which books to publish and how best to publish them\".</p> <p>Both letters use a favourite publishing word: passionate. Rebuck even refers to the prospective amalgamation as a \"bold, innovative and passionate move\". I don't want to carp; it's very good of these publishers to take the trouble to reassure authors as commercially insignificant as I&#xa0;am. \"Passionate\" looks like an adjective too far, however, to describe a plan that aims to defend traditional trade publishing from digital competition, particularly Amazon's, by cutting the costs of the mechanics \u2013 production, warehousing, shipping, accounting \u2013 and spending more on marketing and publicity. Like many modern restructurings, including those of the NHS and the police, it promises to preserve and even enhance the frontline while letting synergies take their axe to \"back-office\" operations the customer never sees and rarely understands (though, in the case of public institutions, may sorely miss, eventually).</p> <p>The frontline, in the author's case, is the imprint. Every imprint has an editorial director, one or two assistants and at least a share of a marketing person and a PR. They will get the author's book into shape and then try to sell it, and the author may be pleased that his name on the cover is linked with another even more lustrous, such as <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/vintage-publishing/jonathan-cape\" title=\"\">Jonathan Cape</a> or <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/vintage-publishing/chatto-windus\" title=\"\">Chatto &amp; Windus</a>. Readers, however, barely notice the publisher's name. What interests them is subject, author and title. They don't say, \"Oh, I see that's published by <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/about-us/about-us/companies/uk-companies-and-imprints/cornerstone-publishing/william-heinemann\" title=\"\">Heinemann</a>, it must be right up my street\". Big outfits such as Random preserve the names of the smaller publishers they have acquired for other reasons: because the relationship between author and publisher can flourish at this more intimate scale, and because publishing houses don't want to look too monolithic.</p> <p>The names of many dead entrepreneurs survive as a result. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Cape\" title=\"\">Jonathan Cape, the go-ahead book salesman</a> who was lucky or clever enough to hire <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Garnett\" title=\"\">Edward Garnett</a> as his reader and talent-spotter; <a href=\"http://www.marktwainproject.org/biographies/bio_chatto_andrew.html\" title=\"\">Andrew Chatto</a>, who impressed writers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-louis-stevenson\" title=\"\">Robert Louis Stevenson</a> with his straight talk about money; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Hamilton_%28publisher%29\" title=\"\">Hamish Hamilton</a>, who won an Olympic silver in rowing and had impressive social connections that fed a snobbish taste in authorship. It would be hard to say that their book-lists had a noticeable identity. They were just as eclectic as the great family dynasties \u2013 the Routledges, the&#xa0;Longmans, the Collinses and the Macmillans. The Collins family made a fortune from its \"Clear-Type\" bibles and liturgies \u2013 \"Satan trembles when he sees / Bibles sold as cheap as these\" went the sales jingle \u2013 but they also published novelists as various as Winifred Holtby, Alistair MacLean and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/boris-pasternak\" title=\"\">Boris Pasternak</a>.</p> <p>When, in the 1980s, the British book trade began its march towards foreign ownership, nobody could complain too much about cultural loss. Random House, then a US firm, acquired Cape, Chatto, Virago and Bodley Head in 1987, Century Hutchinson in 1989 and Secker &amp; Warburg and Heinemann eight years later. The imprints persisted \u2013 some might say flourished \u2013 under corporate ownership. Then, in 1998, Random House was itself acquired by Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate. Another big German company, the Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, bought Macmillan around the same time, while in 2004 the French multinational Hachette took control of several imprints, including John Murray, Hodder, Orion and Little, Brown. When Penguin merges with Random/Bertelsmann, British-owned general publishers, led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bloomsbury\" title=\"\">Bloomsbury</a> and Faber, will have no more than 7% of the market.</p> <p>Does it matter to the reading public? It doesn't seem to have done so far \u2013 we never knew who Secker &amp; Warburg were anyway. But Penguin is different. No other imprint in the world has meant so much to its readers \u2013 to the point where at one time, the <a href=\"http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/stevereads/2010/12/penguins-on-parade-a-tale-of-two-beowulfs/\" title=\"\">penguin colophon</a> was as big a recommendation as the author's name. It was \"the first serious attempt to introduce 'branded goods' to the books trade\", wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/04/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Edward Young, the artist who drew the penguin from life at London zoo</a>, and it was a glorious success from the start. By 1936, a year after the first Penguin appeared, a million were in print, all of them sixpenny paperbacks with the strikingly simple covers that now decorate coffee mugs and tea towels. Penguins marked their owners out as political progressives as well as cultural self-improvers. As early as 1937, Lane appointed an Indian nationalist, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._K._Krishna_Menon\" title=\"\">VK Krishna Menon</a>, as a founding editor of the non-fiction Pelican series. \"We had a kind of code,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/07/politics\" title=\"\">Richard Hoggart</a> of his wartime career, \"that if there was a Penguin or Pelican sticking out of the back trouser-pocket of a battledress, you had a word with [the soldier] because it meant he was one of the different ones.\"</p> <p>And now the Basil Fawlty question: what was Bertelsmann up to during that period? For more than 50 years after the war, the firm put about the useful legend that it had been victimised by the Nazis, who closed down its printing plant in 1944. Its takeover of Random House began to prompt questions over this account, however, so Bertelsmann appointed an independent historical commission to inquire into the facts. It concluded that Bertelsmann's version of its history was a lie: the Nazis had closed the factory because of shortages rather than subversive texts. In fact, Bertelsmann had published all kinds of antisemitic books, including the Hitler Youth Christmas annual, and made indirect use of slave labour in Latvia and Lithuania.</p> <p>The company immediately expressed its \"sincere regret for the inaccuracies in our previous corporate history of the [second world war] era\", and I don't question its suitability as Random House's owner or Penguin's soon-to-be majority shareholder. My question is a different one. How can it be that Penguin, one of the most innovative publishing companies in the world, ends up in the hands of a German firm that, 50 years ago, was only a quarter of Penguin's size, with an unenviable publishing record? More generally, how is it that so many British publishers are owned in Germany and France, given that the English language is one of this country's last great assets, and we should surely know more about its exploitation than others do?</p> <p>British capitalism is so often a sorry thing. If the second world war was fought to defend it, there was a useless sacrifice.</p>",
  "<p>This time next week, we'll know. I hesitate to say we'll know by Wednesday morning: any journalist who covered the Bush v Gore Florida photo-finish of 2000 knows better than to tempt fate. But, barring a repeat of that freak event, it should be clear enough soon enough.</p> <p>Now is the moment the two duelling campaigns contemplate their destiny. What if Mitt Romney loses, as most of the blue-chip polling analysis says he will? It'll be a bitter personal defeat for a man who has been plotting this campaign since the moment his last one ended in failure. Seven days after he dropped out of the Republican primary race of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/us/politics/setback-leads-mitt-romney-to-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Romney gathered his allies around a boardroom table</a>, handing out a single-page memo he'd written about himself, detachedly laying out his own strengths and weaknesses and plotting the path to 2012.</p> <p>Some will say he has been running much longer, the ambition rooted in the crushing of his father's presidential hopes in 1968. Now Mitt Romney will be twice defeated with no chance of coming back. The stellar career in high finance that beckoned four years ago will surely beckon again \u2013 and this time with no nosy reporters demanding to know how much he pays in tax. (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">14%</a>, since you ask.)</p> <p>But the consequences of a Romney defeat would go much wider than the job prospects of one supremely wealthy man. The Republican party would have to stare itself long and hard in the face. A loss on Tuesday would mean the party had won the popular vote only once since 1988, when George W Bush beat John Kerry in 2004. In the five other elections, the Democrats would have beaten them. That is a shocking record that lays bare a deep, structural problem.</p> <p>Its base is shrinking before its eyes. The old \"southern strategy\" pioneered with such success by Richard Nixon, in which Republicans commandeered the white vote, often by playing on racial anxieties, worked wonders for decades. But now that white vote accounts for too small a share of the electorate: Romney is on course to win about 60% of it, but it's still not enough. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-republican-convention-emphasizes-diversity-racial-incidents-intrude/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html\" title=\"\">As the Republican senator Lindsey Graham so memorably</a> put it: \"The demographics race we're losing badly. We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>The problem is that Republicans have not compensated for that decline in white numbers with gains elsewhere. Steve Schmidt, campaign manager for John McCain in 2008, put it starkly when we met: \"We have been horrific\" towards Hispanic-Americans, he said, adding that the party needed to start speaking to that rising population with \"respect\". George W Bush made an effort in that direction with some results, but any progress has been reversed this time. Obama is expected to win as much as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-race-polarized-electorate-20121031,0,2198469.story\" title=\"\">75% of the Hispanic vote</a>.</p> <p>That problem with minorities \u2013 and one poll showed Romney's black support at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/mitt-romney-black-vote_n_1820329.html\" title=\"\">a striking 0%</a> \u2013 is both cause and effect of its shrinking base. If only \"angry white guys\", or Tea Partiers and evangelical Christians, are taking part in presidential primaries, that is bound to have a distorting effect. Romney is a case in point. In theory, he could have been a candidate with crossover appeal: a moderate, proven businessman who had won in Democratic Massachusetts. But to win the Republican nomination he had to change, becoming what he called a \"severe conservative\", dropping his previous stances in favour of abortion rights and gun control and, in order not to be outflanked on his right, telling undocumented immigrants, most Hispanic, to \"self-deport\".</p> <p>This is the Republicans' existential problem. They have retreated ever deeper into an ideological laager, shaped by a narrow, nationally unrepresentative Christian right, until they have reached the point where anyone acceptable to them is unacceptable to the rest of the country. Romney was the only plausible candidate on offer from the freakshow they had to choose from \u2013 but competing in the freakshow turned him into someone implausible.</p> <p>If Romney loses on Tuesday, Republicans will have to acknowledge that they threw away an election that, by rights, should have been theirs. They faced an incumbent with low approval ratings and weighed down by an unemployment rate hovering around 8%: no US president since Franklin Roosevelt had been re-elected with such a high jobless number. This was their election to lose. If they lose it, they will need to contemplate the most profound change.</p> <p>And what if the polls in the critical swing states don't hold up and Obama loses? The brutal truth is that neither American politics nor history looks kindly on one-term presidents. They&#xa0;are instantly deemed failures. Jimmy Carter had to undertake a 30-year penance of good works in order to rehabilitate his reputation and absolve the grave sin of losing. Many Democrats would be similarly embarrassed by a defeated Obama, unsentimentally branding him a non-person. Many will say the party made a grave mistake and that it should have gone for Hillary in 2008, a view that will be nourished by this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/hillary-clinton-mitt-romney-poll\" title=\"\">YouGov poll finding that Clinton would have beaten Romney</a> by a comfortable six points.</p> <p>The last four years will be regarded as an aberration, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-choice/2012/11/01/59b5bed0-2445-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html\" title=\"\">\"a historical parenthesis, a passing interlude of overreaching hyper-liberalism, rejected by a center-right country that is 80% nonliberal,\"</a> according to the ultra-conservative commentator, Charles Krauthammer. Everything Obama did \u2013 his Keynesian stimulus, his bailout of the car industry, his reform of healthcare \u2013 will be condemned as a mistake, including by many Democrats who will succumb to the right's critique and fault Obama for veering too far left. Only the killing of Osama bin Laden will earn him any credit.</p> <p>Worse, and this will rarely be articulated out loud, too many Americans will see the first black presidency as a kind of failed experiment: we tried it, but it didn't work out. In a silent way, the bar for non-white candidates, already so high, will be even higher.</p> <p>The world outside America is backing Obama, the polls show it, but without the fervour of four years ago. Some on the left see little difference between him and Romney, on, say, drones, civil liberties or the Middle East; the odd nuance, perhaps, but otherwise they are&#xa0;Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p> <p>Big mistake. Some of us heard the same refrain in 2000: no difference between Gore and Bush, who cares who wins? And we all know how that worked out.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>There are currently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/09/half-uk-young-black-men-unemployed\" title=\"\">more young black men unemployed than employed</a>. Chinese graduates can expect to earn 25% less over the course of their careers than their fellow white graduates. Government research has shown that those with an identifiably African- or Asian-origin name need to make nearly twice as many job applications to even get an interview. Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people. Since the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a further <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16438933\" title=\"\">96 people have been killed at the hands of racists</a>.</p> <p>I could go on. The litany of racial inequality and injustice in our society is a long and shameful one. It is for this reason that minority communities have long called for a society free of racial discrimination, and successive governments have created legislation and institutions to address our \"race problem\".</p> <p>But since the last election the coalition has been busy downgrading efforts to address racial inequality. Government has wasted little time in deciding that fiscal austerity means that the promotion of greater equality is a price that is simply not worth paying. Central government support for organisations working to tackle racial inequality was cut by 100%. Its \"red tape challenge\" suggested that protection against discrimination is merely an inconvenient barrier to business growth.</p> <p>When challenged in parliament last month on having no strategy to address the high levels of unemployment faced by young black men, Helen Grant MP, recently <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/helen_grant/maidstone_and_the_weald\" title=\"\">appointed minister for equality</a>, argued that targeted support would be \"wrong\" since \"everyone needs help\".</p> <p>Such a sustained attack on efforts to close gaps in education, employment, health and criminal justice is made worse when the body that is supposed to act as a watchdog on the erosion of equality itself loses the confidence of those it is seeking to protect. This week, two commissioners at the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\" title=\"\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> with extensive experience in fighting racial inequality have been told their services are no longer required. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/nov/01/black-muslim-members-equalities-commission-roles\" title=\"\">Simon Woolley and Baroness Hussain-Ece were not even interviewed</a> after they applied to continue as commissioners \u2013 despite the fact that in his formal assessment this year, Woolley was described as providing \"outstanding leadership on race equality\" and being \"a vital contributor to the commission's development\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/trevor-phillips-legacy-panel-verdict\" title=\"\">Trevor Phillips's term as chair of the EHRC ended in the summer</a>. Now, five years since the abolition of the Commission for Racial Equality, there may soon be no minority ethnic commissioners on its successor body. Were these commissioners considered too vocal in challenging the direction of government?</p> <p>In her pre-appointment hearing, the new chair of the EHRC, Baroness O'Neill, was asked whether she had experience in dealing with race issues. The best she could offer was that she regularly spoke to Cambridge university undergraduates from minority backgrounds \u2013 hardly a representative sample of Britain's minority population. If this is the only insight the chair has on racial discrimination, it is crucial that the rest of the commissioners have an understanding that goes beyond a few niceties expressed over sherry in the senior common room.</p> <p>We need an effective EHRC now more than ever \u2013 a body that can challenge government, when necessary, and work alongside public authorities to create a society that does not waste the talents of people simply because of their identity. Under this government the EHRC has already been hit by budget cuts of over 60%. If it's to gain the confidence of minority ethnic communities the EHRC must prove it is a watchdog with teeth, rather than a government poodle.</p>",
  "<p>Offering flea and worm treatments and opening more grooming salons in stores helped Pets at Home push up like for like sales last year by 1.3% while turnover jumped 7.1% to \u00a3544.3m.</p> <p>In the year to 29 March, ebitda earnings \u2013 before adjustments and exceptional items \u2013 at the pet retailer increased 0.5% to \u00a391.7m. The results are the first since new chief executive Nick Wood joined from American Golf this year to replace Matt Davies, now chief executive of Halfords.</p> <p>Wood said: \"In a year of significant capital and revenue investment, and against a challenging economic and retail background, it is extremely pleasing to report further growth in turnover and profit.\" The new chief, owner of two bichon frise dogs called Oscar and Louis and a hamster called Snuggles, said there had been a \"very strong\" takeup of microchipping and flea and worm treatments at stores as well as nutritional services. \"We are giving people more reasons to come to us and we want to develop expertise among our colleagues,\" said Wood.</p> <p>The chain, which now has 313 stores, opened 18 grooming salons and 19 Companion Care in-store veterinary practices in the year. It opened 32 stores last year and Wood believes there is \"significant opportunity\" to continue opening stores at the same rate. The retailer will be hoping it can continue the momentum through to Christmas, after last year it reported pet owners facing squeezed incomes had scaled down their purchases to smaller items, such as Santa stockings for hamsters, and advent calendars for dogs.</p>",

This is his last election, he's really energised.\"</p> <p>And so he was. I haven't heard Obama as fired up at a rally like this one since 2008. In the events I've seen him at this year he's always been 10% reserved, 20% professorial. A pale reflection of the \"hope and change\" merchant of four years ago. But this time he was back to the firebrand of 08, his speech belching out of him like it came from the gut.</p> <p>I know it's become unfashionable to talk about Obama the orator \u2013 he over did it with the promises and the rhetoric four years ago and to no small extent he's been paying the price ever since. But when he turns it on, it still sends electricity through the crowd, and it did here.</p> <p>The anger towards Romney was palpable. \"The folks at the top in this country don't need another champion in Washington. They already have a seat at the table,\" he said. Romney didn't represent change, or the future. \"To make sure no matter who you are or where you come from you can make it in America, that's the future.\"</p> <p>It is stating the obvious that Obama's supporters in the crowd loved him. But actually, at this late stage in the election, that is of huge importance. His mission here was to fire up the base so that they get out this weekend knocking on doors and getting out the vote. With poll margins razor-thin in Ohio, the candidate that has the edge in inspiring his faithful followers over the next four days in this crucial battleground state is likely to be the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>So it matters that Pam Bishop, 60, looked at the end of Obama's speech as though she'd just seen an angel, and vowed to work hard from now to the end of election day. \"I think he is amazing. I think he gets what the country needs and he's willing to work for every single one of us.\"</p> <p>And it particularly mattered that Rick McCurdy, 59, said he found the speech \"very motivating\". McCurdy is one of the one in eight Ohioans who work in the auto industry, in his case for Honda US, and he says without the auto bailout he might have lost his job. \"I'm not ready to go backwards,\" he said, echoing one of Obama's mantras. \"I want to see him moving forwards with the recovery.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T17:04:45.923Z\">at 5.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e897b579f74bac764970\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:36:55.379Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong> appears to be doing his greatest hits here in West Allis, but the latest jobs figures don't get much attention from Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unemployment is higher today than the day Barack Obama took office.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, that is technically true, given that the January 2009 jobs report had 7.8% unemployment, and Obama was inaugurated on 20 January.</p> <p>And here we go with the five-point plan to create jobs.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:42:59.996Z\">at 3.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093e753b579f74bac76496f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:31:31.175Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">MItt Romney speaks in Wisconsin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Now <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> takes the stage in <strong>Wisconsin</strong>, and he also starts off by mentioning the impact of Sandy.

But these figures today were to have been the killer, with just four full days of campaigning left.</p> <p>It has not worked out like that, mainly because the figures have gone down, dropping below the symbolically-important 8%. It is not just that the figures have gone down but that voters have not attached as much importance to them as the Romney campaign had hoped. Americans have been living with unemployment for four years: it is a fact of life, and the monthly unemployment figures have been largely discounted.</p> <p>These figures are good for the Obama campaign, the 171,000 new jobs higher than expected. The Obama campaign can claim that the trend is going in the right direction.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is almost certain to say that the unemployment rate is still too high, that the rate is not coming down fast enough, that all that stimulus money has failed to make an impact. But these figures are not the game-changer the Romney campaign had predicted two months ago.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093c3cfb579f74bac764956\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:00:00.104Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the point about the <strong>unemployment rate</strong> at the start and end of Barack Obama's first presidential term:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/damianpaletta/status/264349507238633472\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Obama trying to join Reagan and GW Bush; won reelection with unemployment higher than day took office.

Will job creation beat expectations?</strong></h2> <p>Forecasters are predicting around 125,000 jobs have been created last month. Anything above that will be seen as better than expected, especially a figure of 150,000 or more. Similarly, a total below that will suggest the opposite, especially if the new jobs total dips below 100,000.</p> <h2><strong>2. Will the unemployment rate stay at 7.8%?</strong></h2> <p>Even a slight uptick in the headline rate of unemployment will become ammunition for the Romney campaign \u2013 all the more if the rate goes to 8% or above.</p> <h2><strong>3. Will revisions to previous months add or subtract?</strong></h2> <p>September's positive jobs report may be subject to heavy revision, possibly raising the unemployment rate in retrospect. Look out for revisions to previous months.</p> <h2><strong>4. What about the numbers below the headline figures?</strong></h2> <p>After the job creation total and unemployment rate, the report includes a wealth of other data. The key statistics include hours worked and hourly pay: strong increases in both are signs of an improving labour market, and a better guide to how those in work are faring.</p> <h2><strong>5. What will be the impact from Hurricane Sandy?</strong></h2> <p>The storm's devastation may have come too late in the month to have much impact on October's jobs numbers. But its influence, if any, is likely to be negative, as well as a possible source of confusion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-957d65a3-fac3-4146-b624-6d4496d331fd\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/10/31/1351690402591/Downed-power-lines-after--007.jpg\" alt=\"Downed power lines after superstorm Sandy at Seaside Heights island\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downed power lines at Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

But for Obama and his supporters, the real question is how October's figures stack up alongside the rosy economic data received recently, and whether September's decline in the headline rate of unemployment \u2014 to 7.8% from 8.1% \u2014 was merely a blip or part of an improving trend.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has put jobs at the centre of his pitch for the White House, regularly boasting that he \"knows how to create jobs\" while citing the 23m Americans estimated to be out of work.

  "<p>A determined attempt by the Ministry of Defence to transfer insurgents to Afghan jails was blocked by the high court on Friday after it heard evidence that they would be handed over to a notorious torturer and alleged killer.</p> <p>The court heard how the Foreign Office minister Lady Warsi \u2013 the former Conservative Party co-chair \u2013 had failed to question assurances by Asadullah Khalid, the head of the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS), even though he was alleged to be widely known to have been personally involved in torture.</p> <p>An urgent hearing was requested by lawyers acting for an Afghan prisoner tortured in breach of assurances made to British officials. James Eadie QC, for the MoD, told the hearing: \"Both the secretary of state for defence [Philip Hammond] and the baroness [Warsi] were briefed on the allegations. But the fact of the matter is, he is head of the NDS.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We have to deal with the NDS: it is to the NDS that insurgents are transferred. Therefore, it is obvious that whatever the truth of the allegations, the government engages with the body it engages with.\" Khalid is reported to be a close aide to the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai.</p> <p>Lord Justice Moses intervened to say Warsi had done a deal with a man responsible for prisons where there were \"still very live concerns\". Eadie accepted the point.</p> <p>The court heard that a senior Canadian diplomat in Afghanistan had made public allegations that the head of the NDS \"was known to personally torture people\" in a \"dungeon under his guest house\", \"had people killed who got in his way\" and was \"running a narcotics operation\". Khalid has previously denied the allegations.</p> <p>The court hearing \u2013 in a case of the kind likely to be heard in secret if the government's justice and security bill is passed \u2013 was requested by the law firm Leigh Day and the legal charity Reprieve, acting for Serdar Mohammed, tortured by the Afghan security services after being transferred to their custody by UK forces.</p> <p>Following Mohamed's allegations, the government placed a moratorium in 2010 on all transfers of prisoners to the NDS.</p> <p>The MoD now wants to lift that moratorium. Eadie argued there was a \"pressing need\" for British forces to transfer detainees to the Afghan prison at Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province. From there, they might be transferred to jails in Kandahar and Kabul, where prisoners had also been tortured, the court heard.</p> <p>Eadie said delays in transferring the prisoners to what he called \"a sovereign state's criminal justice system\" could damage the UK's relations with the Afghan government. Some detainees might have to be released from British custody if they could not be handed over to an Afghan jail, thereby endangering the lives of British soldiers and the local population, Eadie argued. Safeguards, including monitoring of Afghan jails by UK officials, had been put in place, he added.</p> <p>Dinah Rose, QC for Mohammed, repeatedly described the head of the NDS as \"Mr Khalid the Torturer\". Warsi must have received a Foreign Office briefing before meeting him, she told the court: \"Baroness Warsi met him and shook his hand, and I hope she washed her hands well afterwards.\"</p> <p>Eadie suggested two whips found at Lashkar Gah jail in September and November last year were insufficient evidence for a reasonable prospect of success at a full court hearing into the matter scheduled for later this month.</p> <p>\"That is not enough\", Eadie said, referring to the weight of evidence. \"Not enough whips?\", asked Moses.</p> <p>\"My Lord, this is a serious issue,\" Eadie replied. \"Exactly\", said Moses.</p> <p>Following the exchange, Rose told the court: \"In fact there are two more.\" Two suspicious lengths of hose pipe had also been found in interrogation rooms when MoD inspectors visited on two occasions earlier last year, the court heard. Moses said this suggested they were \"not isolated incidents\" but \"spoke to a culture\" of abuse. If the court found for the MoD and the safeguards the MoD had arranged proved inadequate, it could lead to a \"disastrous situation\".Moses described the prospect as \"chilling\".</p> <p>Documents disclosed to the court showed Britain's deputy ambassador to Afghanistan, Catherine Royle, met officials from the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan in June and asked them to name Khalid as a torturer in a forthcoming report.</p> <p>Granting the injunction, Lord Justice Moses said that if the \"substantial body of evidence\" of mistreatment were to be accepted, Khalid's assurances that prisoners handed over by Britain would be safe from harm \"represents a very dramatic change of heart from his behaviour in the past\".</p> <h2>Document released in court by MoD</h2> <p>Among the documents disclosed by the Ministry of Defence on Friday and made public \u2013 possibly inadvertently \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/interactive/2012/nov/03/torture-email\">was a heavily redacted copy of an email that named the new head of Afghanistan's intelligence service as being a \"principle [sic] culprit\" for the torture of Taliban prisoners</a>.</p> <p>The email, sent on 17 June this year, states that five days earlier Catherine Royle, the UK's deputy ambassador in Kabul, met United Nations officials who warned her that torture was continuing to take place at intelligence and police posts across the country.</p> <p>Royle urged the officials to publicly identify Asadullah Khalid as being one of the men responsible for particularly brutal mistreatment of prisoners at Kandahar.</p> <p>Three months after that, Khalid was appointed head of the Afghan intelligence agency, the NDS. A few weeks later the British government was making arrangements to hand their own prisoners to Khalid, after he met Baroness Warsi, now a junior foreign office minister, and assured her that none of those men would be harmed.</p>",

The father of two was the first prison officer to be killed by paramilitaries in almost 20 years. His family issued a statement pleading for no retaliation over the murder.</p> <p>The police have confirmed that an armed anti-peace-process republican terror group was behind the drive-by shooting at a junction close to Portadown.</p> <p>Arriving at a meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in nearby Armagh City on Friday, Ireland's prime minister, Enda Kenny, offered support to the security forces in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The taoiseach said any help the PSNI needed in the investigation would be \"immediately forthcoming\".</p> <p>Kenny described the murder as a \"very sad case\" and pledged that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na would work closely with the Northern Ireland police in terms of \"intelligence and information\".</p> <p>Earlier, in a statement to the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, expressed her \"profound sympathies\" for the family and friends of the victim and praised the \"untiring efforts\" of police on both sides of the border.</p> <p>\"This attack has demonstrated the gravity of the threat that dissident groups continue to pose,\" she said, adding that the government \"will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that the terrorists do not succeed\".</p> <p>She said that people from both communities in Northern Ireland were determined \"there will be no return to the dark days of the past\".</p> <p>\"Their response to this horrific crime has been clear, united and resolute,\" she said.</p> <p>Last week she reported that republican dissident attacks had fallen by 20%, although a Home Office threat assessment still put the level of danger these organisations pose as \"severe\".</p> <p>A book of condolence in memory of the 52-year-old prison officer was opened in a local arts centre in Cookstown.</p> <p>Meanwhile one of the IRA's most important prison leaders during the buildup to the 1998 Good Friday agreement is back in jail after being charged with offences connected to one of the most notorious murders during the peace process.</p> <p>Padraic Wilson, 53, was the leader of IRA prisoners in the Maze prison in the late 1990s.</p> <p>He has been charged with IRA membership and addressing a meeting to encourage support for the IRA, which he denies.</p> <p>Robert McCartney, 33, was stabbed to death outside Magennis's bar in Belfast. Local IRA members were blamed for the attack.</p> <p>A detective told Belfast magistrates court on Friday that although Wilson was not charged directly in connection with the murder of McCartney, the charges related to an internal investigation by the IRA following the murder.</p> <p>The magistrate said her concern was that Wilson could interfere with witnesses who include McCartney's sisters. Wilson was remanded in custody for four weeks.</p> <p>The murdered man's sisters launched an international campaign to bring his killers to justice, accusing the local IRA of helping to clean up all the forensic evidence from the bar and then intimidate witnesses.</p> <p>Wilson was and remains a key supporter of Sinn F\u00e9in's peace strategy and after his release from jail for a time was the party's international affairs director. During his incarceration in the Maze prison he met the late Dr Mo Mowlam as part of delicate negotiations aimed at winning the IRA inmates' support for the Good Friday agreement.</p>",
  "<p>\"We had rather a late night, yeah,\" laughs Gus Unger-Hamilton, keyboard player with Alt-J, winners of the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/nov/02/alt-j-mercury-prize?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9383\" title=\"\"> Mercury prize</a> for their album An Awesome Wave. \"I think I got in at about 7.30am. We ended up in east London at one of our record label people's flat where we had a boogie to some seriously smooth R&amp;B.\"</p> <p>Alt-J, a four-piece band who met at Leeds University, where three of them studied fine art and the other took English literature, are many things, but purveyors of smooth R&amp;B they are not. With its complex lattice of styles, songs about geometric shapes and allusions to literature and film, An Awesome Wave was the bookmakers' choice for the prize ever since the Mercury shortlist was announced in September.</p> <p>This was a surprise in itself. When the album was released in May, it failed to gain a single broadsheet newspaper review, while in one magazine the record was pointedly dismissed for its \"pompous whimsy\".</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398726306\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/11/2/1351820883249/Alt-J-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/2/121102MercuryPrizeResult-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/2/121102MercuryPrizeResult_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121102MercuryPrizeResult/121102MercuryPrizeResult.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/2/121102MercuryPrizeResult_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Did <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/nov/02/mercury-prize-2012-alt-j-video\" title=\"\">Alt-J \u2013 who took their name from the shortcut for a delta sign on an Apple Mac keyboard \u2013 have any inkling</a> of what would happen on Thursday night?</p> <p>\"None whatsoever,\" says Unger-Hamilton. \"When it came to the announcement we could see [presenter] Lauren Laverne form an 'alt-j' shape with her mouth and it was like, 'Oh my God, I think we've won!' It was a bit like a shell going off in a trench. I think I've repressed the feeling \u2013 it was too traumatic and overwhelming.\"</p> <p>Unger-Hamilton was convinced his band were not going to win. \"There were all these rumours flying round the room: 'No, no, no - it's Plan B, it's Plan B.\" Twenty minutes later everyone's going, \"Richard Hawley's got it, it's obvious.'\"</p> <p>Did he have a flutter on himself at the bookies? \"No!\" he says, recalling the 4/5 odds. \"We wouldn't have won very much.\"</p> <p>Despite some criticism about this year's Mercury shortlist being unadventurous, Unger-Hamilton considers the lineup to have been strong, conceding that there could have been a greater showing for electronic artists. \"There were under-represented genres,\" he says, \"but it's a subjective thing. It's chosen by humans, not a computer or a quango. That makes sure it's diverse in every way.\"</p> <p>The presence of Alt-J and another fast-rising outfit, Django Django, on the list of nominees suggests more chances now for the conventional four- or five-piece band after years of dominance in the industry by solo female stars such as Amy Winehouse and Adele.</p> <p>Unger-Hamilton accepts the \"boffin-rock\" tag that has been attached to Alt-J and agrees that they are almost an anti-Oasis, with songs, not about cigarettes and alcohol but war photographers and foreign cinema.</p> <p>\"After the success of the first Kaiser Chiefs album in the mid-noughties there came a lot of dross \u2013 rubbish landfill indie,\" he says. \"I would hate for that to happen again,\" he adds.</p> <p>Alt-J's success is also a triumph for their independent record label, Infectious. Unger-Hamilton's brother runs Polydor, part of the Universal Music Group, but, he says, signing with his sibling's label \"was never on the cards\".</p> <p>\"He thought [signing to Infectious] was a great move for us and thought it would be best for us to sign to an indie,\" the keyboard player says.</p> <p>Korda Marshall couldn't agree more. The head of Infectious, he believes Alt-J's Mercury win is a triumph for indie labels everywhere. \"It's like David beating Goliath,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We're punching way beyond our weight but it's lovely, amazing.\"</p> <p>He attributes An Awesome Wave's success \u2013 not just the Mercury prize but 100,000 sales in the UK and 75,000 more abroad \u2013 partly to the enduring power of mainstream radio, which shared his appreciation of the album as an art form in what he calls the \"single-track economy\". \"It's very rare that I do this but Radio &#xa0;1 should be given credit for championing a band when nobody else would,\" he says, \"especially when your strategy is to sell an album, not singles. Radio 1 got that right away.\"</p> <p>He also praises his team's creative approach to marketing and awareness of the increasing importance of digital media.</p> <p>\"We had to fire the press officer because they couldn't get anyone to review it in the papers,\" he grimaces, adding: \"We took risks that major labels don't in terms of strategy. We streamed the whole album ahead of release on SoundCloud, which a major would never do. We made an <a href=\"http://redditlurker.com/pics/Post/t3_uc09z\" title=\"\">origami version of the CD</a> \u2013 a major label wouldn't have done that. We focused on online \u2013 we haven't done one print advert in a single magazine. I don't believe putting adverts in a magazine like NME works.\"</p> <p>There is now \"a level playing-field\" in this digital age, he says, when the majors \"no longer control the means of distribution\". Of course, it helps that Infectious have a group like Alt-J, \"a fantastic band who haven't stopped working since the day we signed them\".</p> <p>Will the band stop working long enough to enjoy their success? How will they spend the \u00a320,000 prize?</p> <p>\"We're planning to fly our parents to the same place in the world and buy them all an expensive dinner,\" says Unger-Hamilton.</p> <p>No plans for rock'n'roll excess, then?</p> <p>\"No, we're still on tour, working hard,\" he says. \"We're trying to honour our commitments and play great gigs for the people who come to see us. We're quite a tame band. If somebody's late for the bus, they get all sorts of disapproving looks. We don't tolerate very much rock'n'roll excess in this band. We have quite a strong work ethic, and having got this far that's how we intend to continue.\"</p> <p>He laughs off the idea of a \"Mercury Curse\" \u2013 previous recipients of the award such as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/173094.stm\" title=\"\">Gomez</a> and Roni Size have all but disappeared without trace \u2013 saying: \"It's an eccentric, idiosyncratic prize, and I like the way it doesn't always create megastars\".</p> <p>So is theirs a triumph for indie/DIY ideals over corporate muscle?</p> <p>\"It's nice that a band on an indie won because it feels right,\" he says. \"Although I don't think the winner should be based on the backstory, I do think when an artist from a major label wins you think, 'Oh, OK, there you go.' It's nice to have a band on an indie win.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's not fair,\" is my 10-year-old son's standard response to pretty much any parental intervention he doesn't like. From sleepovers to sweet distribution, fairness is the watchful eye of jealous siblings. Little wonder that fairness as a moral ideal can be dismissed as hazy romanticism and the ethical imperative of the green-eyed monster. Yet us Brits pride ourselves on being fair. And we don't require some extended philosophy of fairness in order to recognise unfairness when we see it.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href=\"http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgnl/community_and_living/fairness_commission.aspx\" title=\"\">Tower Hamlets launches a Fairness Commission</a>, which I have been asked to chair. I am especially excited by this, not least because this is my favourite part of London. As a young priest, I worked in a homeless centre in Aldgate, washing dirty feet and helping people organise their benefit. I remember as if it were yesterday a homeless woman, M, who was always especially rude and ungrateful.</p> <p>Later, over lunch at the wonderful Bloom's restaurant, I shared my irritation with a colleague. She explained that M used to live a perfectly normal life in north London until one day a fire destroyed her home and killed her children. She had been deliberately homeless ever since and could never bring herself to sleep inside a house. M had been driven mad by grief. Never&#xa0;again have I been so quick to&#xa0;presume I understand the pressures other people operate under. For some, life is horrendously unfair.</p> <p>But there are some forms of gross unfairness that are not, as it were, metaphysical \u2013 making you want to swear at the gods \u2013 but entirely practical and within human control. Tower Hamlets is, at the same time, one of the richest and one of the poorest parts of Britain. It has the highest rate of child poverty in the country and yet the average salary of those who work in the borough is \u00a358,000, the second highest in the UK after the City of London. This is a place where many kids sleep six to a room yet the borough has an economy worth more than \u00a36bn a year, higher than places such as Malta or Monaco. We were told by the Thatcherites of the 80s that wealth would trickle down.</p> <p>Tower Hamlets is proof positive that it doesn't. If anything, it flows the other way. Have a walk around Bow and Whitechapel and Bethnal Green. Then go to the great glass towers of Canary Wharf, still in the borough but in all other ways another world completely. No, wealth is sucked upwards, it doesn't trickle down.</p> <p>During the second world war, as the East End was being blown to smithereens, there developed a strong belief that everyone was in it together. Rationing preserved a sense of togetherness, that the effects of austerity would be shared, managed together as a communal burden. This was one-nation Britain, this was the \"big society\". From the end of the war to the 80s, the idea that fairness was importantly linked with equality of outcome shaped the national conversation, delivering such much-loved institutions as the NHS. This was fairness.</p> <p>But the Thatcherites destroyed all this. They thought the emphasis on equality was itself a moral problem, hindering enterprise. Freedom was to be the new moral watchword \u2013 which, for the right, meant the freedom for some people to get as rich as they could. The Blairites were intensely relaxed about all of this as long as the poor were themselves pulled along in the slipstream. But they weren't. The gap between rich and poor widened with every passing year and with huge social consequences.</p> <p>Today in Tower Hamlets, rich men live 11 years longer than poor men. And cuts and austerity have a long way to run over the next few years. But those who caused the economy to impale itself on its own greed remain protected from the consequences of their behaviour. Unfairness needs no deeper philosophy to explain it than this.</p> <p><strong>Twitter: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\"><strong>@giles_fraser</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>Doctors were at the forefront of the Aids treatment revolution a decade ago, denouncing stigmatisation and inequality from conference platforms and lobbying politicians alongside the activists. Could we see cancer doctors take up the banners and the slogans on behalf of the poorest in the same way?</p> <p>Until last weekend, I personally did not think so. But in a lakeside hotel in Lugano in Switzerland, at <a href=\"http://www.eso.net/varie/wof.html\">a meeting of the World Oncology Forum</a>, I watched what looked like a process of radicalisation take place. Nearly 100 of the world's leading cancer doctors were there \u2013 extremely eminent clinicians and scientists. The question for discussion over a day and a half was \"Are we winning the war on cancer?\" Broadly speaking, the answer seemed to be no, on two fronts. The first was that scientific progress had not delivered hoped-for cures, even for countries with substantial amounts of money to spend on drugs. The second was that people in low- and middle-income countries are dying of cancers that are preventable and curable in the richer world. And it was that second front that the forum agreed to tackle in an unprecedented way.</p> <p>Some of the oncologists present, who spend their time in high-tech labs and well-equipped wards in Europe and the US, did not anticipate the way the meeting would develop, I suspect. There was much very interesting discussion about the failures of the much-hyped and hoped-for targeted therapies, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/28/targeted-cancer-drugs-expectations-experts\">which I wrote about here</a>. There was also a lot of anger at the tobacco industry, which doctors held directly responsible for millions of deaths past and to come.</p> <p>But tobacco control is now most needed in poorer countries where cigarettes are dirt cheap and the companies look to expand their sales. Cancer is a global issue and growing fastest in low- and middle-income countries. Professors Rifat Atun of the Imperial College Business School and Felicia Knaul, director of the <a href=\"http://globalhealth.harvard.edu/org/harvard-global-equity-initiative\">Harvard Global Equity Initiative</a>, powerfully put the case for doctors to fight for better care and prevention in the developing world. Knaul spoke of the unnecessary deaths of children from leukaemia and women from breast and cervical cancer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Children with leukaemia divide, such that in Canada almost 90% can hope to survive where in the poorest countries of the world, 90% can expect to die.</p> </blockquote> <p>Atun and Knaul are joint authors of a new book, called <a href=\"http://www.pih.org/news/entry/new-report-released-closing-the-cancer-divide/\">Closing the Cancer Divide: a blueprint to expand access in low- and middle-income countries</a>. It aims to show what can be done and stamp out four pernicious myths:</p> <p>1) Cancer treatment is unnecessary because the burden of disease is not great in the developing world \u2013 untrue. Over half of all new cancer cases and two-thirds of deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>2) It is unaffordable for most poor countries \u2013 untrue. The economic burden of cancer on those countries is high, the costs of lost productivity outstrip the costs involved in care and only 5% of global cancer spending takes place in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>3) Cancer prevention and treatment is unattainable because of inadequate human and physical resources \u2013 untrue. Screening for breast and cervical cancer, for instance, can be integrated into other programmes such as maternal and child health, and HIV care.</p> <p>4) It is inappropriate because the resources are needed for high-burden infectious diseases \u2013 untrue. Expanding cancer care can strengthen whole health systems, many cancers are associated with poverty just like infectious diseases and at least half of all deaths from cancers in developing countries are preventable.</p> <p>Atun told the meeting that what the Aids community did, they could and should do too. By the end of it, goaded as much as guided by Lancet editor Richard Horton, they drew up a list of 10 principles for a declaration to be published in the new year. While some were about better drug development, most were about ending the shameful neglect of cancer in the developing world.</p> <p>Next stop \u2013 the barricades.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 12 November 2012. Rifat Atun works at the Imperial College Business School, not the London Business School. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's creative economy could be destroyed \"within a generation\" because of the decision to leave arts subjects out of the English baccalaureate, according to leading figures in the arts world.</p> <p>Sir Nicholas Hytner, Sir Nicholas Serota, Julian Lloyd Webber, Richard Rogers, Sir David Hare and Grayson Perry are among the cultural figureheads who have told the Guardian they are deeply worried about the impact of excluding creative subjects from the core qualification at 16. There are fears that many schools, particularly state schools, will marginalise arts subjects if they do not count towards the Ebacc, the new GCSE performance measure.</p> <p>The film and theatre director Sir Richard Eyre called the lack of arts on the Ebacc \"incredibly shortsighted\" while the playwright Sir David Hare condemned the policy as \"the most dangerous and far-reaching of the government's reforms\".</p> <p>The architect Lord Rogers added: \"Our writers, artists, designers, dancers, actors and architects are the envy of the world. Arts education should definitely not be marginalised or censored.\" Thomas Ad\u00e8s, the composer whose opera The Tempest is currently at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, called the move \"suicidal, if we want to have any arts at all in Britain in 30 years\". Mandatory school music lessons had \"made all the difference\" to him.</p> <p>The new performance measure depends on pupils' attainment in five subject areas. Pupils who achieve a GCSE grade C or better in English, maths, a language, two sciences and history or geography will achieve the EBacc. Subjects such as music, art, drama and design do not count. Many in the arts world fear that schools will sideline cultural subjects if they are not part of the new measure. Lord Hall, the Royal Opera House chief executive, said: \"It is absolutely crucial that [education secretary] Michael Gove rethinks. It's not enough for arts to be tucked away in the 20% of time that's left in the curriculum.\"</p> <p>Serota, the Tate director, joined Hall in urging the government to create a \"sixth pillar\" for culture. \"The arts are integral to our understanding of the world, as important as reading, writing, geography and arithmetic,\" he said. Greg Doran, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said: \"There is evidence of the link between the attainment that students make in arts subjects and their performance elsewhere in the curriculum. Arts subjects should be part of the Ebacc.\"</p> <p>Since the Ebacc was introduced as a performance measure in schools from 2010, numbers taking GCSE arts subjects have already declined. In a <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2012-10-15b.120591.h&amp;s=dan+jarvis+department%3AEducation#g120591.q0\" title=\"\">parliamentary answer</a> to a question by Dan Jarvis, the shadow culture minister, it was reported that in 2012 entries in design and technology were down 5.1%, in art and design by 2.4%, in music by 3.6% and in drama by 6.3% since the previous year.</p> <p>Lloyd Webber said the Ebacc was \"crazy and bizarre\", and, along with figures such as violinist Tasmin Little, the cellist lent his support to a <a href=\"http://www.baccforthefuture.com/\" title=\"\">campaign</a> to review the Ebacc spearheaded by the Incorporated Society of Musicians.</p> <p>In 2011, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/31/trainee-secondary-teachers-funding-cut\" title=\"\">government cut the number of postgraduate certificate of education places</a> for trainee teachers \u2013 with art and music among the subjects most hit, losing 220 and 180 places respectively.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/DFE-RR249.pdf\" title=\"\">Ipsos Mori research</a>, 27% of schools withdrew subjects from the curriculum in response to the EBacc this academic year. The most commonly withdrawn subjects were drama and performing arts (23%) and art (17%).</p> <p>If the trend continues, according to Lizzie Crump, who runs the Cultural Learning Alliance, \"we risk ending up with a two-tier system where arts are regarded as second-class subjects\".</p> <p>Creative subjects are especially important at school, arts leaders argue, when there is pressure on the arts across the board. Arts Council England's budget was cut by 30% at the last spending review and many local authorities are cutting grants to cultural organisations.</p> <p>Arts leaders fear that without a strong cultural component through the curriculum, children may be deprived of a fully rounded education. Hytner, director of the National Theatre, said: \"Our concern is that many children and young people will simply miss out: not just on the enjoyment of theatre, but on the important learning and development that comes through taking part in drama from an early age.\"</p> <p>There are also fears that a diminishing of arts on the curriculum will damage the economy. Martin Roth, director of the V&amp;A, said: \"The UK is one of the greatest creative nations in the world, as exemplified during the Olympics this summer, but if subjects such as art, design, music, drama and dance are pushed out of the curriculum Britain's creative economy will be destroyed within a generation.\" Tamara Rojo, artistic director of English National Ballet, said: \"The performing arts are one of the few sectors that create growth and work for the UK economy.\"</p> <p>Arts leaders argue that great national celebrations such as the jubilee and the Olympics were defined by their creativity \u2013 which could be threatened in the future if arts become second-class subjects.</p> <p>Ian Rickson, who directed the hit play Jerusalem, said the Olympics opening ceremony was possible only because \"people like Danny Boyle, Stephen Daldry and Akram Khan [were] all recipients of a broad curriculum that helped them develop their unique vision and identity\".</p> <p>Khan, who choreographed much of the ceremony, paid tribute to his education, which included AS-level drama. Joe Wright, director of films including the recent Anna Karenina, added: \"If we want Britain to continue to lead in creative areas such as art, fashion and music then we have to support those areas through the school curriculum right from the very beginning.\"</p> <p>There are fears of a divide between children from different backgrounds if the arts are sidelined at school. Actor Jude Law said: \"The arts must not be allowed to become a middle-class pursuit.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"The English baccalaureate does not prevent any school from offering GCSEs in art and design, dance, drama and music. We have been clear that pupils should take the GCSEs that are right for them.</p> <p>\"We are providing funding for over 2,000 of the most talented students to attend leading independent dance schools or centres of advanced training.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ash dieback disease will spread across the UK by around 20 miles a year, infecting most of the country's 90m ash trees within a decade, the government was told Friday at a crisis meeting with its leading environment advisers.</p> <p>It is feared many more clusters will be identified in the next year and that spores from the fungus will spread from the east of England and Scotland to eventually cover Britain \u2013 in some cases carried on people's clothes.</p> <p>The grim picture was set out by Prof Ian Boyd, chief scientist with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, at a national emergency Cabinet Office briefing room (Cobra) meeting led by the environment secretary, Owen Paterson.</p> <p>Even if the native ash tree cannot be saved, the meeting was told, such is the tide of similar deadly plant diseases now coming into Britain on millions of imported plants every year that drastic measures like long quarantine periods and passports for all plants may be needed.</p> <p>In the gloomiest prognosis yet made of the disease now known to be infecting trees in Scotland, East Anglia and possibly Kent, Boyd warned ministers that trees cannot be vaccinated, and the airborne disease would be too expensive to treat chemically. He said the spores first found in Britain in March can be spread even by the moving of leaves.</p> <p>But some ash trees are likely to have natural immunity, he said. \"Older trees infected with ash dieback may weaken but die of other diseases. Trees are more likely to be affected in forests than if they are isolated,\" he said.</p> <p>The government will hold a tree summit next week at which proposals will be discussed by the forestry industries, scientists, charities and nurseries. The most radical suggestion is expected to be for more rigorous border checks on the billions of trees and plants imported into Britain and Europe from around the world every year for parks, gardens, woodlands and forests.</p> <p>\"There is a tidal wave of pathogens coming in. It is terrifying. We have to have a strategic response. Unless we have better biosecurity in the EU and Europe it will be very difficult to stop them coming in. It is difficult to ban all imports. It has to be done on a risk basis,\" said Martin Ward, chief plant health officer at Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency.</p> <p>Other measures expected to be discussed by government include forcing nurseries to attach \"plant passports\" to all imported plants; a new system to ensure all plants are safe before they enter Britain; tighter rules on suppliers; restrictions on the public bringing in plants from abroad; and a radical overhaul of the European plant protection system.</p> <p>But other plant experts on Friday called for stronger measures. Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at Kew Gardens, which has 14,000 trees, told the Guardian a complete ban was needed on imports of any plants that threatened a species, and a one-year quarantine was needed for all plants coming into Britain.</p> <p>\"Ash dieback shows how fragile our woodlands are and how something can turn into a disaster very quickly. Most of us were not even aware of it until very lately.</p> <p>\"There are so many pests and diseases out there. We can buy trees in Italy, France, anywhere nowadays. I don't think we should be allowed to do that. I think there should be bans on anything that threatens a species, and a one year quarantine system for all woodland species coming into Britain. That's the only way we will stop these diseases,\" he said.</p> <p>Joan Webber, principal pathologist at Forest Research, the research agency of the UK Forestry Commission, said: \"There have been more outbreaks of diseases in the past 10 years than we had in the whole of the last century. These organisms reinvent themselves when they move into an unknown habitat. Plants have little or no resistance to them. It can happen very quickly.\" She urged anyone going into woods to clean their boots and to ask nurseries to be more vigilant for diseases.</p> <p>But she said that a full quarantine system on all plants entering Britain would be difficult to work and some plants might not show evidence of disease for nearly two years.</p> <p>\"We cannot immunise trees to special pathogens. In the very long term we can expect the ash population to evolve and reach a new equilibrium. We may be able to control as die back with fungicides but we would need to spray every few weeks over the whole country. It is inconceivable that you could do this without disastrous side effects. The hope of chemical control is extremely unlikely,\" said Mike Shaw, a leading plant scientist at Reading University.</p>",
  "<p>It's part of the grooming process to persuade the victim it's wrong to think badly of the abuser. In that respect, Jimmy Savile groomed the nation. Children rarely said the emperor was naked \u2013 sometimes all too literally. But even when one did, the cry was never taken up. Adults also kept their suspicions quiet, even when they were strong. It seemed wrong to think badly of Savile, though many secretly did.</p> <p>It's telling, this collective failure to point at Savile and suggest he was just the scary, child-catching creature of nightmare he appeared to be. People tend to believe what's easier to bear. Sadly it's easier for a child to bear the idea that they deserve abuse than it is for them to believe the adult world does not protect the innocent.</p> <p>It's also easier to bear the idea that Savile's reign of terror was due to some unique historical confluence, that he slipped though the gap that appeared during a time of great cultural upheaval. This narrative is true enough. Savile exploited the chaos created by changing attitudes \u2013 to sex, class, youth, culture, entertainment, money, fame, even to public services and charity \u2013 that were themselves a response to an industrial age of rapid technological advancement.</p> <p>Recorded sound, recorded pictures, radio, the movies, television \u2013 the rate of&#xa0;change in the ways people communicated with each other was and remains astounding. When all that started, even the reality of mass literacy and popular, printed fiction was still pretty new. But some of the ideas and attitudes that assisted Savile in his unchallenged assaults on the vulnerable have been around for as long as humanity. In some ways, ancient folklore told humans more about their condition than the popular mass market manages to now.</p> <p>Take the story The Emperor's New Clothes itself. The version we all know is Hans Christian Andersen's. But in the traditional folk tale that Andersen used as a source, there is no little boy who speaks out. No one speaks out. The cautionary tale is not about the vanity of&#xa0;leaders, but about general insecurity around paternity: the emperor's new clothes are supposedly invisible only to&#xa0;people who have been duped into accepting the wrong man as their father. Neither the emperor nor any of his subjects admit that they see no garments, because no one \u2013 not even the emperor \u2013 truly trusts what their mothers have told them about their parentage.</p> <p>The old tale highlighted an ugly truth about distrust of female sexual testimony, one echoed in last November's devastating \"just the women\" observation, made by then editor of Newsnight, Peter Rippon, as he canned an investigation into Savile's paedophilia.</p> <p>It wasn't until his conventional retelling was at the printers that Andersen decided to change the ending, introducing a child's voice, speaking truth to power, being universally listened to and believed. Andersen's story, with its happy ending, rather than the harsh lesson of the ancient tale, has lodged in&#xa0;the popular imagination. It was, as stated on the cover of the first edition, part of a collection of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\". Yet adults believed that soothing nonsense, too \u2013 still do. Adults are horrified that no child was heard in criticism of the shell-suited emperor of darkness. Savile is now recognised as a character more suited to a cruel story from the Brothers Grimm than a feel-good tale tickled up by Andersen.</p> <p>Except that those tales, too, are full of evil acts perpetrated by insufficiently maternal women, their child victims saved by handsome princes. No one is politically incorrect enough to berate the mothers of the \"intelligent, emotionally disturbed girls\" Savile preyed on at Duncroft Approved School. But that's largely because the contemporary riposte is: what about their fathers? You&#xa0;might even say that if all the blame can't be dumped on women, then the preference is for no blame to be dumped at all. (Equality is not always progress.)</p> <p>Nevertheless, it's easy to understand how a figure as unlikely as Savile could have been mistaken, by those girls, for a handsome prince. He wore the invisible yet dazzling cloak of celebrity, and promised them the tawdry glamour of television exposure. Savile knew better than anyone that TV is better at concealing than exposing, particularly in the light entertainment department.</p> <p>The novelist Andrew O'Hagan wrote <a href=\"http://cdn.lrb.co.uk/v34/n21/andrew-ohagan/light-entertainment\" title=\"\">a sobering essay</a> in the London Review of Books about how the sexual exploitation of children was the worm in the bud of broadcast light entertainment from the start. O'Hagan outlines the&#xa0;careers of several entertainers of children from the 40s and 50s, all suspected paedophiles that the BBC culture protected.</p> <p>O'Hagan is hard on Savile's audience, suggesting he was \"made to the public's specifications\". He continues: \"Bosses and colleagues who knew what he was doing say he was just being Jimmy. And he was just Jimmy to the public as well. It is the kind of concession a sentimental society makes to its worst deviants.\"</p> <p>O'Hagan is hard, but fair. The public approved of what they sentimentally believed Savile was, not what he actually was. Light entertainment, with&#xa0;its bland promises of true love and innocents rewarded, its staged \"competitions\" for&#xa0;success and its transformations via \"expert advice\", is enjoyed just because it encourages people not to think. The only demands the public makes of light entertainment is to help us to forget our troubles, or provide distraction in the form of troubles greater than our own.</p> <p>TV and celebrity, now more than ever, are credited with the ability to turn an ugly duckling into a swan. That fantasy is what reality shows and talent contests thrive on. Andersen again: The Ugly Duckling was his own composition, and&#xa0;published in the first collection, from which he later dropped that \"for Children\" on the cover. He'd realised by then that his \"fairytales\" were devoured by people of all ages, unlike his novels.</p> <p>The Ugly Duckling is supposedly autobiographical \u2013 Andersen is said to have found out he was the illegitimate child of Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark at some point before he conceived the story. Did he know that already when he prompted a child to say what the adults couldn't, the disempowered adults who weren't sure they knew who their fathers were? Who can say?</p> <p>One thing's for sure, though. The Ugly Duckling, a mendacious tale, has passed into the vernacular. Ducklings grow up into ducks. Cygnets grow up into swans. Mere sentiment persuades us to believe in magical transformation. People looked at Savile and saw an unattractive man from a modest background, clearly a bit weird, but doing it his way, his passion for the new, the young and the popular having made of him an unlikely celebrity swan. If it could happen to Savile, it could happen to anyone \u2026 A&#xa0;fairytale for credulous adults, who opted for The Ugly Duckling over Hansel&#xa0;and Gretel, groomed by their own modest taste in fantasy.</p> <p>Even serious commentators reach for&#xa0;a simple solution in the wake of Savile's exposure: if only society listened to the children, a vast cultural edifice of self-serving sentimentality could be vanquished and child abuse could end. Another simple solution, too&#xa0;simple to be credible, in which other, better, humans come along to dry&#xa0;the tears and fix the damage.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2012.

  "<p>More than 30 alien insects and mites, fungi, bacteria, viruses, diseases, pathogens and invasive plants, many with the potential to devastate native populations, are expected to reach Britain and other European countries in the next few years, according to the European plant protection organisation's <a href=\"http://www.eppo.int/QUARANTINE/Alert_List/alert_list.htm\" title=\"\">alert list</a>.</p> <p>Some could arrive on imported trees and shrubs from Brazil or in soil from China or Africa, others via wooden ornaments and even packaging crates. But plant scientists say no one can predict exactly what ecological impact they will have because they are likely to behave differently in new environments than they do in the places where they have evolved over millennia.</p> <p>When and if they come, they will join at least 10 new organisms that have arrived in the last few years and now threaten swaths of forest and woodland. Some could die out in months and do no damage but others could spread rapidly, as Dutch elm disease did in the 1960s or as ash dieback may do in the next decade, said Joan Webber, principal pathologist and head of the tree health research group at the Forestry Commission. \"There's been a massive jump in the number of pathogens in the last 10 years. It's a combination of climate change , trade and other factors.\"</p> <p>Webber said the fashion for \"instant landscapes\" and the planting of very large trees increased the risks of pathogens and diseases spreading. \"There is a greater appetite for more exotic and bigger plants. Some plants are shipped in from China or elsewhere with 1,000 litres of soil around them. That soil is a black box full of billions of bacteria. It's very difficult to inspect and intercept harmful organisms in large plants.\"</p> <p>It was also increasingly difficult to identify and control new organisms, she said. \"They can reinvent themselves when they move into an unknown habitat. Faced with plants which may have little or no resistance to them, they can change quickly.\"</p> <p>Ash dieback surprised some of Britain's most experienced tree experts. \"Until this happened, I would have thought that the emerald ash borer [a green beetle native to Asia] would have wiped out all our ash trees. It's not here yet but it's on its way,\" said Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum and horticultural services at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.</p> <p>Martin Ward, the UK's chief plant health officer, said the EU plant health regime was not good enough but world trade rules prevented member states imposing outright bans.</p> <p>\"We need a much better early warning system to know what is coming in to Europe. Experts from across Europe must work together more,\" he said. \"The whole system is under review. It will call for more surveys, contingency planning and better regulation of the movement of plants within the EU. But it will take at least a year to be agreed, and it is terrifying what is out there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain, the US and other western powers are backing a new attempt to create a single coherent Syrian opposition that could take part in peace talks with President Bashar al-Assad's regime or, if talks fail, provide a channel for greater military support to the rebels.</p> <p>The plan, to be launched in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday, will bring the external opposition together with the revolutionary councils leading the insurrection inside Syria, behind a common programme for a democratic transition.

Russia, however, opposes the plan, arguing it reneges on <a href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/18F70DBC923963B1C1257A2D0060696B?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">an earlier international agreement</a> to pursue the formation of a new government by \"mutual consent\" of the parties to the conflict. The leadership of the main exile opposition group, the Syrian National Council (SNC), has also criticised the plan, in which its influence will be diluted, and it is not yet clear which of the divided rebel forces inside Syria will turn up on Thursday, or whether they will agree on the common platform once they arrive in Doha.</p> <p>\"It could go as promised, or it could be a train wreck,\" said Salman Shaikh, the head of the Brookings Institution Doha Centre, which had helped arrange earlier opposition discussions that paved the way for the Doha meeting. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/10/18-losing-syria-shaikh\" title=\"\">Shaikh has argued that Syria's collapse as a nation state</a> can only be avoided by unification of the rebels coupled with \"a unified, controlled flow of weapons and other support to the Syrian opposition\" to prevent a power vacuum and a \"free for all\".</p> <p>The US and its western European allies have so far avoided supplying weapons to the rebels, although US intelligence appears to have played a role in trying to control the flow of arms coming from Qatar and other Gulf opponents of the Assad regime. Observers say that if the Doha initiative is successful, Washington's policy might change, allowing heavier weapons to be supplied to the opposition, whoever wins the US election on Tuesday.</p> <p>A western official insisted on Friday that the primary goal of a unified opposition would be to engage in peace talks with the regime about a transition, and so the Doha plan was a way of implementing the <a href=\"http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/%28httpNewsByYear_en%29/18F70DBC923963B1C1257A2D0060696B?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">June Geneva agreement</a>, rather than a substitute for it, as Moscow had alleged.</p> <p>The risks that have so far prevented direct western intervention were made clear on Friday with <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20422\" title=\"\">the emergence of a video</a> apparently showing the execution of captured government soldiers in Idlib province. A rebel fighter from the province, Abu Abdul Rahiem, said the killings took place in al-Nayrab to the west of Saraqeb, on the highway between Aleppo and Damascus, which the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) claimed to have captured on Friday. He claimed the executions were carried out by a Salafist extremist group, operating outside the command structure of the FSA.</p> <p>\"Assad's soldiers were inside a military camp in the town. Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only 10 of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare,\" Rahiem told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.\"</p> <p>Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN human rights council, said the video still had to be verified, but added: \"The allegations are that these these were soldiers who were no longer combatants. And therefore, at this point it looks very likely that this is a war crime, another one.\"</p> <p>Washington's decision to swing its support behind the Doha initiative marked a decisive break with the SNC after months of mounting frustration over the exile group's failure to unite the internal and external opposition.</p> <p>\"We've made it clear that the SNC can no longer be viewed as the visible leader of the opposition,\" the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said on Wednesday. \"They can be part of a larger opposition, but that opposition must include people from inside Syria and others who have a legitimate voice that needs to be heard.\"</p> <p>SNC leaders dismissed the Doha plan. The group <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20121102-syrias-snc-accuses-us-undermining-revolution\" title=\"\">issued a statement</a> saying that any attempt to create new bodies to replace the SNC \"are an attempt to undermine the Syria revolution by sowing the seeds of division\".</p> <p>The SNC will hold a congress of its own starting on Saturday in Doha, aimed at restructuring the organisation and electing a new leadership. That new leadership will have to decide by Thursday whether to take up about 15 seats on the 50-member SNI council which have been reserved for it.</p> <p>\"The SNC has not been able to provide a broad-based platform,\" Shaikh said. \"They've been asked to cut themselves down to size. Fifteen seats would still leave them the biggest single group by far. Most other groups will be represented by just one person.\"</p> <p>A western official said: \"It is important for the SNC to know that there will be very little tolerance for them if they try to play the spoilers at the Thursday meeting.\"</p> <p>The official said that the Qatar government had made great efforts to ensure that the internal opposition, including the revolutionary councils, would take part in the meeting. Western observers are also due to attend, including the British envoy to the Syrian opposition, John Wilkes, but have not played a central role in the organisation.</p> <p>\"The Qataris have played their cards close to their chest and its not clear they want the same things as us,\" the western official said.</p>",
  "<p>Before making landfall on the shores of South New Jersey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a> pounded Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba, leaving massive destruction in its wake. There were few boots on the ground from the western media to cover the effects on these Caribbean countries.</p> <p>But when it became clear that the New York region would bear the full force of Sandy, the news media deployed their own massive force to cover every movement of the story. The networks and local television stations battled to show which reporter was bravest as they fed us live feeds of journalists standing in the middle of the hurricane.</p> <p>The resilience and heroism of average people were the narrative the day after the storm. The dead were rightly given a face and their lives memorialised.</p> <p>But we seldom see these kinds of reportage out of places like Haiti, a country that has seen more natural disasters than the richest countries would be able to handle adequately, let alone one of the poorest nations on Earth.</p> <p>Hurricane Sandy drenched the country's south with more than 20 inches of rainfall. As the rivers receded, allowing officials to travel through the storm-drenched southern peninsula, the death toll rose to 52.</p> <p>In Cuba, 200,000 homes were damaged by the hurricane.</p> <p>In the Bahamas, the total cost of damage to private property and public infrastructure is expected to reach $300m, according to a report from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. That total would be higher than last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/29/hurricane-irene-claims-lives-destruction\" title=\"\">Hurricane Irene</a>, which caused about $250m in damage to the island chain east of Florida.</p> <p>But where in all this week's media coverage are the human-interest stories out of the Caribbean? Do we hear about the resilience of the Bahamian people and how they will restore their economy? What about those dead? So far there hasn't been any and I don't expect to be reading about it from any western publication. Part of the definition of news is proximity and western media companies rarely go out of their way to bring thoughtful vivid human stories of places far away.</p> <p>The last time Haiti was covered under the bright lights of the western media was the fabled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/13/tsunami-alert-haiti-earthquake-disaster\" title=\"\">earthquake that hit the mountainous country on 12 January 2010</a>. It was no surprise to me that the bulk of the stories filed from parachute journalists consisted of the heroics of the aid workers and rescue and mission teams that had flown in to help the survivors and victims of this tragedy.</p> <p>But in Haiti, like many other places, locals pulled together and helped each other. The first responders were indeed Haitians. It took the international cavalcade days to reach Haiti and by then most of the death and destruction had already occurred.</p> <p>The world simply didn't get a complete picture of the reality on the ground then, just as we didn't get the impact of Sandy on Haiti. That hurricane flooded Les Cayes, the third largest city in Haiti. Sandy has exacerbated a Cholera epidemic that has been difficult for the Haitian government to control and has put an added burden on a country that has experienced a string of natural disasters since 2004.</p> <p>\"I am launching an appeal to international solidarity to come and help the population, to help support the completion of our efforts towards saving lives and property,\" <a href=\"http://uk.weather.com/partners-hurricanes/haiti\" title=\"\">Haiti's prime minister, Laurent Lamothe, said on Wednesday</a>.

It often feels quite earnest. Jane (cleverly played by Sarah Malin) is the stereotype of the hard-bitten female reporter who believes that, when it comes to getting the story, the means always justify the ends, even if those means include betraying someone's trust. Ray's daughter Ana, a media-studies student and blogger, is too convenient a character: her only purpose is to set up a tension between old journalism and the rise of the blogger.

  "<p>\"Right \u2026 No, no, 'votefromabroad' is all run together. Then a dot. Then org.\"</p> <p>In the Great Portland Street office of Democrats Abroad, men with perfect teeth are explaining how to vote to expats down the phoneline who apparently have never used the internet before.</p> <p>The atmosphere in the London offices is not exactly tense \u2013 it's not the White House situation room, after all \u2013 but nobody is in much mood to mess around.</p> <p>There are 6.3 million Americans living outside the US and in a close election like this one absentee ballots are a big deal. \"Where we can make a difference still, we will be doing everything we can to make a difference,\" Susan Schoenfeld Harrington explains. \"People are very fired up, they recognise how important an election this is. What's been happening in the past few days with hurricane Sandy has underlined the real differences between candidates, and what kind of government they believe in.\"</p> <p>I'm surprised by how much latitude there is in the deadlines \u2013 a lot of states will take an absentee ballot so long as it's postmarked 6 November, the big election day itself. Of the relevant states \u2013 there are only about seven with a real chance of swinging the result \u2013 Iowa, Colorado and Pennsylvania will still count your ballot paper if they get it the week after.</p> <p>Apart from sheer numbers, the other good reason \u2013 if you're a Democrat \u2013 to concentrate on Americans living abroad is that Mitt Romney has almost no support anywhere outside the US. Two <a href=\"http://normantranscript.com/community-news-network/x1095518407/How-the-world-would-vote-in-the-U-S-election\" title=\"\">rather mischievous polls</a> \u2013 one by the BBC and one by UPI \u2013 asked the world how it would vote in the US election. Only one country of 32 \u2013 Israel \u2013 would go Romney. There was a very slight preference (14% to 11%) for Romney over Obama in Pakistan, but against a background that most people thought either result totally catastrophic.</p> <p>One might reasonably suppose, given the untranslatability of the Romney charm, that US citizens living abroad might have a more cosmopolitan, Obama-friendly aspect.</p> <p>But in the Democrat campaign room, nobody but Susan is allowed to say what they think.

Although that is quite droll, most of the attacks have been unfunny, with the vitriol of a very polarised debate.</p> <p>There is a growing consensus that the middle ground has disappeared, that people are approaching politics as they would sporting affiliations, avidly, unquestioningly and passionately (not necessarily in a nice way), and politicians play up to that, exaggerating their differences in public while cutting deals quite happily behind the scenes.</p> <p>It's not just the modern, post-Clinton, third-way strategising that's led to this, and not all the polarisation is pantomime. Politicians have been tapping racism for electoral advantage since the 70s. The so-called \"southern strategy\" set out to deliberately deter black people from voting Republican, so that white racists who might be Democrats otherwise would be irresistibly pulled rightwards by their desire to vote with other white people.

  "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing to enter talks with regulators to settle Libor-rigging claims, its chief executive said on Friday, as the bailed-out bank prepares to face a major fine for the attempted manipulation of the key interest rate.</p> <p>As RBS revealed that the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal was now costing it \u00a31.7bn, Stephen Hester said he would be disappointed if he did not have more news on the scale of the Libor situation by the time the bank reported its full-year results in February.</p> <p>The bank, just over 80% owned by the taxpayer, does not yet know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">if the fine it incurs will be larger than the \u00a3290m penalty paid by Barclays</a> to the Financial Services Authority and regulators in the United States. Even if the fine is smaller, Hester said it would be a \"miserable day in RBS's history\".</p> <p>Hester said the \"explosive\" reaction to the Barclays fine \u2013 which forced the departure of the chief executive Bob Diamond \u2013 may be a factor considered by regulators. \"We are up for settling with all and every one as soon as they are ready,\" he said.</p> <p>While preparing the ground for a large Libor fine, RBS also bore the cost of the PPI mis-selling scandal, now regarded as the costliest mis-selling scandal in the UK, taking an extra \u00a3400m provision. Finance director Bruce van Saun described the total \u00a31.7bn charge as a \"best guesstimate\" and said the bank had been \"guilty of underestimating the response rate\" from customers.</p> <p>Asked if any bankers had been disciplined for the PPI scandal, Hester said all the senior managers had left but indicated there had not been a clawback of bonuses because that provision was not included in contracts until 2009. \"The industry has to take its medicine on PPI,\" said Hester, who has already axed bonuses linked to sales targets for branch staff.</p> <p>The PPI provision contributed <a href=\"http://www.investors.rbs.com/download/announcements/full_announcement_11_2012.pdf?utm_source=rbscomnews&amp;utm_medium=bodylink&amp;utm_campaign=2012Q3IMS\" title=\"\">to a \u00a31.2bn loss</a> in the third quarter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/04/rbs-fresh-hit-greek-government-bonds\" title=\"\">versus a \u00a32bn profit a year ago</a>. For the nine-month period the bank reported a \u00a32.7bn loss, against \u00a31.2bn profit a year ago. An accounting rule requiring RBS to take account of the cost of buying back its debt also fed into the loss for the quarter, as did a \u00a350m charge for the summer's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/28/rbs-denies-cost-cutting-it-crisis\" title=\"\">IT meltdown</a>, taking the total charge to \u00a3175m.</p> <p>Hester, who was parachuted in to run the bank in October 2008 when Fred Goodwin was ousted, said the bank's restructuring plan would be completed by the next election but any attempt by the government to cut its stake was likely to depend on economic growth and the share price.</p> <p>\"Plausibly, we can be ready. Whether our share price is ready and the government is ready is not in our control,\" said Hester. The shares closed 2% lower at 280p, well below the 500p average at which the government's near-80% stake was bought, a loss of about \u00a318bn.</p> <p>\"We have already made much progress, though clearly not enough, and our reputation will take time to recover from past events which are still being accounted for,\" said Hester.</p> <p>The bank, which has axed 9,000 staff in the past 12 months and 37,000 since the 2008 crisis, is being forced to sell off parts of its business to meet EU rules linked to the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout.</p> <p>RBS has sold a third of the Direct Line insurance business but has run into difficulty with the sale of 316 branches to Santander, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/12/rbs-branch-sale-santander-falls-\" title=\"\">which pulled out last month.</a> Hester said RBS was unlikely to ask the EU to reverse its decision.</p> <p>The sales process has been resumed, and the branches could be floated off under the brand name Williams &amp; Glyn, first created in the early 1970s but disused from 1985.</p> <p>RBS is also under pressure to consider the sale of its Citizens operation in the US but Hester indicated that the bank wanted to have a geographic spread of businesses.</p>",

But the decision not to cancel the event, which starts Sunday at 9.30am on Staten Island, has led to widespread criticism. Some residents and elected officials have said it could divert essential resources from the recovery operation.<br> James Oddo, a council member for Staten Island, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-residents-plead-article-1.1195599\">described the decision as \"idiotic\".</a><br> Paul Fernandez, 24, who lives in Oakwood, Staten Island, told the Guardian: \"I think it is bullshit. We need some help down here. We need help fixing the benches, fixing people's houses \u2013 nobody is helping us here, nobody is saying anything.\"</p> <p>Fernandez feared the number of dead would rise. \"They are going to continue to find bodies, over and over again,\" Fernandez said.<br> The bodies of the two Moore children were found on Thursday after a three-day search by police. Their mother had been evacuating them to a shelter when her SUV stalled in rising floodwater. \"Terrible, absolutely terrible,\" police commissioner Raymond Kelly said after the grim discovery: \"It just compounds all the tragic aspects of this horrific event.\" There was some good news for residents in Manhattan. The utilities giant <a href=\"http://www.coned.com/\">ConEdison</a> said it hoped to have restored power to many homes and offices in lower Manhattan on Friday.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority added more subway services in New York on Friday, although there was still no service through lower Manhattan and heavy traffic was reported around the city. More services were added on the Long Island Railroad.<br> Amtrak said it expected to restore limited service on the New York to Washington DC and Boston line.</p>",
  "<p>As Italy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/28/serie-a-violence-match-fixing\" title=\"\">struggles to bring football violence under control</a>, a new board game celebrating the exploits of rampaging hooligans has been denounced by government officials.</p> <p>Modelled on Monopoly and selling for \u20ac49, Play Ultras swaps the car, the hat and the boot for miniature hooligans armed with belts, sticks and bars.</p> <p>Players must pass helmeted, baton-wielding riot police figurines to reach a football stadium. The winner is the player who can get the largest number of his pieces into the stadium to watch the game, while avoiding a stay in hospital.</p> <p>\"This is not a positive or educational game and seems designed simply to make money,\" said Roberto Massucci, the vice president of Italy's National Observatory for Sporting Events, part of the interior ministry.</p> <p>Giacomo Lonzi, one of the game's developers, defended Play Ultras and insisted he was not encouraging violence. \"I am an ex-ultra against any form of violence,\" he told Corriere della Sera. \"The message is: go wild on the board with the dice \u2013 but stay calm when you go to a match.\"</p> <p>At least 1,000 copies of Play Ultras have reportedly been sold since its launch this week at a games and comics fair in Lucca. An English-language version is in the works.</p> <p>Massucci said Italian football was cleaning up its act after years of clashes between ultras and riot police. \"Fighting your way past the police to get to the stadium is over, so at best this game is a way for people to relive something that doesn't happen any more,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If I was an ultra I would be offended since it defines ultras as people who smash up stations and clash with police and they are not all like that.\"</p>",

Now the company behind it has a new app, which helps you understand which apps are sucking up data, breaking down usage over the month, with pretty graphs.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/summly/id488689465?mt=8\">Summly (Free)</a></h2> <p>Summly promises \"pocket sized news for iPhone\", trawling hundreds of news sites, pulling in articles from their RSS feeds, then turning them into 400-character summaries, which can be flipped through using a neat gestural interface. For more on the company behind it's intentions, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/01/summly-iphone-app-news\">read our interview</a>.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/in-play/id564522300?mt=8\">in:play (\u00a31.49)</a></h2> <p>If you're pondering an alternative to the default iPhone music player, in:play is well worth a look. Not least because of its striking typography-focused design, gestural controls and some seriously nifty navigation to root through even the largest digital music collection.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brian-coxs-wonders-universe/id508465867?mt=8\">Brian Cox's Wonders of the Universe (\u00a33.99)</a></h2> <p>Scientist Brian Cox's planetary app has been out for a while on iPad, but now publisher HarperCollins has released a native iPhone version too, boiling down its text, videos and photography to something that works well on smaller screens.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/howdo/id570202390?mt=8\">HowDo (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is very neat: an app \"to show you how to do stuff in the real world\", with the tutorials coming from other people using the HowDo app. The idea being that you can shoot photos, associate up to eight-second sound recordings with them, and then share them with the community, following other users who seem knowledgable.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/threadlife/id572125383?mt=8\">Threadlife (Free)</a></h2> <p>Threadlife is picking up a fair bit of buzz this week, thanks to its aim to make \"shooting video as easy as taking photos\". That involves shooting three-second video clips, which are then \"stitched\" together into longer stories, or \"threads\", including your own videos and/or those of other users.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/viz-profanisaurus-das-krapital/id458591699?mt=8\">Viz Profanisaurus Das Krapital \u00a31.49</a></h2> <p>Dennis Publishing pleased fans of Viz with the launch of its Profanisaurus iPhone app earlier in 2012. Now there's an iPad version of the sweary dictionary, offering 12,000 definitions too rude to read to your grandparents.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/path/id403639508?mt=8\">Path (Free)</a></h2> <p>Social app Path has fervent fans, who love its status as a more private version of Facebook and other services. It's traditionally been a smartphone thing, but now it's available on iPad too, with bigger photos and film/music/book previews, as well as the ability to see your whole day's posts in an attractive landscape view. It makes very good use of the larger screen.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/james-bond-50-years-movie/id554188790?mt=8\">James Bond: 50 Years of Movie Posters</a></h2> <p>As cinemagoers get excited about the new Bond film Skyfall, there's an app from DK showcasing some of the poster art that promoted previous films. 105 posters are featured, with accompanying text from \"Bond expert\" (now that's a job worth having) Alastair Dougall.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wreck-it-ralph-storybook-deluxe/id570319431?mt=8\">Wreck-It Ralph Storybook Deluxe (\u00a34.99)</a></h2> <p>Talking of movies, Disney has launched an iOS book-app for its animated film Wreck-It Ralph, which tells the story for children with voice narration, animation, clips from the film and a racing game where kids get to build their own kart.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/happy-places-by-coca-cola/id567232249?mt=8\">Happy Places by Coca-Cola (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is pretty surprising: a photo-sharing app from Coca-Cola, with a clean and stylish design, and the ability to share shots out to Facebook or Twitter, as well as Coke's own Happy Places community. The question is whether this kind of branded app will tempt anyone away from Instagram, Facebook Camera, Path and other popular apps.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bubble-guppies-animal-school/id567249360?mt=8\">Bubble Guppies: Animal School Day (\u00a31.99)</a></h2> <p>There are a number of big entertainment companies getting into app-education (appducation?), with MTV the latest. Its new app aims to teach children about animals: what they're like, where they live, and what they eat. Rewards, a doghouse to decorate and the option to register up to four children separately with the app should be a hit with parents.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/linktv-world-news-free-videos/id550263630?mt=8\">LinkTV World News (Free)</a></h2> <p>iPad app LinkTV has a focus on international news, aggregating videos from broadcasters around the world tied to topical events, as well as text articles, documentaries and personalisation features.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/18-months/id571729033?mt=8\">18 Months (Free)</a></h2> <p>Calvin Harris has a new album out, and there's an app for that. And unusually, the app lets fans stream the album in full, with one caveat: they have to dance. A simple yet fun motion-detecting feature ensures that songs will play as long as the user is dancing \u2013&#xa0;or at least moving the phone.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-xx/id394653020?mt=8\">The xx (Free)</a></h2> <p>The xx's last album Coexist has a very slinky iOS app that's just come out, offering high-definition videos for every song on the album, interactive artwork, and the promise of messages and news from the band, as well as ticketing details.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/junior-astronaut-breaking/id568831665?mt=8\">Junior Astronaut - Breaking through the space barrier (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is another excellent education app for children, this time from UK firms Immediate Media and Crank Publishing. Aimed at 9-15 year-olds, it focuses on space travel: rockets, gravity and other topics, with a look and feel inspired by children's space books from the 1950s and 60s. It's free, with an in-app purchase of \u00a33.99 unlocking the whole book-app.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/oakley-airwave/id561551472?mt=8\">Oakley Airwave (Free)</a></h2> <p>This one's for snow-sports fans, claiming to be \"the perfect app to enhance your day on the mountain\".

Like most fashion mags, really, but of course the key thing here is that the buying is built into the magazine. Monogram is a hint at how many of the more established fashion magazines will develop in their digital incarnations.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/huffpost-live/id572584499?mt=8\">HuffPost Live (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is only available in the US for now, but it's an interesting sign of the way Huffington Post is developing: \"a live-streaming video network that uses the most engaging stories on The Huffington Post as the jumping-off point for real-time conversations and commentary\". The idea being that readers (viewers? users?) join in with the debates.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/beamr/id560470786?mt=8\">Beamr (Free)</a></h2> <p>Beamr sounds like a novelty at first, turning your photos into \"a glossy-style magazine with a custom cover\". But look closer, and there's a much better hook here: the ability to share photos at their original resolutions as shot on the iPhone, including the new panoramic shots. People you share them with can view, download and print the pics, too.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/creatorverse/id563088306?mt=8\">Creatorverse (\u00a32.99)</a></h2> <p>Linden Lab's main business is virtual world Second Life, but you won't see any 3D avatars in its new iPad app. Instead, this is a playful physics app that gets you to create... things, using joints, motors, forces, teleporters and other items. Then watch them in motion: \"From the simplest bouncing ball to an elaborate pinball machine\".<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/djz-txt/id569992903?mt=8\">DJZ TxT (Free)</a></h2> <p>DJZ is a brand new website devoted to dance music (or, as the US would have it, \"EDM\"). It has just launched, with a spin-off app that isn't about presenting the site's content at all. Instead, it's a messaging app with the twist that you can include graphical \"emojis\" (emoticons) that act as beats and loops. \"Every conversation is a new remix,\" notes the App Store listing. Which sounds silly, but it's actually enormous fun.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/thoughtful-gift-finder/id571641021?mt=8\">Thoughtful Gift Finder (Free)</a></h2> <p>When you've finished making dubstep-scronk messages, how about thinking of someone else for a change? Thoughtful Gift Finder does exactly what its name implies: released by Notonthehighstreet.com, it's a way to research gifts for friends and family, based on some of their key characteristics. More than 60,000 products are covered.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sooty-paint/id553995896?mt=8\">Sooty Paint (\u00a31.99)</a></h2> <p>Sooty is 64 now, y'know. He's making his first appearance in an iPad app though, along with friends Sweep, Soo and Richard from his TV show. The app focuses on digital painting, with 20 pictures for children to colour in, and a blank canvas to come up with their own creations.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pc-pro-enhanced/id537178956?mt=8\">PC Pro Enhanced (Free)</a></h2> <p>Another app from Dennis Publishing, but this time with less swearing and more computers. A digital version of PC Pro magazine, it includes more photography and podcast snippets alongside kit reviews, as well as product comparison features. The app charges \u00a39.99 a quarter for the digital issues.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hotukdeals/id570702323?mt=8\">HotUKDeals (Free)</a></h2> <p>British website HotUKDeals gathers discounts, deals and vouchers from a host of retailers and sites. Now it's got an app, which adds location into the mix to pinpoint nearby savings, while also letting you rate and comment on deals, or add those you've found yourself.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/first-scene/id568858490?mt=8\">First@Scene (Free)</a></h2> <p>This app comes from the Australian branch of St John Ambulance, and wants to help reduce road accident deaths and serious injuries, providing advice for anyone who finds themselves in a position to help after a car crash. Text, photos and revision questions all feature.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/trucks-byron-barton/id555415515?mt=8\">Trucks - Byron Barton (\u00a30.69)</a></h2> <p>Byron Barton's Trucks book will be familiar to parents around the world: a colourful children's book covering trucks of all shapes and sizes. This is a digitised version of the book, with interactivity and features to help young (2-5) children practise their fledgling reading skills.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/shatoetry/id564219788?mt=8\">Shatoetry (\u00a31.99)</a></h2> <p>And last, something ridiculous: an official app from William Shatner in which the Star Trek veteran has recorded a host of words, which you can then string together into sentences to hear him say them. The idea being you compose poetry (sorry, \"Shatisms\" \u2013&#xa0;one senses the developer hasn't tested the lingo on Brits), or create them with friends through the app's Game Center integration.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <p>That's our selection, but what new iOS apps have you been using this week?

What we're looking at here is a London with hardly any children, populated by high earning couples living side by side with doss houses (or houses of multiple occupation, as I believe the polite description is) stuffed full of transient workers, while towns like Hastings and Margate face a massive influx of children without sufficient school places to fit them all in. And of course one of the inevitable outcomes of this huge influx of people will be an increase in the average rent in these places, especially as the government have set maximum rents which will soon become the standard rent once landlords realise they can achieve them by renting to claimants.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19193838\"><strong>synthesizer</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Soon, no more poor in London.

And how those who are left will rejoice, as finally they are able to live in the sort of city that will only accommodate those on an appropriate wage. Childcare costs will, of course, spiral upwards precipitously along with council taxes and some local services will simply no longer be available because there is no one to do them. Who will be delivering your post, when the area is too expensive for anyone as plebian as a postman to want to live anywhere near it? And forget about bin men! Priced out!

I believe that most of the elms that are around now are not that old yet. I think the trouble is that, 1: we think that everything in the natural world works in the same way the we do; 2: that we can ignore things until the last minute because if it doesn't happen we don't need to spend any money on it; 3: that we can dick about with nature without there being any consequences; and 4: that we know everything about how nature works simply because we are human and can operate bunsen burners thanks to our opposable thumbs and vastly superior intellect. All of which is, of course, bollocks. What is more likely to be true is that until everyone working in horticulture and land management (including conservation as well as commercial) understands all the interactions within and between ecosystems we can't say we understand what we are really doing and should apply the precautionary princpile to everything we do.

  "<p>Adineh and Rana are women from very different sides of the track. Wealthy, modern and rebellious, Adineh has fled the family home, harbouring a secret desire to become a man. Rana, from a conservative religious background, gives her a lift in the taxi she has been forced to drive since her husband was sent to jail.</p> <p>The burgeoning relationship between the two forms the heart of Facing Mirrors, a film that hit cinemas in Tehran this week and brought the taboo subject of transsexuality to the big screen for the first time.</p> <p>One of the many astonishing paradoxes about life in the Islamic republic is that transsexuality has been legal since a fatwa was issued in 1987 by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Indeed, Iran permits more sex-change operations than any other country, except Thailand, and has long subsidised such surgeries. But, though transsexuals may have the support of the government, they remains highly controversial figures among the public.</p> <p>The religious ruling was issued thanks to the activities in the 1980s of Maryam Khatoon Molkara, a campaigner for the rights of transsexuals in Iran, who wrote to Khomeini asking him to determine their fate. Molkara had herself previously been a man, and worked for the state TV before the Islamic revolution in 1979. In the mid-70s, she started to write to Khomeini, who was in exile, asking for religious authorisation for a sex-change operation. In 1987, after a decade of campaigning, she went in person to the home of Khomeini, by then the country's supreme leader, and came back with a fatwa in hand that allowed transsexuals to choose their sex.</p> <p>Before making the film, its producer Fereshteh Taerpour said she did not even know the fatwa existed. \"At the beginning, it was very strange for me to find out that sex-change operation is permitted in Iran,\" she told the Guardian. \"The authorities give loans and even issue new ID cards after the surgery, something that is not legal in many countries.\"</p> <p>Despite the fatwa, transsexuality is rarely discussed in public. The release of Facing Mirrors, which has attracted a great deal of attention, has created an opportunity for Iranian media to address the issue. Even the state-run television and radio channels, which typically avoid such topics, have reported on the film.</p> <p>\"Some of the young transsexuals who have seen the film have become so excited that they are now campaigning to encourage others to watch it,\" said Taerpour. Among its fans is Saman Arastu, a well-known Iranian actor who has himself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/19/iranian-actor-sex-change\" title=\"\">undergone a sex-change operation</a>. For Taerpour, the status of transsexuals in Iranian society is encapsulated in what Adineh's father says of her in the film: \"I wish she was blind, dead, handicapped but not disgraced.\"</p> <p>Soheil, a 33-year-old Iranian who has also had surgery, said the support of the law does not mean immunity fromharassment from various other state institutions.</p> <p>Unlike transsexuality, homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran, but Soheil believes that being transgender is even more difficult than being gay or lesbian.</p> <p>\"When you're a transsexual, your appearance changes and that's something that many Iranian families can never come to terms with,\" he said. \"But when you're gay, your family might tolerate you as long as you keep your sexuality secret.\"</p> <p>For Shadi Amin, an Iranian rights campaigner based in Germany, the quality of sex-change operations in Iran is so poor that it amounts to little more than \"butchery\". She said: \"In a democratic society, a sex-change operation is an option for transsexuals, but in Iran it's an obligation for their survival.\"</p> <p>Amin pointed out that when a transsexual died after a failed operation in the central city of Isfahan earlier this year, she was denied an Islamic ritual washing before burial \u2013 by both men and women.</p> <p>It has not helped Iranian sexual minorities that there's a confusion within society over differences between being a homosexual and transsexual. Many parents are believed to have forced their homosexual children to have sex-change operations, while psychologists and psychiatrists who still deem homosexuality as a mental illness have been known to prescribe \"cures\".</p> <p>Bronwen Robertson, the director of operations behind a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/17/iran-persecution-gay-community-revealed\" title=\"\">recent detailed report on Iran's LGBT community</a>, said the issue over the confusion is far more complex.</p> <p>\"[The confusion] partially stems from the fact that Iranian law delineates homosexuality as a capital crime and transsexuality as a scientific, and 'correctable', anomaly,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The pressure, from both state and society, on young Iranians to conform to societal norms and adhere to tradition and specific behavioural codes is immense. Therefore, it is not surprising that many young gay and lesbian Iranians, who do not identify as transgender, say they have felt pressured to undergo surgery.\"</p>",
  "<p>The memory of Bush versus Gore will be hanging over next Tuesday's election like a black cloud. Could it be possible that, as in 2000, we wake up on Wednesday morning with the next occupant of the White House still undecided?</p> <p>Quite possible, says Professor Edward Foley, an expert in election law at Ohio State University. He estimates, based on his knowledge of the legal landscape and his reading of the polls, that there could be up to a 1% chance of the outcome of the election still being in the balance beyond next Tuesday.</p> <p>He goes further. He says that the US should embrace the possibility of a delayed result as a necessary and healthy part of the electoral process in the advent of a very close race. \"Just because we are forced into overtime on 7 November doesn't automatically mean we are in crisis,\" he says. \"Such uncertainty is not a reason for panic.\"</p> <p>Here are some possible doomsday scenarios that could leave us still guessing next Wednesday morning:</p> <h2>Storm Sandy</h2> <p>As the fallout of the storm continues to play out across several north-eastern states, the question arises could major disruption to voting centres cause a delay. It's possible, though highly unlikely, that Congress could pass legislation postponing the election. Federal officials have indicated that individual states should decide. Those most affected by the storm, notably New Jersey and New York, are so firmly Democratic that there is no doubt about their outcome. Virginia is the only battleground that has been heavily affected, yet latest estimates suggest power should be restored in most areas of the state by Friday.</p> <h2>Too close to call</h2> <p>It's possible that a state whose crop of electoral votes could determine the identity of the next president \u2013 Florida with 29 votes, perhaps, or Ohio with 18 \u2013 could be so close that either candidate refuses to concede and demands a recount. Florida's recount debacle in 2000 famously went all the way to the US supreme court and was finally awarded to George Bush by just 537 votes. It's also possible that several states are too close to call, leading to a multiple agony of indecision. That happened in 1916, with America's position in the first world war hanging on the election, when so many states were exceptionally close that Woodrow Wilson's victory over Charles Hughes was delayed for many days. In 1876, four states were in dispute, pushing back the victory of Rutherford Hayes for months to the eve of his March inauguration.</p> <p>If a recount happened in Ohio next week it could delay the final result of the presidential race until 11 December.</p> <h2>Provisional ballots</h2> <p>In an attempt to avoid the 2000 snarl-up repeating itself, Congress passed the 2002 Help America Vote Act to try and modernise the system. That has increased the role of provisional ballots, which are cast by voters where there is a question mark over their eligibility and are counted after election day. Several swing states \u2013 for instance Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia \u2013 have had substantial numbers of provisional ballots in recent elections. The phenomenon is particularly acute in the key battleground state of Ohio where more than 200,000 provisional ballots were cast in 2008. Were sufficient provisional ballots cast this year in Ohio to put a close result in jeopardy, then the outcome in Ohio and thus potentially in the entire presidential race <a href=\"http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/freefair/index.php?ID=9905\">could be delayed until 17 November</a>.</p> <h2>Absentee and military ballots</h2> <p>It is conceivable that a dispute could erupt over absentee or military ballots in a very close race. Consider what happened in Minnesota in 2008, where Al Franken's eventually successful challenge to the incumbent senator Norm Coleman was delayed by more than seven months by wrangling over absentee ballots.</p> <p>Colorado, Florida and Virginia all have large military bases and are therefore likely to have a substantial number of military ballots which could be important in a razor-close vote.</p> <h2>A 269-269 tie</h2> <p>It takes 270 electoral votes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/28/us-electoral-college-explained\">to earn the keys to the White House</a>. It is theoretically possible that there could be a tie between Obama and Romney of 269 votes to 269. In that event, the House of Representatives would choose the president in a ballot to be held in January in which each state delegation in the House would have one vote. The vice-president would be chosen by the Senate. <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/28/opinion/la-oe-klotsche-electoral-college-apocalypse-20121028\">Pundits have had a lot of fun</a> envisaging the remote prospect that Mitt Romney is elected Republican president with Joe Biden as his Democratic vice-president.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> Los Angeles.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Miles Michaud (vocals, guitar), Matt Correia (drums), Spencer Dunham (bass) and Pedrum Siadation (lead guitar).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> On their self-titled debut album, LA four-piece Allah-Las offer a compact precis of UK and US 60s rock styles, from surf to garage, beat boom rock to jangle-pop. There's even a bit of bossa nova in there. It's like a compilation featuring the Byrds, Love, the Rolling Stones, the Animals and Burt Bacharach, which you'll doubtless agree would be a fairly strong collection, and probably why Allah-Las has been getting such ecstatic reviews from retro British rock monthlies used to lionising the original exponents of these forms \u2013 as well as America's hipper forums.</p> <p>In theory it's an odd combination of sounds and eras to have sitting side by side on one record \u2013 the raw, dark energy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/06/rolling-stones-rocknroll-adventures-booth\" title=\"\">the Crawdaddy Club</a> mingling with the sun-kissed spirit of California, equal parts swinging London and Sunset Strip \u2013 but it works, as you'll hopefully be able to tell if you go and see the band as they <a href=\"http://www.shacklewellarms.com/listings/eventdetails/10-dec-12-allahlas-the-shacklewell-arms/\" title=\"\">make their UK live debut on 10 December at London's Shacklewell Arms</a>.</p> <p>They all used to work at Hollywood's famous record shop <a href=\"http://www.amoeba.com/\" title=\"\">Amoeba</a>, where they decided to put their love of vintage vinyl to practical use. \"We wanted to make the kind of music we weren't hearing being made by contemporary bands,\" they have said, \"free of digital effects and synthesised sounds, groovy and danceable in a way that wasn't aggressive.\"</p> <p>\"Groovy and danceable\": the music on Allah-Las recalls that pre-disco age when kids would dance to rock'n'roll. Don't be fooled by the high tempos, though \u2013 the album was made as the four members' relationships with their other halves fell apart, and as a consequence the songs are suffused with melancholy, with references to \"what we had is gone\" and flying \"too close to the sun\". To achieve the authentic sound, meanwhile, the band recorded at <a href=\"http://www.voiceplaces.com/the-distillery-studio-orange-county-2956493-l/\" title=\"\">the Distillery</a>, a small studio south of LA crammed to burst with period paraphernalia and gadgetry, with producer and R&amp;B (original variety) whizz <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/event/music/157292030/nick-waterhouse-the-now-sound-from-way-back\" title=\"\">Nick Waterhouse</a> manning the analogue equipment. The effect is stunning, if you're in the mood for some crackle with your pop.</p> <p>Album opener Catamaran employs numerous period signifiers, and is heavy on the shakers and reverb, with a lyric (\"I wanna be your man\" indeed) that does some of the work of plunging you into a bygone age. Don't You Forget It has the tambourine percussiveness and vocal feyness of the era being evoked, the title streaked with the mildly vengeful quality of the young Jagger. Busman's Holiday has the rudimentary, <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8f/Nuggets,_Volume_1.jpg/220px-Nuggets,_Volume_1.jpg\" title=\"\">primeval clatter of the Nuggets bands</a>. On Long Journey, Miles Michaud's mean rasp recalls <a href=\"http://ericburdon.ning.com/\" title=\"\">Eric Burdon</a>'s and the innocently earthy sexuality of the early 60s.

Fighters from the Salafi Dawood brigade overran the camp and captured the soldiers. Initially there were only ten of them so they could not take the soldiers captive, and had to kill them immediately. No trial could be held because the fighting was still going on. This is guerrilla warfare.</p> <p>The soldiers there included snipers who had shot four fighters from the Dawood brigade. </p> <p>The Dawood brigade and the Suqur Al-Sham organisation do not answer to any military council affiliated to the FSA. They work independently and have their own leader whom they call Ameer and his name is Abu Issa.</p> <p>Yesterday we had a demonstration in Jebal al-Zawiyia and we raised banners in response to Hillary Clinton's statement that Assad's end is imminent. We said: \"al-Qaida arrival\u2019s in Syria is imminent too.\"</p> <p>We do not wish to turn Syria into another Afghanistan, but we can't stop these extremists groups. We are really worried about the future of Syria. We need weapons and media support, but there is nothing on the ground.</p> <p>We have four Salafi groups who are fighting in Idlib province. The biggest group is Jabhat al-Nusra which has members all over Syria. There is also the Ansar al-Islam group, the Majless al-Shura group and Suqur al-Sham group.</p> <p>These Salafi groups are gaining support in Idlib province as they are well equipped unlike the FSA brigades. People also admire their bravery.</p> <p>They are tough fighters and when they get hold of soldiers, they kill them at once.</p> <p>They are getting more powerful and in in the future could start forcing people to follow sharia law. It is a big problem.</p> <p>They are so strict about new recruits. If someone smokes or does not pray that much, he is not accepted. They only accept hardliners and we have few Syrians hardliners here. All the suicide fighters come from outside of Syria. Most of the suicide fighters are Saudis.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;output=embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;View &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;amp;msid=200547086913577029119.0004cd806677ade01716d&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;ll=35.876533,36.76403&amp;amp;spn=0.097366,0.145912&amp;amp;z=12&amp;amp;source=embed&quot; style=&quot;color:#0000FF;text-align:left&quot;&gt;Saraqeb&lt;/a&gt; in a larger map&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093d33895cb1506d2444752\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T14:05:44.887Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia condemns Clinton's Syrian opposition plans</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Russia has expressed its alarm about US-backed plans to create a Syrian \"government in exile\".</p> <p>Foreign ministry spokesman <a href=\"http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/393BD239CFF3687C44257AAA0042C7E9\">Alexander&#xa0;Lukashevich claimed the plans flout an agreement reached in Geneva,</a> brokered in June by former international envoy Kofi Annan.</p> <p>It called for democratic change in Syria \"in accordance with the aspirations of the Syrian people\".</p> <p>He accused the US of trying to settle the Syrian crisis on its own terms.</p> <p>Lukashevich urged the Syrian opposition to enter dialogue with the Assad government.</p> <p>Russia's deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov echoed the same points on his Twitter account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Syrian opposition's Western sponsors violate Geneva agreements when trying to impose from outside a list of future leadership of the country</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264268987515424768\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:33:31+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Geneva Communiqu\u00e9 says: \"...transitional governing body ... shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent\".</p>&mdash; Gennady Gatilov (@GGatilov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GGatilov/status/264269168470265856\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-02T07:34:14+00:00\">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T15:15:41.647Z\">at 3.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5093cce7b579f74bac764959\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T13:38:47.376Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">SNC leader dismissive of Clinton plan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The leader of the beleaguered Syrian National Council has accused Hillary Clinton of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264338402265137152\">ignoring the complexity of the Syrian</a> crisis after she backed a rival opposition council.</p> <p>In an interview the journalist Zaid Benjamin Abdel Basset Sayda insisted that the SNC represented the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zaidbenjamin/statuses/264339356846796800\">\"voice of the revolution\"</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday the US secretary of state confirmed US backing for new a new broad-based opposition council \u2013 the Syrian National Initiative [SNI].</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-live/2012/nov/01/syria-conflict-clinton-opposition-overhaul-live#block-509233f395cb39eabe475ee3\">She said</a>: \"We have recommended names and organisations that we believe should be included in any leadership structure.

The video <a href=\"http://youtu.be/6_ttA71FTB8\"><strong>[warning: distressing content]</strong></a> shows rebels berated the soldiers, calling them \"Assad's Dogs\", before firing round after round into their bodies as they lay on the ground, Reuters reports. The British-based Syrian&#xa0;Observatory for Human Rights said the al-Qaida-inspired Jabhat al-Nusra rebel group was responsible for the executions.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/world/middleeast/video-said-to-show-executions-by-syrian-rebels.html\"><strong>Amnesty International said the video appeared to show evidence of a war crime being committed, the New York Times reports.</strong></a> Ann Harrison, deputy director of its Middle East and North Africa programme, told the paper: \"This shocking footage depicts a potential war crime in progress, and demonstrates an utter disregard for international humanitarian law by the armed group in question.&#xa0;We will continue to investigate the incident and once again urge all sides to respect the laws of war and to refrain from torturing, ill-treating or killing their prisoners.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/syria-rebels-fear-foreign-jihadis\">Rebels in Aleppo are expecting a showdown with jihadi fighters, Martin Chulov reports from the city. </a></strong>A&#xa0;defector told him \"It's so mixed up. And this is just how Bashar wants it.\"&#xa0;Martin writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the most part, the opposition movement is staying true to the ethos that led many of the country's towns and citizens to mount a challenge to President Bashar al-Assad's absolute state control over their lives. But around the fringes, there are signs that the revolution's original values are starting to fray. The narrative of a defiant street versus a draconian state, so simple in March 2011, is now far more complicated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Abu Ismael, an Iraqi former member of al-Qaida explained why he, and other like him, have joined the fight in Syria.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Muhammad the Messenger said there would be a battle between the Persians and the Sunnis. And it is coming.&#xa0;When the regime falls, all those who fought against the Muslims will be my enemy, especially the Shias.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-plight-of-syrias-christians-we-left-homs-because-they-were-trying-to-kill-us-8274710.html\"><strong>The Independent's Kim Sengupta reports on the increasing number of Syrian Christians who have fled to Lebanon for fear of persecution.</strong></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prospect of reconciliation between the Alawites, from which the ruling elite are drawn, and the overwhelmingly Sunni opposition, gets more remote by the day after each round of strife. But now it is the Christians, who have largely sought to remain neutral, who are on the receiving end of abuse and attacks. For many, the choice now is between leaving the country or risking an uncertain and hazardous future.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022<a href=\"http://qunfuz.com/2012/11/01/the-revolution-becomes-more-islamist/\"> <strong>Radical Islamism poses a great threat to the Syrian revolution, but the uprising should still be supported, according to blogger Robin Yassin-Kassab.</strong> </a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It makes it much more difficult to start building a civil state for all. It scares minority communities. It scares the West (which, anyway, is doing almost nothing to help). It means that at some point there will have to be a showdown between the majority of fighters who want a Syrian democracy and the small minority who want an emirate on the path to a global \u2018caliphate\u2019.</p> <p>Should we refuse to support the resistance for fear of its Islamism? Absolutely not. The factors generating scary forms of Islamism are factors introduced by the criminal regime. The situation will continue to deteriorate until the regime is made inoperative.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Kuwait</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://arabnews.com/kuwait-warns-stern-steps-against-protesters\">The authorities have warned they will use harsher measures to crack down on anti-government demonstrators defying bans on protest gatherings, Arab News reports.</a></strong>&#xa0;The statement came after clashes between security forces and thousands of protesters who had gathered outside a prison in Kuwait City where opposition leader, Musallam al-Barrack, was being held. He was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20165318\">later released on bail</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/01/kuwaits_moment_of_truth\">The brewing crisis in Kuwait has a troubling echo of the brutal crackdown in Bahrain, according to Foreign Policy's Marc Lynch.&#xa0;</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Before it gets too late to de-escalate, the Kuwaiti leadership needs to offer meaningful political concessions, including standing down on its deeply controversial plans for a December election, relaxing its attempt to shut down public dissent, and allowing a greater parliamentary role in the selection of cabinet ministers. It seems to have instead decided that now is the time to crack down hard before things get out of hand.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T11:25:54.744Z\">at 11.25am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

  "<blockquote> There's one novel, Cujo, that I barely remember writing at all. I don't say that with pride or shame, only with a vague sense of sorrow and loss. I like that book. I wish I could remember enjoying the good parts as I put them down on the page. <br>\u2013 Stephen King, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780340820469/on-writing\" title=\"\">On Writing</a> </blockquote> <p>Stephen King knew he was an addict in 1975, when he was writing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/rereading-stephen-king-the-shining\" title=\"\">The Shining</a>. It manifested in his writing, as part of what he was doing; hidden from everybody else, it was in him, and on the page. Back then, it was only alcohol. As he became more popular, wrote more, earned more, took more time away from his family to work, his addictions escalated. How could they not? He needed to hit deadlines, and he liked the taste of what he was addicted to. You can see it through his fiction: in Jack Torrance's alcoholic self-pity, desperately scared of becoming what he's destined to be, trying to hold his family together even as he shakes it apart; in Larry Underwood throwing his life (and money, and 15 minutes of fame) away on drink and drugs at the start of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/03/rereading-stephen-king-the-stand\" title=\"\">The Stand</a>; in his short stories, tales of addiction and internal collapse and death. Then, in case all this passed you by, along comes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444708127/cujo\" title=\"\">Cujo</a>: and in the giant, slobbering, seemingly unstoppable dog, we find the bluntest metaphor for addiction yet presented in King's oeuvre (a title it would hold until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444720716/misery\" title=\"\">Misery</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444723243/the-tommyknockers\" title=\"\">The Tommyknockers</a>).</p> <p>No ghosts, only the vaguest hint of any supernatural aspects (see the Connections section below), no secret government institutes: Cujo is simply a lovable St Bernard. Until he isn't. His owners, the Camber family, are distracted by the day-to-day hassles of their lives; and by Joe, the patriarch, being a bad father/husband (in the grand King tradition of those). Because of this, they don't get poor Cujo \u2013 a dog that Joe is disinterested in at the best of times \u2013 vaccinated against rabies. When the dog goes poking his nose into caves, he gets bitten by a bat \u2013 a nod to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/11/rereading-stephen-king-salems-lot\" title=\"\">Salem's Lot</a> there that can't be ignored \u2013 and becomes rabid. And so the book's bad guy is born: a beast whose actions are beyond his control, who kills those inhabitants of Castle Rock who cross his path, one by one. A lack of control leading to evil: another of King's dominant themes in these early novels.</p> <p>In fact, though, Cujo spends most of the book involved with Donna and Tad Trenton. Recently moved to Castle Rock, the Trentons are nice, responsible people, the sort who definitely wouldn't have forgotten to get their dog inoculated. They're the sort of people who shouldn't be destroyed by forces beyond their control. But when their own family patriarch, Vic, is away, Donna and Tad are locked in the family car (and for a large portion of the book) while Cujo terrorises them. For them, characters who are conventionally set up to be the survivors, the book ends not with a bang but a whimper: Donna, having been bitten by Cujo, eventually drives a broken baseball bat through the dog's eye. Tad isn't so lucky: he dies in the car. Not because of Cujo, or not directly; but due to dehydration.</p> <p>As I say, it's all one giant metaphor for King's addiction. Metaphor is there in all fiction if you look for it, of course, but this book aches with symbolism. On the outside, Cujo is cuddly, pleasant, likable. When he's bitten \u2013 and maybe that bite from a bat can be directly equated to King's Salem's Lot success \u2013 he changes. Filled with uncontrollable rage, foaming at the mouth, unable to be the good dog he was. As King writes: \"He had always tried to be a good dog. He had been struck by something \u2026 free will was not a factor.\" He \u2013 Cujo, King \u2013 is trapped inside whatever's driving his body for him. He hurts those he loves. He is brutal and remorseless, because he is not himself. Those who would stop him are cut down or trapped. They can only look at him through windows and pray he leaves them alone, or that they get a chance to stop him. Even when the demon is dead, it still kills them. Well, no. Actually, what kills Tad is his desperate need for a drink.</p> <p>Maybe that's too much. Maybe we have to come at this from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/jan/13/death-of-the-author\" title=\"\">a Barthesian position</a>, standing back: this is a scary book about a rabid dog. But I simply don't believe we can. King cannot remember writing the book, but he did. Daily, he sat at his keyboard and drank himself into a stupor and beat the keys, and at the other end Cujo was sent to his editor. Somewhere inside, his subconscious was driving: something had to be.</p> <p>Many of his books from this point on are less than subtle with their metaphor. That isn't a criticism: I think King does some of his best work when looking inward, consciously or not. It's not always pretty, but it's always interesting. It's not as if Cujo was the first of his novels to mine the alcoholism metaphor \u2013 The Shining told the story of an ex-English teacher with a drinking problem \u2013 but this is the point at which it became the book. Not a character, but the whole text.</p> <p>Structurally, Cujo is fascinating. There are no chapters, no page breaks: it's a constant rush of words, darting between characters and with reminiscing periods of backstory, but always pushing forward. Like the plot and the dog \u2013 and, yes, King's addiction \u2013 it's unrelenting. The book stops when the dog does, or just after, as the families try to pick up the pieces of their lives in the wake of the chaos that has wrecked them. The surviving members of the Camber family, Cujo's owners, buy a new dog. This one is vaccinated, but here's the thing: it's still a dog. The potential for what it could do, how it could turn on you, is always inside it.</p> <p>Reading interviews with King from the time when his addictions weren't public knowledge, <a href=\"http://carolinanavy.com/navy/creativewriting/sking/view.html\" title=\"\">he feigns normality</a>, pretends he knew what he was doing when he wrote Cujo. Now, after he's admitted that he was then suffering his worst bout of alcoholic torpor, we know it was all a lie. Cujo is as much a surprise to him as it is to the reader: the brutality, the pace, the agony inside. It's a tremendous book \u2013 more tremendous, in my view, when you know how it was written, and how absent King really was. It's scary, it's tense, it's incredibly pacy. And it's another non-supernatural book. It's a shame King can't remember writing it, that he can't revel in his creation of something this good. But what's not a shame is that we have it: not only as readers of great fiction, but as admirers of a man who was suffering and couldn't face his demons in person, so put them directly on to the page.</p> <h2>Connections</h2> <p>Cujo \u2013 either the dog itself or the deaths it rendered \u2013 is invoked in several other Castle Rock novels: The Tommyknockers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444708158/the-dark-half\" title=\"\">The Dark Half</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444707878/needful-things\" title=\"\">Needful Things</a> (all books, incidentally, that deal with King's addictions in their own ways). There's a bigger connection, though: to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/12/rereading-stephen-king-dead-zone\" title=\"\">The Dead Zone</a>, in which Sheriff George Bannerman asks for John Smith's help to catch the Castle Rock Strangler, Frank Dodd. Bannerman reappears in Cujo and meets his end at the dog's teeth. But another character also makes the transition to this book: Dodd himself. It's weird, and vague, but we're told at the start of Cujo \u2013 on page one \u2013 about Dodd, and that \"the monster never dies \u2026 It came to Castle Rock again in the summer of 1980\", when Cujo is set. It's suggested, briefly, that Dodd is somehow the darkness haunting Tad Trenton's closet; that he's a part of the darkness that fills Cujo and drives him to commit his horrible killings. This is another common theme of King's: the sense that evil is innate, and more powerful than the individual instance. It's never made totally explicit in Cujo, but it's definitely suggested: Cujo, Frank Dodd, the other darkness that will, in later books, invade Castle Rock \u2013 they're one and the same.</p> <h2>Next time</h2> <p>We're raining fire, flying planes and somehow being played by Arnie in the film of the same name: it's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/horror/9781444723540/the-running-man\" title=\"\">The Running Man</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Civil liberties groups are being too \"simplistic\" and purist in their opposition to the government's justice and security bill, Ken Clarke has said.</p> <p>The intelligence and security agencies will become more accountable for any failings under proposals to allow evidence to be heard in secret, according to the minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>Clarke, who retains responsibility for the bill after leaving the Ministry of Justice, revealed that amendments to the proposed legislation may be adopted before it is voted on in the House of Lords this month.</p> <p>At their party conference in September, Liberal Democrats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-lib-dem-conference?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">voted to scrap the bill</a>, which would expand secret hearings \u2013 known as closed material procedures \u2013 into the main civil courts.</p> <p>Clarke implied there may be political negotiations going on. \"We will table some amendments,\" he said. \"I have to clear them. We are still running a coalition government.\"</p> <p>Speaking at a meeting in Westminster organised by the thinktank Policy Exchange, Clarke said: \"Either we can adopt a position of simplistic legal purism and wreck a golden opportunity for sensible reform. Or we can actually use this bill to deliver much-needed improvements to the parliamentary and judicial accountability of the security and intelligence agencies.</p> <p>\"I have never been naive about the role the security and intelligence agencies play for us. I want them to be more able to defend themselves and be more accountable to the courts and to parliament. On the one hand we have the security services supporting a change to court process to enable them to hold themselves more accountable in courts of law. On the other my old friends and allies in the human rights lobby say unless it is given in a public hearing, they do not want to allow the judge to hear and take into account evidence from intelligence agencies of a sensitive kind never previously admitted to court.</p> <p>\"Some appear to be saying that if spies cannot give evidence in open court then they prefer to stay with secrecy and exclusion of evidence. Serious cases involving allegations of torture should be undecided, the amount of damages settled by a silenced defence.\"</p> <p>Responding to Clarke's speech, the executive director of the human rights group Reprieve, Clare Algar, said: \"Nothing Ken Clarke said today justified the government's dangerous plans for secret courts, which will allow ministers to cover up embarrassment or even serious crimes such as torture.</p> <p>\"His reassuring comments do nothing to change the reality of the Bill itself, which would put politicians above the law and deny ordinary citizens access to justice.</p> <p>\"His claim that judges will have the 'final say' on whether a case is pushed into a secret courts is directly at odds with the view of the government's own reviewer of terrorism legislation, who says that this Bill will mean that 'the judges' hands are tied,' and 'the secretary of state ... pull[s] the strings.'</p> <p>\"The House of Lords must vote against plans for secret courts \u2013 otherwise, a centuries-old tradition of fairness and equality before the law will be lost.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"The country needs you, Tom,\" hisses reptilian chief whip John Hodder (Charles Dance), cufflinks oscillating with indignation. Doughty Deputy Prime Minister Tom Dawkins (Gabriel Byrne) is unconvinced. \"I'm not a leader,\" he mumbles, peering gloomily out of his Downing Street window. \"You give off stability,\" persists Hodder. \"People are craving that. We need someone (<em>voice rises, eyebrows scrunch</em>)\u2026 WITH BALLS.\"</p> <p>It's a rum old business, this modern politics lark, so thank Christ <strong>Secret State</strong> (<em>Wednesday, 10pm, Channel 4</em>) is here to sort everything out. A four-part conspiracy thriller (\"inspired\", the credits thunder, \"by the novel A Very British Coup by Chris Mullin\"), it arrives amid considerable hoopla. Its lavish trailer depicts a downtrodden Byrne gliding glumly through a deserted SW1A in which the blackened remains of a chemical refinery loom over the Houses of Parliament: corruption and politics and slightly wonky CGI chimneys entwined in a spluttering enormoblur of apocalyptic unpleasantness. Here, honks Channel 4, is a Big Drama with a Big Message: a modern thriller with the brass neck and trousers to address hot-potato global skulduggery while harking back to such brooding, labyrinthine classics as Edge Of Darkness, State Of Play and, indeed, A Very British Coup. \"Britain is buggered,\" it bellows from a darkened doorway, \"so let's crack open the all-butter Viennese biscuit assortment and watch Gabriel Byrne do Big Acting in a M&amp;S wool-blend car coat.\"</p> <p>The plot, then: a blast at the American-owned Petrofex chemical plant has left 19 people dead and the residents of Scarrow, Teeside, in high dudgeon. \"A tragedy like this can act to bring us together,\" emotes a craggily concerned Dawkins to a bank of flashing cameras as rhubarbing salt-of-the-earth types in anoraks say things like \"your word means nothing!\" and \"oi\". While national and governmental disquiet grows, rumours of an international cover-up rumble. Then something Really Bad happens to the prime minister, and Dawkins \u2013 the sole glimmer of morality in this bastards' soup \u2013 finds himself in the thick of a corruption-shaped, petrochemical-scented brouhaha.</p> <p>It takes approximately six minutes to realise you could reverse an oil tanker into the gulf between what Secret State thinks it is (important, good) and what it actually is (cobblers with exploding CGI bells on). It's difficult to convey just how splutteringly ludicrous the whole thing is. There is a phalanx of steeple-fingered, baddie-eyed American executives, a pair of monumentally irritating counter-intelligence flunkies and a ball-flattening home secretary with a penchant for bursting into the gents and snarling \"fuck the polls\" as startled frontbenchers attempt to wee. It's a Jacuzzi of obviousness. A journalist in a raincoat (Gina McKee) pops up every so often to deliver a plot development via whispered aside or cryptic text message (\"WHOSE PLANE?\"), then buggers off again. At one point, someone says \"a military background like yours comes in handy at times like this, I suppose\" and we duck for cover as another slab of exposition crashes from the rafters and lands on credulity's skull.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the middle of the woe, there is Gabriel Byrne, peering perpetually into the middle distance with the pained absentmindedness of a man with an undiagnosed urinary tract infection. As is the modern TV thriller way, Secret State refuses to let us breathe. It's all bang this and boom that. Pounding, panicky drums and Meaningful Glances are crammed into every frame, like a herd of bison into a broom cupboard. Everything is spelled out in 3,500pt Hope You're Getting All This At The Back font. At first you may find yourself pining for the silences and the realism of the 80s conspiracy dramas Secret State is so keen to emulate, along with the skull-fizzing thrill of a plot so ferociously complex you need a compass, crampons and slab of Kendal mint cake to make it past the title sequence. But then you watch Charles Dance snarling like a dog as he twiddles his cufflinks outside No 10 and remember the intense joy of unfettered TV stupidity. Secret State is Spooks with its head in a bucket of dumb. It's Tinker Tailor Soldier Sigh. Brains and depth are all very well and good but sometimes you just want something (<em>voice rises, eyebrows scrunch</em>) \u2026 WITH BALLS.</p>",
  "<p>An army of thousands of lawyers is quietly amassing in the key swing states ahead of next Tuesday's presidential election in preparation for the largest legal ground operation to be fought in any American election.</p> <p>Hundreds of paid lawyers employed by the Obama and Romney campaigns, backed by a reserve force of thousands of volunteer attorneys who are jetting into the battleground states this weekend, will be monitoring polling stations on 6 November. Their job will be to prevent the rival side gaining an unfair advantage, and to be at hand to litigate should the vote be too close to call.</p> <p>\"Thousands and thousands of lawyers will be out on election day ferreting out any problems with voting rights,\" said Joseph Sandler, who led the Democratic party's legal team for 15 years until 2008. The attorneys will be on the look out for irregularities such as malfunctioning polling equipment, election officials failing to follow rules, or irregular opening hours at the polling stations, he said.</p> <p>The presidential election of 2012 will herald the largest and most intricate legal ground game yet seen. \"Very sophisticated operations have been put together in the swing states by both main parties, and my sense is that if they do go into battle they will be evenly matched,\" said Professor Edward Foley, who runs an election law centre at Ohio State University.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the legal aspect of presidential elections has moved from a sideshow to being central to the campaigning process. The impetus for the shift was the 2000 election and the notorious legal fight that followed the disputed Florida result.</p> <p>The events of that year, which ended up with the US supreme court blocking a recount and handing George Bush the presidency, caught both Republicans and Democrats off guard. Both sides have vowed never again to be put in that invidious position.</p> <p>Sandler, who was a key adviser to Al Gore in his unsuccessful attempt to force a Florida recount in 2000, has watched the legal operation grow into a veritable army since that highly contentious election. By 2004, paid lawyers were already in place well in advance of election day, and by 2008, Barack Obama had developed a sophisticated network of lawyers that is likely to be the model in future elections.</p> <p>This year that model is being followed again, \"but this time it is much more extensive,\" Sandler said.</p> <p>At its most dramatic, the army of lawyers assembled by both presidential campaigns could be called upon to litigate in the event of a battleground state returning so close a result that one of the candidates refuses to concede and demands a recount. In 2004, lawyers for John Kerry came close to challenging the result in Ohio but backed off after they realised that Bush had accumulated sufficient votes to win the state, and with it the presidency.</p> <p>\"When you have an incredibly close election as next Tuesday looks like it might be, it increases the chances of legal disputes and delays in announcing the winner,\" said Lawrence Norden, a voting rights experts at the Brennan Center for Justice within New York University.</p> <p>On the Democratic side, paid and voluntary lawyers will be keeping a particularly beady eye out for any signs of intimidation or disenfranchisement of voters in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/florida-assault-voting-rights\">a slew of attempts by Republican legislatures to restrict voting practices this year</a>. Most of the new voter suppression laws have been stayed by the courts, but Obama's legal army will be watching out for any residual foul play.</p> <p>The lawyers leading the respective armies are two of the biggest shots in election law in the US. The Republican operation is led by Benjamin Ginsberg, who headed Bush's legal team in the 2000 Florida recount dispute.</p> <p>A former newspaper reporter with the Boston Globe, Ginsberg went on to become pre-eminent in election law. After his success in 2000, he commanded the army of attorneys deployed in Bush's in 2004 re-election, and has been at the legal helm of Romney's run on the White House both in 2008 and this year.</p> <p>His counterpart for Obama is Bob Bauer, former White House counsel who returned last year to his private law firm Perkins Coie so he could spearhead the president's re-election bid from outside government. Bauer has been giving Obama legal advice ever since Obama came to Washington as a US senator in 2005.</p> <p>Bauer and Ginsberg are at the top of a pyramid structure that will see lawyers for both presidential candidates in place right across the battleground states come election day. Both teams have been working for months on preparing for whatever eventuality fate throws at them next Tuesday.</p> <p>\"You never know what comes up on election day. If the operation has done its job right, election day will be relatively uneventful as all the heavy lifting is done before then,\" said Sandler.</p> <p>As the legal armies have grown since 2000, they have come to rely increasingly on volunteer attorneys flying in to the key swing states for election day. The Obama for America campaign has used its digital organising tool, Dashboard, to mobilise lawyers, paralegals and law students and direct them to the polling stations where they are needed most \u2013 <a href=\"https://dashboard.barackobama.com/groups/1664-victory-counsel-\">a project called Victory Counsel</a>.</p> <p>A campaign official said: \"While it is easy to vote and we expect the election process to run smoothly, Obama For America has a team of legal volunteers and professionals prepared in case any difficulties do emerge.\"</p> <p>Philip Raible, a commercial litigator with the New York firm Rayner Rowe, is flying at his own cost to Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday to volunteer for Obama's legal team. On Sunday he will spend three hours in a training session on election law, before being dispatched on election day to a precinct of Cleveland to monitor the poll.</p> <p>Coming from out of state, Raible is not able to enter a polling station, issue proceedings or appear before Ohio judges himself, so he will be acting in a purely supporting role to local lawyers on the campaign. But he thinks the effort will be worthwhile.</p> <p>\"I'm doing it because as a Democratic resident of New York, a Democratic state, my vote has very little impact on the election nationally, whereas if I can help Obama win Ohio it will have a much greater impact,\" he said.</p> <p>While lawyers will be fanning out through all the crucial swing states \u2013 including Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, Wisconsin and Virginia \u2013 the most intensive efforts will be in Florida and Ohio given their history of litigation in 2000 and 2004 respectively.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most venerated sites in the Christian faith, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus is believed to have been crucified, buried and resurrected, is facing a financial crisis over an unpaid water bill in a row that could result in its closure.</p> <p>The church, which attracts more than 1 million pilgrims each year, has been issued with a 9m shekel (\u00a31.5m) water bill, backdated 15 years to when the supply was taken over by a new company, Hagihon.</p> <p>As a result of the church's failure to pay, Hagihon has secured the freezing of the bank account of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which is jointly responsible for the church's administration.</p> <p>The standoff was confirmed by the spokesman for Theophilos III, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, following a report in the Israeli paper Maariv. \"It is completely true,\" Issa Musaleh told the Guardian. \"They have frozen our account. This is a flagrant act against the church.\"</p> <p>According to Maariv, the move has resulted in standing orders being rejected and cheques bouncing. Services which have been affected include telephones, internet and electricity, as well as companies supplying food.</p> <p>\"The church is completely paralysed. We can't pay for toilet paper. Nothing. Hagihon has declared war on us,\" a Patriarchate official told Maariv.</p> <p>For decades, the church was exempt from water charges. But Hagihon, which took over water supply to Jerusalem in the late 1990s, sent a bill to the church for 3.7m shekels (\u00a3600,000) in 2004. Church officials believed the bill was a mistake, and Hagihon did not press for payment.</p> <p>Now the company has demanded payment of the bill, which has risen to 9m shekels including interest.</p> <p>The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate is refusing to deal with Hagihon in protest, according to Musaleh. \"This is an outrageous act against the church. We will not receive Hagihon [officials], and we will ask our pilgrims to bring their own [bottled] water to the church,\" he said. The church may close in protest over the dispute, he added.</p> <p>Patriarch Theophilos III told Maariv: \"If nothing changes we intend to announce within a few days, for the first time in centuries, that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is closed.\"</p> <p>The Christian denominations which jointly manage the church, including the Greek Orthodox, Franciscans and Armenians, have begun a campaign to win support in their battle with Hagihon.</p> <p>A letter from the Greek Patriarch to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and president, Shimon Peres, quoted by Maariv, said: \"The enforcement of this unjustified step undermines the sanctity and offends the sensitivity of the site ... [and] could lead to the closing of the site to masses of pilgrims.\" It called for intervention \"to put a stop to this aggressive move\".</p> <p>Approaches are also planned to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, the prime ministers of Greece and Cyprus, King Abdullah of Jordan and President Barack Obama.</p> <p>In a statement to Maariv, Hagihon said it had been in talks for several years with church representatives with the aim of reaching a settlement of the debt. It was prohibited by the Israeli Water Authority from exempting any party from water charges, and more than 1,000 religious institutions in Jerusalem paid their bills regularly, it added.</p> <p>\"Hagihon has refrained from steps it is permitted to take by law, of cutting off the water, in light of the sensitivity of this matter, and in order to enable the operation of the site ... The management of Hagihon believes and hopes that the Greek patriarch will honour the commitment he gave in meetings with the management of Hagihon and will act to arrange the payment in the near future,\" the statement said.</p> <p>The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate has extensive land and property holdings in the Holy Land. Sales in recent decades \u2013 some of which have been controversial \u2013 have increased its wealth.</p> <p>Thousands of Christian pilgrims and tourists jostle each day inside the gloomily lit spaces beneath the church's dome. Despite the chaotic queues for the most revered sites within the church and the cacophony of chanting priests, tour guides and camera-clicking tourists, for many it is a deeply emotional and spiritual experience.</p> <p>The original church was built on the site of Jesus's crucifixion, which was then outside the city walls, in the fourth century.</p>",
  "<p>It's another bumper Best Apps post for new Android apps, covering 30 releases from the last week alone. Heady times for Google-powered devices.</p> <p>The list doesn't include games, as they get their own separate post: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/01/best-mobile-games-need-for-speed-bubble-island\">this week's selection</a> included Android titles like Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Theme Park, Hellfire, Zombie Driver THD, Chrono Trigger and Zombiewood.</p> <p>iOS apps also get their own post, which can be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/02/best-iphone-ipad-apps-2nov12\">found here this week</a>. Windows Phone has a monthly roundup \u2013&#xa0;the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/nov/01/best-windows-phone-apps-october-2012\">latest one is here</a>. For now, here's the pick of the Google Play store from the last week.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.smartglass\">Xbox SmartGlass (Free)</a></h2> <p>Launched by Microsoft, this is an official companion app for its Xbox 360 console, enabling you to control the device from your Android smartphone \u2013&#xa0;alas, not tablets for now. The app can control TV shows and films, music, web browsing and other features of the console, and in time will also be usable as a second screen for games.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Encyclopaedia+Britannica,+Inc.\">Britannica Kids apps (\u00a31.24 each)</a></h2> <p>There are actually nine brand-new Britannica Kids apps available for Android. I'm including them as one entry. The nine apps cover the solar system, Aztec empire, dinosaurs, knights and castles, ancient Rome, snakes, rainforests, volcanoes and ancient Egypt. Their content is a mixture of text, images and interactivity, all aimed at children.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.clouddrive\">Amazon Cloud Drive Photos (Free)</a></h2> <p>Amazon has extended its Cloud Drive storage service out with a new app focusing on photos. It offers 5GB of storage (for free) to store images in, and access them from Android devices as well as computers. It supports both phones and tablets, and can share to Facebook and email.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wemakeawesomesh.calvin\">18 Months (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is the official app for Calvin Harris' new album 18 Months, complete with a nifty feature to play every track in full. It requires some work though: dancing. Well, moving your Android smartphone, anyway: the idea is that by dancing (or waggling the handset) you keep the song playing. Fun and innovative.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android\">Snapchat (Free)</a></h2> <p>Snapchat bills itself as \"the first real-time picture chatting app\", and has been doing rather well on iOS, where its users have shared more than 1bn photos. The idea: send photos to friends with a built-in time limit up to 10 seconds. The photo then wipes itself off the recipient's handset. Ideal for sexting people you don't quite trust, but there must be a few other uses too.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://thexx.info/app/\">The xx (Free)</a></h2> <p>The xx have released a stylish app that lives up to their latest album Coexist, offering \"HD Visualiser videos\" for every track on the album for fans who own it digitally, as well as interactive artwork, news and notifications from the band, official music videos, lyrics and ticketing info.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wacom.bamboopaper\">Bamboo Paper (Free)</a></h2> <p>This app is the work of Wacom, and is designed to work with its Bamboo Stylus accessory. Promising \"note taking on your smartphone made easy\", it involves scribbling sketches or writing notes which can then be flipped through. Made for Android smartphones, it (kind of) brings them the functionality seen in Samsung's Galaxy Note devices. The stylus costs around \u00a325.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Sweetapple\">Rockford's Musical Audiobooks (Free / \u00a32.99)</a></h2> <p>And more numerical cheating here, since there are four Rockford's Musical Audiobook apps: chapters one to four of children's story Rockford's Rock Opera, with the first available for free, and the other three chapters costing \u00a32.99 each. It's an audiobook with an hour of narrated story, as well as music and pictures. Read more on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/feb/22/rockford-rock-opera-app\">the aims behind it here</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pv.twonkybeam_belkin\">Belkin MediaPlay (Free)</a></h2> <p>Belkin's new Android app builds on the myTwonky technology, with the aim of helping you pipe films and music from your Android device to a connected TV (via its browser), or play content from your home library on your smartphone or tablet.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.game.mobileapp\">Game Reward Mobile App (Free)</a></h2> <p>British games retailer Game has had some rough times in 2012, but apps are forming part of its comeback strategy. This ties into Game's loyalty programme, helping you earn points on purchases from the stores, while also offering recommendations. If you add your console gamertags, there may be other \"cool stuff\" in the future too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.tonuzaba.photowarp2\">Photo Warp+ (Free)</a></h2> <p>More than 14m people have downloaded developer Tonuzaba Entertainment's first Photo Warp app, so this sequel should find a healthy audience. It's all about, yes, warping photos, with a range of effects to play merry havoc with images.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ratedPeople.homeOwner\">Find a Tradesman (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is definitely one of the most useful apps in this week's lineup: released by the Rated People website, it helps you dig into its directory of tradesmen for home improvement jobs, posting what you need done and getting responses from companies or people who can help.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanhouse_media.bookbbgivethanks_app\">BB - Give Thanks (\u00a32.47)</a> </h2> <p>The Berenstain Bears books have a firm following among several generations of Christian parents, and they're being digitised as apps by Oceanhouse Media book-by-book. This one focuses on Thanksgiving, with voice narration, audio and words highlighted as they're read out, to help early readers.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tippingcanoe.hukd\">HotUKDeals \u2013 Official (Free)</a></h2> <p>So called because there seem to be plenty of unofficial Android apps pulling down listings from the UK's deals'n'vouchers website. This is its official app, offering vouchers from the likes of Asda, Tesco, Domino's Pizza and Sainsbury's, filtered by location. You can also comment on the offers and tip those you find in the real world.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insync.insync_android\">Insync for Android (\u00a31.49)</a></h2> <p>Insync's new app ties in to the Google Drive service, to access documents and other files stored in Google's cloud service, upload new ones, and share with friends and colleagues. All of which you can do in the official Google Drive service. Insync claims a host of additional features though, from exporting files to the SD card in your device, to saving folders for offline use, and streaming music or video files.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antengo.tablet\">Antengo Classifieds - Tablet (Free)</a></h2> <p>The native Android tablet apps are coming, as Google encourages developers to think harder about their larger-screened software. Antengo claims to be \"reinventing classified listings\" in the US, with more than 2m items in its classifieds directory, and an app designed for tablets.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andcreate.app.fliplauncher\">Flip Launcher (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is a smartphone app for power Android users who want to save a few precious seconds when navigating to and opening specific apps and shortcuts. The idea here: you flip to them, having set up to 24 as your designated flips.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.montblanc.tws\">The Montblanc Worldsecond (Free)</a></h2> <p>Luxury watchmaker Montblanc is working on an interesting digital marketing campaign that aims to get people around the world taking photos at the same instant, then making them available to browse. This app helps you do that, with four Instagram-ish filters to apply, uploading pics to the Montblanc Worldsecond site, as well as (if you choose) to Facebook, Twitter and Google+.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goalmaster\">Goalmaster | Goal Tracker (Free)</a></h2> <p>This is a simple but potentially-useful app focused on tracking goals \u2013&#xa0;of the personal motivation kind, rather than the football kind. You can create entries for your ambitions, then analyse your progress, and share your success (hopefully) on Facebook.</p>",
  "<p>The floods and fires that swept through our city left a path of destruction that will require years of recovery and rebuilding work. And in the short term, our subway system remains partially shut down, and many city residents and businesses still have no power. In just 14 months, two hurricanes have forced us to evacuate neighborhoods - something our city government had never done before. If this is a trend, it is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be - given this week's devastation - should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.</p> <p>Here in New York, our comprehensive sustainability plan - PlaNYC - has helped allow us to cut our carbon footprint by 16 percent in just five years, which is the equivalent of eliminating the carbon footprint of a city twice the size of Seattle. Through the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group - a partnership among many of the world's largest cities - local governments are taking action where national governments are not.</p> <p><strong>Leadership needed</strong></p> <p>But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House - and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change. As governor of Massachusetts, he signed on to a regional cap- and-trade plan designed to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels. \"The benefits (of that plan) will be long-lasting and enormous - benefits to our health, our economy, our quality of life, our very landscape. These are actions we can and must take now, if we are to have 'no regrets' when we transfer our temporary stewardship of this Earth to the next generation,\" he wrote at the time.</p> <p>He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported. This issue is too important. We need determined leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward.</p> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> <p>If the 1994 or 2003 version of Mitt Romney were running for president, I may well have voted for him because, like so many other independents, I have found the past four years to be, in a word, disappointing.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. But as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction. And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.</p> <p><strong>Important victories</strong></p> <p>Nevertheless, the president has achieved some important victories on issues that will help define our future. His Race to the Top education program - much of which was opposed by the teachers' unions, a traditional Democratic Party constituency - has helped drive badly needed reform across the country, giving local districts leverage to strengthen accountability in the classroom and expand charter schools. His health-care law -- for all its flaws -- will provide insurance coverage to people who need it most and save lives.</p> <p>When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America.</p> <p>One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>One recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.</p> <p>One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics.</p> <p>Of course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn't the shape of any particular proposal; it's the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions.</p> <p>Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress - and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael R Bloomberg is mayor of New York and founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.</p> <p>\u2022 This article <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\">first appeared on Bloomberg View 2012</a>.

  "<p>Pakistani officials have arrested the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after being doused with acid at her home.</p> <p>The couple, from Kashmir, reportedly confessed to the killing earlier this week because they believed she had sullied the family's honour.</p> <p>Such so-called honour killings are common in much of Pakistan, with thousands of women burned, disfigured or maimed in similar attacks every year, according to human rights groups. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kashmir, however.</p> <p>Zohra Yusuf, chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), said the case was a \"classic\" example of a family dispute turned horribly violent. \"What is really striking is that there really is no regret among members of the family. Justice for the women is very, very rare,\" she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Last month, a schoolgirl in the north-west of the country was shot by militants from a local extremist group as she travelled home from school. Malala Yousufzai, 15, was a prominent advocate for girls' right to education in Swat Valley, formerly controlled by the Taliban.</p> <p>The movement, heavily influenced by its Afghan namesake, campaigned against allowing girls to go to school before being largely driven out of Swat by a Pakistani army offensive in 2009.</p> <p>Malala was taken to Britain for treatment at a specialist centre at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, where her condition remains stable.</p> <p>The shooting provoked an outcry in Pakistan. President Asif Ali Zardari said the attack was one \"on all Pakistani girls\" and the Chief of Army Staff, Ashfaq Kayani, called Malala an <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/449540/malala-is-an-icon-of-courage-hope-kayani/\" title=\"\">\"icon of courage and hope\"</a>.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman said Malala had been targeted for trying to spread western culture, and they would try to kill her again if she survived.</p> <p>Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, who runs a girls' school, said his daughter had defied threats for years, believing the good work she was doing for her community was her best protection.</p> <p>However, the recent acid attack appears to be more mundane, and such incidents rarely attract top-level political attention.</p> <p>The teenager appears to have been attacked by her parents after she spoke to a boy outside the family home.</p> <p>\"There were third-degree burns on her scalp, face, eyes, nostrils, both arms, chest foot and lower part of legs. Even her scalp bone was exposed,\" Mohammad Jahangir, a doctor at the local hospital in Kotli, a town in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said, adding that the mother had initially told the hospital their daughter tried to kill herseslf.</p> <p>According to the HRCP at least 943 women were killed in 2011 by relatives seeking ostensibly to restore the family honour through murder. It marks a 15% increase on 2010, but could be due to increased reporting.</p> <p>Though the parliament has passed laws aimed at protecting vulnerable women from abuse, implementation is at best patchy.</p>",

The NHS Commissioning Board and Monitor would provide technical support and track the innovations adopted.</p> <p>This active encouragement of local experimentation is more likely to identify the blend of payment systems needed to support the rapid development of new models of care.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093bf4bb579f74bac76494f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T12:54:35.946Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime roundup</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Claire Burke writes</em></p> <p>Here's a roundup of health stories from around the web this lunchtime:</p> <p>E Health Insider - <a href=\"http://www.ehi.co.uk/news/EHI/8170/youth-mental-health-app-trialled\">Youth mental health app trialled</a></p> <p>Pulse - <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/therapy-areas/immunisation/gps-given-green-light-to-start-shingles-vaccination/20000746.article#.UJO-tr9nFE4\">GPs given green light to start shingles vaccination</a></p> <p>Telegraph - <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9649526/Memory-loss-could-begin-in-thirties-or-forties.html\">Memory loss 'could begin in thirties or forties'</a></p> <p>BBC - Li<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-20167559\">ster Surgicentre: Joint replacement referrals postponed</a></p> <p>London Evening Standard - <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/club-drug-clinic-warns-students-of-serious-risks-after-patient-loses-bladder-8276867.html\">Drug clinic warns students of serious risks after patient loses bladder</a></p> <p>Publicservice.co.uk - <a href=\"http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=21336\">'NHS 111 won't give patients info they need', warns royal college</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093b738b579f74bac764949\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T12:06:16.785Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Jessica Fuhl writes</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/02/nhs-doctor-trial-photographer-syria\">An NHS doctor is to face trial accused of kidnapping UK photographer in Syria</a>.&#xa0;Shajul Islam, 26, who studied at St Bartholomew's and a University of London hospital, appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday via videolink from Belmarsh prison, charged with keeping John Cantlie and a Dutch journalist captive.&#xa0;</p> <p>Telehealth technologies, which can be most useful to patients with long-term conditions in rural areas, <a href=\"http://www.governmentcomputing.com/news/poor-connectivity-hampers-telehealth\">are being hampered by poor broadband connectivity</a>, the Telehealth2012 conference has heard.</p> <p>Serco <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-20168210\">has announced job cuts a month after taking over from NHS Suffolk</a>.</p> <p>And Liverpool Community Health NHS trust <a href=\"http://www.clickliverpool.com/business/public-sector/1217572-liverpool-community-health-nhs-trust-celebrates-second-birthday-.html\">is celebrating it's second birthday</a>. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5093ac2cb579f74bac764941\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T11:19:08.435Z\">11.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Claire Burke writes</em></p> <p>In his Quintessential blog today <a href=\"http://www.quintessential.org.uk/sa-mathieson/further-reading-us-elections-healthcare-and-obamacare/#more-3789\">SA Mathieson writes about the US elections, healthcare and Obamacare</a>.

  "<p>A massive storm blows in from the Atlantic, bringing the commercial capital of the western hemisphere to a complete standstill. Ferries stop running, trains are immobilized, and in several boroughs, fires rage out of control. \"New York\", a reporter at the New York Times marvels, is as \"completely isolated from the rest of the world as if Manhattan Island was in the middle of the South Sea.\" Seeing their city utterly paralyzed by an act of nature, officials who tour the blacked-out neighborhoods immediately call for a massive investment in better transportation.</p> <p>The tempest in question was not Hurricane Sandy, but the \"Great White Hurricane\", a blizzard that, in the early days of March 1888, wreaked havoc on the eastern seaboard and brought 22in of snow and 80mph wind gusts to New York City. The storm also brought an end to two decades of dickering about infrastructure: from then on, electrical cables and telegraph cables would be buried, and the elevated trains on the avenues, whose steam engines were extinguished by the gale, would be replaced by a weather-proof underground railroad, on the lines of the one already running in London.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/PpoAqY\">most lasting impact of the Blizzard of '88 was the building of the IRT</a>, the first line in what would become, in the 20th century, the world's most extensive subway system. Never again would the great city of New York allow itself to be paralyzed by a simple act of nature.</p> <p>Now, as the Army Corps of Engineers flies in 250 pumps to drain tunnels filled floor-to-ceiling with water, and service haltingly resumes on 14 of the city's 23 subway lines, New Yorkers are being reminded of how completely they have come to rely on public transport for going about the day-to-day business of their lives. On any given day, 95% of commuters get to Manhattan's central business district not by car, but by foot, bicycle, or buses and trains \u2013 mostly the latter. (Realizing this, and to forestall a carmaggedon of gridlock, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has wisely announced that only vehicles with three or more occupants will be allowed in to Manhattan until Friday night.)</p> <p>Rail transportation is the sine qua non of Manhattan: it keeps the economy of the city, the state, and the entire north-east thrumming. It doesn't take an urban planner to realize that if you shut it down, even for a couple of days, New York City will turn into <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=podunk\">Podunk</a>. After touring scenes of devastation in Queens, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-new-york-city-mta-free-rides-20121031,0,2038243.story\">Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We will rebuild the subway system and we will build it better. That's what New York is all about.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's hope he keeps his word. As it stands, New York is pitiably lagging behind other global cities when it comes to expanding, or even maintaining, its subway and commuter rail networks. Even as ridership surpasses 1.6bn trips a year, a record since the postwar boom years, the subway continues to rely on early industrial-age technology.</p> <p>Consider, for example, the metal flanges in Union Square <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SzS0lM\">that snap into place as squealing trains</a> arrive (to compensate for a marked curve in the platforms); the analogue signals that prevent dispatchers from boosting the frequency of trains; and the Depression-era relays that, as one commentator told me, \"look like the switchboard at the Grand Hotel\". For decades, New York's subway was the only one in the world that was <em>actually losing</em> track mileage. Now, happily, tunnel-boring machines are again at work beneath the streets: the 7 line is being extended into the far west side, by all of one stop, and if all goes well, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway will be up and running, maybe, by 2016. (A simple replacement project for an elevated line scrapped in 1942, it should have been completed a half century ago.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, Shanghai \u2013 a city where commuters can ride a 268mph magnetic levitation to the airport \u2013 has taken only 17 years to build itself a metro system that now surpasses New York's as the largest in the world.</p> <p>There's no question that New York's legacy transit system faces huge challenges. Even when there is no storm surge to cope with, pumps have to operate day and night to keep the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hurricane-Sandy-Challenges-Subways-Power-Buildings-176188001.html\">estimated 13-15m gallons of water a day</a> that routinely infiltrate tunnel walls from overwhelming the system. (Fortunately, this may be New York's last serious case of tunnel flooding. On the eve of Hurricane Sandy, the department of homeland security was testing giant inflatable plugs that would swiftly close off tunnels in case of terrorist attacks or future storm surges; <a href=\"http://t.co/KmEEPOiB\">see this video</a>.)</p> <p>In New York, trains still cross the Hudson and East Rivers through tunnels that were dug with pickaxes by Irish, Italian and African-American <a href=\"http://sandhogs147.org/\">\"sandhogs\"</a>, who lost their lives by the dozens in caisson failures and explosions. Yet, there are other metropolises \u2013 among them Paris, London, and Berlin \u2013 that face similar challenges. The difference is, they've managed to improve and expand their vintage metro systems. New York has a lot of catching up to do.</p> <p>In 1968, under then Mayor John Lindsay, the newly-created MTA announced plans that would have expanded the <a href=\"http://secondavenuesagas.com/2008/06/04/the-1960s-subway-expansion-that-never-came-to-be/\">subway network by 20%, including new lines to Queens and the Bronx, and a subway spur to JFK airport</a>. The financial crisis of the 1970s put paid to the plans, and the city is nowhere near achieving what, in any other major city, would have been a routine network expansion.</p> <p>And now, at a time when some politicians are making political hay out of natural disaster, it's well to remember that the chief impediment to truly sustainable transportation for American cities continues to be blinkered partisanship. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is being praised for his handling of the aftermath of the hurricane, but he's also the reason that, when Sandy blew in, New Jersey's only rail link across the Hudson River consisted of two easily flooded, century-old, single-track tunnels. </p> <p>Because the Republican governor was determined to keep a campaign promise not to raise the state's very low gas tax during his campaign, <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/PJU8cl\">he exaggerated the cost of \"Access to the Region's Core\" plan</a>, thus killing a project that would have given his constituents faster and more reliable rail access to the jobs in Lower Manhattan. Not to mention brand new, non-leaky tunnels for all New Yorkers.</p> <p>The Great Blizzard of '88 brought an end to the dark ages of transportation in New York, a period typified by the rotund <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed\">Boss Tweed</a>, whose financial interests in horse-car companies had long kept the city mired in congestion, and stalled any progress on the digging of an underground railway. With any luck, the legacy of Hurricane Sandy \u2013 the Great Blow of '12 \u2013 will be serious and sustained commitment to the only transportation that will keep New York running, day-in, day-out.</p> <p>Namely, the public kind.</p>",
  "<p>With week six behind us, we're on the home straight in <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun\">Martin Odersky's Functional Programming Principles in Scala course</a>. We have covered a number of new concepts which we've already started to apply to our work, and gone into more detail on the practical and theoretical principles of functional programming. This post forms part of an ongoing series on our experiences with the course, so if you've missed the others, check out our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/sep/21/funtional-programming-principles-scala-first-impressions\">first impressions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/oct/05/functional-programming-scala-week-three\">our update 3 weeks into the course</a>.</p> <p>It's been a few weeks since our last update and in that time the course has moved on a long way. Week four introduced Scala's type system in detail, covering some advanced topics including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming\">Polymorphism</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming\">Generics</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_(computer_science)\">Variance</a>. Week five formally introduced Scala's <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html\">Lists</a> (we had been working on idealised representations of the List type up to this point). The List type was used as a springboard to look into higher order functions and we were taken through Scala's implicits (a technique in which you can insert or convert data types non-explicitly). Implicits can allow developers to create flexible and powerful libraries, but \u2013 while they serve a clear purpose \u2013 they can also hamper the comprehension of a codebase. Implicits, by their very nature, are opaque to anything other than a detailed inspection of the code and our experience of implicits is that they can cause confusion in codebases written and maintained by multiple developers.</p> <p>This week's lectures paid particular attention to Scala's for loop. Due to Scala's functional implementation, the loop syntax and behaviour is very different from the more familiar for loop found in languages like Java and C. In fact, Scala's for loop is just a shorthand for writing a combination of map, flatMap and filter calls on your collection. This sometimes leaves people asking what's the point in having this construct at all and we'd always overlooked the for loop as an unintuitive construct with unfamiliar syntax. The lectures and exercises take a bit of time to explain this relationship and outline some benefits to this approach. We found this week's assignment has highlighted that for loops can be particularly useful when the task is semantically one of generating a data structure from one or more input collections rather than reducing an existing collection. Also, looping through multiple dimensions can often be expressed with a for loop concisely, whereas writing out the collection operations explicitly can lead to some very opaque code.</p> <p>The second half of the course has shown a noticeable shift in the scope of the assignments. The first few weeks felt like Scala with stabilisers, working with very limited subsets of Scala's functionality to solve the type of highly abstract problem that lends itself naturally to functional programming paradigms. These serve as a fantastic introduction to functional programming and Scala's syntax but, as we commented in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/info/developer-blog/2012/oct/05/functional-programming-scala-week-three\">our last article</a>, this high level of abstraction was frustrating for some. The increased focus on practical aspects of the course has continued and we now find ourselves writing large programs to solve much more complex problems anchored in real-world examples. While these problems aren't necessarily going to come up in our day jobs, their complexity means that we're getting practice comprehending and manipulating Scala's data structures.</p> <p>We're also delighted we are going into more depth on the abstract side of functional programming. The course includes more advanced videos that have been largely optional (they're compulsory for students taking the full version) and take us through the benefits of the close relationship between functional programming and maths. This relationship emerges naturally because functional programming is a pure abstraction of mathematical principles in software, whereas imperative programming is designed around the constraints of the underlying hardware.</p> <p>One way to see how functional programming differs from programming in \"classical\" languages is in the way prospective developers are introduced to the concepts. Most C, Java and Python tutorials begin with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program\">\"Hello, world\"</a> example and move on to writing simple programs, introducing concepts as they go. Functional programming is very different \u2013 for some functional programming languages, even \"Hello, world\" can be a program that is built on some complex concepts because it is inherently impure (eg. it has side-effects). This course has followed the standard way to introduce functional programming by starting with pure, abstract programs to expose the developer to the underlying principles. You can then stack up more advanced concepts, all the while building an edifice of understanding with its foundations firmly rooted in basic axioms.</p> <p>For example, across all types of programming, tests are a crucial tool for verifying that software behaves the way it ought to. Odersky shows us an alternative way to verify a program by applying the tools available to mathematicians. Using inductive methods, we verify the absolute correctness of some functionality on Scala's Lists with mathematical proofs. It is possible, although sometimes difficult or impractical, to come up with test data that completely captures the behaviour for part of a program in unit or integration tests. However, if we can get to a mathematical proof, we know that the function must work correctly for any possible data. It is a much stronger measure of its correctness, albeit correspondingly harder to arrive at.</p> <p>We've got the last week ahead of us and at first glance it looks like we've got a tricky one in store, covering more of both the practical and abstract sides of functional programming and Scala. In the coming week, the extensive set of video lectures will introduce some new concepts and bring all that we've learned together, ready for us to create our largest program yet in the final assignment. Good luck and we hope to see you at graduation!</p>",

Their son, Barack, was born there, but the couple separated when the child was two.</p> <p>In his 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father, the president tells how he met Mama Sarah when he travelled to Kenya in search of his roots in his 20s, describing her as a large woman with a \"smooth and big-boned\" face and \"sparkling, laughing eyes\".</p> <p>Members of the Obama family said this week that the matriarch, who is now 90, did not plan to speak to the media \u2013 a police officer at her still-modest compound said she was sleeping when the Guardian visited.</p> <p>Inside the green gates, where cows were feeding at a trough under the trees, is the grave of her stepson, who died in a car crash in 1982.</p> <p>Said Hussein Obama, Mama Sarah's son and the president's half-uncle, is sure voters would give Barack Obama a second chance.</p> <p>\"Among his top achievements,\" he says in an email, \"he has restored the trust in, and dignity of, America among the international community, which were severely damaged by his predecessor.\"</p> <p>He says the president has performed well, considering what he has inherited from George W Bush, citing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the economic slump.</p> <p>\"[Obama] has brought honour and glory to a once-sleepy village \u2026 he has placed Kogelo on the world map,\" he says.</p> <p>Kogelo residents agree. Beatrice Akoth's hand glides elegantly through the air as the pregnant mother-of-six enumerates the benefits this fame has brought. \"There have been big improvements. There is water everywhere in the town. Before, the water was not clean. There's electricity and roads. The children get a good education. Occasionally, they go to Mama Sarah's and she provides maize and other food,\" she says in Luo.</p> <p>Said Hussein Obama says schools, a clinic, cultural centre and hotels have been built since his relative was elected. \"The ball is now in the court of the residents to make use of these facilities to help them grow.\"</p> <p>Other benefits are less tangible. In a motor parts shop, Kelvin Otieno Ouma remembers the day in 2006 when Obama came to his school. Otieno Ouma was 14 and head boy. He recalls how Obama ended his speech with <em>erokamano</em> \u2013 thank you in Luo.</p> <p>\"When I saw him,\" he says, \"I thought: we can make it. Despite your family background or how poor you are, you can achieve your goals through focus and determination. He made the students of the school work very hard to achieve their goals.\"</p> <p>Otieno Ouma dreams of being an orator and lawyer. He is saving to go to university in the capital, Nairobi, but says he still needs a sponsor. But Kogelo is still waiting for a visit from President Obama. Perhaps that is why nobody has renamed the school from Senator Obama primary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398764761\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/2/1351868688294/Kelvin-Otieno-Ouma-004.jpg\" alt=\"Kelvin Otieno Ouma,\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelvin Otieno Ouma, 20.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clar Ni Chonghaile/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if people were disappointed by this absence, the <em>boda-boda</em> driver Evans is adamant \u2013 and pragmatic.</p> <p>\"Oh no, no, no,\" he says. \"We haven't been disappointed.

I know he'll come.\"</p> <p>Evans does not think defeat for Obama, although obviously inconceivable to him, would be the end of Kogelo's fame.</p> <p>\"That big name has changed lots of things. Business is good \u2026 I don't think it will change. (People) will come. History is here.\"</p> <p>Tuesday's election is not the only vote being talked about in Kenya. The country is due to elect its own president in March, and there are fears the violence that erupted after the last ballot in 2007 could do so again.</p> <p>An Obama victory would lift spirits in Kogelo, but in reality, its future depends more on the outcome of the March poll.</p> <p>Ochieng hopes Kenya's politicians, widely condemned for corruption and for using tribalism to rally voters, have learned their own Obama lesson.</p> <p>\"If you compare the leadership in Kenya and in the US, [Obama] has made our leaders look up, he has given them an example.\"</p>",
  "<p>Poverty is America's economic Hurricane Sandy. Close to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/21/373432/vitter-food-stamp-cap/?mobile=nc\">50 million Americans</a> \u2013 a number equal to the populations of the states hardest hit by the devastating storm \u2013 are below the poverty line. But one wouldn't know it from the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/170749/home-foreclosures-missing-presidential-debates\">silence of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney</a> on the topic. In contrast to the physical storm, neither presidential candidate has promised the full resources of the government that they wish to lead in turning the tide on this searing issue. Their dual muteness is shocking given what's at stake.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/161013227/poverty-rate-unchanged-but-still-historically-high\">One in six Americans is poor</a>. Due to the ravages of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, their ranks have grown to the highest level in almost a generation. Most of those in poverty are the working poor \u2013 those employed but who don't earn enough to live \u2013 and their children. Though the poor are overwhelmingly white, poor people are disproportionately black and brown. <a href=\"http://www.npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief16/index.php\">One in three African Americans</a> is poor, as is <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/lifestyle/2012/09/12/one-in-every-4-us-hispanics-lives-in-poverty/\">one in four Latinos</a>. Though poverty has grown, when it comes to actual discussion during this year's presidential race, you can hear a pin drop.</p> <p>Neither during the campaign nor his term in office has President Obama given one speech dedicated to poverty. In his second run for the presidency, besides the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/mitt-romney-47-percent_n_1941423.html\">wayward \"47%\" comment that the poor \"did not take responsibility for their lives\"</a>, Mitt Romney hasn't either. Poverty was barely discussed during any of the presidential debates. The topic is nowhere to be found on either candidate's website. </p> <p>An absence of real talk on poverty is not a surprise. Ronald Reagan successfully fused the issue of poverty with racial animosity in his first bid for the White House. In 1976, the \"Great Commnunicator\" \u2013 playing off of southern white resentment of economic and social change in the 1960s and 1970s \u2013 falsely labeled America's poor as black \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html\">welfare queens</a>\". Ever since, this distortion of poverty has served as an effective way to get votes from the white working class.</p> <p>The issue became radioactive for Democrats and remains so. Republicans even managed to jujitsu President Bill Clinton into <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/what-it-will-take-for-barack-obama-to-become-the-next-fdr/264195/\">dismantling the program of federal assistance</a> for the poor instituted by Franklin D Roosevelt. </p> <p>Reagan's poverty slight-of-hand worked so well that Mitt Romney, in a tight race, tried it himself. Trailing among white women, Romney unleashed a summer-long attack on welfare. Romney <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/ct-oped-0812-page-20120812,0,5718812.column\">falsely accused</a> Obama of secretly rolling back the program's work requirement and five-year cap instituted under Clinton. \"Under Obama's plan \u2026 they just send you your check,\" the ad bogusly asserted. But the president never did such a thing, and the lie was eventually exposed.</p> <p>Romney's attempt to gain votes through racial division consequently ran out of gas. But that wouldn't stop the campaign from trying again.</p> <p>Last week, in a move also aimed at white women, Republican vice-presidential-nominee Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/10/25/1087591/paul-ryan-contraception-threat/\">gave a speech on the poor</a>. Ryan pledged his ticket's support for \"upward mobility\" to end poverty. While laying out his vision, he faulted America's expansion of racial and economic justice programs under Democratic President Lyndon Johnson for the current iniquities. Oddly, he claimed that the best way to increase economic opportunity for the poor is to end the very education, health, and work-support programs that poor men and women use to exit impoverishment.</p> <p>Polls taken in the speech's wake show that Ryan's desire to pull up the economic ladder didn't fare well. Like the first attempt, the latest political push on the poor ran out of gas.</p> <p>Though neither presidential candidate may have addressed it straight on as a public policy issue, poverty <em>can</em> be rolled back and millions lifted it from it. In the last 50 years, poverty has come down during periods when strong economic growth meets aggressive government policies to catapult the poor into the working and middle classes. These programs \u2013 specifically in education, health, housing, transportation, work-skill development and racial discrimination \u2013 are what's truly needed to make America an economically fairer place.</p> <p>America has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/business/economy/a-slow-recovery-but-its-all-relative.html\">slowly started to recover from recession</a>. It's time that the country get back to the business of focusing on the poor.</p> <p>But instead, what we've gotten is the continuation of policies which extend the 30 year-long reorientation of government from the needs of the many towards the needs of the super-rich. The numbers show it. Poverty is at a record high, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/top-earners-doubled-share-of-nations-income-cbo-says.html\">so is the top 1%'s share of national income</a>. Poverty and income inequality are moving in tandem, in the wrong direction. Only renewed action to make the economy work for everybody will reverse it.</p> <p>Sadly, instead of redirecting the economic winds to everyone's benefit, both candidates are all too eager to continue to ride the waves of economic and political inertia.</p>",
  "<p>If there's one thing that unites all video-game movie adaptations, it's that they're all unremittingly ghastly. But if there's another thing, it's probably their desire to strike while the iron is hot. Without fail, from Super Mario Brothers and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/57404/street-fighter\" title=\"\">Street Fighter</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/06/michael-fassbender-shame-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender</a>'s recently announced Assassin's Creed film, these movies tend to be released at the peak of a game's popularity. And not, say, three decades after the game was first released, as will be the case with Castle Wolfenstein.</p> <p>Yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/castle-wolfenstein-video-game-coming-385318\" title=\"\">Panorama Media announced</a> that <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000812/\" title=\"\">Roger Avary</a> \u2013 who wrote the script for Pulp Fiction \u2013 would write and direct a movie based on the 1981 Apple II shooter. According to the announcement, the film will be \"an action-adventure film in the vein of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142811/captain-america\" title=\"\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/128690/inglourious-basterds\" title=\"\">Inglourious Basterds</a>\". But why Castle Wolfenstein? Why now?</p> <p>It's such a bizarre choice of game to adapt. Not in terms of storyline \u2013 if the world needs anything, it's a film about a Rambo knockoff pelting through a castle and blasting through waves and waves of undead mutant Nazis until he reaches a berserk armour-plated robo-Hitler \u2013 but in terms of age. Castle Wolfenstein was first released more than 30 years ago. If you want to be picky, you could argue that it sounds as if Avary will actually adapt Wolfenstein 3D, which didn't come out until long after Castle Wolfenstein, but even that's still more than 20 years old. It's the opposite of striking while the iron is hot. It's tapping at an iron that's almost completely rusted away.</p> <p>What this means is that, when it's released, Castle Wolfenstein might be the first video-game adaptation not to be targeted at the current generation of gamers. People who loved the Wolfenstein games are people who get misty-eyed about the golden age of gaming, back when games could be knocked up by a couple of blokes in a bedroom and not an entire billion-dollar studio. They're people who used to wait for 25 minutes while their games loaded from a cassette, who know that hitting the T key during International Karate Plus would make everyone drop their trousers, who can't get the hang of modern Call of Duty games because there are just too many buttons to press at once.</p> <p>It's an interesting approach, and it might just work. Until now, video-game movies have been little more than lazy cash-in afterthoughts that exist solely to maximise a franchise's revenue. But Avary has had decades to think about Wolfenstein. He's got to know its plot and its tone and its humour inside out. Perhaps leaving it so long is actually a blessing in disguise. Without the expectation of market forces pressing down on him, he can take this semi-forgotten gem of a game and craft something loving and nostalgic and golden-hued out of it. Then again, this is a story about shooting robo-Hitler in the face with a chain gun. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it.</p>",

  "<p>And so it goes on. After the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/tory-privatisation-plans-blow-cornwall\" title=\"\">political bloodletting over mega-outsourcing of public services in Cornwall</a>, the spotlight has shifted back to the biggest proposed local government privatisation of them all: the \u00a31bn One Barnet scheme.</p> <p>Next Tuesday Richard Cornelius, the leader of Barnet, the London council, faces <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/inside-outsourcing/2012/11/barnet-council-leader-faces-axe-over-outsourcing-on-tuesday.html\" title=\"\">a vote of no-confidence</a> over One Barnet. Just as in Cornwall, the outsourcing plan is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/12/friern-barnet-library-cuts-fight\" title=\"\">publicly unpopular</a>. As in Cornwall, where the deputy leader quit in protest at the scheme, a senior Tory councillor has come out calling for the scheme to be scrapped.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.barnet-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=38205&amp;headline=Brian%2520Coleman:%2520%27One%2520Barnet%2520should%2520be%2520scrapped\" title=\"\">scathing piece</a> published in the Barnet Press this week, councillor Brian Coleman, the chair of the council's budget and overview committee, describes One Barnet as \"a flawed scheme\" and a \"turkey\".</p> <p>Coleman writes:</p> <blockquote> Many Conservative councillors feel they are powerless to stop this officer-driven juggernaut or as one senior Conservative put it - we are lemmings heading for the cliff. <br>The council needs to dump this flawed scheme and introduce a proper strategy which assesses where services belong, whether that is the private sector, shared services with other boroughs, the voluntary sector or indeed occasionally in-house - a mixed economy is what is needed. For example, I don't know any councillors who agree we should privatise the planning department. <br>Conservatives are pragmatic and anyway the concept of One Barnet is fundamentally un-Conservative and ignores localism. It is totally New Labour, in fact. <br>The time has come to dump One Barnet and return to core local government values and make sure this particular turkey does not see Christmas! <br> </blockquote> <p>Close observers of Barnet politics may see this as self-serving, rather disingenuous exercise in buck-passing. Coleman blames council officials, trade unions and even the last Labour government for a scheme that he, as a senior Tory, appears not to have seen fit to question, at least in public, for the past three years, despite a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2011/jun/17/barnet-easy-council-scandal-puts-reforms-in-spotlight\" title=\"\">series of controversies</a>.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://wwwbrokenbarnet.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/brian-coleman-and-one-barnet-some.html\" title=\"\">joint post</a> published today by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2011/jul/07/eric-pickles-praises-barnet-bloggers\" title=\"\">five local campaigning Barnet bloggers</a> points out:</p> <blockquote> Notwithstanding ...our very many differences with Cllr Coleman over the years, there is an indisputable truth in much of what he is now saying about One Barnet: it is only a pity that someone did not speak out publicly before. </blockquote> <p>Whether Coleman, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Coleman\" title=\"\">colourful and controversial character</a> who oversaw London Fire Authority on behalf of mayor Boris Johnson for four years, will inspire others to rebel rebellion is open to question. This week he was <a href=\"http://lydall.standard.co.uk/2012/10/boriss-former-fire-chief-brian-coleman-suspended-by-tories.html\" title=\"\">suspended from the Conservative Party</a> after being charged with assault. He will appear in court on Monday, the day before the no confidence vote.</p> <p>But his suggestion that \"many\" fellow Tory councillors share his views on One Barnet is interesting. Although this is a Labour motion, which would not normally hold much weight, a simple majority vote could topple Cornelius. Of the 63 councillors, 25 are Labour and Liberal Democrats, so a handful of rebel Tories could trigger a crisis.</p> <p>Cornelius will have much to do to assure potential rebels that their concerns are being met. In Cornwall, it was as much the stubborn refusal of the ill-fated leader Alec Robertson to contemplate any other possible course of action, as the controversial Joint Venture strategy itself, that led to his downfall.</p> <p>Cornelius was regarded as a One Barnet-sceptic when he became leader. But as recently as July he was dismissing criticisms of One Barnet as \"a lot of froth\". He <a href=\"http://www.barnet-today.co.uk/coldetail.cfm?id=1382&amp;bid=1122&amp;headline=No%20organisation%20can%20stay%20how%20it%20has%20always%20been\" title=\"\">wrote in a blog post</a>:</p> <blockquote> There has been opposition to this modernisation, but then I took some time to come to terms with it myself. </blockquote> <p>So, will potential Tory rebels consider that Cornelius is the man to rein in One Barnet? Compare Coleman's description of One Barnet as \"fundamentally un-Conservative\" with the leader's view of One Barnet <a href=\"http://www.barnet-today.co.uk/coldetail.cfm?id=1382&amp;bid=1122&amp;headline=No%20organisation%20can%20stay%20how%20it%20has%20always%20been\" title=\"\">expressed just three months ago</a>, that there was, in effect No Alternative:</p> <blockquote> We do need to change the way we do things just for the sake of improvement. No organisation can ever stay the way it has always been. Nostalgia is fine but the world has moved on. </blockquote> <p>This week Barnet announced that it would not, after all, outsource its waste and street scene services, and would <a href=\"http://www.barnet.gov.uk/news/article/170/one_barnet_proposals_published_for_future_of_waste_and_public_space\" title=\"\">take back under council control its recycling service</a>, currently delivered by a private firm. This decision that means 700 staff will remain \"in house.\" This signalled, perhaps a softening in the council's position. On the other hand, also this week, the council re-affirmed that <a href=\"http://www.barnet.gov.uk/news/article/172/barnet_council_efficiency_savings_mean_no_rise_in_council_tax_but_further_cuts_predicted_for_2015\" title=\"\">One Barnet would still be the main driver of cost savings</a> in the era of huge funding cuts.</p> <p>So what is Barnet? A pragmatic, mixed economy council, or a ideologically-driven commissioning organisation? Even if Cornelius survives the Tuesday vote, the full council must still decide whether to press ahead with two mega-contracts valued collectively at \u00a31bn that would see 70% of council services offloaded in one fell swoop.</p> <p>The lesson of the last two years is that road to mega-outsourcing is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/thatcher-outsourcing-fantasy-fails-reality\" title=\"\">littered with political corpses. </a>Privatising everything in the municipal landscape is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/23/suffolk-council-outsource-barnet\" title=\"\">long-held Tory dream</a>, but recent experience tells us that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2011/may/10/all-over-local-government-reform\" title=\"\">voters don't care much for the idea</a>, and many Tory councils (if they survive the public backlash) turn back before they reach the promised land.</p> <p>Local politicians across the political spectrum wonder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2012/oct/23/council-cuts-chief-warns-outsourcing-no-longer-cuts-mustard\" title=\"\">if such schemes work</a>: they fear the political and financial risks, and the loss of accountability and democratic oversight. They are sceptical that such schemes can deliver the promised savings.</p> <p>Changing what local government does and how it delivers it is inevitable, given the financial climate. But \"grandiose re-organisation\" as Cllr Coleman describes One Barnet, is rapidly falling out of favour. Grassroots Tory confidence in huge schemes is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2012/oct/18/tory-council-privatisation-cuts-dilemma-cornwall-outsourcing\" title=\"\">draining away</a>. There are limits, it seems, to the market, and no simple privatised silver bullet solution to the financial woes of councils.</p>",

The \"<a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Jobs_and_US_economic_recovery_A_panel_discussion_2843\">jobless recovery</a>\" seems to actually be adding jobs.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/jobs-figures-us-economy\">Housing, autos, consumer spending</a> \u2013 all have been indicating a recovery that is starting in earnest. Taken as a trend, the jobs numbers this year indicate that more people are finding jobs. It's not nearly enough \u2013 there are still millions out of work \u2013 but it's more progress than anyone had dared hope for in the past three years.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is shocking stuff. And it changes, or should change, something in the way we talk about and think about the US economy.&#xa0;There is a lot that has been written, lately, about&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/free-nate-silver/2012/10/31/74bec65a-234f-11e2-8448-81b1ce7d6978_blog.html\">Nate Silver's numerical election analysis</a>&#xa0;and the death of \"<a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3253\">horse-race election coverage</a>\", in terms of the politics.</p> <p>But there has also been a kind of horse-race economics thinking, in newspapers and research reports. The economy has been treated like a month-by-month race towards some undefinable end, which we don't seem to be reaching anyway.&#xa0;Every month, with the jobs numbers, journalists and economists and analysts handicap whether the economy is recovering (that month) or suffering (that month). The big picture, hard to see, has been impossible to describe.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's highlighted with the popular Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NFPguesses&amp;src=typd\">#NFPguesses</a>, in which tweeters spend the morning of the jobs speculating on what the exact number of jobs added might be. It's a fun intellectual game, which actually only highlights how unpredictable and strange the unemployment figures have become.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, it's more clear that the economy is going up \u2013 at least, most of the useful economic indicators we have are pointing that way. And if there's any fairness in the world, horse-race economic thinking should come to an end: the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/nov/01/jobs-figures-us-economy\">economy seems to be well on its way to recovery by most measures</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>So, perhaps, Superman (in the form of the BLS) is starting to put an end to the horse-race guesses of whether the economy is improving or not, and what that means for politicians, who, realistically, have no individual control over whether people are employed or not. It's become hard to doubt that a real, if modest, recovery in the economy is definitely happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>Josh Brown, a <a href=\"http://about.me/joshuamorganbrown\">blogger and analyst with Fusion Analytics</a>, put it best when he joked in a fake headline:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic recovery threatens \u2026 handwringing industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>And for Governor Mitt Romney, these jobs numbers, coming so close to the election, will naturally undercut his argument that the economy is bad \u2013 even though the jobs numbers are notoriously vague and inconclusive. That might leave him saying another famous quote from the Simpsons:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>D'oh!</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>BBC producers had initial doubts about hiring Jimmy Savile to present Top of the Pops in the early 1960s, it has been claimed.</p> <p>However, their concerns are believed to have been over Savile's background as a club DJ and manager, rather than over allegations of sex abuse that have now engulfed the BBC and other public institutions including hospitals.</p> <p>A former Yorkshire committee member of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain has also revealed that he was strongly opposed to Savile having anything to do with the charity in the 1980s and 1990s, because of his background in clubs and \"reputation for entertaining young girls\".</p> <p>BBC entertainment producers initially rejected Savile as a Top of the Pops presenter when they were planning what would become the long-running music chart show in the early 1960s, according to Paul Jackson, the producer of Red Dwarf and The Young Ones, and a former head entertainment at both the BBC and ITV.</p> <p>Jackson, 65, was a teenager at the time and his father, T Leslie Jackson, was one of the BBC producers who attended planning meetings for what became Top of the Pops.</p> <p>His father had asked Jackson, then still at school, who the top DJs were and he suggested Savile, having seen him at a ballroom in the north-west.</p> <p>\"My dad had been rostered to go to a group meeting at the BBC,\" Jackson told MediaGuardian. \"They were thinking of launching what became Top of the Pops. When he came back from it, it was almost as if he was saying to me, 'you made me look silly', as if I had been suggesting a gangster.</p> <p>\"A few days later he said to me, 'he'll never work for the BBC'. I didn't know exactly why \u2026 these things get said.</p> <p>\"But literally, a year or less after dad said that, Savile was the first DJ on Top of the Pops, which started in 1964. When I queried this he said, 'things change'. But he was an obvious choice. He was the most prominent DJ of the time, on Radio Luxembourg.\"</p> <p>Savile went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter for 20 years and returned for the final edition of the weekly show in 2006.</p> <p>Jackson said he believed the reason for the BBC's initial reluctance to use Savile on Top of the Pops was because of his background in the club scene. As well as DJing he was a club manager in the 1950s.</p> <p>\"Savile was thought to be dodgy, there was a feeling he was heavy, you didn't cross him, he was a heavy dude,\" Jackson said.</p> <p>He added that those who came through the clubbing circuit, flooded with cash and drugs, were tough: \"They had bodyguards, they had sharp elbows, you had to protect yourself.\"</p> <p>John Oldfield, who was on the Yorkshire committee of the Royal Variety Club of Great Britain from 1981 to 1996, and its chairman in 1989, also had concerns about Savile's background in clubs.</p> <p>\"We didn't let him near the charity. Everyone knew, everybody I spoke to knew he was dodgy. It was widespread, it went back to when he was working at the Meccas, all over the UK, but also in Leeds,\" said Oldfield, who owned an ad agency based in Leeds until he sold out in 1999 and is now membership director of industry trade body the IPA.</p> <p>\"He had a reputation for entertaining young girls. He was the top DJ in Leeds. He was always chasing around with young girls, it goes back 30 to 40 years, and it just wasn't right, even when you consider it was the days of flower power and free love. He looked dodgy, he sounded dodgy, he was dodgy. And why did he always turn up with that motorised van?\"</p> <p>Jackson witnessed at first hand the heady mix of frenzied fans and sexual freedom which characterised the broadcasting and music industries in the 1960s and said attitudes had clearly changed since then.</p> <p>\"I was around at the BBC during the 1960s because of my dad. It was a different time. It wasn't now. The commissioners were fighting to keep the girls out of the dressing rooms,\" Jackson said.</p> <p>\"We had the Beatles, the Rolling Stones turning up at White City to do shows. There was buzz, then a scandal about payola.</p> <p>\"These were crazy times. It wasn't as if [Savile] was unique. But there was something that was not attractive about him to other stars I worked with. In the 1970s there were rumours about general bad behaviour, about young [girls], but not meaning underage girls \u2026 It was not thought he was raping any one under the legal age of consent.\"</p> <p>Of the current flood of sexual abuse claims against Savile, Jackson said:\" I am surprised by the scale, which is staggering, but not surprised by it. It is difficult to say we all knew, because you then face the question, why the hell didn't you do something about it?</p> <p>\"It is hard to know what came first, abuse or charity. Did he do charity to gain access to girls, or assuage his Catholic guilt? Or was it a calculated front? He did really work ceaselessly at charity fundraising. He was a weird mix.</p> <p>\"I hardly ever met him. I never witnessed anything, but there were always whispers and words. If I had walked into a dressing room and found him having sex with a woman, I would have said: 'Lock the bloody door next time, Jimmy.' But if it had been with a child, of course I would have reported it.\"</p> <p>Jackson joined the BBC as a production assistant in 1971 and worked on some editions of Top of the Pops in a junior role early in his career. His credits as a producer include The Two Ronnies, Three of a Kind and Saturday Live.</p> <p>After a varied career at the BBC, as an independent producer and managing director of ITV company Carlton, he became the corporation's controller of entertainment in 1997, several years after Savile had stopped working regularly for the organisation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,178381,00.html\" title=\"\">In Louis Theroux's 2000 BBC2 documentary about Savile</a>, he talked about how he dealt with troublemakers when he was working in clubs: \"I never threw anybody out. Tied them up and put them down in the bloody boiler house until I was ready for them. Two o'clock in the fucking morning... We'd tie em up and then we'd come back and I was the judge, jury and executioner.\"</p> <p>Savile later told Theroux he was talking metaphorically and said he would never tie anyone up \u2013 only with words \u2013 but admitted \"some of my people might have done\".</p> <p>He described drug dealers as \"dirty slags\". \"If those people wanted to sell drugs, so be it, but it must not happen in my place. All there is to it. No arguments. I invented zero tolerance.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Thomas Keneally discovered a cache of journals from Australian nurses who looked after the wounded of the first world war, he realised he had found a novel in waiting. He tells us about the stories behind The Daughters of Mars, and explains why, years after winning the Booker prize with Schindler's Ark, he keeps being drawn back to the subject of war.</p> <p>Then we look at how people with mental problems were treated in Victorian England. Historian Sarah Wise introduces some of the characters who feature in her book, and tells us why their stories must be heard today.</p> <p>Finally, we turn to Brooke Magnanti, who found notoriety when she outed herself as the call-girl diarist Belle de Jour in 2009. But it wasn't her blogging which earned her a place on the judging panel for the Wellcome prize for medicine in literature, it was a background which includes a PhD in pathology. She talks us through the shortlist for the prize, and muses about why medical stories are so popular today in both fiction and non-fiction.</p> <h2>Reading list</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780340951873/the-daughters-of-mars\">The Daughters of Mars</a> by Thomas Keneally (Sceptre)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/history/9781847921123/inconvenient-people-lunacy-liberty-and-the-mad-doctors-in-victorian-england\">Inconvenient People</a> by Sarah Wise (Bodley Head)</p> <p><strong>Wellcome prize shortlist</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780007413515/the-hour-between-dog-and-wolf-risk-taking-gut-feelings-and-the-biology-of-boom-and-bust\">The Hour Between Dog and Wolf</a> by John Coates (Fourth Estate)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/music/9780224093576/the-train-in-the-night-a-story-of-music-and-loss\">The Train in the Night</a> by Nick Coleman (Jonathan Cape)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780224082051/our-lady-of-alice-bhatti\">Our Lady of Alice Bhatti</a> by Mohammed Hanif (Jonathan Cape)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780230760523/perfect-people\">Perfect People</a> by Peter James (Macmillan)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780701185206/merivel-a-man-of-his-time\">Merivel</a> by Rose Tremain (Chatto and Windus)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/history/9780701185732/circulation-william-harveys-revolutionary-idea\">Circulation</a> by Thomas Wright (Chatto and Windus)</p>",

  "<p>No, please, no more. Really, no more goals. This week the sense of altered pressure, a minor shifting of the barometer in English football has been almost tangible. It isn't exactly raining goals out there, it is more a persistent humidity of goals, a rising fungal mulch.</p> <p>The increase in goals scored per game in the Premier League has been clear for some time: each of the past three seasons has brought an increase on the old record, while this season we may for the first time top three goals per game. But it is also there in the way football feels now.</p> <p>On Saturday lunchtime Manchester United will play Arsenal, a fixture that may once have conjured a sense of high level constriction, of a miserly wringing out of decisive details, but which instead we must contemplate pre-exhausted with goal leap and net bulge, braced for repeated TV cutaways to that frighteningly unguarded moment when even the most contained and ruminative of managers will come rearing up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverback#Group_life\" title=\"\">like a startled silverback</a>, neck swivelling, fists bunched, face the colour of startled spam.</p> <p>For all the cajoling of television, a glut of goals is not something that anybody really contemplates with any pleasure. Watching Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Brian McDermott on the touchline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/30/reading-arsenal-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">during the 7-5 at the Madejski</a> there was a shared sense of some collective bungle in train, the two managers standing helpless and baffled like empty-handed men at the top of a scaffold surveying, for a frozen moment, the wreckage of the ruined chandelier down below.</p> <p>Nobody who really likes football likes goals that much. Not in the abstract, deprived of context or scarcity value. What is the pleasure, really, in witnessing a goal? Or in witnessing a goal surrounded by so many other goals that it becomes little more than its basic parts: a leather sphere propelled across a chalk line into a segmented nylon gauze. Does that sound fun? The only way in which a goal has any real content is against the wider background of an&#xa0;absence of goals. There must be struggle and despair, we must genuinely believe to the last that a goal may not happen at all.</p> <p>This is why television commentators, in times of goal scarcity, would howl and yelp and say things like \"Rammed it in!\" and \"Glorious from the Ipswich schemer!\" still completely astonished that anything like this could ever happen, success so huge and wholly farcical. By contrast football that is flush with goals, its emotional barometer set constantly to delirium, is like watching an endless series of cinematic climaxes with no narrative ballast: two hours of car crashes, or closing musical montages, or Robin Williams looking wise and hugging someone as the credits start to roll. This isn't enough. We need to know that Robin Williams has previously suffered, felt angry, clowned inspiringly in front of photogenic children, perhaps even that Robin Williams will soon die of some decorative disease. Why is this happening? It has become fashionable to suggest that teams have \"forgotten how to defend\", albeit it seems more likely that defending has become more difficult. Most obviously this is because of the rule changes that have dampened the concussive side of football, forcing a defending player to compete in registers such as balance, speed and agility, rather than just the catch-all smear of physical force. Plus there is the continuing nightmare of offside, confusion wrought by progressive fiddling around at the edges that echoes dimly the more major change to the offside rules of the early 1920s that led to the Football League's greatest upsurge in goalscoring, the Dixie Dean era of Brylcreemed cannonball centre-forwards</p> <p>And perhaps some credit is due here after all. Even in a traditionally conservative league, attacking innovations have become a cautious kind of vogue. The defining image of last season's title race was the sight of Yaya Tour\u00e9 in his \"advanced\" runaway dustcart mode, the ball not so much glued to his foot as caught beneath his rearing hooves. A highly effective attacking tool, albeit one that, as a footballing spectacle, brings to mind a particularly chaotic West Country cheese rolling competition glimpsed briefly on the Saturday afternoon regional news.</p> <p>This season it has been the turn of Chelsea to provide innovation via the attacking trio known to some (apparently) as \"Mazacar\", and led by Juan Mata and supported most memorably by the luminous Oscar, who doesn't so much run as glide and moonwalk and slither with a bell\u2011bottomed sense of chic and who could be teleported into any team in any era, past or future, and people would still sigh and swoon and blush and say: \"Oh yes, oh \u2026 yes, mmm, such lissome grace oh I say he's a doll, daddy, an absolute doll.\"</p> <p>Beyond this the current goal glut is perhaps not so much a function of tactics or tinkering, but of money, which has already skewed and flustered pretty much everything else in football. Recently, I asked a multiple title-winning defender about the current standard of defending and his response was that players don't have the time now to perfect the art; that defending is boring, serious and horribly repetitive work, that the rehearsals and drills involved demand a sense of subservience, humility, even desperation, that is just not there. Players are too preoccupied elsewhere, too itinerant, with team-building too hurried and too much a process of ad&#xa0;hoc diplomacy.</p> <p>Perhaps, just as no one will ever draw like Michelangelo again because there simply isn't the time or the inclination, nobody will ever defend like J\u00fcrgen Kohler or Steve Bould or Franco Baresi. And perhaps this isn't even something to regret or revolt against, it is simply part of these wider currents.</p> <p>It is what is happening now: a phenomenon to be observed with a sense not of rising panic or a wringing of the hands, but glazed and burpingly sated, replete with our own sense of everyday delirium.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC, four other public institutions and Jimmy Savile's estate are facing more than 50 potential damages claims from alleged victims of sex abuse by the late TV and radio presenter.</p> <p>The rising number of potential legal claims shows there is no sign of the crisis abating. The BBC director general, George Entwistle, plans a further meeting on Monday with the National Association for People Abused in Childhood with the aim of forging a partnership with the charity, which is seeking funds after dealing with up to 6,000 calls since the Savile scandal broke.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a partner at law firm Russell Jones &amp; Walker in London and an expert in personal injury and child abuse cases, said she was in contact with 30 alleged victims and the number had almost doubled in the past week.</p> <p>Up to 20 other people contacted Alan Collins, the solicitor who represented victims of the Jersey child abuse scandal. Another London-based law firm specialising in child abuse cases, AO Advocates, said it was in contact with five other alleged victims and was assessing whether to launch claims.</p> <p>Collins, of law firm Pannone, said the BBC and Savile estate should consider opening a compensation fund to deal with the flood of claims. \"You've got the makings of a group action already but how official that becomes depends on the attitude of the BBC and the estate,\" he said. \"So far, all the abuse happened in the UK in a wide variety of circumstances. Savile was an opportunist, he was a risk-taker; it [the abuse] seems to have happened very quickly. He seems to have an eye for taking advantage of an opportunity.\"</p> <p>Collins has written legal letters before action on behalf of four complainants this week, and intends to do so on behalf of another victim in the coming days.</p> <p>Dux is acting for women who intend to sue the BBC, Stoke Mandeville hospital, Leeds general infirmary, the Duncroft approved school and an unnamed institution where Savile is alleged to have assaulted at least one woman.</p> <p>No claims have yet been filed at the high court. Dux said she would be making an announcement on the progress of the claims in the coming days.</p> <p>She said damages payments in such cases could range from a few thousand pounds for those who suffered a minor assault and were able to get on with their lives to hundreds of thousands if their lives were judged to have been wrecked \u2013 if they had been unable to have a career or form relationships, for example.</p> <p>The cases are being prepared on the grounds of \"vicarious liability\" against the BBC and other public institutions, hospitals, their staff and agents. Savile was not an employee of the any of the hospitals but was invited on to their premises and, in some cases, given a room or access to staff quarters, making them legally liable for his behaviour.</p> <p>With the police now pursuing 400 lines of inquiry, the threat of legal action is expected to spread to other institutions where Savile made official charity visits.</p> <p>The Department of Health could be sued directly over claims the star abused patients when he was a volunteer at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital in the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>The mounting claims prompted NatWest, which is acting as executor and trustee of Savile's \u00a34.3m estate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/01/jimmy-savile-estate-frozen-sexual-abuse\" title=\"\">to freeze his account and the distribution of his assets according to his will</a>, given the threatened claims for compensation.Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 28 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times.

  "<p>The following interesting question arose yesterday from what at first appeared to be some petty Twitter bickering: who was the worst president for civil liberties in US history? That question is a difficult one to answer because it is so reliant upon which of many valid standards of measurement one chooses; it depends at least as much on the specific rights which one understands the phrase \"civil liberties\" to encompass. That makes the question irresolvable in any definitive way, but its examination is nonetheless valuable for the light it sheds on current political disputes.</p> <p>It's worthwhile first to set forth the context in which the question arose. At their Lawfare blog, Ritika Singh and Benjamin Wittes <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/10/civil-liberties-in-the-war-of-1812/\">posted an excerpt</a> of an essay they wrote for a new book on the War of 1812; their essay pertains to the impact of that war on civil liberties and executive power. The two Brookings writers note that despite intense domestic opposition to the war, President Madison \"eschewed the authority to detain American citizens in military custody or try them in military tribunals, and more generally, declined to undertake the sorts of executive overreaches we have come to expect - and even encourage - from our presidents in war.\" </p> <p>After Julian Sanchez, I and others tweeted that essay by remarking that Madison refrained from exploiting the war to abridge civil liberties, Slate's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264005363010002945\">Matt Yglesias' wrote</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398788006\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351853066074/yglesias.png\" alt=\"yglesias tweet\" width=\"360\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That struck me as a cheap and vapid reply. Nobody was suggesting that Madison was the personification of civil liberties nirvana. Rather, the point was a very narrow and discrete one: he largely refrained from exploiting the War of 1812 as a pretext for abridging extant political rights. Whether he owned slaves - or was otherwise the worst monster in history - does not remotely pertain to, let alone negate, that specific and important historical fact about Madison's presidency.</p> <p>Moreover, the issue raised by the essay on Madison was about the extent to which presidents use their power to erode civil liberties which exist when they assumed the office, or refrain from attacking those rights despite having the opportunity in the form of war or other crises. That a person is born into a society in which the evil of slavery already exists has little to do with that historical question.</p> <p>That said, once one posits a president's personal slavery ownership as inconsistent with a positive civil liberties record - as Yglesias implicitly did - then that must be the number one factor in assessing a president's place on the civil liberties list. By that metric, all slave-owning presidents, or one who <a href=\"http://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/educator-resources/lessons-plans/presidents/dred-scott/\">expressly endorsed the Dred Scott decision as James Buchanan did</a>, would automatically have to be deemed the worst.</p> <p>After all, owning human beings as chattel is the supreme civil liberties violation, by far the gravest civil liberties abuse in US history. That goes without saying. It is sui generis.</p> <p>That's why it was so bizarre to see that the very same Matt Yglesias, just moments later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/264006669296615425\">pronounced Woodrow Wilson</a> - a president who never owned any slaves and never presided over slavery - to be the \"worst-ever president on civil liberties\", even suggesting that Wilson has no \"serious competition\" for that ignominious title. It was when I pointed out the irony of Yglesias' selection of a non-slave-owning president in light of his tweet that the interesting question arose of who should be considered the worst civil liberties president in US history.</p> <p>If one were simply to consider specific acts which constituted grave assaults on civil liberties - narrowly defined as the core political rights explicitly protected by the Bill of Rights: free speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, etc. - one could make a strong argument for several presidents. John Adams <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Alien.html\">signed The Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which essentially criminalized certain forms of government criticism in preparation for a war with France, a radical assault on the First Amendment. </p> <p>Abraham Lincoln <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0029.205?rgn=main;view=fulltext\">illegally suspended the core liberty of habeas corpus</a> without Congressional approval. Wilson's <a href=\"http://www.chicora.org/woodrow-wilson.html\">attacks on basic free speech in the name of national security</a> were indeed legion and probably unparalleled. Franklin Roosevelt <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/roosevelt-ushers-in-japanese-american-internment\">oversaw the due-process-free internment</a> of more than 100,000 law-abiding Japanese-Americans into concentration camps.</p> <p>And then there are the two War on Terror presidents. George Bush seized on the 9/11 attack to usher in radical new surveillance and detention powers in the PATRIOT ACT, spied for years on the communications of US citizens without the warrants required by law, and claimed the power to indefinitely imprison even US citizens without charges in military brigs. </p> <p>His successor, Barack Obama, went further by claiming the power <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/02/president-obama-signed-the-national-defense-authorization-act-now-what/\">not merely to detain citizens without judicial review</a> but <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/04/07/assassinations_2/\">to assassinate them</a> (about which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">the New York Times said</a>: \"It is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for an American to be approved for targeted killing\"). He has waged an unprecedented war on whistleblowers, dusting off Wilson's Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute more then double the number of whistleblowers than all prior presidents combined. And he has draped his actions with at least as much secrecy, if not more so, than any president in US history.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is close to impossible to rank these abuses strictly as a qualitative matter, in terms of the powers seized. How does one say that interning citizens in concentration camps (Roosevelt) is better or worse than imprisoning people for dissent (Adams and Wilson), putting people in cages with no charges (Lincoln, Bush, Obama), or claiming the power to execute citizens in total secrecy and without any checks of any kind (Obama)? If anything, one could reasonably argue that the power of due-process-free executions is the most menacing since it's the only act that is permanent and irreversible.</p> <p>Certainly, the quantity of abuse matters. In that regard, Roosevelt's interments and Wilson's free speech prosecutions would appear worse than, say, Adams' attacks on dissent, Bush's indefinite detentions, or Obama's citizen assassinations. </p> <p>Moreover, it is one of the ironies of US history that <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/19113.html\">civil liberties erosions are often accompanied by civil liberties progress from the same leader</a>: Adams was integral in the founding of the republic and its rights-enshrining documents; Lincoln freed the slaves; Wilson supported women's suffrage; Roosevelt appointed two of the most sterling civil liberties advocates to the supreme court; Obama withdrew authorization for some torture techniques (ones that were not in use when he was inaugurated) and banned CIA black sites (ones that were empty when he assumed office). </p> <p>Ultimately, there are two critical factors that, for me at least, are highly influential if not decisive in determining the proper ranking. The first is the extent to which the civil liberties abuses are <strong>temporary or permanent</strong>.</p> <p>Most of the contenders for worst civil liberties abuses were \"justified\" by traditional wars that had a finite end and thus dissipated once the wars were over. Lincoln's habeas suspension did not survive the end of the Civil War, nor did FDR's internment camps survive the end of World War II. The Alien and Sedition Acts were severely diluted fairly quickly, while the bulk of Wilson's abuses which survived World War I lay dormant until the War on Terror. As horrible as they were, these radical erosions were often finite, arguably by design, since the wars which served as their pretext would foreseeably end at some point.</p> <p>This is one key factor that distinguishes the War on Terror. By its nature, it will never end, at least not in the foreseeable future. It is a \"war\" far more in a metaphorical sense than a real one. </p> <p>Since it began, both administrations who have waged it have expressly acknowledged its virtually indefinite - and thus unique - nature. In May 2009, when <a href=\"http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article22688.htm\">Obama unveiled his proposal</a> for \"preventive detention\", <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/politics/21obama.text.html?_r=0\">he said</a>: \"Unlike the Civil War or World War II, we can't count on a surrender ceremony to bring this journey to an end.\" He added that we'll still be fighting this war \"a year from now, five years from now, and - in all probability - 10 years from now.\" </p> <p>Just last week, the Washington Post <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/24/obama-terrorism-kill-list\">reported</a> that the Obama administration is creating permanent bureaucratic systems to implement its War on Terror powers as it \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\". Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" That \"suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>Civil liberties abuses justified by a finite war can be awful while they last, but then they cease. Abuses that are systematized based on the premise that they are to be permanent do far more than that: they radically alter the nature of the government and the relationship of the political class to the citizenry. </p> <p>This, to me, has always been the most uniquely pernicious aspect of the War on Terror civil liberties assaults of the last decade: they will not end when the \"war\" does because the \"war\" will have no end. Each new power is embedded permanently into the political framework, incrementally transforming the political culture and the species of government itself.</p> <p>The second vital factor is the<strong> justification used</strong> for these assaults. However critical one wants to be of Lincoln, Wilson and Roosevelt - and harsh criticism is appropriate in all three cases - they were actually fighting major wars that had the potential to severely harm if not destroy the US. To the extent that war is a justification for increasing the powers of the executive, those three wars are clearly the most compelling examples.</p> <p>By contrast, the \"War on Terror\" is not even legitimately described as a \"war\", let alone one anywhere near the magnitude of its predecessors. Shortly after I began writing about politics in late 2005, I <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2005/12/idiotic-and-revealing-civil-war.html\">examined the inane tactic</a> of Bush-following neoconservatives - one that is, like so many neocon views, now vigorously embraced by many Obama defenders - to cite Lincoln's civil liberties abridgments during the Civil War to justify abridgments in the name of the War on Terror. The fundamental differences are obvious:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"During Lincoln's Presidency, the entire nation was engulfed in an internal, all-out war. Half of the country was fully devoted to the destruction of the other half. The existence of the nation was very much in doubt. Americans were dying violent deaths every day at a staggering rate. One million American were wounded and a half-million Americans died (a total which represented 5% of the total population), making it the deadliest war America has ever faced, by far, including all wars through the present. On multiple occasions, more than 25,000 Americans \u2013 and sometimes as many as 50,000 \u2013 were killed in battles lasting no more than three days. The scope of carnage, killing, and chaos \u2013 all within the country, on American soil \u2013 is difficult to comprehend.</p> <p>\"Making matters worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 the country was only 70 years old at the time. And even before the Civil War began, America was teetering precariously from these unresolved internal conflicts. The country then was a shadow of what it is today, with a tiny faction of the strength, stability and cohesion which, 140 years later, characterize the United States.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It takes little effort to demonstrate that the \"War on Terror\" is not in the same universe. As Professor Richard Jackson has <a href=\"http://richardjacksonterrorismblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/the-threat-of-terrorism/\">documented</a>, there is a greater risk of dying from lightning strikes or bathtub falls than terrorism. Professors John Mueller and Mark G. Stewart, writing <a href=\"http://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller//absisfin.pdf\">in the latest issue of International Security</a>, condemned the \"extraordinarily exaggerated and essentially delusional response\" to 9/11. As Professor Stephen Walt <a href=\"http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/13/what_terrorist_threat#.UClvYIJhDFA.twitter\">described their article</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Mueller and Stewart analyze 50 cases of supposed 'Islamic terrorist plots' against the United States, and show how virtually all of the perpetrators were (in their words) 'incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational and foolish.' They quote former Glenn Carle, former deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats saying 'we must see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are,' noting further that al-Qaida's 'capabilities are far inferior to its desires.'\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To the extent the validity of the proffered justification matters, and it must matter some, the War on Terror abuses are easily the worst for this metric. Unlike the actual, threatening wars of the past, this \"war\" is pure pretext, a total farce: so out of proportion to the civil liberties assaults employed in its name as to be inconceivable.</p> <p>As noted, this discussion assumes a rather narrow range of the term \"civil liberties\": namely a focus on the original core political liberties expressly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights: freedom of speech, freedom from deprivation of life and liberty without due process, habeas corpus. If one expands the term to include more contemporary debates surrounding issues such as gay equality and reproductive rights, as is proper, then the overall picture meaningfully changes.</p> <p>The one common strain running through these historic civil liberties assaults is war. War almost always erodes political liberties. That has always been true. Cicero <a href=\"http://liberalwarjournal.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/inter-arma-enim-silent-leges_10.html\">famously observed</a> \"inter arma, enim silent leges\" (in times of war, the law falls mute). </p> <p>That fact - that wars maximize a political leader's power - is a key reason they often crave war and why wars, under the Constitution, were supposed to be extremely difficult for presidents to start. As John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">wrote in Federalist 4</a>, \"absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal\" (that's also why the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-negation-of-hostilities-in-libya-draws-criticism/2011/06/20/AGV2zTdH_story.html\">absurd contortions</a> invoked by President Obama to fight a war in Libya not only in the absence of Congressional approval, but in the face of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-20073996.html\">formal Congressional disapproval</a>, belongs high on the list of his worst and likely most enduring civil liberties assaults).</p> <p>But in terms of the role played by war in enabling civil liberties assaults, at least the exploited wars are usually real. In the case of the \"War on Terror\", it is far more illusory and frivolous than real. That - along with their permanence - is a major factor in determining where the civil liberties erosions of the last decade, and the presidents responsible for them, rank in history.</p>",
  "<p>Meeting targets for saving energy, reducing waste or increasing recycling is a global challenge. The UK is no exception and, having missed the target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2010, sustainable development is more important than ever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://naei.defra.gov.uk/actiondetail.php?action_id=12\" title=\"\">Almost half of the UK's emissions are caused by buildings</a> and engineering successful cities is vital in helping the UK \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 meet, or even exceed, sustainability targets.</p> <p>There are many buildings across the world which have been lauded for their sustainable design, even before significant carbon reduction targets were put in place. In the 1980s, for example, it was the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) headquarters in the UK, followed by the Beddington Zero Energy Development (BedZed) in Sutton in the late 1990s. More recently the Aquatic Centre in Beijing and the California Academy of Sciences, which were completed in 2008, both fitted the bill.</p> <p>The recently opened Construction Industry Council's (CIC) Zero Carbon Building in Hong Kong can also be added to the list of impressive sustainable developments. The CIC building goes beyond the traditional definition of zero carbon. It's connected to the local grid and produces renewable energy on site from a combination of photovoltaic panels and a biodiesel tri-generation system, which offsets the power consumed on an annual basis.</p> <p>The large-scale use of such renewable fuel is a first in Hong Kong and by using waste cooking oil to generate power, two problems are solved \u2013 waste treatment and energy generation. Excess energy is also exported to the local grid to recover the energy used its construction process and building materials.</p> <p>These exemplar buildings demonstrate that we have the technology to achieve low-carbon, low-water consumption buildings, made from low impact or recycled material.</p> <p>However, while projects such as CIC, BedZed and CEGB highlight the rise and benefits of sustainable design, this type of urban development is still not commonplace. With such tough environmental targets to meet \u2013 particularly in developed countries \u2013 why are our cities not full of sustainable buildings, enabling the city as a whole to operate in this way?</p> <h2><strong>Building leadership</strong></h2> <p>Perhaps the first point to address is a country's cultural and political landscape. For example, the government in China is committed to delivering sustainable developments, but when this policy is handed down to local development level it rarely is delivered in practice.</p> <p>The success of northern Europe in delivering green developments can perhaps be partly attributed to the countries' more socialist structure. The government in Finland, for example, is committed to the sustainable agenda and has the backing of its communities to deliver. In 1990, Finland became the first country in the world to establish a carbon tax. Also, 3.4% of its GDP is invested into research and development \u2013 the largest amount in the world \u2013 leading to innovative and sustainable solutions across all areas.</p> <p>Sustainable buildings and city-wide projects need committed, forward-thinking leadership to drive through change. Risk aversion tends to be the default of the development industry and will not deliver the changes we require.</p> <p>Most people believe that sustainable buildings are too costly. However, if the design is considered holistically, in many cases a sustainable building will cost no more. For instance, a building's fa\u00e7ade can be engineered to operate differently in the winter and summer to reduce the lighting and heating required in the building. Good integrated design may increase the fa\u00e7ade cost but reduces the heating and air conditioning equipment required, resulting in an efficient building at a similar overall cost.</p> <p>Examples like this consider cost and benefits over the entire project life cycle and design decisions aren't rooted in the immediate financial implications alone. This leads to a far more efficient and cost effective building design in the long-run.</p> <p>The Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute is a fantastic example of this theory in practice, setting a benchmark <a href=\"http://www.arup.com/Services/Sustainable_Buildings_Design.aspx\" title=\"\">for&#xa0;sustainable building design</a> and reclamation of contaminated land.</p> <p>The building was designed to respond to the seasons; there is no central air conditioning in the building and the centre's slanting fa\u00e7ade operates as a solar controller. In the winter (when the sun is low) the sunlight streams in, warming the building. In the summer (when the sun is higher in the sky) the building is protected from overheating. A control system for the windows also allows warm air to escape in the evening and cool night air to circulate within the building, making significant savings on utility bills.</p> <p>As well as new developments, we shouldn't forget older buildings in the sustainability equation. There's no question that buildings today are better than they were 20 years ago \u2013 regulations have seen to that. However, most of our cities are full of structures built more than 20 years ago, so much more needs to be done to retrofit these buildings to make them more efficient.</p> <p>Projects such as CIC and the institute highlight again and again the high return of sustainable projects and the increasing need to educate the public on the benefits. Owners, developers and tenants do not push, or are not properly advised by their professional team about what can be achieved and they set their sights too low.</p> <p>Instead, policy makers, designers and engineers alike need to push through these new innovative projects as the decisions made today will set the path for our future cities and impact the everyday lives of communities for years to come.</p> <p><em>Alistair Guthrie is global sustainable buildings design leader at </em><a href=\"http://www.arup.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Arup</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Somewhere out there, in a panoply of parallel universes, Nick Payne isn't sitting in a London cafe talking to the Guardian about his plays, because he hasn't written any. Instead, he followed a childhood ambition to be an artist, and another teenage desire to work as a chef.</p> <p>If the idea seems far-fetched, consider the subject of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jan/22/constellations-travelling-light-man-middle-review\" title=\"\">Payne's play Constellations</a>, a hit at the Royal Court earlier this year and now transferring to the West End. It was inspired by a TV documentary presented by <a href=\"http://www.briangreene.org/\" title=\"\">Brian Greene</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.ebook3000.com/Brian-Greene--The-Elegant-Universe---Superstrings--Hidden-Dimensions--and-the-Quest-for-the-Ultimate-Theory-_102479.html\" title=\"\">The Elegant Universe</a>, which discussed the idea of the multiverse \u2013 <a href=\"http://phys.org/tags/multiverse/\" title=\"\">the theory that our universe is merely one of many</a>. Constellations illustrates the concept by presenting several permutations of a single relationship: in some, the couple (played by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sally-hawkins\" title=\"\">Sally Hawkins</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/aug/20/rafe-spall-one-day\" title=\"\">Rafe Spall</a>) live happily together, in others, they don't even make it to a first kiss.</p> <p>With his grey suit and glasses slipping down his nose, Payne, 28, has a professorial air, as though he were on a break from giving lectures, not sitting in rehearsals. He says that the idea of a multiverse initially struck him as \"terrifying and really romantic\" \u2013 but writing the play changed his mind. A cosmologist at Sussex University whom he met as part of his research told him the theory is rubbish, and perhaps quite dangerous: \"She felt that it could remove the idea of consequence,\" he explains. \"I could kill someone knowing in another universe they'll live.\" And, as he wrote, he realised that whatever universe the couple inhabit, their story always has to conclude in the same way \u2013 with death. So how does he feel about it now? \"I'd rather believe this is it, this is all that does exist.\"</p> <p>It's just as well life is currently pretty good for Payne. Last month, he had another play on in London, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/26/roundabout-lungs-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">One Day When We Were Young</a>, while an earlier piece, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/986fb06a-0639-11e2-bd29-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet</a>, was also being staged in New York with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jake-gyllenhaal\" title=\"\">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> in a starring role. As a first step towards fulfilling an ambition to write for cinema, he recently worked with director Carrie Cracknell on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/oct/18/nora-ibsen-dolls-house-video\" title=\"\">Nora, a modern response to Ibsen's A Doll's House</a>, made as part of the Young Vic/Guardian Shorts strand. \"It's a day in the life of a contemporary working mum,\" says Payne. \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/oct/17/nora-dolls-house-film-modern-world?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">A lot of the ideas came from Carrie</a>: my part was more about structure, or shape.\"</p> <p>Almost everything Payne says has a mild-mannered, unassuming quality. Yet there is an undercurrent of fierceness in his speech, especially when he talks about the meaty, complex subjects that have inspired his plays \u2013 apart from the multiverse, there's been climate change (If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet), sex in the increasingly explicit 21st century (Wanderlust), and the experience of bereavement in Lay Down Your Cross \u2013 as well as a new play, as yet unnamed, commissioned by the Royal Court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398964832\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/11/2/1351859411147/Rafe-Spall-and-Sally-Hawk-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rafe Spall and Sally Hawkins in Constellations by Nick Payne at the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reality check ...

I think we're all doomed.\" It pains him that, because of the New York production of If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet, he's had to fly to the US five times this year, breaking a self-imposed five-year ban on air travel. To compensate, on the advice of a climate change specialist he met there, he offset his carbon emissions by becoming vegetarian.</p> <p>Payne comes across as a serious, studious person, yet he's quick to laugh at himself, and evidently sociable: everything he's written is based on interviews with people who work in or have direct experience of his subject. \"Generally people are quite happy to talk about their job, and don't want to be misrepresented,\" he says. \"One cosmologist I spoke to for Constellations said: 'Please don't write a stuffy scientist.' And I met a great bee-keeper [Rafe Spall's character in the play is an apiarist] and shamelessly put some of what he said in the play. He was fine about that, thankfully.\"</p> <p>All of which made writing his new Royal Court play unusual. It's about a 12-year-old boy who goes missing, and how his family cope. \"That was odd to research, because I didn't want to talk to parents who had gone through that: it would be too invasive.\" What he's concentrating on is faith, what the family turn to for support in the absence of religious conviction. This itself loops back on research he did for Constellations \u2013 all the scientists he read were atheists \u2013 and has made him think about his agnosticism. \"I find some of the aggression of atheism a bit unpalatable. I don't have any religious beliefs whatsoever. In some ways I'm envious of people who do, because they seem to have a kind of anchor that I don't have, so I find it appealing.\"</p> <p>What he has instead is superstition. Since he became a full-time writer in 2010 \u2013 before that he combined writing with evening shifts as an usher at the Old Vic, and in the National Theatre bookshop \u2013 he has been on a winning streak, as evidenced by this West End transfer of Constellations. And it's brought out his nervous side. \"I have to have everything on the desk in the same way to start work, all the books are alphabetised, everything's at right angles.</p> <p>\"I do sometimes think: presumably there will come a point where I just don't get stuff on any more. What would I do? Would I be employable at something else?\" He might have to look to the multiverse to find out.</p> <p>- Guardian Extra members can buy best seats for just \u00a337.50 until 29 December.

  "<p>As more schools open their doors as converter academies, their governing bodies face a stark reality. There can be no more turning to the local authority if things go wrong: academies are autonomous, and that means that if you're a governor, the buck stops with you.</p> <p>So what differences exist between the responsibilities of a community school and an academy governor \u2013 and if the headteacher blows the budget or the school acts unlawfully, might governors lose the coat off their back or end up in court?</p> <p>\"If you're a single converter school, the governing body actually become directors of the company and trustees of the charitable trust. I think it can feel a bit scary, but the principles of good governance are the same,\" says Gillian Allcroft, policy officer at the <a href=\"http://www.nga.org.uk/\" title=\"National Governors Association\">National Governors Association</a> (NGA). There is, she explains, \"quite a high bar for negligence.\"</p> <p>Governors \"do worry that they are personally liable and because they're directors, they may conceivably, if something legally improper happened, get into trouble\", says Nick Mackenzie, a partner in the education team at <a href=\"http://www.brownejacobson.com/default.aspx\" title=\"Browne Jacobson\">Browne Jacobson</a> and governor at an academy school that converted in 2010. Schools, he points out, must take insurances against liability, but \"if they acted very wilfully and deceitfully, and committed a crime, they might be [liable] because insurance has certain limits.\"</p> <p>Financially, Allcroft points out, the governing body does need to get to grips with different reporting responsibilities. \"It's a different regulatory basis. They're company accounts rather than done through the local authority as consistent financial reporting. And so it will look quite different.\"</p> <p>As part of the process of academy conversion, says Barry Bainbridge, former headteacher and now consultant, governors should be asking very searching questions of the headteacher to ensure the necessary levels of financial expertise are available to the senior leadership team. \"You don't have to have it in house,\" he says. \"You can buy it in, but you have to have it. There are plenty of experienced people with relevant expertise in the education sector to choose from.</p> <p>\"Quite a lot of local authorities are now selling services, lots of the law firms and accountancy firms,\" says Allcroft. \"There is no shortage of people out there trying to flog things to academies.\"</p> <p>No matter whether they choose to spend money on buying expertise, governors of a converter academy will still need to learn a great deal, often in short time, so \"you've got to want to take those responsibilities,\" says Richard Barnard, chair of governors at <a href=\"http://www.robinswoodps.co.uk/\" title=\"Robinswood Academy\">Robinswood Academy</a>, Gloucester.</p> <p>If you do get into a sticky situation but can prove that you've behaved in a way that is reasonable, reassures Bainbridge, then individual governors are unlikely to come to grief.</p> <p>But it seems that anxiety about the extra financial accountability that academy governors must now accept can have implications for their relationships with the senior management team.</p> <p>\"One of the things I've seen happen is that governors request a lot more information from the management team than they did in the past, and that can cause tensions,\" explains Mackenzie.</p> <p>Do you need a more 'professional' set of governors for new academy schools than is required when there is local authority expertise on tap if a school has, for example, questions about human resourcing or pensions?</p> <p>Not necessarily, says Professor Mary Watkins, chair of governors at the Marine Academy Plymouth, which converted in 2010 under the sponsorship of the university of Plymouth.</p> <p>\"I think you need people who can accept the accountability,\" she says.</p> <p>Barnard says that though all governing bodies need a spread of abilities to draw on, for academies in particular, \"you've got to do a skills audit, and it will change every year: [it's about] knowing the expertise you've got, and knowing where are the gaps you have to fill.\"</p> <p>Watkins is keen to emphasise that a school doesn't only need its governors to understand \u2013 or know when to consult on \u2013 employment law or financial regulation. It also needs people who come with \"a really strong understanding of the social network you're trying to serve.\"</p> <p>She gives an example. \"Unless you understand that your children are being drawn from single parent families or second generation unemployed, it's very difficult to understand the health needs they might have. So, I wouldn't want an accountant from KPMG to sit on our board unless he was interested in the population we're serving.</p> <p>\"It's about looking at the cost-effectiveness of an intervention [that academy governors must opt to pay for] \u2013 a breakfast club, say, which gives some children the only chance they may get to do their homework \u2013 which may not at first glance appear to be cost-effective.\"</p> <p>Chairing a governing body of a new academy is a time-intensive job. Watkins believes that given the number of hours she has had to put in to support the senior leadership team at her school, there may well be a case for a modest stipend for the chairperson's role.</p> <p>\"I don't think people should do it for the money, so not a lot, say \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000, but something like the chair of an NHS trust,\" she explains.</p> <p>Even with a good spread of skills and people willing to put their backs into the job, Bainbridge believes those who volunteer for a role on the board do need training. And despite the course being piloted for chairs of governors by the National College for School Leadership, he notes that \"there is very little of it about\".</p> <p>Critical to an academy school's success, Bainbridge says, is governors' recognition of the need to continuously assess the risks it might encounter.</p> <p>\"It's not just the financial risks; it's saying what are our numbers, how are we perceived in the community, looking at the future. It's about making sure that this school is the best in the community because it's about recruiting children \u2013 that is what gives you financial security. It's about working in groups and working together. Any school on its own as an academy is a scary place to be.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The secretive project was revealed via an enigmatic <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oapeVBFJNtc\" title=\"\">YouTube trailer</a>, promising a forthcoming short film.</p> <p>According to the trailer, the film was directed by <a href=\"http://capitalaustinfilms.com\" title=\"\">Austin Christianson</a>, in association with West's production company, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jan/06/kanye-west-twitter-apps-donda\" title=\"\">Donda</a>. Christianson's previous work includes videos for Burberry and other fashion labels.</p> <p>The trailer suggests Cruel Winter is a cross between a David Attenborough documentary and a Godspeed You! Black Emperor video: Christianson shows bare trees and trembling branches, with ghostly strings and a speech by George H W Bush. There's no release date or cast list, just \"COMING SOON.\"</p> <p>If the past is any indication, Christianson's Cruel Winter movie will precede a Cruel Winter album. That's what happened last season: before West's label, GOOD Music, released its Cruel Summer compilation, the rapper flew to Cannes and premiered a 30-minute short film called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/may/24/kanye-west-cruel-summer-cannes\" title=\"\">Cruel Summer</a>. He directed it himself, shooting Kid Cudi in the desert of Qatar and incorporating songs by Big Sean, John Legend, Raekwon, and a remix of Coldplay's Paradise. Neither the film nor most of the soundtrack have ever been widely released.</p> <p>Hints of a Cruel Winter album began dropping last month, through the rapper (and GOOD signee) Q-Tip. \"If there's a Cruel Summer then there's got to be a Cruel Winter, right?\" he told MTV News. \"That's all I'm saying.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Exhibition of the week: Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait prize</h2> <p>The photograph dominates our idea of portraiture. Even when we look at art from previous centuries, the portraits we admire are often those with a \"photographic\" clarity such as <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-a-lady-with-a-squirrel-and-a-starling-anne-lovell\" title=\"\">Holbein's pictures of the Tudor elite</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/johannes-vermeer-the-guitar-player\" title=\"\">Vermeer's nameless women</a>. Centuries before the invention of photography, people who posed for a painted portrait wanted a photograph \u2013 without knowing it. When <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/rembrandt/self/rembrandt.1661.jpg\" title=\"\">Rembrandt</a>'s sitters complained, as they did, that he was not accurate enough, they were seeking a precise visual record, rather than the visionary masterpieces he created. His early supporter, the Dutch courtier Constantijn Huygens, fell out with Rembrandt over this issue: a portrait of <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/thomas-de-keyser-portrait-of-constantijn-huygens-and-his-clerk\" title=\"\">Huygens by Thomas de Keyser has the photographic sheen he preferred</a>. People have always wanted their portraits to look like them, and what is more accurate than a photo? So it is no surprise that photographs are now loved as the most truthful, moving way to register someone's appearance and personality. <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/museums-and-galleries/national-portrait-gallery\" title=\"\">This prize offers a wide survey</a> of what photographers are doing with the portrait now.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Portrait Gallery</a>, London WC2, from 8 November until 17 February 2013</p> <h2>Other exhibitions this week</h2> <p><strong>Hockney to Hogarth</strong><br>David Hockney's series of prints The Rake's Progress draws on Hogarth to recount a young artist's discovery of gay America at the start of the 1960s.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Whitworth Art Gallery</a>, Manchester M15 until 3 February 2013</p> <p><strong>Threads of Silk and Gold</strong><br>This is the <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/museums-and-galleries/ashmolean-museum\" title=\"\">first exhibition</a> of the rich textiles of Japan's Meiji era (1868-1912) ever to be staged outside Japan.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.ashmolean.org/\" title=\"\">Ashmolean Museum</a>, Oxford OX1, from 9 November until 27 January 2013</p> <p><strong>Cathy Wilkes</strong><br>Everyday objects are the stuff of this former Turner prize contender's art.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.themoderninstitute.com\" title=\"\">Modern Institute</a>, Glasgow G1, until 24 November</p> <p><strong>Chris Steele-Perkins</strong><br>There were 12,640 centenarians living in the UK in 2010, compared with a mere 2,500 in 1980.

  "<p>One of Britain's biggest credit unions has gone bust, taking the number that have collapsed so far in 2012 to at least six and dealing a blow to attempts by the government and others to promote the sector as a viable alternative to banks and costly payday lenders.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nycu.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North Yorkshire Credit Union</a> was declared \"in default\" on 1 November and has been placed in liquidation; however, its 5,000 saver members have been told that their money is safe. They will get their cash back via the official <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a> (FSCS) within the next seven days.</p> <p>The credit union's demise has been blamed partly on high levels of bad debts on loans to members, plus \"inadequate credit referencing and credit control\".</p> <p>It is the sixth credit union to go under in 2012, and follows at least seven that collapsed in 2011. Others that have gone bust in recent months include <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/news/2012/september/youre-protected-fscs-t-yf1ufy113/index.html\" title=\"\">Tamworth Credit Union</a> in September, the Liverpool-based <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/news/2012/august/youre-protected-fscs-t-kdgvg311h/index.html\" title=\"\">Waltonian Credit Union</a> in August, and <a href=\"http://www.fscs.org.uk/news/2012/may/pallister-credit-union-ltd-update/\" title=\"\">Pallister Credit Union</a> in Middlesbrough in May.</p> <p>Most of those that have been declared in default have tended to be small, with perhaps a few hundred active members, but North Yorkshire Credit Union is one of the bigger players.

  "<h2>1) Hull City 1-1 Manchester United (Manchester United won 4-3 on penalties)<br>Watney Cup semi-final at Boothferry Park<br>5 August 1970 </h2> <p>Englishmen of a certain age will remember the Watney Mann Invitation Cup as a brewery-sponsored pre-season tournament staged in the early 70s and contested by the two highest-scoring teams from each of the Football League's four divisions who hadn't qualified for Europe or won promotion. (If it was still going today, this summer's would have been contested by Norwich City, Everton, Blackpool, Birmingham City, Sheffield United, MK Dons, Southend United and Gillingham.) We can only assume all players involved revelled in the irony of sweating off their close-season hangovers by contesting a trophy sponsored by those responsible for the 70s house party staple of a <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8gmtywy\" title=\"\">seven-pint can of ale</a> that was invariably opened using a hammer and screwdriver, before erupting like a sticky bitter Krakatoa.</p> <p>While a match in such a randomly contrived pre-season tournament was unlikely to live long in the memory of anyone who played in, let alone watched it, the semi-final of the inaugural Watney Cup earned itself a special niche in English football history, due in no small part to the good people at Fifa. Weary of seeing certain matches requiring an immediate result decided by the drawing of lots or tossing of coins, football's governing body had convened during that summer's World Cup finals and adopted the recommendation of penalty shootouts to avoid such TV unfriendly outcomes in future. Although the identity of the evil genius behind these modern day deadlock-breakers remains in dispute (both a German, Karl Wald, and an Israeli, Yosef Dagan, claimed the credit) what we do know is that the first English professional game to be settled by them took place at Boothferry Park, then the home of Hull City, who were beaten by Manchester United.</p> <p>The visitors had earned their invitation to the tournament courtesy of the 64 goals they'd scored en route to finishing eighth in the table, 26 points behind the champions Everton. Hull qualified by dint of the 72 they'd bagged in finishing 13th in the Second Division, four more than Huddersfield had mustered despite topping the table with seven points to spare at a time when teams still only got two points for a win. When the two teams met in the semi-final of the Watney Cup, the score was tied at 1-1 all after extra time and history was made as a series of notable firsts were recorded.</p> <p>No less a luminary than Manchester United's George Best became the first player in English football history to score in a penalty shootout, while his team-mate Denis Law was first to miss. But the undisputed hero and villain of the piece was Hull City goalkeeper Ian McKechnie, who notched up the dubious distinction of becoming the first British goalkeeper to let in, save and miss penalties in one shootout, with his failure from the spot with Hull's final penalty costing his side a place in the final. For English football fans, the game would never be the same again.</p> <h2>2) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__O5tBodwVI\" title=\"\">Steaua Bucharest 0-0 Barcelona</a> (Steaua Bucharest won 2-0 on penalties)<br>European Cup final at Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, Seville<br>7 May 1986 </h2> <p>While those who take them may not relish the experience, however confident their outward disposition as they walk from the halfway line to the penalty spot, for goalkeepers, the experience of the shootout is one to be relished. With their fans and team-mates watching in forlorn hope rather than expectation, this is their big chance to make a name for themselves. With neither his side nor Barcelona's having managed to break the deadlock after extra time in an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98xyUvK-Vic\" title=\"\">exceedingly dull 1986 European Cup final</a> in which the Spanish champions were the better side, the Steaua Bucharest goalkeeper Helmuth Duckadam did exactly that, earning himself the sobriquet \"the Hero of Seville\" by saving all four Barcelona penalties to seal the Romanian military side their country's first and only European Cup triumph.</p> <p>A giant of a man sporting a stereotypical Soviet-era mullet, luxuriant soup-strainer moustache and the super short shorts du jour, Duckadam looked a most unlikely hero. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/may/17/miodrag-belodedici-european-cup-football\" title=\"\">in an interview with Jonathan Wilson last year</a> his Steaua team-mate Miodrag Belodedici described him as just what the doctor ordered for the job of saving spot-kicks.</p> <p>\"Duckadam was very good at penalties,\" recalled Belodedici. \"In training he would make bets with the guys in the team. He was big and strong and had long arms \u2013 ideal for penalties.\" In the ridiculously partisan melting pot of Seville's Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, where travelling Romanian fans were outnumbered by up to 350-1 (200 had been cleared to travel by the Securitate, but some 40 defected before the match), long arms and a seemingly unerring psychic ability to read the intentions of the Barcelona penalty-takers he faced were all he had. They served him well.</p> <p>Steaua Bucharest went first, but despite the failure of his team-mates Mihail Majearu and Laszlo Boloni to convert their penalties, Duckadam maintained the deadlock by twice springing low to his right to save splendidly from Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Alexanko and then Angel Pedraza, whose efforts were anything but poor. Up stepped the Romanian superstar Marius Lacatus, who made no mistake, sending a screamer in off the crossbar from 12 yards, giving Steaua a narrow edge. For the third time in succession, Duckadam guessed correctly, again diving towards his right-hand post to save from Pichi Alonso, before Gavril Balint put Steaua two to the good. With the jig all but up for Barcelona, Marcos embarked on his journey of truth, the Long Walk from halfway line to penalty spot, clearly deciding along the way that if Duckadam was going to keep diving to his right, he was going to put the ball the other side. He did so, the goalkeeper shimmied left and then right before guessing correctly once again. Steaua Bucharest were European champions.</p> <p>For Duckadam, however, the story was far from over, although his career, to all intents and purposes was. Amid paranoid speculation that he'd been shot or had one of his arms maimed by goons of General Ceausescu who were jealous of the car he'd received as a bonus for his efforts in the European Cup final, he disappeared from view, never to be seen in a Steaua shirt again. While unfortunate, the truth was far less interesting. \"I'd had pains in my right arm for six months before the final,\" he reveals in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Outsider-A-History-Goalkeeper/dp/1409123197/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351680776&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Wilson's forthcoming book The Outsider: A History of the Goalkeeper</a>. \"I got drugs from the doctors to control them, but the medicine wasn't strong enough. One day that summer I was with my friends in my home town and I fell over. I put my hand down to protect myself and the aneurysm went to the artery and blocked the circulation for the whole arm. I had surgery, some kind of bypass. In 1988 I had another operation and [in 2010] I had another operation with modern technology.\"</p> <p>After his second operation, Duckadem made a brief comeback for a small team in his home town of Arad, with whom he briefly relived former glories by scoring from his own penalty area with a clearance before calling it a day.</p> <h2>3) Czechoslavakia 2-2 West Germany (Czechoslovakia won 5-3 on penalties)<br>European Championship final at Crvena Zvezda Stadium, Belgrade<br>20 June 1976</h2> <p>Often dismissed as a lottery by supposed experts who have almost certainly participated in them and should therefore know better than to spout such balderdash, the shootout is anything but. Quite obviously an intense battle of nerve between goalkeeper and penalty-taker, few efforts from 12 yards have better encapsulated this battle of wits than the audacious effort scored by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp2HZNheCZ8\" title=\"\">Antonin Panenka to win the 1976 European Championship final for Czechoslovakia against West Germany</a>.</p> <p>As Joe Hart knows only too well from being <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V83xAuWbqBk\" title=\"\">embarrassed by Andrea Pirlo during Euro 2012</a>, the Panenka has been replicated <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO-Q8seyktw&amp;feature=fvwrel\" title=\"\">countless times since</a>, often with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqJpnCmIvnA\" title=\"\">hilarious consequences</a>. But the original remains the best, not least because its exponent had the courage to try it first, in a major international final where failure would have resulted in widespread ridicule, opprobrium and \u2013 who knows, given the unforgiving nature of certain football fans and 1970s eastern European regimes \u2013 possibly a lot worse.</p> <p>With the first seven kicks of the shootout having been converted in front of the 30,790 supporters wedged into the Crvena Zvezda Stadium in Belgrade, West Germany's Uli Hoeness was first to wilt under the pressure and ballooned his effort over the bar in a most nationally uncharacteristic fashion. His team-mate, the goalkeeper Sepp Maier took his place between the posts, knowing that if the Czechs scored their next penalty, the final was lost. Up stepped Panenka and short of listening out for the loud clanging noise of the Czech's giant brass balls as he strode towards the penalty spot, Maier could have had no idea what was going to happen next. Panenka placed the ball, retreated just outside the penalty area and embarked on a speedy run-up that gave every indication he would attempt to blast one, Hot Shot Hamish-style, past Maier and through the net. Instead, Panenka decelerated at the point of contact with the ball and \u2013 with Maier already committed to diving to his left \u2013 sent it gently arcing down the middle and into the back of the goal. His place in the football pantheon was assured.</p> <p>Although Panenka had spent many training ground hours practising the penalty for which his name is now a byword, by his own account he reckoned he had tried it no more than 10 times in public. This being the 1970s, of course, opposition goalkeepers did not have the technology to study the technique of opposition penalty-taker. \"No keeper will stay in the centre \u2013 that's what I based my strategy on,\" revealed Panenaka in a recent interview with Karel Haring in the Blizzard. \"The keeper is waiting and when I bring my foot to the ball, he is choosing one side or the other. When I kick the ball lightly, the opponent is already on the move and can't recover. However, if I kicked it too strongly, he could make some reflex save. And that's why I used slow lobs. It takes a while but keeper can't get back.\"</p> <h2>4) England 0-0 Spain (England won 4-2 on penalties)<br>European Championship quarter-final at Wembley Stadium<br>22 June 1996</h2> <p>Per penalty shootout participated in major tournament finals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/27/euro-2012-are-england-worst-penalties\" title=\"\">no country has endured as dismal a failure rate as England</a>, who have lost three out of three in World Cups (against West Germany at Italia 90, Argentina at France 98 and Portugal at Germany 2006) and three out of four in the European Championships (against Germany in 1996, Portugal in 2004 and Italy in 2012). They also messed one up against Belgium at the King Hassan II International Cup in Casablanca in 1998, but we'll let that one slide as their record is shameful enough without including Mickey Mouse tournaments from which nobody could possibly be expected to earn lucrative Pizza Hut contracts. But today we come not to bury England, but to praise them, by focusing instead on the one shootout they actually managed to triumph in, against Spain at Wembley in the quarter-finals of Euro 1996.</p> <p>With the two sides having fought out a scoreless draw over 120 minutes (a golden goal would have settled the match at any point in extra time), England had every reason to feel bullish. After all, this was only the second time a match in which they'd featured had gone to penalties and with just one defeat, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH_Yt0K3tZA\" title=\"\">to the Germans, under their belt</a>, their players couldn't possibly be expected to know how rubbish history would prove them to be at this particular discipline. With a rabidly partisan crowd behind them, confidence was high. Well, it wasn't too low.</p> <p>David Seaman was playing in goal for England and had already faced two penalties in this tournament, failing to save one from Switzerland's Kubilay Turkyilmaz, but stopping the Scotland midfielder Gary McAllister's effort, <a href=\"http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/4351210/Gary-McAllister-on-missing-THAT-penalty.html\" title=\"\">albeit with the assistance of celebrity spoon-bender Uri Geller</a>. His opposite number was Andoni Zubizarreta, currently Barcelona's director of football, but who was earning his 110th cap for Spain that day. England got off to a splendid start in the shootout, with Alan Shearer grazing Zubizarreta's right fingertips with an effort that whistled into the top left-hand corner. By way of reply, Fernando Hierro smashed his effort off the crossbar: advantage England.</p> <p>Next up were David Platt and Guillermo Amor, who both scored. Seeking redemption for his Italia 1990 shame, Stuart Pearce was next to stride forward, simultaneously dispatching the ball and exorcising his personal demons with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0OCRrvMBpA\" title=\"\">left-footed scorcher into the bottom right-hand corner</a>: 3-1 England. The full-back Alberto Belsu\u00e9 pulled one back for Spain, Paul Gascoigne extended England's lead and then it was left to Miguel Angel Nadal, the Beast of Barcelona and the slightly less scary-sounding uncle of tennis player Rafael, with a kick to keep his country in the tournament. Shooting right-footed, low and slightly right of centre, his effort was poor and was kept out by the right arm of Seaman. Wembley erupted, a nation rejoiced and triumphant England were through to the semi-finals against Germany. They lost, of course \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odADLL1u36M\" title=\"\">on penalties and a terrible hoodoo was born</a>.</p> <h2>5) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0AphJ8hJN0\" title=\"\">Uruguay 1-1 Ghana (Uruguay won 4-2 on penalties)</a><br>World Cup quarter-final at Soccer City, Johannesburg<br>2 July 2010</h2> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jul/02/world-cup-2010-uruguay-ghana-live\" title=\"\">It takes a real streak of evil to win like this</a>,\" wrote Simon Burnton of this parish in the wake of Uruguay's astonishing victory over Ghana in the quarter-final of the last World Cup. He wasn't wrong. This was pure football theatre; for the African side, a three-act tragedy in which their continent's long-held hopes of celebrating the presence of a representative in the World Cup semi-finals for the very first time were left in ruins. In standalone terms, there have been more thrilling denouements in the wake of 120-minute stalemates, but in terms of what had preceded it, this particular penalty shootout could hardly have been more riveting. Ghana were the good guys and they got well and truly stiffed. With the score at 1-1 courtesy of strikes either side of half-time from Sulley Muntari and Diego Forl\u00e1n and the ensuing 30 minutes of uneventful extra time almost up, all hell broke loose.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the role of El Diablo was played with no little aplomb by renowned thespian Luis Su\u00e1rez. With what was almost certainly the last attack of the game, Ghana swung a free-kick into Uruguay's penalty area and on the goal-line, the striker pulled off two of the saves of the tournament. The first was from Stephen Appiah with his knee, the second, from Dominic Adiyiah with his fist. Adiyiah's effort was goalbound and standing on the line, Su\u00e1rez had two choices: watch the ball sail over his head into the goal, taking his country's chances of World Cup glory with it, or incur the opprobrium of millions worldwide by taking one for a team and punching it clear. It was a split-second decision. What's more, it was a no-brainer. We'd all have done it, even if much of the mouth-foaming sanctimony that ensued in the game's aftermath would have you believe otherwise. From the ensuing penalty, Asamoah Gyan sent his effort off the crossbar and over, prompting gleeful celebrations from the South Americans, not least the sent-off Su\u00e1rez, who moments previously had been led weeping from the field.</p> <p>Adding a further twist to what was already one of the most dramatic matches of this or any other tournament, Gyan showed remarkable strength of character to step up and take his country's first penalty in the shootout and this time made no mistake. But with the score at 3-2, it was John Mensah who cracked. Eschewing a run-up, the centre-back made it easy for the Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, only to see Uruguay's Maxi Pereira return the favour with an effort that's probably still somewhere in airspace over Johannesburg. Another save from Muslera, this time from the luckless Adiyiah, left Uruguay with a spot-kick to win a shootout they had little or no business even being in. Sebasti\u00e1n Abreu's Panenka was sublime. A crazy game settled in fine style by a man nicknamed El Loco? In so many ways it was fitting, but in so many others, preposterously unjust.</p> <h2>6) Mickleover Lightning Blue Sox U10s 1-1 Chellaston Boys U10s (Blue Sox won 2-1 on penalties)<br>Derby Community Cup, somewhere in Derby, probably the Racecourse<br>1998</h2> <p>Spare a thought for Chellaston Boys Under-10 goalkeeper Ben Hodder, who is presumably the only goalkeeper in football history to save 31 consecutive spot-kicks in a sudden-death decider and still end up on the losing team. Having fought out a 1-1 draw with their Mickleover counterparts in a 1998 Derby Community Cup match, Hodder's side were forced to endure the trauma of losing the longest and arguably most tedious shootout in football history, having been edged out 2-1 after an astonishing 66 kicks had been taken.</p> <p>Watching shot after shot being saved or sent wide and no doubt at the behest of despairing parents whose will to live was gradually evaporating, referee Peter Shieff first moved the spot forward a couple of yards, before suggesting a coin toss to decide the outcome of this pivotal seven-a-side tie after 56 penalties had failed to break the deadlock. He was quite rightly overruled and a mere 10 penalties later, Mickleover Lightning Blue Sox had prevailed 2-1, presumably with many of their players having entered puberty, grown stubble and developed an interest in girls since the match had kicked off. In the wake of the match, the FA's official statistician, David Barber, confirmed the youngsters had set a new world record which would stand \u2013 and continues to stand \u2013 despite their tender years.</p> <p>\u2022 With thanks to Jonathan Wilson and James Dart</p>",
  "<p>The time is right for a new and exciting relationship between local and central government \u2013 a partnership of equals.</p> <p>That would be new and exciting for us, but commonplace in all other Western democracies. Currently, local government in England is viewed by Whitehall as little more than its delivery arm. Central government, with its focus on imposing top-down solutions, needs to realise that what works in Nottingham doesn't necessarily work in Pudsey. The people who live in our communities want and deserve local solutions to local problems. And this is what a new relationship \u2014 a genuine partnership \u2014 between local and central government could offer them.</p> <p>Some might argue that England, being left out of the devolution settlement, has no over-arching philosophy of place. Belated, botched and half-hearted attempts at regional devolution in England in the early years of this century were certainly not a success. The <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/regeneration/yourregionyour\" title=\"\">white paper, Your Region, Your Choice</a>, in May 2012, outlined plans to establish elected regional assemblies. But of the three planned referendums only one took place, several years after Scotland and Wales voted on devolution. Voters in the north east rejected the proposal by a large majority, and the plans for elected regional assemblies outside London were abandoned. In what might be seen as another blow for a philosophy of place, all the regional development agencies in England have now been abolished. The vast majority of regional institutions no longer exist.</p> <p>However, rather than being downhearted or discouraged by the fate of regionalism, we need to move forward. England is the most centralised country in western Europe. Devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, in particular, the referendum on the future of Scotland, is finally encouraging people to think about how a devolved England will work. In my view, the best solution is to devolve far more power to local government and let them build from there.</p> <p>There are positive signs. Politicians have said they want to see a radical shift in the balance of power, and more decentralisation, but Whitehall seems loath to lose the power to micro-manage. A battle is going on. For now we remain half pregnant and can only either go forward towards greatening independence or default back to Whitehall control.</p> <p>The Localism Act is a step in the right direction, although while the secretary of state is still able to cap council tax and threatens to mandate weekly bin collections, real gains such as the general power of competence may be difficult to realise. The people of Leicester and Liverpool used a government imposed ballot to elect mayors for their cities. Bristol will follow shortly. This brings the total number of elected mayors to 17, including the mayor of London. The six city deals are also an encouraging sign that the government means what it says when it talks about an unprecedented transfer of power to the localities. But much remains not only to make the ambition of decentralisation a reality but to ensure that a future meddling officialdom can't recoup its control of what are rightfully local matters.</p> <p>The Commons political and constitutional reform committee, which I chair, is holding an inquiry to explore the possibility of codifying in statute the principles and mechanics of the relationship between local and central government and entrenching them beyond casual repeal.</p> <p>My own opinion is that, unless the rights of local government are codified in statute in a way that successive governments cannot easily repeal, power will always drift back towards the centre.</p> <p>We have had a record response to our inquiry. So far, we have received more than 80 submissions to our consultation on a draft code for relations between central and local government \u2014 the vast majority from local councils or councillors. This reaction underlines that there is a real thirst to take localism further and to explore ways in which genuine separation of local from central government will happen.</p> <p>In order to raise awareness of the draft code, I have been working with the Local Government Association on a <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/campaigns\" title=\"\">campaign</a> for independent local government. The campaign has generated a very positive response, and the draft code has been referred to as local government's Magna Carta. LGA chair Sir Merrick Cockell and I have together taken part in countless meetings up and down England. These meetings have made it clear to me that people want their own elected local government to control how things are run in their area. Greater financial independence for local government is a crucial element of making this aspiration a reality. Without more control over their own finances, councils will always be at the beck and call of an overmighty centre.</p> <p>For some local councils, comfortable with the lack of responsibility that comes with a lack of power, this might initially be a frightening prospect. But the best councils are showing the way. And I believe that it is open to all to be as good as the best. I have spoken to many councillors and local authority chief executives who just want the chance to run their areas as their continental and north American counterparts do.</p> <p>The people who live in our local communities strongly associate with their area, although they probably wouldn't describe this as a philosophy of place. They care about where they live and they want to be governed by people they elect and who respect and understand the local area and who have the freedom to implement local solutions to local concerns. It is the responsibility of this generation of local and central government leaders to leave behind the fear and scepticism of the past and have the confidence and courage to forge a new relationship, with all the opportunities this will bring.</p> <p>Every day that goes by is a day closer to independence from Whitehall and control of our own futures.</p> <p><em>Graham Allen is MP for Nottingham North and chair of the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee.

  "<p>Researchers from the University of Oxford <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/18/civil-service-admin-costs-policies?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wrote in October </a>about the difficulty for governments in implementing cost-cutting policies.</p> <p>But some UK government organisations have already succeeded in cutting their administrative costs, without hitting service delivery. UK Sport is one such organisation.</p> <p>In 2011, research carried out by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport on the operating costs of distributing funding found that <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/fundraising/news/content/8404/dcms_publishes_comparative_admin_costs_of_statutory_and_sector_funders\" title=\"\">UK Sport was the most efficient of all the statutory funders</a> appraised, spending just 4.4% of its \u00a356.5m turnover on grants - well ahead of Sport England, which spent 12.3% of its income on making grants, and the Arts Council, which spent 10.5%.</p> <p>At UK Sport only four administration staff are required to handle 1500 customers, where previously20 administration staff had struggled to handle 350 customers.</p> <p>How was this achieved?</p> <p>The core thinking starts by adopting what is called <a href=\"http://www.transformationforum.org/Transformation-Booklet.html\" title=\"\">\"system thinking\"</a>, based on <a href=\"http://www.transformationforum.org/Fourteen_Points_for_Management.html\" title=\"\">the management philosophy of William Edwards Deming</a>, which was credited for turning around Japan's fortunes after the war.</p> <p>This is based on optimising how business processes operate from end to end, working together with suppliers and for the benefit of the customers. It is a \"bottom up\" approach that removes the costly \"command and control\" way that has come to be endemic in most organisations and government in particular.</p> <p>Somewhat disappointingly IT has evolved as a contributor to this \"centralised\" control, and has failed to support people at the frontline delivering services.</p> <p>To protect or even improve frontline services, while cutting costs, we need to move to a model that empowers people, measures what they do, and is based on a new type of technology, that automates many routine, back office processes and that reflects quickly how people and organisations actually work.</p> <p>The aim is to remove spreadsheets and offline, inefficient working, so that information is entered only once. Flexible, supportive software was available at UK Sport to enable business managers to change their requirements.</p> <p>In fact, one business manager at UK Sport said that \"you kind of get used to the luxury of being able to chop and change \u2013 and I think you can end up abusing the flexibility a bit.\"</p> <p>Of course, there is always historical data and older ways of doing things that cannot simply be discarded. But by automating as many routine processes as possible, those older processes can be brought into a more flexible approach.</p> <p>There is no reason why the savings made by UK Sport cannot be replicated throughout government. But \u2013 and it is a big but \u2013 it requires leadership..</p> <p>Central government needs to take a lead on this, to help educate departments that there really is a new thinking and supporting technology that's proved effective.</p> <p>This should all be part of the government being an intelligent customer. In its<a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmpubadm/715/71503.htm\" title=\"\"> 2011 report on effective use of IT</a>, the Commons public administration select committee recommended that the government needs to urgently rebuild its capacity to manage suppliers and \"understand the potential IT has to transform the services it delivers\".</p> <p><em>David Chassels is the chief executive of UK software company Procession</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email </em><a href=\"mailto:public.leaders@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>public.leaders@guardian.co.uk</em></a><em>.

  "<p>In an economy obsessed by innovation, we're always on the lookout for cool little startups, clever new ways technology is changing our culture, and smart new software that comes out of nowhere to show us a better way of doing things. When you watch the evolution of popular digital culture \u2013 and observe which services people love and are loyal to, which they get infatuated and then bored with, which they ignore, which they actively resent \u2013 you get fascinating results.</p> <p>The era of services accessed through mobile phones has shown us that people really respond to tools configured around (to quote Apple) \"solving life's little problems, one app at a time.\" With this resounding user-focused lesson in mind, maybe the next big thing for us is something a little grander. Perhaps we should strive towards a world where we can promise an operating system for life. Not as an immediate practical aspiration, but as an idea that new examples of digital products and services ultimately take us closer towards.</p> <p>The Oxford English dictionary says an operating system is: \"A set of programs for organising the resources and activities of a computer\" \u2013 today, people respond to and embrace software that in some way organises their resources (like time and money) and activities (like work and play). Even a smartphone game you play in the supermarket is organising your resources, in this case time, by giving you an activity, sparing you a feeling of watching time pass by.</p> <p>This week we launched <a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training\" title=\"\">Nike+ Kinect Training</a>, where an ongoing exchange of fine-tuned data gives people an evolving, precise and truly personal training system, improving health and fitness. In September, California's governor Edmund Brown signed the bill that legalised autonomous vehicles \u2013 also known as self-driving cars. Doing so wasn't just about space-age headlines, but a response to the findings of initial research by companies such as Google, which suggest computer-controlled drivers can be safer and more efficient than humans.</p> <p>Luddites might see such developments as the machines taking over, but the rest of us should be able to embrace this example of technology making efficient use of our time and resources. Here's the proof: Nissan recently unveiled early developments from its own autonomous vehicle research program. One part of the technology uses sensors and cameras to understand the spatial terrain around the car and respond accordingly, so drivers can't mistakenly move into too-small spaces, bump into unseen objects, and won't have to correct driving lines. The second key innovation is the replacement of all the mechanical components between steering wheel and front wheels with electronics, for a much quicker, more responsive, and driver-aware experience.</p> <p>Back in the early 60s, Marshall McLuhan wrote an essay called <a href=\"http://home.roadrunner.com/~lifetime/UM-4-A.htm\" title=\"\">The Gadget Lover: Narcissus as Narcosis</a>. In it he surveyed the new boom in consumer electronics in America over the previous decade and identified a new archetype: the gadget lover. McLuhan wasn't overly enthusiastic about this emerging obsession, seeing it as a way for consumers to offload the information overload and psychic stress of modern life. The gadget was kind of cyborg extension of the individual that helped them cope by putting them into a kind of trance (narcosis). Though the gadget lover sang the praises of the latest gadget for its innovations, he or she actually, unwittingly, loved it because it reflected his or her own interests and personality back, like a mirror.</p> <p>We often want help, because we like to do things more easily and quickly, to better manage our resources and activities. We invest ourselves and our personalities in our technology \u2013 that's when it becomes interesting and relevant. We like technology to help do more useful and fun things, to make boring things less painful, to save us time, money and misery.</p> <p>People have become accustomed to having hardware and software working for them, and the internet has made everybody accustomed to having their say and expecting solutions at speed. If we love gadgets and software, it's precisely because we know they reflect our lives. We're not the deluded slaves of new gadgets, we're their impatient masters. New technologies give us more knowledge and control than we are used to. If I go to a firm like <a href=\"https://www.23andme.com/\" title=\"\">23 And Me</a> and pay $299 (\u00a3185) to get my genes analysed, that's not because I want to outsource my identity to machines \u2013 it's because the information they give me from a saliva sample will help me learn all sorts of interesting things, from past ancestry to future health problems, that I couldn't have accessed before.</p> <p>In September, thinktank <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Demos</a> issued a report on people's attitudes to sharing data in the digital world. \"The Data Dividend\" was written on the assumption that, used properly, big data can help all of us \u2013 at home, in healthcare, in civic life, in science \u2013 but thanks to high-profile losses of confidential information, expensive IT projects gone wrong, perceived heavy-handedness and newsworthy errors in its past application, many people are exceptionally cautious about the risks involved, and the likelihood of promised benefits materialising.</p> <p>What organisations need to do, then, is be modular and responsive. To use the data now generated by people's choices and behaviours to keep refining and improving their systems and making them more responsive. This means combining data with small, speedy manoeuvres \u2013 combining clear, reassuring, deeply-held principles with agility and enough leeway for an organisation's employees to use the realtime data available to improve the services they offer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\" title=\"\">Theyworkforyou.com</a> is the address where you can cut through the promotional materials and see how your MP acted where it counted, at key parliamentary votes. In a digital era where 'service' is the key aspiration for anybody hoping to continue engaging with people, organisations should take that message to the heart. It may be too late for the US 2012 presidential election, but it's surely a more sensible way to re-engage voters in the data-rich, increasingly transparent world we inhabit today. Put technology to work for people and you're already taking steps towards that inspirational near-future aspiration: creating an operating system for our lives.</p> <p><em>Ajaz Ahmed is founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.akqa.com/\" title=\"\"><em>AKQA</em></a><em> and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Velocity-Seven-Laws-World-Digital/dp/0091947561/\" title=\"\"><em>Velocity: Seven New Laws For a World Gone Digital</em></a><em> \u2013 find out more about Nike+ Kinect Training </em><a href=\"http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/training/nike-plus-kinect-training\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Microsoft has just released Windows 8, and along with it Internet Explorer 10. This is a momentous release for many reasons, but among them is a move with far-reaching implications for how consumers receive content, and how companies generate the revenue they need to deliver those pages.</p> <p>In summer, Microsoft announced that IE10 would have a \"do not track\" (DNT) function implemented by default. This means when you install IE10, the browser will send a signal that you don't want to be anonymously tracked \u2013 whether you actually do want to be tracked or not.</p> <p>This signal, however, has two huge and unintended implications.</p> <p>The first is that this signal is not required to be honoured by any company.</p> <p>There are no laws or even industry best practices that require the companies that collect anonymous data to fund free content and deliver more relevant ads and offers to turn off the tracking. This is not well understood by consumers or regulators. The potential for a lot of confused consumers is significant.</p> <p>Why did Microsoft do this? Many suggest it is their way of creating a point of difference in an increasingly competitive market. Take Google's Chrome, which is hot on its heels and in some parts of the world overtaking it completely in terms of browser choice. In part, Microsoft has taken its decision as a way to create a new norm that is acceptable to Europeans, who have been working at ensuring compliance with the widely publicised ePrivacy directive. But there is potentially a resulting consequence that will severely impact advertising \u2013 one that has been completely overlooked until now.</p> <p>If DNT did work as advertised for most consumers, the biggest American internet companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, eBay, Amazon and LinkedIn \u2013 will still have access to the data. Why?</p> <p>Because each of these companies has direct, so called \"opt-in\" authorisation to still use your data which you likely agreed to somewhere in their impenetrable privacy statement when you opened a Gmail account or saved your weather with Yahoo.</p> <p>That means if DNT is implemented in the way that Microsoft, some regulators and privacy advocates want, the big winners will actually be large US-based retailers, social networks and media companies with their huge first-party opt-in databases. In fact, DNT will create a complete imbalance in the industry. By enabling DNT, this data could become concentrated in the hands of a few; it will become more exclusive and this will then allow those select few companies with access to charge even higher prices for their data. Was this Microsoft's plan from the outset?</p> <p>Despite ePrivacy hitting the headlines of late, none of the privacy advocates or regulators, to my knowledge, object to this situation. It is also worth noting that these same people are also unable to present credible examples of anyone being harmed by the collection of non-personally identifiable information, the kind of data most commonly used for behavioural advertising.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, I value innovation, but a small number of big companies shouldn't have total control over the market. I would argue that this competitive edge would concern Europe more so than anonymous behavioural tracking.</p> <p>Behavioural tracking is also not new and there is mounting evidence to suggest that once consumers are educated about how their data is used online, they are far more accepting. And if they don't like it, they can choose to opt out by clicking on the ad choices icon in billions of online ads, by visiting <a href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/\" title=\"\">youronlinechoices.eu</a>, or by downloading for free tools like the <a href=\"https://www.ghostery.com/download\">Ghostery</a> service to completely block data collection on your browser.</p> <p>So, with DNT implemented as envisioned by Microsoft and others, many publishers could go out of business and web advertising could look much more like it's 1997 all over again for IE10 users. But DNT also means that your personal information just got a lot more valuable. Those transacting data online will continue to do so, and perhaps will become even richer. This could go down as the mother of all unintended consequences. And nobody seems to realise it even exists. It really is the elephant in the room.</p> <p><em>Scott Meyer is CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.evidon.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Evidon</em></a><em>.

  "<p>New government ways of boosting the economy must be found if the current Bank of England stimulus proves incapable of combating the headwinds facing Britain, the head of the City's financial watchdog says.</p> <p>Rekindling the debate about whether record low interest rates, quantitative easing and lending incentives will work, Lord Turner said further steps may be needed to avoid the risk of deflation.</p> <p>Turner, one of the candidates to be the next Bank governor, said in a speech in South Africa that the failure to regulate the financial sector stringently enough had created a climate of excessive risk-taking.</p> <p>Banks were now scaling back, Turner said, starving the economy of credit, adding that \"in the face of deleveraging we may need to consider innovative and unconventional combinations of policies to offset deflationary risks\".</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, last week strongly opposed one unconventional policy \u2013 money creation by Threadneedle Street to finance the government's budget deficit. King said so-called \"helicopter drops\" of money could make the Bank insolvent as well as posing an inflationary threat.</p> <p>The FSA chairman did not specify what he thought was needed if a 0.5% bank rate, \u00a3375bn worth of QE and the Funding for Lending scheme failed to work.</p> <p>\"This is an innovative combination of policies, and one which lies far outside past orthodoxy. And if these measures prove insufficient we may have to consider further policy innovations, and further integration of different aspects of policy, to overcome the powerful economic headwinds created by deleveraging across the developed world economies.\"</p> <p>Turner said a lesson from the crisis was that commercial banks and the shadow banking system which can create credit and money to finance asset price booms were \"inherently dangerous institutions\". He added that \"optimal regulation of banks and shadow banking must reflect a recognition that the private financial system, left to itself, will tend to create excessive debt contracts, and excessive leverage\".</p> <p>Turner said: \"The financial crisis of 2007-08 revealed how deeply flawed were the assumptions of the pre-crisis conventional wisdom. Free market finance left to itself will create huge instability \u2013 too much leverage in the real economy and within the financial system, too volatile a new credit supply, too much complexity and dangerous interconnectedness. Increased financial intensity is not limitlessly beneficial.\"</p> <p>The Bank of England has been given new powers to ensure financial stability by the government, and Turner said powerful macroeconomic prudential levers, such as countercyclical capital requirements, were essential to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crash. These needed to apply not just at the bank level but in respect to specific sectors \u2013 such as commercial or residential real estate \u2013 where the danger of self-reinforcing credit and asset price cycles was greatest.</p> <p>Turner said that conventional monetary policy \u2013 cutting interest rates \u2013 became less effective in tackling deflationary pressures when the cost of borrowing was close to zero and when banks were damaged by their battering from the financial crisis. \"In addition the freedom to use fiscal stimulus is limited by the need to get rising public debt burdens under control.</p> <p>\"Clearly therefore, the policy response has to include unconventional monetary policy \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 which as best we can tell has produced a path of real output growth and inflation slightly higher than would otherwise have occurred.\"</p> <p>But Turner said quantitative easing alone \"may be subject to declining marginal impact\", where allowing the private sector to exchange government bonds for money had little impact on demand in the economy.</p>",
  "<p>Masked men made an horrific attack on the owner and editor of a Bolivian radio station by pouring petrol on him and setting him ablaze.

  "<p>The Move Your Money campaign, launched in February 2012, was designed to transform widespread public anger with the big banks into active support for ethical and mutual banking in the UK.</p> <p>This small industry was systematically gutted following the \u201cbig bang\u201d financial deregulation of the 1980s, leading to the closure of hundreds of small banks and building societies and the consolidation of the financial market within just four \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d high street banks.</p> <p>Within the first six months of this year, the campaign saw more than half a million personal customers close accounts with high street banks, moving their money to mutuals, ethical banks and credit unions. The next stage for the campaign is to encourage and support institutions to move their money out of the four largest high street banks. A large part of this work will focus on local authorities.</p> <p>Local government finance could be on the verge of a revolution, with the Commons political and constitutional reform select committee already leading a debate on the benefits of codifying the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2012/jun/27/lga-conference-independent-local-government?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">relationship between central and local government</a>. This \u201cMagna Carta\u201d would guarantee councils\u2019 legal and financial independence from Whitehall, establishing a legal status for councils and granting the freedom to raise and spend revenue in any legal way open to individuals or companies (subject to local consent).</p> <p>A council-focused Move Your Money campaign would further both of these fundamental aspirations \u2013 greater independence for local government from the centre, and greater democratic control and oversight by the public \u2013 within local government procurement and spending decisions.</p> <p>Figures from the Department for Communities and Local Government for 2011-12 show a combined annual budget of \u00a3122bn for English councils. Despite the claim from the Co-operative Bank that one third of councils currently employ its services, initial research by Move Your Money UK illustrates many council clients only use the Co-op for a small proportion of their total banking services. This indicates that tens, if not hundreds, of billions of pounds of public money in local authority budgets still resides within the big four banks.</p> <p>In the US, the Move Your Money project is achieving considerable success in divesting city banking funds to socially responsible lenders. The nation\u2019s two largest cities, Los Angeles and New York City, have passed responsible banking ordinances to collect better data on banks\u2019 community reinvestment activities and to encourage institutions that want to do business within the cities to be more accountable to local concerns.</p> <p>Other localities are following suit: Seattle city council member Nick Licata has declared that \u201cdue to growing disparity in this country\u2019s wealth, we can at the very least review the city\u2019s banking and investment practices to ensure that public funds are invested in responsible financial institutions that support our community\u201d.</p> <p>In May 2012, the city of Buffalo, New York announced that it would move its entire pot of city funds \u2013 some $45m (\u00a328m) \u2013 to the local First Niagra Bank. Buffalo became the seventh New York municipality to divest from JP Morgan Chase in protest against the bank\u2019s foreclosure policies, which directly impact the lives of local home owners and small businesses.</p> <p>This movement in the USA to extract local benefits from city financial arrangements stands in stark contrast to the UK, where the market dominance of the big four banks reinforces the much criticised culture of complacency and entitlement. Negotiating contracts and extracting local benefits is nigh on impossible.</p> <p>Some local authorities, however, are already re-considering their banking options. In discussion of his council\u2019s \u00a32.4bn contract with NatWest, Lambeth councillor Paul McGlone, who sits on the finance scrutiny sub committee observed, \u201cit\u2019s hard to pinpoint any tangible benefit the council receives, despite the size and value of its contract with RBS\u201d.</p> <p>Hackney council has progressively migrated bank account services away from the larger banks, and now banks exclusively with the Co-operative Bank. Principal banking officer Chris Locke explained: \u201cThe Co-operative understand the public sector. Other banks \u2014 specialists in the private sector \u2013 understand that organisations must compete with one another. They don\u2019t really understand that organisations can collaborate, share their research development and save a lot of money by working co-operatively\u201d.</p> <p>UK banks have been allowed to grow so large that they take their customers for granted, and no longer act in a socially responsible way, nor in local communities\u2019 interest. With financial donations to political parties from the banks at record levels, there is little appetite for root and branch reform within Westminster.</p> <p>But local government can seek to reverse this trend, encouraging a return to ethical, local investment by socially responsible financial institutions which have a stake in the local community and actively invest in its future. Councils can take the lead by stimulating investment in local credit unions, co-operative and ethical banks, growing the alternative financial sector and improving access to low cost credit for the financially excluded (in turn reducing demand for predatory pay day lenders).</p> <p>We will soon carry out research with the aim of creating an ethical finance toolkit for local authorities. We hope this will help guide councils seeking to move funds into ethical, local and mutual banks.</p> <p><em>Joel Benjamin is a campaigner for Move Your Money UK.

  "<p>It cannot be called an uprising. Nor do demonstrators demand regime change. The dispute is narrowly about preventing a change in the electoral law that would disenfranchise voters. Nevertheless, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/kuwait-bans-gatherings-20-protests\" title=\"\">demonstrations taking place in Kuwait</a> are real enough. Tens of thousands, a number unheard of in Kuwait, took part in a \"march of dignity\" and a further mass protest is <a href=\"http://www.arabtimesonline.com/NewsDetails/tabid/96/smid/414/ArticleID/189354/reftab/36/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">planned for Sunday</a> despite an announced ban on public gatherings of more than 20 people. The wave of demands for democratic change, which Saudi Arabia fervently hoped had come to a crashing halt with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/syria-civil-war-aleppo-checkpoints-torture\" title=\"\">the civil war in Syria</a>, is now lapping around the feet of the Gulf states.</p> <p>That Kuwait should give rise to such scenes is, on the face of it, a surprise. It is not only one of the wealthiest oil producers in the region, but a state with a raucous parliament to which the current emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, partly owes his position. A former foreign minister, Sabah was not the crown prince <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/16/brianwhitaker.mainsection\" title=\"\">when the then emir, Sheikh Jaber, died in 2006</a>. The death created a dynastic crisis, as the crown prince <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/25/brianwhitaker.mainsection?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Sheikh Sa'ad was too ill to take the oath</a>. Sa'ad abdicated and Sabah took over, but by the time the abdication came through Kuwait's parliament had already voted Sa'ad out of office.</p> <p>The new emir was the victor of a power struggle within the ruling family, but he was also the popular choice. This point is not lost on today's parliamentarians, who say that, as they backed him, the emir owes them one. It also accounts for the proprietary tone of the slogan: \"We will not let you\" [take Kuwait into the abyss of autocracy].</p> <p>There are other factors that make Kuwait different. There is no Sunni-Shia divide in this state. In fact, relations between the Sunni state and Iran are by custom and practice stable. So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/20/bahraini-uprising-iran\" title=\"\">unlike Bahrain</a>, no one can blame Iran for fomenting unrest. Instead, the Kuwaiti authorities have been forced to look elsewhere for the source of their troubles.</p> <p>With the exception of Qatar, the Gulf states are now openly blaming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/24/muslim-brotherhood-egypt-president-mohamed-morsi\" title=\"\">Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood</a> as the source of their domestic woes. After the \"dignity\" demonstration, the Kuwaiti government said they were looking for three members of the Brotherhood. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, which has locked up 64 members of a local Islamist group al-Islah, claims that <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/gulf-states-must-tackle-muslim-brotherhood-threat-uae-164546200.html\">the brothers were plotting to undermine governments in the region</a>. The Brotherhood is now on the agenda of the next meeting of the Gulf co-operation council.</p> <p>Blaming Egyptian Islamists for trouble at home is a high-risk strategy. If Egypt pulls through, it is a doomed one. It risks local unity \u2013 Qatar is a major financial backer of both Egypt and Tunisia. It invites the very comparison with corrupt dictators of the Arab republicans, that the monarchs of the Gulf were so anxious to avoid. By portraying Islamism as an outside force, it guarantees it added credibility as an internal one.</p> <p>Islamists, whether Brotherhood or Salafi, are only part of the opposition in Kuwait. Youth groups, nationalists, liberals are all in this too. The arrest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/30/syria-conflict-after-failed-ceasefire-live#block-508fa29d95cb55519dae8b4f\" title=\"\">Musallam al-Barrak</a>, a former lawmaker and union leader, has done more to galvanise the opposition than anything else. An independent nationalist, at the last elections Barrack garnered around 30,000 votes, the highest number in Kuwait. To declare him the plaything of foreign power is political folly. He has now been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20165318\" title=\"\">released on bail</a>.</p> <p>The source of the ferment in Kuwait has little to do with Islamism. It is an amendment to the electoral law pushed by the emir that would reduce the number of votes each voter cast to one. With multiseat constituencies, this would mean that, as in Jordan, if the opposition candidate got 70% of the vote, the remainder of the vote would be divided up among the other seats for the same constituency. This would pave the way for a neutered parliament in which the opposition could never take control. It is blatantly undemocratic but it is non-negotiable.</p> <p>The emir is, however, going full-steam ahead with an election on 1 December on this basis, which the opposition has now said it will boycott. The ferment in the Gulf undermines the thesis that the movement known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> is primarily about poverty. It defies too the prediction that it has run into the sands of sectarian divides between Sunni and Shia. The Gulf rulers thought they could buy immunity from this change but they have found that dignity is not something that even their unlimited quantity of petrodollars can buy. All eyes are now looking nervously on Kuwait.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 November 2012. The original said that Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, used his address to the United Nations to claim that the Muslim Brotherhood were plotting to undermine governments in the region. He made this claim after his address to the UN. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The impact of the superstorm Sandy was felt directly on the presidential election on Thursday when the popular mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, threw his support behind Barack Obama, citing Republican challenger Mitt Romney's failure to back climate change measures.</p> <p>Bloomberg combined his endorsement of Obama with a devastating attack on Romney for reversing his positions not only on climate change but on immigration, guns, abortion rights and healthcare.</p> <p>His endorsement came as Obama received plaudits for his handling of the storm that has devastated New Jersey and New York and also hit Connecticut and West Virginia.</p> <p>The mayor, writing about the damage caused to New York by Sandy, praised Obama for having made some progress towards tackling climate change. He noted that Romney, too, had supported climate change moves in the past but has since backed away from them.</p> <p>In a powerful passage that can only hurt Romney, Bloomberg went on to write: \"I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results.</p> <p>\"In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and healthcare. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the healthcare model he signed into law in Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was honoured to have Bloomberg's endorsement. \"I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and [I] appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days,\" the president said.</p> <p>\"Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time \u2013 that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future.</p> <p>\"Just as importantly, we agree that whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation \u2013 together.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg's support comes after New Jersey governor Chris Christie praised Obama for his handling of Sandy. Although Christie is a Republican and a prominent supporter of Romney, he went out of his way this week to repeatedly praise Obama's leadership in responding to the crisis.</p> <p>Bloomberg is an independent who had originally been a Democrat before switching to the Republicans in 2001. He won the mayorship as a Republican but fell out with the party in 2007.</p> <p>He considered running as an independent in the 2008 White House election and commissioned polls in all 50 states, dropping the idea after finding insufficient support.</p> <p>In his op-ed, Bloomberg brings climate change, largely ignored by Obama and Romney during the campaign, back to the fore.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he wrote.</p> <p>He added: \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be \u2013 given this week's devastation \u2013 should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Obama had taken major steps to reduce carbon consumption and Romney too had a history of tackling climate change but had reversed course.</p> <p>He said he was disappointed with Obama on many issues, listing among them healthcare reform.</p> <p>\"When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of supreme court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>\"One recognises marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.\"</p> <p>He concluded: \"Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress \u2013 and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfil the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.\"</p> <p>The Economist, which has a wide readership in the US, said in an editorial it had backed Obama four years ago and was doing so again. It regretted that Romney was too far removed from the centre.</p> <p>\"This newspaper yearns for the more tolerant conservatism of Ronald Reagan, where 'small government' meant keeping the state out of people's bedrooms as well as out of their businesses. Mr Romney shows no sign of wanting to revive it,\" it says.</p> <p>It concludes: \"For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p>Fellow Republicans downplayed the significance of Bloomberg's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me. Bloomberg is a very liberal political figure,\" said George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York.</p> <p>Pataki also argued Romney would be \"far better\" than Obama in dealing with climate change.</p> <p>Pataki during his time as governor was one of the creators of a regional carbon trading system \u2013 which is in partial collapse since Christie pulled out last year. </p> <p>He said of Romney's position: \"I think he is far better than Obama, who embraced the Markey-Waxman bill. That is the fear when you allow people like Pelosi and Reid and Obama to draft national legislation that is not so much aimed at climate change but at expanding government power and government revenue. I think Romney would be far better.\"</p>",
  "<p>The approach of the end of autumn term for hundreds of students hoping to become lawyers brings with it the mad scramble to apply for law firm vacation schemes \u2013 paid work experience that many hope will help to secure that elusive training contract.</p> <p>City and commercial law firms run schemes during the summer, Easter and Christmas holidays, varying in length from two to four weeks. They are open to second year law students and non-law students in their final year.</p> <p>Students are paid at least \u00a3250 a week during placements and many firms provide help with finding accommodation.</p> <p>During placements you will be given a taste of life as a trainee. While all law firms may look alike to the outsider, there are wide variations, and placements allow you to get a feel for the particular culture and people, helping you decide the right place for you.</p> <p>Remember though, it's a two way process and during placements firms will also be sussing you to see if you are right for them.</p> <p>All firms do the schemes slightly differently, but generally students are assigned to a trainee or qualified lawyer and work with them on whatever they are doing.</p> <p>You obviously won't get to do the really clever stuff, but it won't all be photocopying either. As well as doing research and taking notes in client meetings, vac students will often be given assessed exercises. Students doing a placement with Allen &amp; Overy, for example, will take part in a client-pitch exercise. \"Many initially find this nerve-wracking, but for most it's the event they value the most,\" says graduate recruitment partner Richard Hough.</p> <p>Students will get opportunities to meet and learn about the different teams within a firm and will also be invited to attend a number of social events. \"We're looking for people with client-winning potential,\" says Hough, \"so it's important to see how they interact socially\".</p> <p>The deadlines for application vary, but some are approaching for the next year's summer placements at the end of October and early November. A useful guide to the timetables can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.lawcareers.net/Solicitors/WorkPlacementDeadlines/\" title=\"\">LawCareers.Net</a> site.</p> <p>The importance placed by firms on vacation schemes varies. For some, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/01/international-lawyer-asia\" title=\"\">recently-merged Herbert Smith Freehills</a> (HSF), they are an important tool in recruiting some of their trainees. While others, such as Slaughter and May, see them as simply providing useful work experience and insight into the reality of the work of a lawyer, rather than as a two-week interview.</p> <p>A&amp;O's Hough observes: \"They were designed for work experience, but have morphed into something different in the eyes of students, who view them as a means to an end \u2013 they hope they will end up with a training contract.\"</p> <p>All firms however, approach vac schemes seriously, and for most, the process of application and selection is as rigorous as it is for training contracts.</p> <p>Application is generally done online. Some firms expect candidates to complete online verbal and critical reasoning tests, as well as a face to face interview and practical assessment. Slaughters, on the other hand, which does not recruit trainees via its vac scheme, simply requires students to submit a CV and covering letter.</p> <p>Those applying to HSF go though exactly the same demanding process as they would to apply for a training contract, culminating in a six-hour assessment day.</p> <p>\"We like to recruit as many trainees as possible from those who have done the vacation placement. It's a stepping stone on the way to a training contract,\" says graduate recruitment partner Matthew White.</p> <p>Of the 85 trainees that HSF has recruited this year, half, he says, have done a vacation placement with the firm.</p> <p>\"I'd like it to be higher because it's a better way of recruiting \u2014 giving students a good look at us and us a good look at them,\" he says. However, he stresses that not having done a placement with the firm is not a barrier to applying or being selected for a training contract.</p> <p>Competition for vacation placements is even more fierce than it is for training contracts, because some students accept places on several, whereas you can only accept one training contract.</p> <p>For example A&amp;O gets around 3,000 applications for vacation placements, according to Hough, compared to 2,000 for training contracts. The firm takes on around 60 vac students per year.</p> <p>The firm's graduate recruitment advisor Sarah Cockburn suggests that \"media hysteria\" over the level of competition means that many good students are \"deselecting\" themselves before they have even had a go. \"It is really disheartening to see,\" she says.</p> <p>But, she says students should not be put off by the numbers, because the quality of applications can often be a really mixed bag. \"Many are littered with spelling errors and mistakes that are easy to avoid, and this varying quality, combined with an increasing number of good candidates wrongly deselecting themselves, can at times make it harder to fill placement schemes.\"</p> <p>She encourages candidates to focus on making their own application as good as possible, by doing their research properly and spending time tailoring it the individual firm.</p> <p>One reason for the low standard, suggests Hough, is the high number of applications that some students are making \u2013 on average between eight and 12.</p> <p>\"I question whether it is possible to do so many applications on an individual bespoke basis. It would be better if everyone was a bit more focused,\" he says.</p> <p>All firms are keen to stress that they are looking to recruit the best talent wherever that might be found, and to allay fears that any groups or individuals might be treated more favourably than others.</p> <p>Twenty of thirty years ago, says White, things may have been different, with the children of clients or partners given preferential treatment, but he insists, those days are long gone.</p> <p>Like others, White says he does not want to see candidates put off by perceptions that they need to have gone to a particular school or university in order to apply, or that they will be disadvantaged to their ethnicity, sex or socio-economic background.</p> <p>When applications are initially considered, partners cannot see the name or sex of an applicant, or their school or university, he reassures, stressing that the application process is objective, judging candidates only on merit.</p> <p>\"Some people assume that we are looking for a particular type of person, but we aren't,\" says White.</p> <p>\"I went to a comprehensive school and was the first person in my family to go to university, but I came here and felt like I fitted in,\" he adds.</p> <p>One misconception that firms particularly want to scotch, is the notion that they are only interested in Oxford and Cambridge graduates, and therefore it is not worth others applying.</p> <p>Hough says he finds the Oxbridge \"fixation\" frustrating. \"The perception is that in a downturn recruiters narrow their focus and look at a few select places.\" He says that is not the case. A&amp;O, he counters, goes to 18 universities in the milk round, works actively with 47 and has 50 represented among its current London trainee population.</p> <p>\"Quality is everywhere,\" he insists.</p> <p>But what of you don't get a placement? The firm message not to despair \u2013 they are not the be all and end all. Hough points out that half of the training contracts at A&amp;O are held back for those applying through the external recruitment scheme. He stresses: \"It's wrong for vacation placements to become the focal point \u2014 they are not the only way of getting a training contract.\"</p> <p>What matters, he says, is that students have shown a \"hunger\" to learn about the law and get some work experience. \"If they haven't done a vacation placement it doesn't mean they are under par.\"</p> <p>\"I'd be equally, if not more impressed, with someone who has trawled the phone directory and found themselves a couple of weeks work experience in a high street firm. That shows commitment,\" he says.</p> <p><em>*This article was amended on 7 November. It originally said that Allen &amp; Overy take on 10-12 vacation scheme students per year. This has now been corrected</em></p>",
  "<p>Avid readers of this blog may remember that last year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/jun/17/blogpost\">I questioned </a>whether the East Coast mainline, currently under public control, should now be transferred back to private ownership.</p> <p>I did so on the basis of a number of problems. Figures showed that it had one of the worst punctuality rates of any train operator in the UK and despite fares going up, services such as unlimited internet were being confined only to first class. The operators also put an end to 100 years of the dining car. Not world-shattering I know, but enough to make you wonder whether a private firm would have been quite so eager to lose such services that provide a competitive edge.</p> <p>After this week, my suspicions have been reinforced that Government should stay as far away from train travel as possible.</p> <p>In the wake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-contract\">the news that the competition</a> to run the West Coast mainline linking much of north west England with London was being cancelled due to what the newly installed Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin described as \"deeply regrettable and completely unacceptable mistakes made by my department in the way it managed the process,\" the Secretary of State <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/03/virgin-rail-west-coast\">announced the establishment </a>of two inquires.</p> <p>One, led by Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, is looking at the Government's wider rail franchising policies to establish what needs to be learnt from the West Coast fiasco. The other, examining the circumstances that led to this disastrous U-turn, is being led by Sam Laidlaw, Chief Executive of Centrica who this week <a href=\"http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/laidlaw-report/laidlaw-report.pdf\">published his interim findings</a>.</p> <p>Presenting the report to the Commons, McLoughlin<a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/news/statements/mcloughlin-20121029a\"> told MPs</a> that the document made for \"uncomfortable reading\" for the department. That would be an understatement.</p> <p>Declaring that the events around the franchising of the West Coast route raised \"significant issues about the ability of the DfT to effectively conduct rail franchise competitions\", what followed was a <a href=\"http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/laidlaw-report/laidlaw-report.pdf\">damning critique</a> of the way the Department ran the process, including:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The department proceeded despite being aware of \"a lack of transparency\" in the process of detraining the \"subordinated loan facility\" (SLF), the key part of the risk capital that bidders would have to agree to forfeit if they failed to meet the terms of their contract.</p> <p>Bidders were not provided with sufficient information to be able to reliably predict the likely size of the SLF to be imposed by the Department.</p> <p>The level of SLF ultimately required in respect of the two leading bids from First and Virgin was not determined using the Department's own guidelines. </p> </blockquote> <p><br> In seeking to explain the reasons for such problems, the report outlines a lack of adequate planning and preparation, \"significant resourcing challenges faced by the DfT\" and lack of clarity about who at the Department was responsible for what.</p> <p>So where does this leave us? </p> <p>While three Government officials <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/03/transport-secretary-west-coast-mainline\">have been suspended </a>pending the results of all the inquiries still on-going, those Ministers ultimately responsible, the former Transport Secretaries Philip Hammond (now at Defence), Justine Greening (now at International Development) and the former Rail Minister Theresa Villiers (now Northern Ireland Secretary) remain in their posts. Having all expressed unwavering support for the process, along with the current Transport Secretary this raises questions about how they could have judge what were systematic failures so badly.</p> <p>As the Shadow Transport Secretary, Maria Eagle told the Commons on Monday: </p> <blockquote> <p>However the Secretary of State spins it, the truth is that this is a franchise fiasco with not one but four Cabinet Ministers' fingerprints all over it. Who designed the new franchising policy, building significantly greater risk into the process? It was the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Who reduced the Department's capability to manage major contracts by cutting a third of the staff, including the directors of procurement, rail strategy and rail contracts? It was the Secretary of State for Defence. </p> <p>Who decided not to bother with an external audit, turning a saving of thousands into a cost of tens of millions, then delegated the entire process to her junior Minister and then failed to act on warning after warning about flaws in the process? It was the Secretary of State for International Development. And who declared himself satisfied with the whole process before the Transport Committee, despite the growing evidence that something had gone badly wrong, and then added to the chaos in the franchising system by replacing the costs of one competition with the costs of three? It was the current Secretary of State. This is a shambles involving not one but four members of the Prime Minister's Cabinet, and it is about time they took responsibility for it instead of blaming officials.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Officials may not have been so forthcoming with the facts with Ministers, but given that Richard Branson <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/28/virgin-trains-legal-challenge-franchise\">announced in August</a> that he was taking legal action over the process, both Greening and Villiers should have been asking serious questions of the Department to ensure their support for the franchising process was merited. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398683158\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/9/10/1347297005291/Richard-Branson-004.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Branson\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Richard Branson.

That leads to a suspicion, and it's no more than that at the moment, that faced with the media campaign Branson was launching against the Department, ministers did not investigate sufficiently deep enough, raising issues of competence. As Gordon Brown could tell them, as soon as any minister or Government loses public support for its competence it is ultimately far more serious than accusations about ministers all being toffs. </p> <p>The convention that ministers decide and officials advise is one that has lasted for many years. It is ultimately ministers, who were responsible for formulating the current franchising policy, who should be responsible for ensuring that it works properly. </p> <p>Given the mess that the Government itself has created on the West Coast, I would argue that this, above anything else makes a clear case for the public sector to stay well clear of UK railways.</p> <p><strong>What do you think? Do events around West Coast make the case against nationalising the railways? </strong><br><em><strong><br>Ed Jacobs</strong> is a political consultant at the&#xa0;Leeds based&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.publicaffairsco.com/\">Public Affairs Company&#xa0;</a>and devolution correspondent for the centre-left political and policy blog,&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/\">Left Foot Forward</a>.</em></p>",

It's a laptop killer. After living with the Surface RT for a few days now, I'm convinced that this form factor is the replacement and way forward for the stagnant laptop. I can't even remember the last time I was this excited about a computer.

The Galaxy were made to work hard for their victory and once again, it was Mike Magee, the man who loves the playoffs, and who loves scoring against the Whitecaps, who popped up to blast the equalizer, before Donovan wrote his own headlines by winning and coolly converting a penalty.</p> <p>The Whitecaps executed their game plan as far as it could take them, but in the end it wasn't enough and they didn't have a Plan B when LA finally injected some urgency into their play. The Galaxy were a little timid in the first half, but when Arena made his tactical switches they began to reap the rewards - and Keane was a menace all night.</p> <p>Just before the Galaxy equalizer there was a moment where the goal opened up for Robson, and he could have killed off the Galaxy with a second goal. Instead the Galaxy broke and from the next corner the equalizer went in. That's knockout soccer. The Galaxy move on. The Whitecaps are out.</p> <p>Thanks for all your tweets and emails, sorry I couldn't get to use them all. I'll be back with Seattle vs Real Salt Lake tomorrow night, and we'll have our fan previews of the semi-finals too.

A possible Olympic slot squirmed out of the USA\u2019s hands, when Donovan was a possible favourite to captain that side, and generally the player has found himself a little becalmed this year and at one of those career crossroads where he has to decide whether he wants to set new goals (including the 2014 World Cup) and push on, or not.&#xa0;</p> <p>His concerns were publicly aired in an interview with Sports Illustrated\u2019s Grant Wahl recently, and again last night in an ESPN interview with Julie Foudy \u2014 and his international coach has also weighed in on the subject, basically saying it\u2019s perfectly understandable and up to the player what he wants to do. All of this amid plenty of clamour from other people with slightly less at direct stake than Klinsmann, but equally convinced of their right to tell Donovan exactly what they thought of him.

After that, the game settled into the pattern we might have predicted beforehand - the Whitecaps parking two lines of four and inviting the Galaxy on. The Galaxy duly lumbered forward and everyone pretty much did what they were supposed to do, but it looked as if Keane was the only player to regularly look to inject some urgency, change of pace, or just the unexpected, against a very solid Whitecaps defense.&#xa0;</p> <p>Of course there's danger in committing forward too much and the Whitecaps almost had a second had Robson's pass at the end of the half received the run it deserved, but mainly the pattern of the game is set thus: Vancouver defend, LA attack. The onus is on the hosts to do something - not just because the score is as it is, but because on current balance of play the Whitecaps are coping pretty comfortably.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509341a0b579f74bac764915\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T03:44:32.724Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HALF TIME: LA 0 VANCOUVER 1</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Half time thoughts in a moment...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50934176b579f74bac764914\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T03:43:51.306Z\">3.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins+2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>...Beckham curls it up and over toward the top corner but Knighton gets brilliantly across to palm the ball clear.

Just as the reputation of Omar Gonzalez ballooned in his absence, the reputation of Rennie as an MLS coach grew before a ball had been kicked, as his off-season wheeler-dealing and overhaul of a squad that had drifted through their expansion season, had some pundits tipping them as an outside shot to win the West.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Whitecaps started solidly and confidently, and were getting results. Maybe not with great style, but last season they didn\u2019t have style or results. From the platform of being difficult to beat, Rennie tried to add some more flair to his side with his mid-season moves, and from the outside it became fairly apparent that the speed of change had begun to overtake the rate of improvement and some of the basics began to get neglected. The Whitecaps began losing ground to their playoff bound peers then found themselves desperately staving off an FC Dallas late-season revival in a storyline they should never have been involved with. Perhaps as much due to others as themselves, the Whitecaps found themselves in the playoffs, and now Rennie faces the task of taking them further.&#xa0;</p> <p>His first tactic for doing so: mind games. Will he play his Designated Player duo of Kenny Miller and Barry Robson? The pair were benched for RSL last week, but was that because they\u2019ve been a little underwhelming or were they being rested with tonight in mind. Rennie\u2019s been coy on the matter, in a manner his opposite number Bruce Arena might nod approvingly at, but the fact remains that whatever side the Whitecaps coach puts out they\u2019ll need to be at their best to win tonight.</p> <p>That said, if the Whitecaps could get through tonight, San Jose would hold no fears for them:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFW22t-cVxo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NFW22t-cVxo?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50932ebfb579f74bac764905\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T02:24:00.019Z\">2.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">LA Galaxy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Before the season started, you wouldn\u2019t have had many people saying you\u2019d see the Galaxy in this game. Any expectations that the side that had fulfilled David Beckham\u2019s American Destiny\u2122 would suffer a slump, were tempered by them news that the Galaxy seemed to be both holding a stacked roster together and even augmenting it in places during the off-season, with a tilt at the Champions League firmly in their sights. Buddle was back to augment the offense, even Beckham decided he couldn\u2019t bear to leave, and while the freak injury to Omar Gonzalez was a blow, surely it couldn\u2019t be <em>that </em>significant. Then came Toronto - a CCL defeat that was put into further dispiriting context as the season developed and Toronto became <em>Toronto</em> (pronounced the same, but with a wince). The league form fell apart as the gap left by Gonzalez assumed the proportions of a vortex of doom, and by May, the same people who wouldn\u2019t have said you\u2019d see the Galaxy in this game, were still thinking you wouldn\u2019t see the Galaxy in this game, but for different reasons, as LA languished at the bottom of the West.</p> <p>Gradually the ship stabilized and the Galaxy began to climb the standings. Robbie Keane, with a full season under his belt (other than the brief Euro jaunt), began to adjust to the game here, and showed how lethal he can still be in front of goal; Gonzalez returned and Tommy Meyer slowly picked up the slack even when DeLaGarza got injured; the culture of the club generally began to tilt back to an air of expectation rather than unease - not least because the senior players began to demand it.</p> <p>The 2011 Galaxy who would find a way out of every tight game via a 1-0 win has not returned, but the Galaxy who were leaking goals at the start of the season seems to have been banished and they\u2019ll go into the play-offs as confident as any other side.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T02:25:21.852Z\">at 2.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50932dc195cb1506d24446ff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T02:19:45.725Z\">2.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Previously, on LA vs Vancouver...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rj-nVAxM1s\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Rj-nVAxM1s?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50932c3d95cb1506d24446fe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-02T02:13:17.682Z\">2.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Playoffs day two. Last night we learned that Chicago Fire\u2019s season has (insert burning pun here), after they (insert \u201cflamed out\u201d style phrase here) to Houston Dynamo in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/01/mls-playoffs-chicago-fire-houston-dynamo\">last night\u2019s Eastern Conference wild-card game</a>. The Dynamo played a very impressive road game and now get to add their vaunted home form into the mix when they play Sporting Kansas City in the semi-finals.</p> <p>Enough of the East for now though \u2014 and let\u2019s go West to the Home Depot Center, where LA Galaxy are taking on Vancouver Whitecaps in the Western Conference wild-card game, with the winner set to face San Jose Earthquakes in the Western semi-final.&#xa0;</p> <p>It\u2019s one of those games that seems so set up in favour of the Galaxy that you actually wonder if Vancouver might just be poised to spring a surprise here. The Galaxy are at home, look to be peaking at just the right time, and their form in the second half of the season has been pretty irresistible (with one or two hiccups). They\u2019ve also dominated the Whitecaps since Vancouver arrived in the league. The Whitecaps on the other hand have been pretty horrible for the last couple of months and just about scraped into the playoffs. They\u2019ve experienced huge personnel turnover and a cultural transformation under Martin Rennie since their 2011 expansion year, that takes time to cohere, and they\u2019ve not shown they know how to beat the Galaxy. A consensus seems to have emerged that they\u2019ve had a good year just making the playoffs, and if they can build in the offseason they should be a more credible threat next year. In other words, Vancouver Whitecaps are going to win MLS Cup...</p> <p>It\u2019s not the most likely outcome, but even the most homer-ish of Galaxy commentators is pretty aware that this game is a banana skin for the reigning champions, if they are to reach the slightly more predictable ground of 180 minutes of soccer, rather than 90, deciding their fate. Whitecaps commentators are generally going for studied fatalism - though you can tell there\u2019s a little bit of the dangerous hope that fans like to dose themselves with, lurking just beneath the surface.</p> <p>Will Vancouver spring a surprise? Will the Galaxy take the scenic route back to MLS Cup? You can see what our regular fan previewers for both teams say about the game <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/31/mls-cup-2012-wild-card-fan-previews\">here</a>, and of course you can read our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/30/mls-cup-previews-2012\">general playoff guide here</a>.

  "<p>The chairman of a parliamentary committee has accused the Bank of England of \"defective governance\" after it published three reports on the financial crisis that he said failed to tackle how well the central bank performed.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, said the reviews were limited in scope and \"fell well short of what is required\" of a body that was at the heart of decision-making during the banking collapse.</p> <p>\"These reviews are a step forward. The Treasury committee will consider them carefully,\" he said, but \"the Bank of England has yet to produce a comprehensive review of the Bank's role in, and response to, the crisis. The decision to commission these reviews fell well short of what was required.\"</p> <p>The central bank commissioned three reviews of its conduct during the crisis in answer to criticism that it had failed to investigate what lessons could be learned to avoid a repeat of the debacle. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank governor, has rejected concerns that he and his officials mishandled the near collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 and underplayed the weakness of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB, which needed a bailout a year later.</p> <p>The Bank's monetary policy, which has involved pumping billions of pounds into the economy, has also faced severe criticism in some quarters, alongside its forecasts for inflation and economic growth.</p> <p>Tyrie, who has already warned against King being handed extra powers to regulate the financial system without a more in-depth look at the Bank's procedures and culture, said two authors of the reports would appear before the committee to justify why a comprehensive review was rejected in favour of three discrete reports.</p> <p>\"A comprehensive review should already have taken place, not just to enable the Bank to learn from its past mistakes but also to inform the legislation currently before parliament,\" he said. \"The fact that it took so long to obtain even these reports illustrates the Bank's defective governance.\"</p> <p>One of the reviews examined how well the central bank provided emergency funds to banks following the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers. The other two tackled the effectiveness of the bank's quantitative easing programme and its ability to forecast economic events.</p> <p>In a series of mild rebukes, the authors said forecasting methods should be strengthened and the bank should look more widely for potential shocks to the financial system, especially dangers lurking in hedge funds and unconventional financial businesses.</p> <p>Ian Plenderleith, one of the authors, who spent most of his career at Threadneedle Street, will appear before the committee with the former JP Morgan banker Bill Winters.</p> <p>Tyrie said that despite some criticisms in the reports, he was concerned that the government planned to press ahead with radical proposals for regulatory reform, \"giving the Bank of England an enormous increase in powers, without thinking through, in practice, who should be overseeing these bodies, and how\".</p> <p>He said: \"That is why the Treasury committee has been pressing for changes to the financial services bill to improve the governance of the Bank of England.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK must brace itself for a high likelihood of winter floods, the Met Office and the government's flooding watchdog have warned.</p> <p>Saturated ground around the country, and high river and groundwater levels from the wet summer, will mean that much less rainfall than usual is needed to top up water levels and cause severe flooding, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>There is now a significantly higher risk of flooding this autumn and winter, even with small amounts of rain, so households have been advised to check warnings for their area. One in six homes is at some risk of flooding.</p> <p>Sarah Jackson, of the Met Office, said: \"We are heading into the winter period which is traditionally the wetter period of the year in the UK. Because the ground is so wet, if we do have any prolonged heavy rainfall in any part of the country, there is going to be heightened risk of flooding.\"</p> <p>Any severe flooding this winter will also raise questions over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">government's cuts to some proposed new flood defences</a>, some of which are now being abandoned or scaled back. Insurers have warned that they may end their long-standing agreement to provide all UK homes with flood cover. If they do so, some people will find themselves in uninsurable homes.</p> <p>Experts singled out Devon, Dorset and Hampshire in the south as being particularly at risk, because of high groundwater levels, while in the north of England and Wales the risk has been heightened from recent heavy rainfall. In the south-west, the main threat will be from rivers, especially this month and next.</p> <p>Coastal areas are braced for high spring tides occurring in the middle of this month and from 12 to 18 December.</p> <p>Paul Mustow, head of flood incident management at the Environment Agency, urged people to take action against \"the UK's number one natural hazard\". He advised: \"The most important step people can take in protecting themselves from the worst impacts is to find out if they are at risk, and sign up to our free flood warnings service.\" More than a million people are currently signed up.</p> <p>One question that the Met Office researchers are now working on is whether the unusually grim weather this year was the result of global warming. For six years in a row, the UK has suffered unusually wet summers with less sunlight than normal. This has been largely owing to the positioning of the \"jet stream\", a northern latitudes weather system that usually brings periods of settled weather to UK summers but for several years has been changing position, resulting in the opposite.</p> <p>Some experts think the positioning of the weather system has been affected by the melting Arctic. This year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">Arctic ice reached the lowest extent ever recorded</a>, and there was more widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet than seen before.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said households and businesses should check their flood risk and sign up to receive free flood warnings at <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood\" title=\"\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood</a>.</p>"
