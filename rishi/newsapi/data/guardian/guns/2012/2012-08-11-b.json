  "<p>A few years ago people used their mobile phones to make calls and, if they were feeling adventurous, to send the odd text. Not any more. These days we take for granted the mini-PCs in our pockets that can play our favourite songs and TV shows; they can even help you find yourself (if you get lost).</p> <p>Consumers are hooked on their phones and, surveys say, miss them long before realising their wallet has gone astray. They have become a life and death matter for manufacturers too \u2013 as Nokia, BlackBerry's Canadian owner Research in Motion and now Taiwan's HTC have found to their cost. The wrong smartphone, marketed in the wrong way, can destroy a company's market value in a matter of months.</p> <p>When Stephen Elop took over as chief executive of Nokia in 2010, the Finnish company was the world's largest maker of smartphones, with a global market share comfortably over 30%. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/feb/10/nokia-warns-trouble-ahead\" title=\"\">A year later, and that share had halved, according to research firm IDC</a>. In the ensuing nine months, the same thing would happen again and Nokia's share now stands at 7%. Asset sales, factory closures and job losses in their tens of thousands have followed.</p> <p>The decline has been just as startling at the once-mighty BlackBerry. Having created the ultimate email machine, RIM has been unable to follow up with a phone that lets you surf the internet without making you feel suicidal, and is now facing an existential crisis. In the space of a year, the company has gone from a quarterly profit measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a quarterly loss of the same magnitude; 7,000 jobs have already been axed this year.</p> <p>It seems a company can go out of fashion faster than its phone \u2013 as the experience of Taiwanese prodigy HTC, which has unravelled in just six months \u2013 has shown us. A relative newcomer to the consumer electronics business, it first found success making white-label Windows phones for various mobile networks. Then along came Google and the Android platform and HTC jumped aboard, making phones under its own name.</p> <p>Android's magic carpet whisked HTC into the stratosphere. Revenues doubled, peaking at Christmas 2011. Then, all of a sudden, the rug was pulled out from under its feet. HTC's newest handset, the HTC One X, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/06/samsung-wins-smartphones-battle\" title=\"\">failed to make an impression this spring</a> and now sales and profits are in freefall: a company that was worth more than \u00a311bn in March is now valued at just over \u00a34bn.</p> <p>In an attempt to right the ship, HTC has sold back its stake in Dr Dre's hip headphone business after the combination of its phones and Dre's \"cans\" failed to inject street cred into the brand. The Seoul and Brazil offices have been closed, as has its research centre in North Carolina.</p> <p>HTC is still profitable, and may well bounce back. But history suggests that once they find themselves in a tailspin, phone makers rarely recover. Siemens, once a top-five manufacturer, began to loose its appeal in 2001. In two years its market share halved. By 2005 it had halved again, and the handset division was sold to a Chinese company.</p> <p>The decline of Motorola, once world number one, can be dated from 2007, the year the iPhone arrived. It took 18&#xa0;months for half of Motorola's sales to fall away, and another 18 for it to loose its mojo altogether. The handset business was sold to Google last year.</p> <p>If anything, the pace of decline is increasing. Apple turned the mobile phone into a status symbol on a par with the designer handbag. As customers moved upmarket, two premium brands, Apple itself and Samsung, have taken control of more than half of worldwide sales. Mobile phones, like fashion, are looking like a dangerously fickle business.</p> <h2>Walker can ride reforming tide<br></h2> <p>The attraction of Sir David Walker, next chairman of Barclays, is that he stands for something. Try his comment to this newspaper: \"This is quite a good time to be reforming pay because of where the market in pay is. We may still suffer some breakages [employees leaving] but if people are only doing it for the money, they are probably not the people we need.\"</p> <p>It is impossible to imagine Walker's predecessor Marcus Agius expressing the view that you can't make an omelette without smashing eggs. Agius was happy to accept that pay would eventually fall across the industry \"to adjust to the new reality of higher capital and lower returns\", as he put it at this year's annual meeting. But the notion that Barclays should take a lead in this made him bristle. Shareholders' interests had to be protected, you see, and outsiders should be more patient.</p> <p>Walker's premise is that there's no time like the present. Hurrah! But the fine words have to be matched by deeds. The test will come when Barclays does suffer \"breakages\". What if a team of red-hot currency dealers threatens to move to, say, JP&#xa0;Morgan? Let 'em go \u2013 we'll find cheaper replacements, seems to be Walker's line.</p> <p>The good news is that he can expect shareholders to be supportive. During Bob Diamond's reign, most became sick of seeing the investment bankers protect their own rewards even when profits fell and returns were weak. Most are willing to gamble that the bank won't fall apart if a few supposed superstars jump ship.</p> <p>Walker's great advantage is that Diamond has gone. He can appoint his own chief executive and demand quick improvements. He is also helped by the Libor scandal: even on the trading floor, they recognise that Bonus Bob's downfall means life will now change.</p> <p>Just don't expect Walker to work miracles. His 2009 review of financial institutions had very little to say on the subject of banks' behaviour towards customers. There were excellent recommendations on the need for non-execs to get up to speed on risk and challenge executives. But since then the full horrors of the PPI insurance mis-selling scandal have been revealed and we've learned that small businesses were stuffed with interest-rate swaps they didn't need. With banks, there's always a new problem.</p> <h2>Oil hunters in troubled waters of Falklands<br></h2> <p>While oil companies are rightly pilloried over the environmental risks they take, you have to admire their bravado. After badly blundering in the Gulf of Mexico, it's hard not to admire BP's boldness as it set about trying to sign a deal with Rosneft behind the back of its existing (and already highly truculent) local partners, AAR.</p> <p>Similarly, it's fun to watch Premier Oil take a \u00a3640m bet on the Falklands, a drilling location Argentina has in the past been willing to start a war over. Premier Oil you might recall was one of the very few companies that hung on in Burma when it was exceedingly politically incorrect to do so. The management eventually sold out \u2013 and how frustrated they must be now that the gas-rich nation has been embraced again by the international community.</p> <p>The City has woken up to the Falklands being a difficult political destination, with Numis Securities last week changing its rating on the shares from buy to hold. But the good news for Simon Lockett and his team at Premier is that last week Noble Energy, became the first US firm to sign its own exploration deal in the disputed waters. Britain might no longer have the hardware to launch another liberation armada, but you can bet the US navy would defend its noble drillers if anything nasty kicked off.</p>",
  "<p>The annual general meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds </a>is a splendid affair, held in the heart of London. Around 1,000 enthusiastic members attend and its high point is a rousing recital of the year's achievements from the charity's chairman. The tone tends towards the evangelical. At last year's gathering, the RSPB's current chairman, Ian Darling, was able to applaud a record membership of more than 1 million, each paying \u00a33 a&#xa0;month to help preserve Britain's bird life \u2013 or, as the handout puts it, anything that \"hops, crawls or flutters in your garden\".</p> <p>This is the charity that draws in the devoted, tending their bird tables across the country, and proud parents sending their children out on ornithological field trips. But it's also one of the nation's leading conservation bodies. Mr Darling recounted some of the success stories: the Great Crane Project which has restored the common crane to the Somerset Levels after an absence of 400 years; red-backed shrikes breeding successfully for the first time in the UK in 17 years; and red kites hatching in Northern Ireland after 200 years.</p> <p>He could applaud the healthy state of the society's finances \u2013 a net income of \u00a394m, and expenditure of \u00a383m. Its funds, boosted by generous legacies from members, are largely spent on conservation projects, including buying up land as nature reserves; it owned 209 at the last count, covering roughly 300,000 acres of Britain, almost half of this in Scotland, making it that country's eighth-largest landowner.</p> <p>With all this financial muscle comes considerable influence. The advice of the RSPB is sought by governments and major companies on a&#xa0;range of issues, from the siting of wind farms to the planning of ring roads and airport runways. Not only sought, but adhered to. The big power companies, key players in onshore and offshore energy, pay tribute to the RSPB for steering them away from sites that are judged damaging to bird life. They know that to ignore the advice is to incur the risk of long-drawn-out planning objections and ultimate defeat.</p> <p>In most cases, such RSPB publicity is immensely successful \u2013 and why not? Surely this is one of Britain's most popular charities, source of an immense body of scientifically objective knowledge about wildlife, not just in Britain but across the world. Yet the RSPB has incurred the hostility of farmers, landowners and even the rural communities among whom it works. An organisation that once prided itself on its close links with countryside affairs and its working knowledge of the land now finds itself at a&#xa0;distance, assisting the police in exposing landowners whom it accuses of wildlife crime, and heaping blame on farmers for agricultural practices which it says have led to a dramatic fall in the numbers of once-common species. Though its stance on shooting is officially \"neutral\", a remarkably high proportion of its press releases concern owners of grouse moors and pheasant shoots, blaming them for trapping, poisoning and shooting birds of prey, or \"raptors\" as they are defined. A recent campaign urged its youngest members to help the society by turning detective: \"Can you help stop the criminals?\" it asks. \"With your help we can save birds of prey.\"</p> <p>Since the upper moorland of Britain is one of the most fragile eco-systems in the country, and agriculture accounts for more than 75% of its land, this is the frontline of conservation.</p> <p>Landowners and farmers claim that there is something odd about the RSPB's very public campaigns and about how they appear to be obsessed by birds of prey above all others. These are, of course, Britain's most glamorous birds. But the suggestion that they are under threat appears, to some, to be a highly partial version of the truth.</p> <p>The picture painted by the latest Breeding Birds Survey, compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), a science-based organisation, challenges the RSPB assertion head on. Species such as kites, eagles, goshawks, and peregrine are all doing well, with kites in particular, now re-introduced to Britain, a familiar sight over large areas of southern England, Wales and the Scottish Highlands. Golden eagles are flourishing enough for around 40 of them to have been \"relocated\" to County Donegal in Ireland. Buzzards, another common bird of prey, have multiplied by more than 600% since 1967, prompting Defra, the government's environment department, to consider ways of controlling them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394812543\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/6/1344271215129/Hen-harrier-001.jpg\" alt=\"Hen harrier\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A hen harrier with chicks in Sutherland. Photograph: Mark Hamblin/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hamblin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the number of hen harriers, which remain on the BTO's \"red list\" of globally threatened species under threat, increased from 570 nesting pairs in Britain in 1998 to 806 in 2004, before declining to 646 in 2010. Its European population runs into many thousands.</p> <p>The RSPB, however, maintains a passionate campaign on behalf of all birds of prey, irrespective of their numbers, its publicity eclipsing its concern for smaller birds, many of which now feature on the BTO's list of genuinely endangered species \u2013 willow tits, yellow wagtails, lapwing, grey partridge, redshank, stonechat and mistle thrush, some of which have undergone a population crash. In working to conserve these, the society needs to have those who own and manage the land on their side.</p> <p>Landowners and farmers, who find themselves on the receiving end of hostile publicity, say that they are every bit as concerned about the fragility of bird populations in Britain as the RSPB. They have, they admit, a more mixed view about birds of prey, seeing them, for all their beauty, as predators which attack small birds, as well as the young pheasants, grouse and sometimes even farm animals which are their livelihood. They argue that if the RSPB spent less time criticising them and more working with them as partners, much more could be achieved in the cause of conservation. The RSPB, for its part, says that it is committed to working with landowners, farmers and other land managers: \"We are the largest UK provider of free conservation advice to the farming community.\"</p> <p>Many consider that to keep its membership high, the RSPB may not want to be seen forging any kind of relationship with the shooting fraternity. Knowing that its loyal members take a dim view of blood sports, its \"neutral\" view on the subject of shooting can on occasion veer towards outright hostility. Privately, RSPB officials will concede that farmers or landowners do much good work to propagate bird species \u2013 planting bird-friendly crops, burning heather and killing vermin in order to improve shooting prospects. In public, however, support for those who kill birds for sport is rarely if ever expressed.</p> <p>John MacTavish, 46, a gamekeeper on a&#xa0;1,500-acre farm and pheasant shoot near Oban, has worked all his life on the land, and is keenly interested in conservation. But ever since the introduction of sea eagles, a spectacular bird of prey unknown in the area for 200 years, he claims he has found himself a&#xa0;constant object of suspicion. These eagles have chosen not to nest on his ground and he believes RSPB officials are convinced he's deliberately frightening them off. They come back regularly to monitor his activities.</p> <p>\"I have absolutely nothing against sea eagles,\" says MacTavish, \"but I have an antipathy towards people who come on to my ground, without permission. I wouldn't go on to their land without asking first. Why can't they have the common decency to ask me?\"</p> <p>Like many gamekeepers, MacTavish is a&#xa0;countryman born and bred, who knows his own ground like the back of his hand. It is part of his job to spend cold nights out on the hill in the constant war against foxes, using his skills to protect his partridge and pheasants, as well as ground-nesting birds, all of which suffer from the attention of predators.</p> <p>His culture could hardly be more different from that of the RSPB, whose members are largely urban-based, and who share a natural antipathy towards farmers and shooters \u2013 the former held responsible for ruining the countryside with their pesticides and fertilisers, the latter dismissed simply as killers.</p> <p>\"They seem to be hell-bent on protecting raptors at the cost of everything else,\" says MacTavish. \"But I've now got more buzzards than bullfinches.\"</p> <p>Privately, some of the society's officers agree with this, arguing that the time has come to call a truce. But its public statements on the issue continue to be aggressive. The RSPB's investigations officer is quoted on its website as stating: \"It is important to remain focused in order to bring the killers to justice. There can be no better job satisfaction than that.\"</p> <p>The society admits that it helps police carry out raids on suspect estates. \"The RSPB will provide expert assistance to enforcement agencies to assist them in their efforts to tackle wildlife crime as required,\" is the official line.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394812544\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/6/1344271154720/Grouse-shooting-001.jpg\" alt=\"Grouse shooting\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A shooting party on the Blair Atholl estate.  Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stuart Housden, who heads the RSPB in Scotland, explains: \"The reason we focus on illegal killing of hen harriers on driven grouse moors is simply that it is by far the most important population impact in England and Scotland.\" An RSPB spokesman added that 70% of people convicted of offences relating to bird of prey persecution since 1990 were employed as gamekeepers. \"This does not mean that the majority of gamekeepers kill birds of prey,\" said a spokesman, \"but it does mean that the majority of people who are convicted of persecuting birds of prey are gamekeepers.\"</p> <p>However, farmers and landowners argue that in its determination to demonise them, the RSPB does little to highlight another side of an important conservation equation: the proven benefits that managed moorland and farmland bring to a whole range of endangered species. There have been several recent reports about the increase in populations of smaller songbirds, either on grouse moors or low ground managed for shooting, where gamekeepers and farmers are assiduous in controlling predators such as foxes and crows. These are rarely, if ever, mentioned by the RSPB.</p> <p>It is six years now since a remarkable report by one of the acknowledged experts on the bird life of moorland Britain, Dr Stephen Tapper, revealed that a&#xa0;wide range of species, including many at risk, such as plover, curlew and lapwing, but also at least one bird of prey, the merlin, had been thriving on moorland in Britain where gamekeepers had been at work. Curlew, he found, were 18 times more abundant in the North Pennines where grouse shooting took place, than in the Berwyn Special Protection Area, which, ironically, is a bird reserve; the merlin was twice as common on grouse moors as elsewhere.</p> <p>The report was virtually ignored by the RSPB. As was the more recent nine-year project carried out on the North Yorkshire moors by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. Using traditional methods of predator control, the trust was able to show dramatic improvements among wading birds. In the course of the experiment, their populations improved threefold.</p> <p>This was dismissed by the RSPB's former conservation director, Mark Avery, as \"work\u2026 funded by grouse-moor managers who are keen to promote the wider value of grouse-moor management\u2026 predator control, legal and too often illegal, is part of the business of delivering lots of grouse to the shooting parties in the autumn.\"</p> <p>For a measured response to a&#xa0;serious scientific paper this borders on the facile, but highlights the yawning gulf between the two sides. And it infuriates conservationists such as Lord Peel, a former member of English Nature, and past president of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust. \"It seems wholly logical and desirable that there be greater co-operation between wildlife charities and the keepered estates,\" he says. \"The prospect of witnessing the virtual demise of iconic species, as has happened outside the keepered areas, along with the substantial economic benefits that accrue to hard-pressed rural areas from grouse shooting, does not bear thinking about.\"</p> <p>The RSPB's arguments might be listened to with more respect in the countryside if its own moorland estates showed better results. On two stretches of important moorland, Lake Vyrnwy in Wales and Geltsdale in Cumberland, the society has acquired what used to be grouse moors, and turned them over to conservation. Here, one might have thought, it should be able to demonstrate triumphantly that birds of prey and the birds they prey on can happily co-exist.</p> <p>In fact, results from these two moors are disappointing. Curlew, plover and other waders have all been in decline. A bar chart compiled by Natural England showing the statistics from 17 Sites of Special Interest in the North Pennines has Geltsdale hovering at the bottom, while managed grouse moors support healthy populations of wading birds. Lake Vyrnwy has around six pairs of hen harriers, but, in 10 years, has recorded no increase in numbers of curlew, lapwing or golden plover. The RSPB vigorously defends its record, claiming that black grouse<strong> </strong>at Geltsdale have shown a marked improvement, from six males in 1996 to 45 in 2011.</p> <p>What is at the heart of the argument is the impact raptors have on other species when they get the upper hand. Uncontrolled numbers rapidly lead to a decline in prey birds, as shown by a famous trial, the Joint Raptor Study [JRS], undertaken on Langholm Moor in the 1990s, which recorded what happens when grouse and raptors are allowed to co-exist without interference. Over five years, the hen harrier population exploded \u2013 from two breeding pairs to 21. The grouse were all but eliminated. As were most of the other birds, because without grouse there was no income, without income there were no gamekeepers, and without the keepers the populations of crows and foxes, which prey on young birds, shot up.</p> <p>The society initially played down the evidence, but has more recently accepted that there could be a link, and is currently involved with a project which feeds dead rats and other animals to harriers as an alternative to grouse.</p> <p>It remains adamant, however, that species such as the recently introduced sea eagle pose no serious threat to farm or domestic animals. In the teeth of evidence from farmers in the West Highlands and Fife, who have seen these huge birds take young lambs, they claim that such incidents are rare. Yet it is becoming a&#xa0;serious and growing problem for crofters. One of them, on the island of Skye, says he now keeps \"an almost sacrificial stock of sheep\" out on the hill to prevent the sea eagles coming lower down. Another says the sea eagles have even tried to take hoggs (young sheep), and have left them wounded.</p> <p>Last year, a petition signed by 100 crofters was sent to the Scottish Environment Secretary highlighting the damage caused by the sea eagles. But the RSPB dismissed the claims, saying that \"independent studies have found the majority of lamb deaths are a result of other causes apart from rare sea eagle predation incidents.\"</p> <p>More recently, when Defra, the government department that deals with rural affairs, sought to tackle the population explosion among buzzards which was causing severe problems on pheasant shoots in England, and suggested that some nests might be relocated, the RSPB sprang into action. Instead of talking to farmers and landowners about how the problem might be managed, it branded any interference as \"appalling\" and immediately issued research of its own saying that buzzards pose little harm to young pheasants.</p> <p>Similarly, when it came to examining the possible impact of sparrowhawks on sparrows \u2013 a once familiar British bird, now in serious decline \u2013 it quoted approvingly the work of Dr Stuart Newson, an acknowledged expert, who concluded that the evidence against the hawks was unproven; but it went on to dismiss the findings of Dr Christopher Bell, who, based on observations going back 30 years, reached a&#xa0;very different conclusion. He blamed sparrowhawks for as much as 65% of the decline since 1977. Despite Dr Bell's international reputation, the RSPB dismissed his findings as unreliable, saying that \"alternative explanations remain equally or more plausible\".</p> <p>Conservationists who have to work with the RSPB find this apparent bias unacceptable. \"You just know they won't take seriously anything that runs counter to their philosophy,\" says one. \"The net result is that we don't take them seriously either.\" Because the RSPB appears reluctant to acknowledge that there may be another side to a complex conservation issue, its reputation as an even-handed, science-based organisation has suffered.</p> <p>There is no doubt that some landowners and gamekeepers are responsible for breaking the law and shooting or poisoning birds of prey. The fact that the north of England teams with grouse, but has no hen harriers on ground where they should be thriving is a black mark against those who own many thousands of acres of moorland in Yorkshire, Lancashire and Northumberland. The same is true of some \"rogue\" estates in Scotland.</p> <p>But this standoff between both sides is helping neither. Many landowners neither trust nor respect the RSPB, believing it to have become a&#xa0;lobbyist for raptors rather than a truly conservationist body. For its part, the RSPB simply believes that landowners are routinely breaking the law. \"The day they stop killing birds of prey and breaking the law, we will begin talking to them,\" says Housden.</p> <p>One of those who believe this mutual hostility damages the cause of conservation is Philip Merricks, a Kent farmer and lifelong conservationist who has also created two nature reserves \u2013 one on the Isle of Sheppey, one on Romney Marsh. He concludes: \"We're at a&#xa0;grim crossroads in the history of nature conservation and it is vital that good sense and co-operation prevail. The recent slanging match between some landowners and the RSPB does nothing to improve effective co-operation, and meanwhile many birds continue to drift towards disappearance.</p> <p>\"Both sides appear to have made the mistake of thinking their work and reputation is more important than successful nature conservation. We need carefully planned research, good science and a commitment to the birds, rather than a&#xa0;moral victory over the 'other side'. No one will thank conservationists of any hue for arguing and striking postures when they could be doing some good in the fields and marshes and moors. Shooting has a key part to play in conservation; sniping does not. Conservation has a key part to play, indiscriminate condemnation does not.\"</p> <p>Sniping and condemning, however, seems to be how the RSPB conducts its campaigns. As a result, it has lost trust in an area where trust is essential. A picture appears to have emerged of a charitable organisation drifting away from its principal purpose \u2013 to propagate all species of birds, rather than a chosen few; instead of acting as a model of evidence-based science, it seems to have turned increasingly into a lobbying body, more intent on boosting its membership than in propagating objective research.</p> <p>In the long battle for conservation, the RSPB proclaims as its slogan \"a million voices for nature\". But in doing so, it is pitting itself against a million more who believe that its policies may be damaging the very nature it purports to defend.</p> <p>\u2022 The standfirst to this article was amended on 16 August 2012 to clarify the author's position as a trustee of a Highland estate.</p>",

His fellow barristers at London's 5 Essex Court Chambers forgot everything they had learned about the presumption of innocence, and asked the police to seize his pass so that he could not re-enter their offices.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service under the current director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, is earning a deservedly bad reputation for its vexatious litigation. Her Majesty's chief inspector estimates that almost one in 10 of its prosecutions is baseless Thousands of people plead guilty, nevertheless, just to get the CPS off their backs.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, the homosexual element in the affair would have made Walsh cop a plea and slink away into obscurity. But Walsh is an openly gay man in the 21st century. \"I've never hidden what I am,\" he told me. \"I knew I had done nothing wrong and was not going to run away.\"</p> <p>Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Paul Chambers</a>, who took on the CPS when it tried to punish him for making a joke on Twitter, Walsh fought back. The \"extreme pornography\" the CPS described to the court sounded suitably obscene. The police found five images on Walsh's computer of anal fisting \u2013 which speaks for itself \u2013 and of \"urethral sounding\" \u2013 which I probably need to inform you involves the insertion of surgical rods into the penis. Three of the photographs, however, turned out to be of Walsh and his gay friends, who took pictures of each other engaging in consensual and legal sex.</p> <p>More ominously for those who believe that the CPS is an honourable institution, the picture it claimed showed child abuse showed nothing of the sort. One expert witness for the prosecution, a 74-year-old retired GP the Metropolitan Police had travelled all the way to Manchester to find, claimed it was a teenage boy.</p> <p>Witnesses for the defence said it was a man in his 20s. They were backed up by the story in the email that accompanied the picture, which also said the naked man was in his mid-20s. The prosecution was not able to prove that Walsh had requested the message or even clicked on the image.</p> <p>The poor old jurors had a lot to put up with, what with one thing and another \u2013 the prosecution passing them implements for sticking down penises and an expert witness explaining: \"It may take some time for someone to take a whole arm into their rectum.\"</p> <p>But, unlike Boris Johnson, they knew that what consenting adults did with their johnsons was no business of the state. The jury concluded that, however obscene the sexual practices on display, they were not as obscene as the notion that the CPS could poke its nose into the nation's bedrooms. It acquitted and proved that the ruin of Simon Walsh's career, the costs of a case that had forced him to sell his flat and the public money spent on bringing him to trial had been a colossal waste.</p> <p>You, dear reader, should be worried. The supposed child pornography was lying unopened in a file in one of Walsh's inboxes. Are you sure there is nothing similar in a spam folder on your laptop?</p> <p>If there is, you many face prosecution under an obscenity law that ignores John Stuart Mill's principle that consenting adults must be free to do as they choose as long as they do not harm others.</p> <p>\"I thought the CPS was meant to stop nasty exploitative porn,\" said Walsh, \"but it is punishing snaps friends take of each other in their own homes.\"</p> <p>The catch-all nature of obscenity law is scarcely an exception. The Communications Act used to prosecute Paul Chambers covers any message that is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing. Hundreds of thousands of people have sent emails, tweets or Facebook messages that fall within its terms.</p> <p>When the law can punish everyone, the question arises: why does the CPS use it to prosecute someone? Contrary to Mill's maxim, the CPS says it was right to prosecute because the possession of images of acts likely to cause serious injury is illegal, even if they are consensual.</p> <p>Myles Jackman, Walsh's solicitor, does not believe it, any more than the jury did. In this as in so many other cases, the CPS charged Walsh to save face, he says. The police had been convinced that Walsh was part of a child porn ring. Met officers put their reputations on the line by securing the approval of a district assistant commissioner, the commissioner of the City of London police and the lord mayor of London to raid Walsh's home.</p> <p>A dozen detectives made a great scene when they tore to his flat in two vans. They even interviewed Walsh's goddaughters and asked if he had abused them. They found no evidence of a paedophile ring, so used what little they could find on Walsh's computer to damn him instead</p> <p>If you receive the same treatment, you should remember that liberty in Britain has not advanced because of revolutions or stirring proclamations on continental lines.</p> <p>Liberty has advanced because bloody-minded protesters such as Chambers and Walsh have ignored cautionary voices, dug in their heels and fought until they forced capricious authority to back down.</p>",
  "<p>It is a frustration for those who study them that there are not enough murderous psychopaths to help isolate, at all reliably, characteristics specific to the type. Not that this difficulty will ever prevent popular speculation about possible warning signs, now updated for the digital age.</p> <p>For instance, for those old giveaways \"kept himself to himself\", \"never met your eye\" or \"had unnaturally pointed canines\", now read \"was not on Facebook\", \"had never played FarmVille\", \"unfamiliar with Spotify\". In particular, given trends in suspicion, the person with no Facebook presence now finds him or herself in much the same position as, going back a bit, a sweaty person who, having lowered his voice in the pharmacy, requested both chloroform and quicklime.</p> <p>A helpful article in the German newspaper <em>Tagesspiegel</em> has just indicated the risks, for anyone aspiring to mental health, of holding out against Mark Zuckerberg. Noting that neither <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9465938/Colorado-shooting-James-Holmes-is-mentally-ill-say-lawyers.html\" title=\"\">James Holmes</a>, the murderer of 12 in a Colorado cinema, nor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Behring Breivik</a> was a fan of online social networking, the paper quoted a Hanover psychologist, Christoph M\u00f6ller, on the implications of Facebook resistance. \"The internet has become a natural part of life,\" is a translation of his comments which, circling the Facebook-minded world, have prompted a surge of speculation about what wilful withdrawal from that natural life might mean.</p> <p>For some amateur investigators, M\u00f6ller's words only confirmed suspicions aroused after the massacre, following internet searches into Holmes's online past or, rather, the outlandish lack of it. On the social media news website Mashable, its editor in chief, Lance Ulanoff, said he couldn't \"get over what an online ghost Holmes appears to be\".</p> <p>To date, however, the killer is still unidentified on Facebook and a very natural exultation among its professed addicts, following this confirmation of their superior mental health, has been accompanied, perhaps more surprisingly, by reports that Facebook use is now considered so overwhelmingly the norm that employers are more likely than not to consider documented history of online poking, boasting and friending to be a comforting sign of socialisation and professionalism.</p> <p>\"It's certainly unusual,\" a US psychologist told CBS of Holmes's online resistance, in an echo of the ostracism that threatens 12-year-old avoiders in a school where everyone else has \u2013 prematurely \u2013 signed up. Enthusiasts cite a study in which lack of internet use was associated, as much as overuse, with depression.</p> <p>Contrary to the dronings of Facebook resisters, who must now accept that we lie somewhere along the psychopathic continuum, young people in particular need to anticipate the reaction of a future employer who discovers, with incredulity that gives way only to suspicion and distrust, that an otherwise impressive candidate has recorded nothing online regarding their accumulation of friends, social life or holidays in fun destinations.</p> <p>This response to eccentricity, together with a human resource operative's inevitable irritation at finding nothing to report, can only increase as the warnings of Facebook sceptics are drowned by internet pundits proclaiming the backward-looking futility of resistance. Even after Facebook experienced slowing revenue growth, a London technology specialist at the law firm Charles Russell shrugged away doubters with: \"Everyone is using Facebook. Facebook has become a utility in our daily lives.\" For everyone who is anyone, presumably.</p> <p>For some businesses, not being patronised by an unspeakable mass murderer might not look like much of a plus. Equally, for others, being favourited by tyrants, criminals and the intimates of known killers does not seem to have done much damage. The reputation of Christian Louboutin, for instance, has survived the enthusiastic patronage of the designer's friend, Asma al-Assad. Christian Dior seems equally uncontaminated by pictures of the newbie dictator's wife, North Korea's Ri Sol-ju with her \u00a31,000 Dior purse. The absence of two leading psychopaths from Facebook appears, however, to be already translating into an uncovenanted, promotional gift to a company that can hardly avoid association with some of the online world's sadder extremes, still visualised by some of us as millions of little Julian Assanges, each immured in the greenish light of a darkened bedroom and wearing socks unchanged for three decades. Smugly, an army of Facebook users now reports that the smelly sock is on the other foot.</p> <p>Arriving so suddenly after children, in particular, have been routinely counselled to use Facebook infrequently and with enormous caution, thus protecting themselves from \u2013 to name some of the more obvious traps \u2013 obesity, time wasting, stalkers, bullying, invasion of privacy, bitching, hideous embarrassment, isolation, career damage and unwitting complicity in Zuckerberg's latest schemes for monetisation, Facebook's onset of health and normality is going to require some adjustment.</p> <p>But maybe parents will find it quite relaxing, if a child is biddable, to demand that it stops reading or playing and settles down nicely for a few hours of online activity of the sort historically pathologised by Susan Greenfield. Perhaps some of us have been too judgmental in the past about the wholesome exchange of youthful venom and embarrassing pictures. Even scepticism about Facebook's real mission \u2013 the commercial exploitation of private human relationships \u2013 should perhaps be overlooked, now that the place comes with this watertight guarantee: unpopular with two prominent psychopaths.</p> <p>Evidence on the back of the above factoid, that young avoiders could soon, if they are not already, be regarded as eccentric \"ghosts\", loners or privacy fetishists, is a more troubling victory for Zuckerberg. Already, with site after site only available via Facebook membership, the company's unstoppable colonisation of online information is surely more irksome, for a habitual resister, than the alleged social losses of missed birthdays and the addition of long-dead schoolmates to an impressive friends count.</p> <p>But far from generating significant resistance to a company whose eavesdroppings go beyond anything the <em>News of the World</em> ever dreamed of, this fusion of professional and personal information, along with the relevant advertising, only seems to generate more data-supplying conscripts, in line with Zuckerberg's signature notion of privacy, whereby anyone who prizes it above submission to his social network is not only pretentious, but dodgy. Just what is wrong with reclusives? \"Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity,\" the young moralist informed David Kirkpatrick in <em>The Facebook Effect</em>, a statement yet more uncompromising than Eric Schmidt's to critics of Google: \"If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it the first place.\"</p> <p>It's three years since Zuckerberg told Kirkpatrick: \"The days of you having a different image for your work friends and co-workers and for the other people you know are probably coming to an end pretty quickly.\" When people who resist this version of human identity are filed instantly under weird, that end appears to be pretty much here.</p>",
  "<p>Several days after it was broadcast, I still find myself still unsettled by the BBC2 Wonderland documentary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/09/young-bright-and-on-the-right?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><em>Young, Bright and on the Right</em></a>. It was about \"Tory Boys\" Joe (21, at Oxford) and Chris (19, at Cambridge), both struggling to get a footing in their respective university Conservative associations. Only they weren't actual Tory Boys, they were Tory Boy wannabes, Tory Boys who couldn't cut it, Tory Boys who weren't made of the \"right stuff\".</p> <p>I'm sure there are Labour near-equivalents (I fondly imagine Ed Miliband doing his PPE coursework in Jarrow March jammies), but would they be so stupid as to appear in a documentary as exposing as this? At first, I thought it was just community service for tragic freaks who thought they could rock a bow tie.</p> <p>Actually, it was sadder. Both the Tory Boy Wannabes (TBWs) were state educated (Joe from a single-parent family) and could only dream of Eton. Both had wardrobes and accents they thought passed for toff, but rather painfully didn't. Both were so busy scheming for power that it barely seemed to dawn on them that the door had already been locked, quite possibly from birth, and they were definitely on the wrong side of it.</p> <p>From there, this documentary was about their increasingly desperate efforts to gain access to the inner sanctum, where all their \"sins\" (Joe's dad sent to prison; coming from Yorkshire and Kettering) would be instantly cleansed.</p> <p>I've often thought that this must be the TBW dream \u2013 a kind of Bullingdon baptism, a sense of being \"born again\" into wealth and privilege. But how was this ever going to happen for these delusional misfits, who tried <em>too freaking hard</em>! You see how worked up I'm getting? The pathos swirling around these TBWs is killing me.</p> <p>For narrow-minded, sub-tribal people like myself (I try), Tories can be many things \u2013 nasty, unnerving, sometimes interesting or entertaining, but I draw the line at vulnerable. I don't want to deal with the question: \"What's sadder \u2013 Tory Boys or Tory Boy Wannabes\"?</p> <p>I resent worrying about Chris, who wished he'd gone to public school with \"like-minded people\" (I smell bullying); or Joe, who cried when he spoke of concealing his background. Then there were their lovely families \u2013 every member of them worth so much more than the floppy-fringed Oxbridge plums their sons were trying so hard to impress and infiltrate.</p> <p>In fact, in both cases, their backgrounds looked far more interesting than the unedifying blur of plotting and cringeing they'd made of life at university. Which perhaps is the point.</p> <p>If only they'd realised it, Joe and Chris were already better than the people they were so desperately trying to be. Both had done brilliantly, coming from state school to Oxbridge. Both had backgrounds, especially Joe's, that proved they could survive in the real world. The accents they were so busy trying to acquire were the same ones their old Etonian contemporaries would be hastily toning down if they got anywhere near a political career.</p> <p>In short, the triumph of Joe and Chris was that they were not your cookie-cutter (entitled, blinkered) Tory Boys; their tragedy was that they so desperately wanted to be. Was this immaturity or something else?</p> <p>Happily, by the end, both young men seemed to be wising up. However, perhaps the shadowlands of political power are full of people who never do. Not the alphas (the strutters and bullies). Rather, these funny little stale air pockets full of the nearly powerful. Political career-wannabes who spend every wretched waking hour, plotting and scheming \u2013 all just to fit in and look as though as they belong.</p> <p>It could be that this documentary slapped Joe and Chris awake, made them realise that, even before they arrived at university, they were worth more than the masks they'd donned. If only everybody in politics were so fortunate.</p> <h2>Even on a bad hair day, Naomi Campbell can weave her magic</h2> <p>Photographs of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/09/naomi-campbell-hair-exposes-bald-spot_n_1761999.html?1344548929\" title=\"\">Naomi Campbell'</a>s receding hairline have emerged. Said to be caused by weaves and hair extensions, the condition is known as <a href=\"http://www.traction-alopecia.com/\" title=\"\">traction alopecia</a>. It serves as a cautionary tale to those who choose to walk around with what is often somebody else's hair squatting on their head. Bizarre. If they wouldn't wear another woman's nail clippings, why would they wear their hair?</p> <p>Back to Naomi. The pictures were vicious but, simultaneously, an exercise in what we might call failed Schadenfraude. Sure, the scalp didn't look great.</p> <p>However, she still has the face and body that would make many women half her age shake fists at the gods and weep scalding, wistful tears.</p> <p>All of which explains why the Schadenfraude misfired. Women aren't going to gloat at a bad hair day when the rest of her looks like <em>that</em>. As in, someone in the skimpiest of bikinis, <em>sans</em> make up, who still manages to resemble a modern Aphrodite.</p> <p>Perhaps it's seasonal. Everywhere, women are starving, waxing and spraying themselves to ensure they aren't mistaken for the Gruffalo on the beach. Yet they're supposed to pause in all this to sneer at a natural beauty such as La Campbell. Unlikely.</p> <p>Go Naomi.

From spelling bees to texting bees \u2013 how far we've come. Actually, watching a clip of this year's event at Times Square, there was something terribly sweet about it. The competitors stood onstage texting with their \"game faces\" on, as if they were chess grandmasters or professional poker players.</p> <p>The winner was 17-year-old Austin Weirschke from Wisconsin who will be putting his $50,000 win into his college fund. Nice thumb-work, Austin.</p> <p>However, questions need to be asked. Was this texting of the old-school predictive variety where you'd press the same buttons, again and again, and it took about four days to write: \"I'm too old for this \u2013 kill me now with a large brick\"? Or were the competitors using the more manageable QWERTY keyboard models? It turns out to be the latter (which is cheating, guys), but let's not spoil the moment.</p> <p>No one could deny that the contestants were put through their paces with such challenges as high-speed texting, blindfold texting, hands-behind-back texting and, in what may have been a nod to the Ivy League universities, translation from text-speak and back again.</p> <p>Watching Weirschke hammering away, it wasn't exactly Jessica Ennis flying through the finishing line in the heptathlon, but an achievement is an achievement.</p> <p>Could texting be an Olympic event? There's no valid reason why activities such as throwing bits of sharpened wood (javelin) or lumps of iron (shot put) should be elevated above the championship texters, who gave their QWERTY all in Times Square. No good reason except it would make trained athletes look like total idiots, and that's curling's job.</p> <p>Another incentive for introducing texting to the Olympics is that, with British kids having been in permanent training since mobile phones were invented, we would be world-class. We would always be assured of winning at least one gold without even trying. We wouldn't even have to have selections \u2013 just put the latest lot from <em>Big Brother</em> into naff tracksuits and send them in.</p> <p>The government could continue sneakily selling off school playing fields, and the kids could sit in gyms text training instead.</p> <p>It's all making sense. The other countries might as well give up now. The Brits are coming \u2013 don't tell me that we're not world leaders in removing vowels.</p>",
  "<p>Consumers are being warned that the price of bacon will rise significantly next year as European producers quit the industry ahead of new laws governing animal welfare.</p> <p>The predicted decline in the number of European producers comes while many of their counterparts in the UK industry, who account for 40% of all domestic bacon sales, are battling to stay in business.</p> <p>Last week British pig farmers mounted a publicity drive to encourage consumers to buy British pork products. The National Pig Association warned that farmers who are responsible for as much as 10% of all British pig production will be forced to leave the industry by Christmas.</p> <p>The association blamed poor crop-growing conditions, particularly in the US, for a 25% rise in the cost of pig feed ingredients, which has meant many producers are unable to turn a profit.</p> <p>It claims that, if British pig farmers continue to leave the industry, around 1.5m rashers of British bacon and 2.3m British sausages a week will disappear from supermarket shelves.</p> <p>Sharp rises in pig feed prices are not new. There have been spikes in 2008 and 2011 due to poor weather. \"But what we are seeing now is a fundamental shift in grain prices going upwards,\" said NPA general manager Dr Zoe Davies.</p> <p>For the British consumer, soaring feed prices may not be a problem in the short term. High street rivalry is making supermarkets reluctant to pay farmers more to cover their extra costs of production. And empty spaces on supermarket shelves, caused by British producers quitting the industry, can be filled with imported bacon and sausages, which are often cheaper than British alternatives but do not adhere to stringent welfare standards.</p> <p>However, a partial ban on sow stalls, due to take effect throughout Europe from 1 January 2013, will have a major impact on the EU pig meat market, according to experts.</p> <p>BPEX, the body that represents the interests of pig producers, said that similar animal welfare legislation, which came into force at the start of this year, has caused serious disruption with the price of eggs up 75% compared with a year ago.</p> <p>BPEX warns that pig production is likely to fall by between 5% and 10% with the result that retailers will be face substantial price increases.</p> <p>Only three EU member states have reported that they comply with the new legislation. Several have already indicated that they expect a \"significant number\" of their producers to stop breeding pigs or allow their herds to run down.</p> <p>\"In the past, the UK was 40% self-sufficient for pork and 60% came from elsewhere,\" Davies said. \"But that is no longer going to be the case. We could soon see pork being imported from South America or Thailand if British producers go out of business.\"</p>",
  "<p>She blazed like an exotic firework across the skies of Westminster, before plummeting to the ground in what looked like an act of political suicide. Louise Mensch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/06/louise-mensch-resignation-letter\" title=\"\">announced </a>on Monday that two years after capturing Corby for the Conservatives, she has decided to stand down. Her loss is a blow to David Cameron, responsible for lighting Mensch's blue touchpaper, launching her on his unsuspecting party as one of his A-list of candidates.</p> <p>When Cameron became leader, the Conservatives were shamefully short of women MPs. As Boris Johnson had put it a few years earlier: \"The trouble with Tory associations is that they don't groove to chicks.\" Cameron tried to deal with this problem by assembling a list of candidates who had already had successful careers outside politics and about half of whom were women, and by coercing local Conservative associations into adopting these newcomers as candidates in winnable seats.</p> <p>Louise Bagshawe, as she was then, had made her name as an author of chick lit; the Conservatives in Corby, an eminently winnable seat, were prevailed upon to groove to her. Such manoeuvres caused immense resentment among Tories who felt they had for many years borne the heat and burden of the day, only to see a collection of minor celebrities enter the Commons after doing virtually no political work at all.</p> <p>John Hayes, chairman of the socially conservative Cornerstone Group of Tory MPs (motto: \"Faith, flag and family\"), denounced the A-list for containing \"people who spend too much time with the pseuds and posers of London's chichi set and not enough time in normal Britain\".</p> <p>However, it would be unfair to describe Mensch as insubstantial. She is a devout Roman Catholic, who has said she is so afraid of flying that she prays to Padre Pio, St Bernadette, St Vincent de Paul, St Louise and John Paul II. Since 1995, she has also published, under her maiden name, the following novels: <em>Career Girls</em>, <em>The Movie</em>, <em>Tall Poppies</em>, <em>Venus Envy</em>, <em>A Kept Woman</em>, <em>When She Was Bad\u2026</em>, and so the list goes on, reaching <em>Desire</em> (2010) and <em>Destiny</em> (2011).</p> <p>Just reading the titles is enough to make some of us feel a bit tired. Mensch is first and foremost a successful professional writer and has shown impressive industry. What's more, her work has not remained completely unchanging over the years. As one anonymous but generally appreciative critic said of the main characters in <em>A Kept Woman</em>: \"The chemistry between them simply sizzles, though Bagshawe, perhaps responding to a few criticisms of her earlier work, has reduced her sex scenes to three per book (rather than the 30 or so you get in her early work).\"</p> <p>If Mr Hayes is reading this, one can almost hear him snorting and saying that even such a dramatic reduction in the number of sex scenes in no way made Mensch suitable for the life of a Tory MP. But there is, oddly enough, a connection between her writing and her politics. For Mensch was inspired by Jeffrey Archer, a writer of bestsellers who was also for a time a highly influential figure in Tory politics.</p> <p>In a 2001 interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Mensch said of Archer's work: \"<em>Kane and Abel</em> is the best popular fiction of all time. As a kid, I wanted to be prime minister when I read <em>First Among Equals</em>. I love him. He's my hero.\"</p> <p>It was quite brave, or at least eye-catching, of Mensch to say this, for Archer was at this point in prison. But at this stage, she was not, as far as we know, contemplating a career in politics. Instead, she declared, with the candour that can make her such a rewarding interviewee: \"I want to retire very early, by the time I am 40, and go to live in Italy.\"</p> <p>Mensch is now 41 and is going to live in New York rather than Italy, but by leaving the Commons she has fulfilled her dream of retiring at an unusually early age. In 2001, she confided that she was already \"building up a portfolio of investments\" because she wanted to be free to decide what she was going to do: \"Money gives you the power to do whatever you want to do. I like the idea of being in complete control of my life.\"</p> <p>This is a fantasy. Money does not give you the power to do whatever you want to do. But without being a fantasist, Mensch could not have written so many books. In order to write like Archer, you have to be able to fantasise like Archer. You have to believe this stuff while you are writing it or you will never get beyond page three.</p> <p>Perhaps the simple truth about Mensch is that she is entirely sincere and has the capacity to believe in something while she is doing it. Her latest venture, which will presumably now receive more of her attention, is the social media site, named Menshn (just in case you might forget who runs it).</p> <p>In 1998, she announced that she was going to New York in search of a husband. Lo and behold, she managed to find one: an Italian-American property developer called Anthony LoCicero. They married in 2002 and had three children. But the couple separated in 2009 and she subsequently married Peter Mensch, a celebrated New York music industry figure she had known since she was a student at Oxford, who had helped her to find work in the music industry, and to whom she had dedicated her first novel.</p> <p>In 2006, she yielded to another fantasy to which no doubt she was sincerely attached at the time. She decided to become a Conservative MP, after which it could be expected that she would very soon rise to dizzying levels of power and influence. Thanks to Cameron's support, she became the candidate for Corby, an oddly mixed constituency, for as well as Corby \u2013 a former steel town which had drawn in thousands of Labour-voting Scottish immigrants \u2013 it includes a large tract of Tory-voting rural Northamptonshire. Mensch said the property there reminded her of the Cotswolds, but with the great advantage of being cheaper: \"I'm pleasantly surprised at what I can get for my money up here. It's fantastic.\"</p> <p>After her election in 2010, Mensch rapidly began to make a name for herself at Westminster. One admiring Tory described her to me as \"brave and brainy\". She brought a touch of glamour to a party that is still not rich in that quality and displayed a gift not just for publicity, but for asking incisive questions. When the culture, media and sport select committee interrogated Rupert and James Murdoch, Mensch helped to prevent the scene being dominated by Tom Watson, the Labour MP who had made much of the running in the attack on News International.</p> <p>Mensch also responded well when she was asked whether she had taken drugs while working, in her youth, in the music industry.</p> <p>She said this was \"highly probable\", and later added: \"I did serious drugs and it messed with my head. It's had long-term mental health effects on me. It's something that I regret incredibly.\" But Mensch also started to wonder if she was ever going to get promoted, asking in an interview (with <em>GQ</em>) in February: \"It's kind of annoying. What do I have to do to get promoted? Am I being disloyal?\"</p> <p>The answer to that question is now yes. By jumping ship, it could be argued she has let down everyone from Cameron to her local party. Corby will almost certainly go Labour again, which it might well have done at the general election expected in 2015, for Mensch does not appear to have taken as much trouble as she might have done to entrench herself in its people's affections. But for many, especially Tories, the decent thing would have been to wait until then to step down.</p> <p>By her own lights, Mensch has been honest. In words that could have come from one of her novels, she wrote: \"Dear Prime Minister, As you know, I have been struggling for some time to find the best outcome for my family life, and have decided, in order to keep us together, to move to New York\u2026\"</p> <p>No wonder a touch of asperity could be detected in Cameron's reply: \"It goes without saying that I had wished to see you serve for longer and at a more senior level.\"</p> <p>The prime minister had done all he could for her, only to find himself written out of the script. Mensch has already started a new story in which she sets sail from Westminster to conquer the New World.</p>",

The city's mayor, Eduardo Paes, who will take the torch from Boris Johnson, has vowed 2016 will be an Olympics like no other.</p> <p>Brazil is planning to spend \u00a313bn on public transport, construction and urban renewal projects \u2013 half as much again as London spent on its Games, but less than half the amount invested by Beijing.</p> <p>Set against a backdrop of golden beaches, lushly forested hills and lagoons lined with palm trees, the next Games has the potential to be among the most visually stunning ever staged.</p> <p>Copacabana, a must for sun-worshippers for decades, will host the swimming marathon, beach volleyball and kite surfing. Rowing will take place in the lagoon below the statue of Christ the Redeemer. The 82,000-capacity Maracan\u00e3 stadium, which staged the 1950 World Cup final, is being expensively refitted and \u2013 infuriating many local fans \u2013 gentrified by the addition of executive boxes. With golf due to return after a 110-year-absence, officials are also looking to ensure that a local course meets the standards of the organising committee.</p> <p>A bigger project is planned further along the coast, where an ex-Formula One track at Jacarepagu\u00e1 and several neighbourhoods are being demolished to make space for the Olympic Park. And, of course, the Sambadrome has been expanded so it can stage the start and finish of the marathon, as well as the archery competition.</p> <p>\"The Olympics is going to be much better than the Carnival,\" said Junior Faria, a local resident, as he picked up his daughter from the school inside the Sambadrome. \"It'll be a festival for the whole world.\"</p> <p>But where will they stay? Faced by a dire shortage of tourist beds (there are currently only 20,000), Rio has offered tax breaks and other incentives to encourage hotel operators to expand. The old port looks set to be the major beneficiary of government spending. As London used the Olympics to revitalise swaths of the East End, Rio plans to redevelop a 5m sq metre area in its long-neglected docklands. Whether everything on this and other projects will be completed on time remains to be seen.</p> <p>According to the local media, 41 of the 101 projects listed for the World Cup are still on the drawing board, prompting increasingly anguished warnings from Fifa about the slow pace of preparations. Olympic organisers say they are on schedule.</p> <p>But the World Cup and Olympic Games will also throw a light on some darker corners of national life. Crime is a major concern. Soon after Rio won the right to host the World Cup and Olympics, thousands of troops and police were dispatched to \"pacify\" the city's <em>favelas</em>. Residents near the Catumbi <em>favela</em>, which is close to the Sambadrome, say that they feel safer, but the problem of guns and drugs has been pushed out of sight rather than solved.</p> <p>Olympic organisers have also been accused by Amnesty and others of riding roughshod over residents' rights and cultural heritage in their rush to clear land for venues and hotels.</p> <p>The authorities stress that their actions are within the law. It is harder, however, to dismiss the endemic problem of corruption and maladministration. Watchdog groups say that the velodrome, built just five years ago for the Pan-American Games, may have to be demolished and rebuilt because it does not meet Olympic standards.</p> <p>The Maracan\u00e3 stadium is having to undergo another \u00a3280m facelift, which has been partly disrupted by a bribery scandal involving one the country's biggest construction companies, Delta.</p> <p>Britain and Brazil were at the same level in the medal table for Atlanta 1996, but there has been a big change since, due largely to UK lottery funding. Brazil's minister for sport, Aldo Rebelo, said his country would improve training programmes for athletes so that it could improve its podium performance, but stressed that the legacy of the Games was about more than medals and infrastructure projects.</p> <p>\"We want Brazil to be seen as a country that balances economic progress with social wellbeing,\" he said. \"This will be a very important message for the world.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 August to remove an incorrect reference to the Interlagos race track being demolished</p>",
  "<p>Russell Brand has no compunction about calling himself a junkie. \"When it comes to the disease of addiction I'm no different from any other addict,\" he says.</p> <p>The 37-year-old comedian was hooked on heroin during his 20s, eventually becoming clean through an abstinence-based recovery programme in 2002. But, in a BBC3 documentary to be aired on Thursday, he admits that he still struggles with his drugs cravings every day. In <em>Russell Brand: From Addiction to Recovery</em>, he is shown watching old footage of himself smoking heroin and admitting: \"I'm jealous of me then.\"</p> <p>Brand told the <em>Observer</em>: \"Without abstinence-based recovery, I'm a highly defective individual, prone to self-centredness, self-pity and self-destructive, grandiose behaviour. But if I seek the company and fellowship of other addicts and alcoholics \u2013 and, for me, alcoholism is no different from other facets of addiction \u2013 then, one day at a time, I have a chance of living free from this disease. I wouldn't be able to do it without that.\"</p> <p>Brand has become a high-profile advocate for the need to treat addicts through rehabilitation programmes, with the ultimate aim of making them drug-free. Current government policy is to prescribe users methadone, a synthetic opioid, in the hope that they will gradually be able to reduce their intake of illegal drugs without experiencing traumatic withdrawal symptoms.</p> <p>\"We might as well let people carry on taking drugs if they're going to be on methadone,\" Brand says. \"Obviously it's painful to abstain, but at least it's hope-based.\"</p> <p>According to a report published last year by the <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/publications/reports/breaking-the-habit/\" title=\"\">Centre for Policy Studies</a>, a rightwing thinktank, the annual cost of maintaining methadone treatment and paying benefits to Britain's 320,000 problem drug users is estimated at \u00a33.6bn.</p> <p>Abstinence-based recovery programmes are more expensive upfront, but Brand argues the cost would be recouped by the subsequent fall in crime levels and prison populations once addicts are free of their habit. Results are patchy, however. The national average for post-rehab recovery is under 30% six years after treatment.</p> <p>\"It's not enough to legislate against taking drugs,\" Brand explains. \"We should aim to regard this as a health issue rather than a criminal issue \u2026 That's why I suppose decriminalisation is important \u2013 I don't see it as a central tenet of what we're trying to do, but I suppose attitudinally it's significant.\"</p> <p>What about those critics who claim that by labelling drug addiction as an illness, users are shirking individual responsibility? \"If you say people that have polio are weak and shouldn't be given crutches or medicine, it's not a very kind way to regard a problem,\" Brand replies.</p> <p>He insists that addiction can be tackled only by addressing the root causes. For Brand, drugs were an escape from a troubled upbringing: the child of divorced parents, he was sexually abused by a neighbour at the age of seven and suffered from bulimia in his teens. There was, Brand says, \"an emptiness inside, a sadness, a loneliness, an unaddressed pain at the core of alienation. Unless you have some mechanism to deal with that, I think you'll deal with it with various forms of anaesthetic, starting with drugs and perhaps ending with shopping.</p> <p>\"I know it must sound absurd to people who aren't drug addicts, but it just seemed preposterous the idea of not taking drugs. I couldn't imagine a coping strategy outside of it and that's why there does need to be programmes \u2026 The recovery is contingent upon unity [with other addicts]. I think that's a key component. I don't think it's something we can do on our own.\"</p> <p>Brand was put on a recovery programme after his agent, John Noel, found him taking heroin in the toilet at an office Christmas party 10 years ago. Brand checked into <a href=\"http://www.focus12.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Focus 12</a>, an independent charity that runs a 12-week rehabilitation programme in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, overseen by chief executive Chip Somers, who is himself a former heroin addict.</p> <p>Somers says: \"The beauty of the methadone programme is that it's really easy. You just dish it out. End of story \u2026 It's a way of shutting up a large population of drug addicts and keeping them out of the way instead of having to engage with people and do things differently.\"</p> <p>Brand believes that politicians struggle to understand the true nature of addiction: \"I think this issue, perhaps like no other, represents a disjunct between the government and the people they govern.\"</p> <p>In April, Brand appeared in front of a home affairs committee examining government drugs policy and called for \"more compassion\" in the way we treat addicts. He is on record as never having voted \u2013 does he believe his intervention made a difference?</p> <p>\"I think it was probably part of the spectacle of pretending to do something about it.</p> <p>\"But we'll see, won't we? Because perhaps legislation will change.\"</p> <p>Did any of the MPs ask for his autograph?</p> <p>\"Keith Vaz did,\" says Somers. \"He said: 'My daughters will never forgive me if I don't get your autograph.'\"</p> <p>Brand snorts. \"Your daughters won't forgive you anyway, Keith,\" he riffs. \"The chance of forgiveness from your daughters has long passed. The only chance of that ever happening was contraception. \u2026 They [politicians] don't know what they're doing. They don't understand the reality of the way people use drugs. They don't understand how to treat drugs. They don't understand how to legislate around drugs. It's just ignorance.\"</p> <p>There is a pause, then a grin: \"I don't blame them because when you're dealing with addicts, they are total arseholes. But they're here to stay, so we've got to find a system of dealing with them.\"</p> <p>At the nadir of his own addiction, Brand admits he was \"a nightmare\" to be around. He lost friends, money and jobs (he was sacked from his first presenting role for MTV when he came to the studio the day after 9/11 dressed as Osama bin Laden). What was the worst thing he did to feed his addiction?</p> <p>\"Took me Nan's pension,\" he says. \"That's quite bad, isn't it?\"</p> <p>Yet heroin held \u2013 and continues to hold \u2013 an allure. When asked to describe the drug to someone who has never experienced it, he recounts an occasion when he accidentally heated the swimming pool at his home in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"I'd been working out and expected to jump into a cold swimming pool,\" he says. \"I jumped in and it was hot. And when I was going into it, it was like this sort of involuntary, contorting, releasing spasm. I just drifted around, floating listlessly and lifelessly underwater in uteral bliss: pre-birth, pre-every single problem you ever had; before the negative coding and the nonsense lands in your mind, there is perfect, snug, brown bliss.\"</p> <p>There is a brief moment of silence.</p> <p>\"A heated swimming pool,\" he says, with a derisive shake of the head. \"I'm so out of touch.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2012. We originally wrote that the BBC3 documentary was to be aired on Saturday, it is in fact Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Emmott is an unlikely candidate for a star of a sell-out London theatre hit. He currently uses crutches after recently losing a disc in his spine and until last month he had never trod the boards. Yet the 52-year-old academic has just completed a majestic run at the Royal Court. For the past three weeks, he has filled the seats of the company's Jerwood Theatre Upstairs with audiences, mostly young, flocking to see his solo performances of <em>Ten Billion</em>, a brutal but careful dissection of the likely impact of humanity's swelling numbers on our planet.</p> <p>People queuing for return tickets have been turned away in their dozens and a restaging of the show now looks inevitable, possibly in the Royal Court's main theatre next year. Emmott, a professor of computational science at Oxford University and head of Microsoft's Computational Science laboratory in Cambridge, has also been besieged with offers from TV companies and documentary makers who want to put his work on screen. We have not seen the last of <em>Ten Billion</em>, it would seem.</p> <p>And that can only be good news. <em>Ten Billion</em> \u2013 a co-operation between Emmott and the distinguished director Katie Mitchell, whose past works have included <em>A Woman Killed With Kindness</em> at the National Theatre \u2013 is the most effective theatrical work that has attempted to illustrate our planet's environmental woes that I have seen. It is spare, chilling, moving and cunningly staged and unravels with compelling, impeccable logic.</p> <p>Forget the hunt for the Higgs boson, Emmott tells audiences. Scientists may think that this was the greatest experiment ever performed, but it is nothing compared to the one humanity is now carrying out on our own planet as we pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, melt icecaps, destroy precious ecosystems and eradicate species in their thousands. The end result is \"one of the most disturbing evenings I have ever spent in a theatre,\" wrote the <em>Guardian</em>'s Michael Billington.</p> <p>By contrast, previous theatrical attempts to tackle the issues of global warming, rising sea levels and the ecological mayhem we face have been confused and tame. The National Theatre's <em>Greenland</em>, staged last year, was chaotic and unfocused, for example, while the Bush's <em>The Contingency Plan</em>, a double bill by Steve Waters, although highly enjoyable and intelligently written, only touched on the depth of the crisis we face.</p> <p>Certainly neither work produced the gasps that greeted the close of Emmott's <em>Ten Billion</em>. We face a future in which billions will starve, he states. Britain, which could come off relatively lightly when 6C rises in global temperature take effect, will be turned into a military outpost dedicated to preventing waves of immigrants reaching our shores. (Disturbingly, senior army officers have recently become a common sight at climate conferences, says Emmott, although this at least suggests that the military perceives the dangers we face, even if politicians do not.)</p> <p>So can we do anything to halt the devastation that lies ahead? Emmott asks as he reaches the end of his show. \"In truth, I think we are already fucked,\" is his answer. Then he quotes the response he got when he asked one of his younger colleagues what measures he planned to take to ward off the worst effects of the mayhem that lies ahead. \"Teach my son how to use a gun,\" he was told. Cormac McCarthy would be proud.</p> <p>The fact we have had to wait so long for a stage production that effectively tackles the most important issue now facing our species \u2013 the destruction of Earth's entire ecosystem \u2013 is perhaps surprising. The theatre has never shied away from facing up to hard or awkward subjects as the Royal Court's history attests. Edward Bond's <em>Saved</em> \u2013 an attack on modern poverty in which a baby is stoned to death \u2013 was first staged here in 1965, while Bruce Norris's scorching indictment of middle-class racism, <em>Clybourne Park</em>, had its UK premiere at the Royal Court two years ago.</p> <p>So why the lack of dramatic action when it comes to planetary degradation? The answer has much to do with the complex nature of the subject. When you are trying to outline the impact of swelling populations, rising middle-class aspirations, increases in carbon dioxide outputs and melting icecaps, the issues of character and narrative can get confused. <em>Ten Billion</em> succeeded by simply avoiding them. There is no action.</p> <p>Emmott merely stands in front of a desk within a set that is a recreation of his own office, right down to the slowly ageing tangerine that he has left in one corner. \"I am a scientist, not an actor \u2013 as will quickly become clear,\" he announces. Then he proceeds with his analysis with the help of some neat video graphics. The result is more lecture than play, though I would argue that this is a perfectly reasonable theatrical mechanism, one that has been deployed recently in London by the Tricycle theatre in its staging of the public inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case and by the Finborough theatre in its depiction of recent events in Syria.</p> <p>In Emmott's case, his main concern is the ecological costs that underlie our daily lives: the billions of barrels of oil drilled each year, the billions of passenger miles flown and billions of tonnes of carbon pumped into the atmosphere. Two years ago, Russia halted its grain exports after its harvest failed. As a result, there were food riots in many countries, including several in the Middle East. The Arab Spring erupted in their wake. Today, an even greater harvest failure is threatened in the United States, where scorching temperatures have devastated crops. The implications for civil unrest across the planet are profound. Add to this the prospect of even greater temperature rises, triggered by increasing emissions of greenhouse gases that are in turn fed by our undiminished urge to burn fossil fuels and you begin to get a feel for the troubles we face. Populations are soaring but our capacity to feed ourselves is dwindling as the heat is turned up on our planet.</p> <p>There is nothing explicitly new in this analysis. What is fresh is its measured, uninterrupted exposition. Emmott remains remarkably calm throughout his performance although you can still sense his concealed fury at our failure to take action. There are no Paxmans to quibble over details and no climate gainsayers to make arcane or inaccurate objections. And that is the real lesson of <em>Ten Billion</em>. Without the clamorous voices of climate change deniers who constantly question the minutiae of scientists' research or cherry-pick data, Emmott has shown that it is possible to make a straightforward, telling demonstration of the dreadful problems we face. We need a lot more sober, pithy work like this.</p> <p>Emmott believes it is too late now to prevent our planet burning. Others, myself included, believe there is still time to take action. Making sure that the message of <em>Ten Billion</em> is not lost would be a very good starting point.</p>",
  "<p>The jury is out on Benjamin Lawsky. Is he an Eliot Ness figure calling the banking mob to account, or another hot-shot lawyer with eyes on a bigger political prize?</p> <p>Lawsky is head of New York's recently created financial services regulator, which operates out of the attorney general's office. This office has form. The two previous attorney generals, Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo, both became governor thanks largely to their insatiable appetite for bringing down the wrongdoers of Wall Street.</p> <p>Before his downfall Spitzer earned the moniker \"the sheriff of Wall Street\" as he exposed a host of institutions, including Merrill Lynch for mis-selling products to clients that it's own analysts knew would fail. Cuomo, meanwhile \u2013 with Lawsky in his inner circle of advisers \u2013 accused Bank of America executives of fraud, claiming that during the takeover of Merrill Lynch they hid billions of dollars in losses at the firm from shareholders. After the takeover Bank of America, which denies the allegations, received a second bailout from Washington.</p> <p>The nickname Ben \"long-arm-of-the\" Lawsky is already gaining currency.</p> <p>The 42-year-old keen marathon runner is the grandson of immigrants from Nazi Germany. He was born on a navy base in San Diego before moving to Pittsburgh, where he grew up with his twin sister. Originally hoping to become an architect, he switched to law, graduating with honours from Columbia Law school. Afterwards he took up a clerk's position with two Republican federal judges before moving to Washington to work in the Justice Department. He first made a name for himself in 1999 as counsel to a Democrat senator, where he honed his skills of delicately balancing policy, politics and the press, feeding interesting stories with fiery language to Capitol Hill's hungry journalists.</p> <p>Later he became a New York prosecutor, gaining a fearsome reputation for prosecuting terrorists, drugs barons and public officials with an aggression more suited to a Hollywood courtroom drama.</p> <p>It was here that he got his first taste for Wall Street blood after prosecuting an insider-trading scheme that involved using advance copies of <em>Businessweek</em> from the printing presses, tips from a Merrill Lynch analyst and insider knowledge on a Reebok takeover before it was public.</p> <p>In 2006 he could have followed the path of fellow lawyers and gone into the private sector, but instead he joined the then attorney general Cuomo. He quickly rose through the ranks to eventually become Cuomo's chief of staff.</p> <p>When Cuomo became New York governor last year, Lawsky could have moved on with him, but stayed where he was. He was unanimously named the first superintendent of the state's first department of financial services.</p> <p>The $144,000 (\u00a392,000) a year job came complete with a corner office on the sixth floor of the downtown Manhattan offices, overlooking the Staten Island ferry terminal.</p> <p>Most New Yorkers expect to see the name of Lawsky, who is said to have a ferocious work ethic, on a ballot paper in the not-too-distant future.</p>",
  "<p>I couldn't help but cynically raise my eyebrows when Benjamin Lawsky, the state of New York's first superintendent of financial services, claimed Standard Chartered was a rogue institution for breaching sanctions on Iran. It was not because I have an informed view on whether or not Standard Chartered has been acting in such a grossly negligent fashion, but due to the fact that New York politicians have a long history of building their political careers off the backs of prosecuting the banking industry for misdeeds. The risk departments of all banks operating in the US zone are well aware of this fact and routinely report that such prosecutions could take place.So I guess Labour MP John Mann's suggestion that US regulators are out to get London as the world financial capital, in order to build up New York's reputation, has to be viewed with an equal measure of scepticism.</p> <p>Probably the better question for everyone is to ask: is it possible for cultures of big global banking groups to operate to a singular good business agenda? If not, is the enormous size of the banks that have caused so much havoc another reason to consider breaking up the large banks so that they can concentrate on performing certain financial services functions to the highest standards possible?</p> <p>What the various US regulators' investigations into Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered have in common is that they involve numerous businesses operating all over the world. HSBC and Standard Chartered have found themselves in trouble through some of their subsidiary companies that have transacted business through the US.</p> <p>It is one thing to operate a bank in a single jurisdiction and comply with that country's regulations and law, but global businesses operating in a multitude of jurisdictions have an extraordinary web of requirements and legal codes to acknowledge in their decision-making. In my own career, the senior and mid-level management debates about how to comply with certain regulatory and standards began more than 20 years ago as many OECD-member nations and others began the first stages of a crackdown on banks used to launder drug money and proceeds of other crimes. More than 10 years ago sanctions against helping certain countries such as Iran carry out day-to-day business in the global financial markets became part of our working lives too, as did watch lists of politically exposed individuals. When these actions began in the 1990s, bankers would complain that it was insulting to ask a client for identification. They would say it was impossible to verify the address of residents of the Middle East because they only had post office boxes. Knowing the source of a client's funds became a huge issue and still is because money launderers are sophisticated and know the loopholes, and impatient bankers just want the accounts open so that business can be conducted and they can, in turn, earn bonus revenue.</p> <p>But still, any banking leader working in this industry for more than 20 years should be able to see that they can only earn revenue from good business and should have been actively working to shed themselves of any dodgy money associated with corruption, crime and terrorism. While not all the jurisdictions have exactly the same regulations and laws, regulators and lawmakers in financial centres from New York to London, Paris, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Sydney, Johannesburg, as well as a number of smaller jurisdictions have all been saying: \"Banks, you are not above the law, you must make your businesses comply with our requirements \u2013 there is no debate \u2013 otherwise there will be consequences.\"</p> <p>I am certain that regulators are now looking at the global operations of big banks to make certain they have everyone operating to the highest standard. This is all the more reason why such large businesses might consider selling off or closing down the business lines that are too difficult to make compliant, no matter the consequence to a bank's income.</p> <p><em>Robert Taylor is a member of several corporate and institutional boards and former chief executive of Kleinwort Benson</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>London 2012 Olympics</strong> (BBC channels) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>Last Monday in the Olympic Stadium I saw Jennifer Suhr soar and Nadzeya Ostapchuk chuck. These historic events I witnessed not from the privileged media seats, with their finish-line view of the athletes, but in the squinting punters' section, from which vantage point the lithe American pole vaulter appeared barely distinguishable from the strapping Belarusian shot-putter.</p> <p>And as I sat shivering under cold-damp skies, along with the other 80,000 lucky spectators, I experienced an epiphany: I'd much rather be at home watching on television. Say what you like about Gary Lineker's taxing puns and Colin Jackson's banal <em>emphases</em>, but there are few pleasures more gratifying than studying extreme physical effort close-up from the stretched-out comfort of one's own sofa.</p> <p>I say stretched out, although of course I sat up when Michael Johnson was talking.&#xa0;Partly out of respect for his studiously informed opinion, but mostly due to fear. Something about Johnson's demeanour makes the drill sergeant in <em>Full Metal Jacket</em> seem like Graham Norton.</p> <p>Perhaps it's his posture. Ramrod straight during his magnificent running days, his spine could still centre the bubble in a spirit level. The effect certainly focuses the attention. Both his fellow pundits, Jackson and Denise Lewis, are noticeably more anxious in the great man's company, as though at any given moment they expect him to tell them to: \"Drop and give me 20!\"</p> <p>This may account for the pair's tendency to lose verbal control during moments of high drama or, come to that, when asked a question by the silvery-smooth John Inverdale. It was Inverdale who rather cattily pointed out why Jackson wouldn't cut it as a commentator, by running the film of the former champion hurdler flicking his fingers and screaming: \"Look at what's his name!\" and \"Here comes the big man!\" during the men's 100m final.</p> <p>\"All of these antics going on,\" complained Johnson. \"Calm down.\"</p> <p>When everyone had calmed down, we learned that \"what's his name\" and \"the big man\" referred to Yohan Blake and Usain Bolt, respectively the runner-up and winner of arguably the finest 100m ever staged.</p> <p>Oh yes, the sport, which has managed to be both epic and intimate \u2013 global in its scale but human in its sensibility. If there hasn't been a lot of record-breaking, the Games have been well-served by memory-making. The images of victory and defeat \u2013 designations often decided by the length of an ant \u2013 will remain charged with emotive power for many years to come.</p> <p>If it's true that the BBC has pursued personal stories with the pushy conviction of a \"real life\" weekly magazine, it's also true that these triumphs over tragedy \u2013 such as Laura Trott's overcoming debilitating childhood asthma to win gold \u2013 have been genuinely inspiring.</p> <p>Equally, some might see an almost sadistic interest in tears, with the placing of cameras and inquisitors in front of overwrought athletes who can scarcely breathe, let alone talk. But the result, far from being sport's answer to Oscar night lachrymosity, has most often provided a moist glimpse of the exceptional emotional commitment required, win or lose, to go for gold.</p> <p>In any case, weeping is now a recognised component of the narrative arc of competition, to be slotted in alongside the other familiar rituals: the pre-event strut and camera stare, the after-win air-punching and track-kissing, and most essential of all, the post-race chat with Phil.</p> <p>Phil Jones's trackside interviews have taken many forms, from the confessional to the curt, depending on the performance and nationality of the athlete. But few are the British competitors who have escaped with their necks or shoulders unblemished by the tactile Jones's avuncular attentions. No matter the result, he's been there, asking them ingenious variations on that abiding televisual concern: how does it feel?</p> <p>The answer hasn't always been uplifting. When 400m runner Martyn Rooney started talking about losing a life to training, after failing to qualify for the final, you got a sense of the unrewarded sacrifice that the great majority of athletes face. While Jones has done a commendable job in treating the two impostors of triumph and disaster with the same hearty embrace, his work has been made considerably easier by the unusual preponderance of British triumphs.</p> <p>For veterans of the kind of Olympic coverage in which a plucky seventh place finish in the women's synchronised swimming traditionally occasioned Shakespearean outpourings of pride, this new way of doing things, apparently known as winning, takes a little getting used to.</p> <p>Pessimism is not easily excised from the soul. Even after Super Saturday some broadcasters still had trouble adjusting to the new reality. With Andy Murray two sets up and leading 4-2 in the third in the tennis final against Roger Federer, Andrew Castle gathered himself to sound a note of jubilation. \"This is\u2026\" he began promisingly, in a suitably elevated register. But the poor man could go no further. The decades of defeat had taken their toll, reducing him to a superstitious silence. \"Well,\" he lamely concluded, \"let's not say anything.\"</p> <p>That's not a temptation to which the amiable Jackson is ever likely to fall victim. When lost for a means of developing his point, he simply repeated whatever superlative he happened to be uttering until the next event was ready to begin.</p> <p>Left to speak for itself, sport can be surprisingly eloquent, but it does need the right context. For some of the most enjoyable team sports in this Olympics \u2013 handball, for example, and hockey \u2013 that context has in the past tended to be Eurosport at about 2am, possibly as a result of drunkenly entering the wrong channel number in the remote.</p> <p>Given the leg-up of gold medal significance and the BBC, these extraterrestrial staples have presented a welcome respite from the national obsession of football, just as the smiling&#xa0;humility of their participants has made a telling contrast with the surly prima donnas who dominate the Premier League.</p> <p>Yet as the games draw to a close today and the TV schedules return to some kind of normality (celebrity cook-offs, celebrity gardening, celebrity football), what will linger longest in the imagination, a year on from the riots, is the dreamy sense of national unity across class, race and religious barriers that has characterised the past fortnight, right from the inclusive vision of Danny Boyle's spectacular opening ceremony.</p> <p>On the whole, allowing for the occasional and forgivable lapse into jingoism, the BBC has judged the mood well, without shying away from contentious questions. During the build-up to Thursday night's 200m final, in which Bolt confirmed his status as a true great, Inverdale introduced two sharp and thoughtful short films, one about the black power salutes of the 1968 Olympics, and the other on black sprinters, eugenics and the slave trade.</p> <p>A studio discussion followed in which Jackson and Johnson both made sound arguments that African-Caribbean and African American dominance of sprinting, as far as science is currently concerned, has more to do with nurture than nature. What was most pleasing about the brief digression is that it both addressed and transcended the issues of race and racism, and in the process only further contributed to the poignant celebration of human diversity that has been London 2012.</p> <p>What will be its legacy? So far the most authentic answer has come from the misleadingly named showjumper, Scott Brash. Asked by Clare Balding, who has enjoyed a stand-out Games, how a gold medal at his first Olympics will change his life, Brash gave a sleepy-eyed, toothy grin and replied in an unexpectedly gritty Scots accent: \"Well, I really hope it improves, eh, my pulling power with women, to be honest with you.\"</p> <p>Long may the Olympic flame keep burning.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes a show has \"a good Edinburgh\". Enthusiastic early houses and then, by week two, strips of critical testimony stapled to its flyers (\"Bravo!\"). By week four its name is a murmured magic word in ticket queues, and perpetual sell-outs are triumphantly announced on venue chalkboards. These shows often return to the festival a year later for a conquerors' tour \u2013 the fringe equivalent of an FA Cup bus parade, or a war party's slow march through town with severed heads on spears. Dance-based weepy <a href=\"http://www.theatreadinfinitum.co.uk/productions/translunar-paradise-2011/\" title=\"\"><em>Translunar Paradise</em></a>, the big theatre hit 12 months ago, is now back in Edinburgh for a month-long run. Two other notable returnees are <a href=\"http://www.blindsummit.com/The%20Table.htm\" title=\"\"><em>The Table</em></a>, by Blind Summit, and <a href=\"http://www.mrbunk.com/PUPPETS/SWAMP_JUICE.html\" title=\"\"><em>Swamp Juice</em></a>, the work of Canadian Jeff Achtem. Both great successes in 2011, and both puppet shows.</p> <p>Puppets won plaudits last year, which might explain why the fringe today is saturated with them. They seem to appear in everything \u2013 looming from behind the fake furniture and clambering out of innocuous-looking on-set boxes; playing supporting characters, taking central roles. How long till actors' unions mobilise?</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/boris-sergeys-vaudevillian-adventure\" title=\"\"><strong>Boris and Sergey's Vaudevillian Adventure</strong></a>, which I watched last week at the Pleasance Courtyard, a pair of featureless bunraku puppets (operated by black-clad members of the Flabbergast Theatre company) staged an amusing variety act. Everything was miniaturised, so the puppets' rendition of a Kate Bush song \u2013 complete with giddy dance \u2013 was performed on a baize-topped poker table. A small fireworks display was orchestrated with party poppers. It was fun.</p> <p>Moodier was <a href=\"http://www.edcomfest.com/TheFantasist/\" title=\"\"><strong>The Fantasist</strong></a>, a mid-morning drama at Underbelly Bristo Square that made tricksy exploration of mental illness. Puppets big and small tormented a central player, Louise, who was slowly losing her hold on reality. <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/grit\" title=\"\"><strong>Grit</strong></a>, at the Bedlam theatre, was a study of war, deploying puppets of varying completion and polish to create scenes of conflict. At one point, a little boy, immaculately sculpted from plaster, was manipulated through a first encounter with guerrilla fighters in Uganda. Later, deliberately infantile cardboard cutouts summoned a very grown-up encounter between the military and members of the public in Sarajevo. This striking production, by Tortoise in a Nutshell, ran just 45 minutes, and packed huge invention into that time. I wanted more.</p> <p>My favourite moment of puppetry took place during the otherwise all-human <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/rubies-in-the-attic\" title=\"\"><strong>Rubies in the Attic</strong></a>. A clever show at the Assembly Roxy, it borrowed the stylings of a throwback cabaret production, the central female quartet dressed in burlesque garb and each taking turns to sing, tell a story, or play the sop in jokes. Beyond the lipstick and the jazz hands, though, unusual ambition was evident. Instead of the haggard supper-club skits so often strung together and brought to Edinburgh as cabaret hours (standard run-down: hula hooping, cover song, strangely chaste stripping finale), <em>Rubies in the Attic</em> was a celebration of ancestry. Each of the players put on a dramatic number about a relative.</p> <p>So we learned about a war-hardened farming couple, then a decadent Brit with a penchant for bald men. An atmospheric ballad celebrated the bravery of a love-shocked Italian immigrant, climbing aboard a steamer while pregnant with the singer's mother. Another song told of an unlucky eastern European tailor who thought he was emigrating somewhere warm, instead getting plonked in late-Victorian London. His subsequent plight, that of many penniless Jewish immigrants, was portrayed with a human-shaped knot of fabric, wobbled back and forth over a row of piled-up suitcases. For me, puppet fatigue had long ago set in, but the scene was still crafted tenderly enough to make me want to bawl.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/sewing-machine?day=03-08-2012&amp;performance=3:2572\" title=\"\"><strong>The Sewing Machine</strong></a>, a one-woman show at the Assembly George Square, the conceit of <em>Rubies in the Attic</em> was reversed. Not romantic twentysomethings, idealising the ancestral line. Instead a gnarled 81-year-old, Magdaleen, played by the South African Sandra Prinsloo, considered the lives of her children and grandchildren with tested affection, even disappointment.</p> <p>Scriptwriter Rachelle Greeff and director Hennie van Greunen never tried to soften Magdaleen or make her more palatable to a 21st-century audience. She was drily funny and won quick sympathy as she huffed and tottered around a care home, preparing tea with old-fashioned attentiveness. But there was a lot to dislike about a character whose feelings towards South Africa's black population were plainly expressed. Magdaleen lived for most of her life in a society where apartheid was law, and as a white, well-off farmer's wife she was bemused: why the need to dismantle the system? We learned that Magdaleen's outmoded racial epithets were a source of conflict between her and her children. \"They bother me about my language,\" she complained, \"I who taught <em>them</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;talk.\"</p> <p>Later, recalling a horrible family tragedy (a scene performed with room-stilling majesty by Prinsloo), the character was brought closest to understanding the folly of arbitrary social division. But, finally, the major lesson Magdaleen seemed to garner from her 81 years was that other people, even beloved family members, should not be relied upon for contentment. Safer to place faith in inanimate objects \u2013 in Magdaleen's case, an old Swiss sewing machine. To this stolid, silent confidant she confessed her miserable story. A must-see, truly.</p> <p>As was my favourite show of the week, <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk/edinburgh/events/dirty-great-love-story\" title=\"\"><strong>Dirty Great Love Story</strong></a>, a romantic comedy that was deftly conjured without prop or undue pizazz by co-writers Richard Marsh and Katie Bonna. Likable characters and a consistent lightness of touch made this hour at the Pleasance Dome so satisfying. And the show had a deeper-lying seam too, that seemed to mirror ideas explored in <em>The Sewing Machine</em>.</p> <p>How best to cope with diminished expectations in life, in love? By cracking jokes, for one. <em>Dirty Great Love Story</em> presented us with two quick-witted heroes \u2013 Rich and Katie, both eager for romance having stumbled on to the hostile borderland between their 20s and 30s, single. Tipped together one night by drunken fortune, their wheeling relationship was tested by misunderstandings, misfiring humour, meddlesome friends, and too many nights on the town gone wrong.</p> <p>Booze, we all know, \"gives access to yes\", which helped these clumsy lovers get together in the first place. But sober they kept bungling opportunities, and it was left ambiguous whether the pair were really right for each other, or whether this love story was a dirty one because it was faintly discoloured by compromise. \"Love realistically\" was the final message. As with <em>The Sewing Machine</em>, candour raised the production above the commonplace.</p> <p>And by the way: no puppets in either. Not a limb, not a string, and absolutely no squeaky voices. Instead, simple human stories, unfettered. I'd love to see both shows earn valedictory return tours next year. The next few weeks will decide that \u2013 but hopefully there are a few words, here, that can be stapled to flyers to help. Bravo, brilliant, encore, all that.</p>",
  "<p>One of my favourite essays is <a href=\"http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_mac_vs_pc.html\" title=\"\">Umberto Eco's 1994 newspaper column</a> about the difference between the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC. \"The world is divided,\" he wrote, \"between users of the Macintosh computer and users of MS-DOS compatible computers. I am firmly of the opinion that the Macintosh is Catholic and that DOS is Protestant \u2026 [The Macintosh] is cheerful, friendly, conciliatory; it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step to reach \u2013 if not the kingdom of heaven \u2013 the moment in which their document is printed. It is catechistic: The essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons. Everyone has a right to salvation.\"</p> <p>I love this essay because it captures an essential truth about Apple. It is indeed like the \"one holy, Catholic and apostolic\" church because it offers salvation in return for total submission. Stick to the Apple Way, it says, and ye shall be saved. The wretched users of Microsoft-powered computers, in contrast, have to find their own way to salvation, installing anti-virus and operating system updates, finding printer drivers and enduring other annoyances.</p> <p>Until recently, however, Apple's escalator to paradise stopped short of the heavens. The company lacked a credible cloud-computing offering. But then in 2011 came <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/\" title=\"\">iCloud</a>, an online storage service that allows users to store their music files on Apple server farms for download to all the iDevices (iPod, iPad, iPhone) and Macintosh computers they own. It also acts as a data-syncing service for email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, to-do lists, and other data. As of now, iCloud has more than 150 million subscribers.</p> <p>Here's the proposition. Most Apple customers seem to have lots of disposable income, and so tend to have multiple iDevices. A typical worshipper might have, for example, a Mac laptop plus an iPad and an iPhone. Each of these devices enables him or her to use email, manage address books and calendars, browse the web, take and upload photographs, download and listen to music, and so on. So what if every single bit of data on all your devices could be securely backed up in the cloud? What if everything you had written, photographed, filmed or downloaded on any iDevice could be automatically available on all your devices? And \u2013 to top everything \u2013 if one of your iDevices was stolen, wouldn't it be great to be able to remotely track \u2013 and disable \u2013 it?</p> <p>Yes to all of that. Most of the iCloud users of my acquaintance seem very happy with it. No more worrying about back-ups, or having out-of-date calendars on different devices. In return for an annual subscription, the great Church of Apple takes away the existential angst about data security that plagues less fortunate folks. And for as long as they stay within the enfolding arms of the Church, that blissful state will continue. That this is rather too good to be true should have been obvious to even the meanest intelligence, but it took a personal disaster last week finally to explode the illusion that single-church, cloud-based systems are the answers to everyone's prayers.</p> <p>The victim was a well-known technology journalist and iCloud subscriber named Mat Honan. \"In the space of one hour\", <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\" title=\"\">he reported</a>, \"my entire digital life was destroyed. First my Google account was taken over, then deleted. Next my Twitter account was compromised, and used as a platform to broadcast racist and homophobic messages. And worst of all, my AppleID account was broken into, and my hackers used it to remotely erase all of the data on my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.\"</p> <p>Note that last sentence. Honan was playing with his young daughter when he noticed that his iPhone had gone dead. He rebooted it to find that it was asking him for a four-digit Pin. He doesn't have one.</p> <p>Attackers got control of Honan's Apple account by first taking advantage of a flaw in one of Amazon's systems, which gave them the last four digits of his credit card number. That and an email address was all that was needed to persuade Apple's customer support people to hand over control of his account. After that iCloud did its stuff. The only problem was that it wasn't doing it for Mat Honan any more.</p> <p>Amazon has now closed the security loophole exploited by <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/amazon-changes-policy-wont-add-new-credit-cards-to-accounts-over-the-phone/\" title=\"\">Honan's attacker</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2185277/Apple-suspends-phone-password-changes-Wired-reporter-Mat-Honan-hacked.html?ITO=1490\" title=\"\">there are reports</a> that Apple has \"suspended\" the facility to make password changes over the phone. Horse departed, in other words, and stable door securely bolted. But will Honan's experience dissuade people from putting all their eggs in the iCloud basket? Is the pope a Protestant?</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/dec/13/peter-morgan-scriptwriter-frost-nixon\" title=\"\">Peter Morgan</a> made his reputation with remarkably perceptive screenplays about British people, mostly real-life ones, going through bad patches in their careers at home (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/29/the-damned-united-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Damned United</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114297/queen\" title=\"\"><em>The Queen</em></a>) and abroad (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/25/frost-nixon-review\" title=\"\"><em>Frost/Nixon</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jan/14/drama.philipfrench\" title=\"\"><em>The Last King of Scotland</em></a>), and encountering some rather odd people. More recently, however, he's moved on to a larger canvas involving the mystical and metaphysical, and the results have been less satisfactory. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jan/30/hereafter-review-clint-eastwood-matt-damon\" title=\"\"><em>Hereafter</em></a>, which Steven Spielberg produced and Clint Eastwood directed, began with an astonishing re-creation of the south-east Asian tsunami, then proceeded with flat-footed banality to tell the parallel stories of three people from different countries (a French TV reporter, an American blue-collar worker and a south London schoolboy) mysteriously linked by their near-death experiences.</p> <p>His new film, <em>360</em>, directed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/fernando-meirelles\" title=\"\">Fernando Meirelles</a>, takes him halfway across the world and back, conjoining the lives of people in half-a-dozen cities in ways of which they're unaware but to which we're privy in God-like manner. It belongs to that school of portmanteau pictures the French call <em>les films \u00e0 sketches</em> which tell a variety of stories consecutively or concurrently with a linking theme, author or geographical location. One thinks of Ealing Studios' <a href=\"http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,4267,1381917,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>Dead of Night</em></a>, of the western <em>Winchester 73</em> and the Franco-Italian <em>The Seven Deadly Sins</em>. They invariably feature a cast of familiar faces, and the practice goes back to the Depression, when MGM's <em>Grand Hotel</em> and Paramount's <em>If I Had a Million</em> (both made in 1932) showed how Hollywood studios kept their stars busy by bringing them together in a single picture.</p> <p>One of the most famous films of this kind is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/07/drama.dvdreviews1\" title=\"\"><em>La ronde</em></a>, the first of the four masterpieces made by Max Oph\u00fcls after his return to Europe in 1950. Featuring some of France's finest actors, it's a version of <em>Reigen</em>, Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 play about a transgressive sexual roundelay in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna involving people of different classes and backgrounds, several of them near-strangers and likely to be transmitting syphilis. Oph\u00fcls somewhat prettified the story, perhaps, but Anton Walbrook as the master of ceremonies was an unforgettably witty, suave and cynical man of the world.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ElLF2VgeYxg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ElLF2VgeYxg?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Schnitzler's play and the Oph\u00fcls film are the declared inspiration for Morgan's screenplay: his title derives from the 360 degrees of a circle and begins and ends with a chilling sexual transaction that recreates Schnitzler in the internet culture of present-day Vienna. Another influence, one suspects, might be those Alan Ayckbourn plays where the action can move in different directions according to chance events, such as the flip of a coin (<a href=\"http://sisterlyfeelings.alanayckbourn.net/\" title=\"\"><em>Sisterly Feelings</em></a>) or a decision whether or not to have a cigarette (<a href=\"http://intimateexchanges.alanayckbourn.net/\" title=\"\"><em>Intimate Exchanges</em></a>, which Alain Resnais adapted as <em>Smoking/No Smoking</em>).</p> <p>So we have a glossy film about fate and destiny with ludic trimmings, suggesting that all (or at least a large part) of human life is here, performed by an international cast headed by Anthony Hopkins, Rachel Weisz, Ben Foster and Jude Law, and supported by actors who are star names in their own countries. There are business tycoons from Germany and Britain, Austrian pimps, Russian gangsters, a French dentist, an American sex offender on parole, a Brazilian photographer and various wives and partners. They spend a lot of time flying, conducting dodgy business deals, engaging in sex or looking for love, and almost without exception they're anxious, depressed and (in the case of those with some vestige of conscience) guilt-ridden.</p> <p>They travel between Vienna, Paris, Berlin, London, Denver and Phoenix, staying at smart, anonymous international hotels of the sort Kenneth Tynan once called the Adolf Hilton, and living in uncluttered glass-and-steel apartments furnished with reams of Eames. The only people who don't belong to this affluent, privileged lifestyle, nor aspire to it, are the sex offender (Ben Foster) and his sympathetic prison psychologist (Marianne Jean-Baptiste).</p> <p>Dramatically the action kicks off when the lonely British car executive (Jude Law) decides at the last moment not to use the services of a Slovakian prostitute in Vienna. This has the unexpected consequence of his wife dropping her Brazilian lover and Law himself being blackmailed by a business associate. The film's best sustained sequence (and its most dangerous and affecting one) involves a troubled Brazilian girl, the sex offender and a retired middle-aged Englishman (Hopkins) searching for his missing daughter, a quest that leaves all of them stranded together during a snowstorm at Denver airport. (This is certainly better than Anthony Asquith and Terence Rattigan's 1963 airport movie <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/472097/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>The VIPs</em></a>.) The most exciting sequence is the most commonplace: a couple of gangland killings in a Viennese hotel, which with heavy irony take place while two other characters drive around the city's famed Ringstrasse. The one really memorable scene occurs in Phoenix, when Hopkins attends an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. His brilliantly delivered speech draws together and gives vitality to the film's&#xa0;themes, about taking the chances we're given and playing the hand we're dealt by life.</p> <p><em>360</em> has a gleaming surface and a knowing air, but essentially it reflects (and this is something hinted at in an accompanying note by Morgan) the&#xa0;lives of people who spend too much time in planes and confuse the ennui induced by jet lag with authentic&#xa0;<em>Weltschmerz</em>. The film's gifted Brazilian director, Fernando Meirelles, who addressed urgent problems in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/jan/03/artsfeatures2\" title=\"\"><em>City of God</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/108557/constant.gardener\" title=\"\"><em>The&#xa0;Constant Gardener</em></a>, was similarly out&#xa0;of touch with the real world in his&#xa0;last film, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/23/drama\" title=\"\"><em>Blindness</em></a>, a hollow allegory about an unnamed police state&#xa0;whose citizens suddenly lose their sight. At the end one feels that <em>360</em>&#xa0;isn't concerned with taking decisions or dealing with fate. It's less&#xa0;about understanding the butterfly&#xa0;effect than observing some&#xa0;urban moths flitting around a guttering candle.</p>",
  "<p>Tears. So many that the South Korean fencer's face shone. For more than an hour following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/london-2012-fencer-a-lam-shin\" title=\"\">her defeat at the ExCel</a> arena on 30 July, Shin A-lam's epee lay on the piste beside her. She would not budge. Judges huddled, spectators slow handclapped. All eyes fell on the electronic clock. One second had distanced the Korean from victory and a possible Olympic gold medal. How long is a second? Longer, a pained Shin discovered, than her opponent's blade.</p> <p>In the Olympians' scrambles to finish first, a second often proves decisive. Even the greatest athletes can find themselves on the wrong side of time. Twenty four hours after the fencing drama, a pair of swimmers in the 200m butterfly touched the wall simultaneously. Michael Phelps \u2013 the most decorated competitor in the history of the Games \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/london-2012-michael-phelps-olympian\" title=\"\">had to settle for a rare silver</a>: his time of 1&#xa0;min 53.01&#xa0;sec was 1/20th of a second behind Chad le Clos of South Africa. Phelps, massaging his disappointment, might have cast his mind back four years to the Games in Beijing, at which another simultaneous finish had on that occasion gone in his favour. A review confirmed his seventh gold of the competition (matching Mark Spitz's record 1972 haul) by a margin of 1/100th of a second.</p> <p>Such margins were unthinkable in Pythagoras's day. The ancient Greek athletes cared far more about timing (<em>kairos</em>) than time (<em>chronos</em>). Wrestlers and boxers sought the right moment, the instant of maximum opportunity, in which to throw a rival or land a winning jab. Victory was always visible, incontrovertible. It was the same story in other disciplines. The hurly-burly of chariot races made neck-and-neck competition virtually impossible. Falls and crashes occurred regularly over the 12 laps of the track. In the Games of 482BC, out of a field of 41, there was only one finisher.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.armand-dangour.com/\" title=\"\">Armand D'Angour</a> notes in his account of the ancient Greek mind, athletes showed no desire to perform more efficiently or race ever faster. They followed special diets and pushed their bodies to exhaustion, but only so as to be the best on the day. No accurate measurements were taken, no reliable records kept (we can safely disregard Phayllus of Kroton's 55ft leap as proverbial). No single standard was upheld. Discus diameters could vary from 5.5in to 13.5in. Every city state had its own version of the <em>stadion</em> (sprint) race: at Olympia, competitors ran 192 metres; at Delphi, 177; at Epidaurus, 181; at Pergamon, 210.</p> <p>When Baron Pierre de Coubertin inaugurated the modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, he also rendered them mathematical. The same weights and distances travelled in quadrennial cycles from country to country and from city to city. New disciplines such as the modern pentathlon (invented by de Coubertin), which made its debut at the 1912 Games in Stockholm, ranked participants objectively using points. Current pentathlon rules quantify everything from the graze of an adversary's epee (which equates to a delay in the final 3,000m race of precisely seven seconds) to the worth of one second in the pool (plus or minus 12 points, depending on the swimmer's total time over 200m). Referees presently value the embarrassment of falling off a horse \u2013 during the showjumping round \u2013 as a 60-point deduction.</p> <p>Using the numbers generated from these standardised units of measurement, the world's first official sporting records emerged. The record, in de Coubertin's analogy, became to the Olympic movement what gravity was to Newtonian mechanics. Its abstract numbers denote feats of human excellence of the kind once praised in Pindar's odes. But unlike poems, numbers are universal. Abstraction effaces the sore toes and false starts and noisy crowds of a particular place and date. Through it, we can compare Michael Phelps's record-breaking 200m butterfly swim in Rome on 29 July 2009 (1:51.51) with that of Mark Spitz in Munich on 28 August 1972 (2:00.07), or the spot where J\u00fcrgen Schult's discus landed at Neubrandenburg on 6 June 1986 (74.08m) with that reached by James Duncan, the discipline's first record holder, in New York on 27&#xa0;May 1912 (47.58m). Rarely though do we pause to contemplate the stark differences in, say, nutrition, financial incentive or lane position. The numbers strike us as dispassionate, unflinching, authoritative.</p> <p>No Olympic record better symbolises the quantification of accomplishment than that in the men's 100m sprint. The sprinter does not tackle any old 100m, but, rather, the idea of 100m: encompassing a standardised and tightly prescribed strip of territory. A century ago, spectators in Stockholm admired Donald Lippincott, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, as he set the event's first official world record in \"the marvellous time of 10 3/5 seconds\" (10.6sec). A row of straw-hatted timekeepers squeezed their stopwatches (accurate to within a fifth of a second) as he whisked by.</p> <p>Electronic timing supplanted stopwatches at the Helsinki Games of 1952. In the final, no fewer than four sprinters made it to the line in a time of 10.4. More remarkable still, the runners were considered somewhat slow. The then world record, first set by Jesse Owens 16 years before, defined sprinting excellence at 10.2.</p> <p>Records, though, are never immune to dissatisfaction. In many minds, those 2/10ths of a second nagged. Sixteen years after Helsinki, running at altitude in the Mexico City Games, the American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hines\" title=\"\">Jim Hines</a>'s gold-medal-winning time of 9.95 seemed to redefine the race. Hines became the first human in history to run under the 10-second mark.</p> <p>Today's sprinters are measured in hundredths of a second. Last week in London, the most hi-tech equipment followed the sprinter Usain Bolt's every step. His reaction time out of the blocks was 0.165 (ranking him a modest fourth of eight). But then the Jamaican got into his stride. His long legs disposed of the race in 41 strides. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/usain-bolt-olympic\" title=\"\">Olympic record time </a>of 9.63 put him an eighth of a second \u2013 some 4ft \u2013 clear of the pack. For Bolt, however, winning gold was insufficient, confiding to a reporter: \"Then it popped into my head, world record! [Bolt ran 9.58 in 2009] \u2026 it's still a fast time, the second-fastest ever, but I won't say it was the perfect race because I know my coach would disagree.\"</p> <p>Bolt had talked of running it in less than 9.5 in London. After all, if a record's abstract numbers allow us to contrast performances with the past, they make it equally possible to anticipate the future. The sprinters chase a ghostly number, a Platonic ideal of the \"perfect race\". What is this number? Mathematicians have long disputed the question. According to John Barrow, professor of mathematical sciences at Cambridge University, the limits of human speed remain a long way off. A faster reaction to the starter's gun, a maximum 2&#xa0;metre per second breeze at his back, higher altitude and thus less resistant air: all would help Bolt pick up even greater speed. Barrow calculates a potential record of 9.45. The statistician Reza Noubary agrees, estimating \"with 95% confidence\" an upper limit of 9.44. Others, measuring the relative improvement in sprinting performances between consecutive Games since 1896, conclude that we will have to wait until at least the year 2020 before someone beats 9.5. Meanwhile the physicist Filippo Radicchi predicts an ultimate 100m men's time of 8.28 (in more conservative calculations, he has put it at 8.8).</p> <p>But some query what the sports philosopher Sigmund Loland describes as the \"cult of abstract entities\" in which a race is turned into \"a quest for objective knowledge similar to what we find in the scientific experiment\". Attention swivels from the humanity of Bolt and Phelps \u2013 their peculiar stories and rivalries \u2013 to \"empirical research questions\": how fast can a human being run? How quickly can he or she swim? Behind such questions, Loland notes, lurks the Enlightenment idea of indefinite progress.</p> <p>We are all children of the Enlightenment: we count calories, set alarm clocks, watch weather forecasts on TV. So habitual, so inconspicuous, are these daily rituals that we perform them automatically. Unlike the ancient Greeks, who considered man the \"measure of all things\", we feel at home in an infinitely expansive cosmos. Great thinkers of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries passed down to us the notion of civilisation moving in a single \u2013 and desirable \u2013 direction. Thermometers, weighing scales and microscopes long ago moved us safely past the marshes of approximation. Time, risk and mortality are now told in numbers and quantified, since incremental progress relies on accurate measurement.</p> <p>\"Citius, altius, fortius,\" says the Olympic motto, but as Loland points out, the idea of unending progress risks leading sport into a bind. Records cannot continue to be broken forever. Soon, perhaps, 100m sprint times will feature a third decimal after the point. Even this solution, however, might not work. A thousandth of a second equates to a single centimetre, yet track lanes have been known to differ in length by twice as much.</p> <p>Why reduce performance to a number at all? Every sport and sportsman and sportswoman is unique. Consider, in place of abstract records, a renewed focus on the human drama and infinite variety of the match.</p> <p>Ball games such as tennis offer an alternative vision of sport's infinite variety: intuition and technical prowess compliment the athlete's speed and strength. The game's units are defined idiosyncratically (zero is winningly called \"love\"); statistics such as \"total volleys\" or \"percentage of returned serves\" mere side-effects of play. Achievement adjusts with every match. Hours before Bolt's race last Sunday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-olympic-gold-federer?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Andy Murray contested the Olympics men's singles final</a> against Roger Federer.

  "<p>The first thing you notice about <a href=\"http://www.sunstudio.com/\" title=\"\">Sun Studio</a> \u2013 the birthplace of rock'n'roll in downtown Memphis, Tennessee \u2013 is that it really is as small as everyone says. Snuggled at 706 Union Avenue on the corner of Marshall, you could lob a catgut-strung double bass from one end of the recording studio to the other without breaking a sweat. The second thing is that, among the black-and-white photos of bequiffed trailblazers who have recorded at Sun \u2013 Elvis, Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash \u2013 there hangs a picture of Bono, replete with trademark mullet and silly hat.</p> <p>\"That'll have to go,\" I said, turning the offending picture to the wall\u2026</p> <p>Like so many modern musicians, from Chris Isaak to Def Leppard (no, really), U2 had recorded at Sun in an attempt to tap into the magic that had produced such timeless hits as Blue Suede Shoes and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On. Now, as the fulfilment of a lifetime's dream, I had come here to Memphis with my band, the <a href=\"http://www.dodgebrothers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dodge Brothers</a> (\"militant skiffle and blues\") to record our second album over two nights at Sun. By day, the studio is a museum, a magnet for tourists who have experienced the Jungle Room and jump-suits of Graceland, and now want to see where Elvis first wiggled his pelvis in front of a microphone. But by night it's a mecca for nostalgic musicians who have an almost religious belief in the power of that tiny room. Having recorded our previous album in Bournemouth, we had decided to stop pretending to sound like a band recording in Memphis and just go there for real\u2026</p> <p>In our endeavours to recreate the sound of records made before most of us were born, we were aided by studio engineer Matt Ross-Spang, a mad rockabilly genius (with whom we had bonded over a shared love of Tarheel&#xa0;Slim) who had spent years studying Sun founder Sam Phillips's recording techniques. Although some sceptics insist that Sun is \"just a room\", Matt believes firmly that the primitive baffling (panels to dampen the sound) that Phillips designed, combined with the confined space of the room, create a unique and distinctive aural dynamic. He also believes that the only way to get that authentic \"Sun sound\" is to record the way they used to \u2013 with no headphones, no overdubs, no instrument isolation; just four or five open mics and the band playing live. This sounded like a brilliant idea to us, standing there on the Xs taped to the floor where Elvis, Scotty Moore and Bill Black recorded That's All Right, ready to rock like they did back in '54.</p> <p>What we weren't prepared for was just how hard it was to record like this. Having buried the guitar amps under mattresses so that they could be simultaneously turned up and dampened down \u2013 an authentic Sun trick from the days before soundproofed booths \u2013 Matt made it clear that each song had to be performed perfectly by everyone from beginning to end, with no chance to fix tiny mistakes later. If a take wasn't up to his exactingly high standards\u2026 well, then you just went back and did the whole thing again. And again. And&#xa0;again.</p> <p>It was around the 24th take of Ghost&#xa0;House, a slappy rockabilly number composed specially for this session, that my fingers started to bleed, dripping blood on to the fingerboard of the Sun Studio house bass that, unless they've cleaned it (unlikely, frankly), is still caked there&#xa0;today. Sometime around 2am on that first night I found myself standing in the parking lot rubbing ice cubes into my right hand, which had become numb from swelling and was starting to resemble the Incredible Hulk \u2013 huge and green and angry. At the end of every take, we'd look over from the pile of mattresses and old-style Coke-bottle mics up to the window of the control booth where Matt would bob up from behind the mixing desk and say something encouraging such as: \"Yeah, great. But still a bit\u2026 squirly [his favourite word]. I think you can do one more\u2026\" And all the time, the photos of Elvis, Carl, Johnny and Jerry Lee looked down disapprovingly, as if to say, \"Hey, guys, what's taking you so&#xa0;long?\"</p> <p>There is a theory, espoused by many, that says there's something about the swampy air of Memphis that gets into that pokey, sweaty room at Sun and gradually overpowers you. Sometime in the middle of the second night, like Dorothy lying down in the poppy field in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, I started to feel it. During the day we'd travelled to Clarksdale, Mississippi, to visit the Riverside Hotel \u2013 where Bessie Smith died and Ike Turner knocked up Rocket 88 (the \"first\" rock'n'roll record) \u2013 fondle vintage Silvertone guitars in the local music store, and get a haircut down from the crossroads where Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil. Now, with a mixture of exhaustion and elation, we had finally relaxed into the atmosphere of Sun, and I was suddenly filled with a fleeting and ecstatic sense of what it must have been like to record here when Phillips first turned the volume dials up to 11. When we finished, I looked up from the bloodstained bass to see Matt grinning in the control box, and one of those black-and-white photos hanging crooked from the wall. \"Hey, look, you played Jerry Lee out of his&#xa0;frame!\"</p> <p>Bono, his face still turned to the wall, said nothing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01lssm3\" title=\"\"><em>Mark Goes to Memphis</em></a><em>, Radio 2, Monday 13 August, 10pm</em></p>",
  "<p>Dieter Roth was a celebrated sculptor, performer, film-maker and draughtsman whose work has been displayed all over the world since his death in 1998. He was also an alcoholic. His last video installation was a record of his final year, lived in the knowledge that he was slowly dying of the consequences.</p> <p>You can watch<em> Solo Scenes</em> \u2013 for hours, potentially for days \u2013 on 128 video screens at the Fruitmarket Gallery, part of <a href=\"http://fruitmarket.co.uk/exhibitions/next/\" title=\"\"><strong>Dieter Roth: Diaries</strong></a>. It is one of the most significant shows in a particularly strong edition of the Edinburgh art festival. There he is, this&#xa0;old man in a soft cap with his solitary ways, seen in the low brown glow of his apartment. He is a figure fit for late Rembrandt or the novels of Samuel Beckett.</p> <p>He works, he eats, he writes, he thinks. He hangs out his meagre washing. In bed, beneath the lamp, he reads late into the night; in the morning there is toast to make. Snow gathers outside, spring comes and he tends his plants. Each scene is conspicuously framed (the camera judders and shakes) before Roth appears within it. This is one of the longest time-lapse self-portraits in art:&#xa0;literally, life passing from moment to moment.</p> <p>And what does Roth do, faced with this mortal dread? He simply goes on working, a common and quiet heroism, as the dawn-to-dusk structure of the work implies. Perhaps some concession is made to comfort \u2013 the artist very often appears in his dressing gown, frequently with a blanket \u2013 but the low buzz of activity never ceases, even against the faint soundtrack of a clock.</p> <p>There are drawings to make and letters to write. Some kind of art is gathering, quite apart from these videos themselves. In the studio there are occasional glimpses of self-portraits, sculptures, paintings; and hundreds of ring binders neatly arranged in library shelves.</p> <p>The actual shelves are installed upstairs at the Fruitmarket Gallery, each file containing the ill-considered trifles of Roth's daily life: bills and tickets and restaurant napkins, bank statements and parking tickets, anything and everything that was less than 5mm thick, preserved in this orderly archive entitled <em>Flat Waste</em>.</p> <p>Shoring up the fragments was not just a compulsion for Roth, it was an aesthetic principle. He made fantastically elaborate environments \u2013 a studio, an entire bar complete with empties and overflowing ashtrays \u2013 out of junk. He also worked with chocolate, baking dough and soft cheese, the inevitable deterioration of each piece equated with life's decline. The materials of art were indivisible from the materials of life.</p> <p>It might have helped to include an earlier work for those unfamiliar with Roth. But the Fruitmarket has several ingenious self-portraits rapidly executed in ballpoint (the artist as a whirring fan, a speech bubble, a weeping pig) and many of his copiously illustrated diaries. These are written in his native German, but there are tantalising entries in English: \"Dorothy loves you madly. She hopes to get through this phase and love you more.\" What happened with Dorothy, one longs to know, after that declaration in 1967?</p> <p>The diaries, like the videos, put everything on the same par, from the love letter to the last cup of coffee. And that is the ethos of the whole show. It doesn't feel desperate \u2013 a clutching at straws \u2013 so much as ravenously interested in everything that exists. <em>Solo Scenes</em> is only finished, so far as I can tell, in that there is a last monitor showing a last piece of video. The death is unrecorded and the work feels energetic, relishing every minute of every day. Roth's curiosity never dies.</p> <p>The art festival this year feels pensive, profound. The <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/\" title=\"\">Ingleby Gallery </a>has a rediscovered work by that great Scottish original Ian Hamilton Finlay \u2013 a lethal air-sea battle played out on an ironing board with wooden planes and irons, tragedy somehow miniaturised with no loss of effect. At lunchtime each day, in response to Edinburgh Castle's one o'clock gun, you can hear the disembodied voice of the Turner prize winner Susan Philipsz hanging&#xa0;in&#xa0;the air at evocative staging&#xa0;posts around the city: a siren song drawing you into the past.</p> <p>And the Dutch artist Melvin Moti has made a spectacularly beautiful work for the <a href=\"http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum.aspx\" title=\"\">National Museum of Scotland</a> simply by passing UV rays over objects from the collection \u2013 scorpions, fluorescing fossils, perfume bottles made from uranium \u2013 and filming the high-chrome effects.

This is the Guston of the great tragicomic period with its near-cartoonish vocabulary: men with heads like lima beans, huge flatiron shoes, hoods riding the streets smoking cigarettes in open-top cars, gigantic hands reaching down from the heavens to make a point (in this case, the point of a pencil).</p> <p>In <em>The Studio</em>, a hood paints his own portrait, appraising his art through Disney eye-slits and smoking as he works. The cigarette has been airbrushed from the picture on the easel, along with the light bulb, the palette and the one-handed clock, but in every other respect he paints himself exactly as he is painted by Philip Guston himself.</p> <p>For this is Guston's allegorical self-portrait: the artist as antihero and nicotine addict, getting through two packs of Camel a day. The picture is full of jokes, from the rueful allusion to Vel\u00e1zquez in the silver, pink and black of the colour scheme to the fact that you can't tell whether the smoke is issuing from the cigarette or the paintbrush.</p> <p>The bulb, the Klannish hood, the ciggy with its orange tip: Guston evolved a pungent vocabulary of forms that couldn't stand for anything except themselves and yet always meant so much more. Those hoods, hugger-mugger in some kind of office, what are they up to with their arms raised against each other? That curious citadel, pink, fat and squat, ascending like Brueghel's towering Babel, seems both ancient and yet so modern you might turn a corner and find it before you today, a sinister bureaucracy rising up to blood and milk clouds.</p> <p>Guston's late paintings have become archetypes, irreducibly simple, translating the world. Like good cartoons, and great paintings, they reveal what cannot easily be said.</p> <p>This is an ideal introduction for newcomers and a perfectly condensed anthology for Guston's admirers, especially since many of the works have never been shown in Britain before. There are only nine paintings, all borrowed from private collections in the United States. But with Guston, a&#xa0;little goes a long way.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Volvo XC90</strong><br><strong>Price </strong>\u00a335,695<br><strong>MPG </strong>34.4<br><strong>Top speed </strong>127mph</p> <p>The tagline Volvo is running on its adverts at the moment is: \"Admit it! You've always wanted to drive a&#xa0;getaway car.\" Can you imagine? The sedate Swedish firm, a&#xa0;touchstone for middle-class respectability for generations, churning out getaway cars. Screeching tyres, fivers fluttering in the breeze\u2026</p> <p>Actually, a&#xa0;Volvo would make a&#xa0;superb escape vehicle. The cars are unexpectedly zesty when it comes to performance. They're famously reliable, too, so you wouldn't have to fear grinding to a&#xa0;halt with the police in hot pursuit. They're also anonymous, virtually indestructible and the great fuel economy means you won't have to refill until you're over the border\u2026</p> <p>But, of course, that's not what Volvo wants you to escape from. It wants to whisk you away from the trudge of everyday reality to a bucolic bolthole. A&#xa0;weekend world of climbing roses and chilled ros\u00e9, where if you own a&#xa0;Volvo and a&#xa0;country house you can pat yourself on the back\u2026 or, in my case, sit and ponder what might have been.</p> <p>Last Friday I got to live the Volvo dream. I had the XC90, the marque's premium seven-seat SUV, to test and the country house had been rented \u2013 a red-brick rectory in Norfolk. Its flagstoned halls and four-poster beds the perfect setting for a \"let's pretend weekend\".</p> <p>There was no shortage of jail breakers hurtling up the M11 that evening. The road was a bumper-to-bumper parade of 4x4s all jostling to escape from the city \u2013 and on Sunday evening the same cars filed politely back.</p> <p>It's a decade since Sweden's biggest export (literally) stormed the SUV market by offering a&#xa0;previously untried blend of non-aggressive yet rugged styling and family-friendly practicality with ferocious off-road capability. In many ways it's the ultimate passive-aggressive vehicle. The XC90 is just as guilty of being a bloated road-hog as the rest of its super-sized class, but it doesn't provoke the same level of loathing.</p> <p>This is because, the XC90 is the SUV most popular among female owners. Volvo had the foresight to appeal to this influential sector of the car-buying public when it first conceived of the XC90, and women were involved in the design of the car right from the start \u2013 something all manufacturers should do. Its smooth lines and gentle curves make it look deceptively compact, and far from being intimidating, the huge Volvo appears rather benign.</p> <p>Inside there's more evidence of a woman's touch. It feels refined and amenable. The new model has seven seats fitted as standard, and they can be flipped into 64 possible seating solutions, so everyone is catered for. The middle seat even has an integrated child booster. The D5 engine now boasts 200bhp yet knocks out a respectable 34mpg and, as you might imagine with a female-friendly car, the driver support and safety systems are peerless.</p> <p>At the end of the country getaway, I closed the door on the Old Rectory (and a life that might have been), and pointed the XC90 towards the capital. Cruise control on and satnav muttering, the eager diesel pumped me effortlessly homewards. Yes, it had been a&#xa0;great escape, but who wants to live a double life?</p> <p>Rural Retreats is the UK's specialist in the rental of beautiful cottages and elegant country homes.

  "<p>Two families battling for control of a successful business, a mysterious set of twins and a couple of unexplained deaths \u2013 if <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vengeance-Quirke-Benjamin-Black/dp/0805094393\" title=\"\"><em>Vengeance</em></a> sounds like a Jeffrey Archer novel, that might be the playful intention of <a href=\"http://literature.britishcouncil.org/john-banville\" title=\"\">John Banville</a> (here writing as Benjamin Black). He's always approached his crime-writing pseudonym with mischievous relish \u2013 here, one of his characters thinks an Agatha Christie novel \"rather dull\" \u2013 but serious intent, too: the series featuring 1950s Dublin pathologist Quirke revels in, rather than sneers at, the crime genre.</p> <p>Yet with this new story, Quirke's fifth outing, it feels as if Banville doesn't wholly commit to the narrative. The prose is gloriously limpid, particularly when Quirke, back on the booze, muses on the \"soapy reek of beer, the scald of whiskey\". However, the twins' connection to the deaths is so obviously signposted, there's never really a sense of shock or even intrigue.</p> <p>But maybe that's by design. Near the end, Quirke's daughter discusses the strange necessity for red herrings in detective novels \u2013 and next sentence works out the key to one of the deaths. The Benjamin Black novels don't play up to all the clich\u00e9s of crime drama, and therein lies their enjoyment.</p>",
  "<p>The title of James Kelman's new novel is more welcoming than his past choices, which have tended towards the jagged (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/short-stories/9781846970382/not-not-while-the-giro\" title=\"\"><em>Not Not While the Giro</em></a>) or the melancholy-dour (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099546276/how-late-it-was-how-late\" title=\"\"><em>How Late It Was, How Late</em></a>, which won the Booker prize in 1994). <em>Mo Said She Was Quirky</em> is almost a Roddy Doyle title, but the book carries on Kelman's campaign for&#xa0;truthfulness in writing, as he sees it.&#xa0;Unfortunately this is also a campaign&#xa0;against vitality. There's no set formula for vitality, of course \u2013 Dickens's version very different from Beckett's \u2013 but without it no writer can maintain a hold on a readership.</p> <p>\"Mo said she was quirky but it was more than quirky.\" \"She\" is Helen, 27, a Glaswegian working in a London casino, Mo her live-in boyfriend. Mo is a restaurant worker from a Pakistani family, the name she uses for him presumably the abbreviation for a full form that doesn't get a mention. The two of them met in Glasgow and moved south, partly to get out of range of Helen's nasty ex, father of her young daughter Sophie. The relationship is strong and solid, though Mo has no plans to introduce her to his family.</p> <p>On the opening pages Helen sees, from the taxi that is taking her home from work in the early hours, a shambling down-and-out who may be her brother Brian. The rest of the book covers the next 24 hours or so of her interactions with Mo and Sophie, but mainly her thoughts. There's a little flurry of incident at the end of the book, by which time the reader no longer expects any pandering to the dramatic and doesn't quite know how to react.</p> <p>One woman's life in a day \u2013 this is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/search/results?query=Mrs+Dalloway&amp;searchBy=all\" title=\"\"><em>Mrs Dalloway</em></a> territory, but drastically defoliated. The method is \"virtual first person\", so that the character is represented as \"she\", but with the bare minimum of context or commentary from outside. Kelman's technique is a little awkward in those opening pages. There must be less bald ways of explaining your set-up than saying \"Mo was her boyfriend. She and her six-year-old daughter lived with him\", or of indicating which side of the family a grandmother belongs to than explaining \"She was Mum's mother\", something of which Helen presumably doesn't need to be reminded.</p> <p>Kelman's background is hardly more privileged than his central character's, and it's obviously important to him politically to give oral culture priority over the stale and literary. This sounds admirable but isn't straightforward. Kelman everywhere purges the apostrophe from abbreviated forms like \"wasnt\" and \"didnt\". Sometimes he drops the core conventions of the sentence (initial capital, final stop), so as to convey rhetorically the urgency and shapelessness of Helen's thought.</p> <p>When you try to customise the toolbox of punctuation in this way you can end up multiplying the contradictions you want to eliminate. Kelman isn't the only writer to dislike \"wasn't\" and \"didn't\", <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/Cormac-McCarthy-on-James-Joyce-and-Punctuation-Video\" title=\"\">Cormac McCarthy being another</a>, but if the apostrophe is a class traitor, why retain it elsewhere, in possessive forms? If informality is the aim, what about the semicolon? It's a mark of which Kelman is fond, but this virtually <em>ancien r\u00e9gime</em> piece of punctuation must have pulled strings to survive the typographical Terror. And what's that double dot in the middle of the word naive, looking suspiciously like a tiara?</p> <p>Real speech is repetitive and goes in zigzags, and the same goes for Helen's refracted monologue, but authenticity is an irrelevant notion in this context. Nothing remains oral once it's written down. Accent, intonation, eye contact, body language, social setting, all these fall away, and after that the choices are a matter of literary convention. When Kelman writes of Helen: \"She had experienced a thing similar in the past to do with confidence, and her ex, it was him and whatever, she didnt know what to do just like standing still, that was all, like a panic but just so quietly and that cold sweat, just so \u2013 not able to move,\" the incoherence is artificial, making uphill work for the reader though a friend saying something similar would be perfectly easy to understand. We forgive friends their conversational tics, but it's harder to forgive Kelman for Helen's unrelenting use of \"so so\" (\"so so wrong, just so so wrong\" and \"so sad, so so sad, really\" on the same page), the constant overemphasis that achieves with so much labour no emphasis at all.</p> <p>The strangest authorial decision governing the book is the virtual abolition of detail. Perhaps the idea is to reach general applicability without passing through specifics, as poetry occasionally can, but the trick can't be worked in prose. Even a novel as mightily indeterminate as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571217359/finnegans-wake\" title=\"\"><em>Finnegans Wake</em></a> is made up of melted particulars.</p> <p>Helen worked at a casino in Glasgow before the one in London, but there's no portrait of either establishment, no account of atmosphere, rituals or tricks of the trade. Only towards the end of the book is it possible to believe that the author has even visited such a place. It's as if abstention from detail is a piece of righteous self-denial, mortification of the writer's spirit, but mortifying your reader into the bargain can't be a good idea. Kelman withholds detail even when it's unnatural to do so. Helen (for instance) obviously doesn't think of her ex as her \"ex\" but by his name, which doesn't appear. She refers to \"the scary exhibition\" near London Bridge station, as if for Kelman identifying the <a href=\"http://www.the-dungeons.co.uk/london/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">London Dungeon</a> would be culpable indulgence, the beginning of a recovering addict's relapse into binge naming.</p> <p>The few details of the Glasgow casino that do get through the puritan filter are bizarre. The only drink reported as being taken is tea. Old Chinese women apparently drop in to drink tea and to chat with their friends, and the management tolerates this, even when their voices are loud and carrying, because they are the place's \"bread and butter\". I'm not saying that there are no Glasgow casinos where old Chinese women drink tea and gossip at the top of their lungs, but when these are the only details given they seem utterly unreal. They stand out stark and stunted on the skyline of the novel.</p> <p>Detail is the rain that makes the soil of a novel imaginatively fertile. Without it nothing can grow. (The semi-arid ecology of Beckett's novels can sustain life but attracts few visitors.) There are widely separated bits of succulent Scots vernacular in <em>Mo Said She Was Quirky</em> (\"shoogly\" and \"fankled together\" early on, then a long wait for \"crabbit\") which resemble occasional drops of dew let fall, either mercifully or sadistically, on to the reader's cracked lips. It's a sign of a truly desperate thirst to be pouncing on a specified place name for its illusion of moisture \u2013 Charing Cross station, mentioned on page 190, where Helen has to change on her way from her generic south London home to her generic West End workplace \u2013 like someone sucking stones in the delirium of dehydration, or a castaway cut loose in an open boat&#xa0;reduced to drinking seawater.</p>",
  "<p>Artifice and technical perfection: chilling terms when applied to almost any work of art outside the music of Ravel. Famously a lover of toys, automata, fakes of all kinds, he sought beauty through distillation and control. His creations glitter and scintillate. Yet still, perversely, he can touch the heart. <a href=\"http://glyndebourne.com/production/ravel-double-bill\" title=\"\">Glyndebourne's new double bill</a> of <em>L'heure espagnole </em>and <em>L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges </em>\u2013 Ravel's only operas \u2013 matches the composer's ethereal precision with near flawless performances and <a href=\"http://glyndebourne.com/production/ravel-double-bill\" title=\"\">dazzling stagings</a>, conducted by Kazushi Ono and directed by Laurent Pelly, who also designed the costumes.</p> <p>Sex dominates <strong>L'heure espagnole</strong> (1911), but the one brief moment of congress takes place off stage. This canny ploy means the action, heaving with innuendo and jokes about pendulums, can be played straight, making it all the funnier. Taken from a <em>com\u00e9die-bouffe</em> by Franc-Nohain, the opera pushes farce to musical and verbal limits. At the start, three clocks tick at different speeds, coinciding every 15 seconds \u2013 a brittle conceit of the kind Ravel enjoyed. Torquemada, the town clock-maker, leaves his shop each week for an hour, abandoning his wife, the concupiscent Concepci\u00f3n, free to receive her lovers.</p> <p>With three contenders, time is of the essence. Don I\u00f1igo G\u00f3mez (Paul Gay), the smug, portly banker, and Gonzalve (Alek Shrader), the poet whose words are more virile than his deeds, are forced to hide in coffin-sized clocks so Concepci\u00f3n can have her way with Ramiro (Elliot Madore) the gormless muleteer. Better a man who can lift a clock than hide in one. Or never mind the brain, feel the biceps \u2013 as Boccaccio nearly but didn't quite say in the opera's closing lines.</p> <p>Ono, who collaborated with Pelly in Glyndebourne's successful <em>H\u00e4nsel und Gretel </em>in 2008, kept textures transparent, the percussive effects of harp, celesta, triangle, castanets and xylophone at once compounding the score's hairspring oscillations and adding lustre. Whirring mechanical patterns are dusted lightly with salacious waltzes and Hispanic rhythms \u2013 jota, malague\u00f1a and habanera \u2013 at once arch and suggestive, each beautifully rendered by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in full&nbsp;erotic flight. Ravel was, let's not forget, the man who, despite or because of his own arid love life, wrote <em>Bolero</em> (\"Did you ever do it to Ravel's <em>Bolero</em>?\" Bo Derek asked, famously, in the 1979 film <em>10</em>, thereby giving the composer fresh celebrity, though the chaste violence of Torvill and Dean on ice five years later certainly helped).</p> <p>The designs by Caroline Ginet and Florence Evrard \u2013 first created for the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris \u2013 combine the shop's well ordered interior with behind-the-counter garish squalor: Concepci\u00f3n (St\u00e9phanie d'Oustrac, pert and sinewy in voice and physique) runs a laundry, to judge from the sluttish array of washing machine, buckets, ironing board and industrial box of soap powder, all piled vertiginously together with Roman Catholic knick-knacks and a car whose headlights flash on and off when the action hots up.</p> <p>In contrast, the streamlined elegance&nbsp;of <strong>L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges</strong><em> </em>(1925), designed by Barbara de Limburg, suited that work's surreal fairytale text, purpose-written for Ravel by Colette. The story of a child and some magic spells sounds whimsical: a naughty boy has to confront the inanimate objects, now come to life, which he has destroyed in his tantrums, before eventually getting wisdom via a hurt squirrel. Written several years after <em>L'heure</em>, <em>L'enfant </em>shows Ravel's new musical preoccupations: a Wedgwood teapot and a Chinese teacup dance to a ragtime foxtrot in a score rippled through with jazz, blues and melody.</p> <p>The Child's fears are haunting and poignant. Pastoral figures torn from <em>toile de Jouy</em> wallpaper lament their destruction, looming like engraved ghosts. Cats hiss with menacing sexuality, insects accuse, trees \u2013 which process towards the child in a moment of pure theatrical alchemy \u2013 vent their anger until at last the perils and dangers of this night are over: the boy holds out his arms and the music calls out the reassuring, two-note \"<em>Maman</em>\".</p> <p>Ensemble cast and chorus excelled. Khatouna Gadelia, in her Glyndebourne debut as the Child, expressed the incipient nursery fears in us all for ever. A friend of Ravel's once described this small, dapper man, whose favourite possession was a mechanical nightingale in a gilded cage, as both a child and an old man. He would surely have been overjoyed by this near perfect double bill. See it live on Sunday 19 August <a href=\"http://glyndebourne.com/production/ravel-double-bill\" title=\"\">in cinemas</a> or streamed on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/live-opera-from-glyndebourne\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/glyndebourne</a>.</p> <p>Given his taste for the miniature, for his Japanese garden and rows of dwarf trees, Ravel's muted enthusiasm for Wagner, the sprawler to beat all sprawlers, is hardly a surprise. Luckily he won't have to endure 2013, the bicentenary of Wagner's birth. The torch relay has already begun at the<strong> Proms</strong>, relatively modestly before Barenboim conducts a full <em>Ring</em> cycle next season (not a well-kept secret so I am betraying no confidences). The BBC Philharmonic, in the third of four appearances, gave a slow, richly ecstatic account of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00x2z5j\" title=\"\">Prelude to <em>Tristan und Isolde</em></a>. The whole opera taken at that speed would have turned into a three-day event but here provided an opportunity to appreciate the orchestra's talent for colour and well-drilled detail.</p> <p>Bruckner may have preferred God to gods, sex and dragons, but he remains Wagner's most devoted disciple. The humble village schoolmaster's son had some catastrophic encounters with audiences and critics in his time, not least at the premiere of his Third Symphony. The Sixth, which followed \u2013 ignore the arithmetic; order of performance and of writing in Bruckner's case does not always tally \u2013 fared marginally better but remains unfamiliar, considered stylistically outside the main Bruckner canon. Perhaps that is part of its appeal, especially in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01ljl38/BBC_Proms_2012_Season_Prom_33_Wagner_MacMillan/\" title=\"\">a performance</a> as taut and supple, as well as massive and thunderous, as the BBC Phil's under the baton of music director Juanjo Mena.</p> <p>As a pivot between these two Romantic giants, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/mar/20/james-macmillan-composer\" title=\"\">James MacMillan</a>'s <em>Credo</em>, a BBC co-commission world premiere, proved ideal. Written for concert rather than liturgical purposes, and demanding a choir of around 140 voices \u2013 here the combined forces of the Manchester Chamber Choir, Northern Sinfonia Chorus and Rushley Singers \u2013 this 25-minute work displayed MacMillan's gift for achieving emotional effect on a substantial scale. The three-section setting of the Latin text, often moving in simple blocks to keep the words clear, conjured the mood of Russian Orthodox music \u2013 a huge challenge to the choir who survived all but the most exposed passages \u2013 while the conspicuous brass writing was a reminder of the band music with which the Ayrshire-born composer grew up.</p> <p>In Part One, praising God as maker of \"all things visible and invisible\", the strings repeated an upward, galloping figure offset by snarling bassoons, fanfares of brass and voices united in declamation. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00x2zdk\" title=\"\">Part Two</a>, the exploration of faith, reaches sonorous crisis at the crucifixion and resurrection to a vivid accompaniment of three solo violas. The Spiritus Sanctus draws on ancient plainchant and culminates in a big \"Amen\". At the start of this expansive, final part, the orchestra buzzes strangely, achieved by flutter-tonguing in the woodwind and the rapid tremolando bowing of the strings. According to MacMillan this represents the Holy Spirit. Whether this means something or nothing to you, the audience in the Albert Hall cheered enthusiastically, their faith, in music at least, fully renewed.</p>",
  "<p>The Brazilian sports minister has declared the London Olympics the \"best possible\", but vowed to match the achievement in four years' time in Rio.</p> <p>The Olympic baton will be passed to Rio during Sunday's closing ceremony, with an eight-minute samba sequence that will showcase Brazil.</p> <p>\"I was here a couple of weeks ago to see the opening ceremony. I am here for the third time now during the Olympics, and my overall impression has been the best possible in terms of the organisation, the atmosphere, everything to do with the London Games,\" said Aldo Rebelo. He said that among the lessons Rio had learned from London was the importance of investing in the success of the nation on the field, and forward planning.</p> <p>Brazil, which hosts the football World Cup in 2014 and the Rio Games in 2016, is facing questions over transport and logistics preparations. The minister insisted that hosting both events so close together was a positive move. Rebelo, who became sports minister last year after his predecessor Orlando Silva was forced out amid corruption allegations, said that Rio would follow the \"London model\".</p> <p>\"I was very impressed with their operations and their planning,\" he said, also praising the way that London had presented the sport in venues and for \"embracing the athletes\".</p> <p>\"I am pleased we have finished the planning segment of the work and we are also finalising the planning for our athletics operations. We hope we will be as well prepared as Team GB,\" he told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>If there has been one criticism of the London Games, it has been that the atmosphere in the venues has not always spread to the streets. Leonardo Gryner, the chief executive of the Rio 2016 organising committee, said that would not be the case in Rio. \"In Brazil, we like to party. We will have lots of live sites around the streets. Whenever we put a show on Copacabana beach we grab a huge crowd. On new year's eve we have two million people on the streets.\" Like London, Rio is projecting itself as a multi-ethnic global city that wants to be seen as tolerant and welcoming. \"It is a very mixed society on all fronts \u2013 religious, racial background, historical, ethnicity, you name it,\" said Rebelo. \"It's a very tolerant society, and this is one of the main messages we want to express to the world. As a nation, we can push forward a vision of nation that is tolerant and diverse and welcoming.\"</p> <p>Rio won the Games partly by reminding the International Olympic Committee of its position as a rising economic superpower, but Rebelo said that hosting the event would not be an explicit attempt to announce its arrival on the world stage.</p> <p>\"Everyone is aware of that \u2013 it's a known fact. But the main thing is the tolerance and the mixed society we have. In a world that has so many challenges in that respect, it is one of the main messages we can show to the world.\"</p> <p>Observing the way that the success of British athletes had catalysed the mood of the host nation, Rebelo said that Brazil had copied London's model and poured money into Olympic sport. \"We have a plan called 'the medal project'. We have learned a lot from the experience in the UK and how the government has invested in elite sport.\"</p> <p>In many ways London, which became the first city to host the Games three times, is an anomaly given a trend of taking the Olympics to new regions. \"These are the first Games in Brazil or in South America. It is a unique and challenging experience. We want to meet expectations and show the world Rio and Brazil is capable of putting on an amazing spectacle,\" said Rebelo.</p>",
  "<p>Details of next month's victory parade for Scotland's Olympic competitors remain sketchy. Thus far, Scots have contributed to more than a quarter of Great Britain's record haul of gold medals at London 2012. And so I suppose it was only to be expected that the government will want to show that we're one of the most athletic small nations in the world.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Alex Salmond ought to be careful here about what he is wishing for. The sight of Chris Hoy, Andy Murray and our other Olympic heroes stravaiging about Arthur's Seat waving huge Union flags would normally bring the first minister out in the sort of sweat that he only gets from one of his favourite curry. And surely the organisers of the parade wouldn't be so crass as to insist that they all must only bear the Saltire.</p> <p>For one of the most enduring features about London's splendid Olympiad has been the Scots medal winners' palpable sense of pride in being part of Great Britain. Indeed, following his gold medal in the keirin cycle event that made him Britain's greatest Olympian, Sir Chris spoke eloquently about how comfortable he felt being both Scottish and British. \"I'm British. I'm Scottish and British. I think you can be both \u2013 they are not mutually exclusive. All I can say is I'm very proud I've been part of this team, to be part of the British team, to be alongside the English and Welsh and Northern Irish, guys on the Isle of Man \u2013 everybody. It's been a great team and I'm proud to be part of it.\"</p> <p>Even if you discount mad Boris Johnson's claim on Thursday that the sense of UK national pride springing from the Olympics has \"retarded\" Alex Salmond's campaign for separation, it's clear that Scotland's first minister is having a bad Games. I'm unaware of any official line that SNP party managers were seeking to advance during the Olympics, but it's clear that not much thought went into dealing with the problem of Team GB and a subsequent unionist groundswell. Instead of confining himself to a dignified \"good luck and God speed\" message to the Scots representing Great Britain, the first minister simply couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge in grandstanding. Thus the Scots were \"Scolympians\"; London's Army &amp; Navy Club became \"a little bit of Scotland\" and in Rio 2016 Scotland will compete separately after independence has been gained. It was wretched stuff and simply made our normally surefooted senior statesman look tawdry and unkempt.</p> <p>It would be absurd not to acknowledge that the vibrant and muscular Britishness evident at the Olympic Games has reinforced feelings of unionism. Even a worthless and Olympics-denying cur such as me has been captivated by some of the feats of the last fortnight. Andy Murray's pride and passion as he destroyed his nemesis, Roger Federer, was one of my highlights. Without getting too geopolitical, I like it when the country that refused to fight Nazism yet hid its war loot gets a right good kicking from time to time. And how could you not be moved by Sir Chris Hoy's serenity and grace in his hour of triumph?</p> <p>But let's not get carried away. To listen to some of the BBC's more hysterical commentators, you might think that we are about to take to the high seas and reclaim our lost empire. Before tonight's closing ceremony has ended we will be insisting that Usain Bolt is really British. After all, the Jamaican tradition of running very fast in one direction is probably rooted in their ancestors' desire to escape the rapacious clutches of the English and Scottish colonial thugs who once carved up the island.</p> <p>The Olympic euphoria will evaporate as quickly as it takes the scions of England's public school elite to put their craft in the waters of Eton Dorney again and reclaim their sport and their paddling pool. Already, a lot of people who really ought to know a lot better are predicting an Olympic legacy that will transform our fey and pasty youth into rippled, rosy-cheeked titans. Before you know it, we'll all be getting up at 6am to throw a few of those falun gong manoeuvres before an ice bath and a wee herbal infusion.</p> <p>But if you take away the rowing and the cycling and a boutique sport such as yachting then Britain would still be down there fighting it out with some of the former Soviet republics and Holland for a place in the top 10. Only time will tell if the tens of millions of pounds spent on getting a clutch of golds in those luxury pursuits that are safely out of the reach of most of the planet have been well spent. I wouldn't hold my breath, though. And we await confirmation of the time of the first tumbleweed blowing through the Stratford site after the circus leaves town. In the meantime, the overwhelming majority of Britain's pupils who don't attend a school with its own water facility and properly maintained five-star sports tracks will do what they've always done: try to get into the school football team to chase their sporting dream.</p> <p>The Nationalist government in Scotland has a chance to make something worthwhile of the <a href=\"http://www.glasgow2014.com/\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Games when they arrive in Glasgow in 2014</a>. But they would do well to leave out all the political posturing. If the SNP are serious about leaving a proper and enduring legacy after 2014, they could put their Holyrood majority to good use for a change and end the ridiculous charitable status of our independent schools. Perhaps the money clawed back from these exclusive and self-serving institutions, with their sprawling sporting facilities, could be spent building modest sports centres in those areas where the only shooting that occurs is at the tip of a needle.</p> <p>And perhaps, too, they could prevent our Toytown local authorities selling off community playing fields while pretending that they care about childhood obesity and heart disease.</p>",
  "<p>Reading <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=13136\" title=\"\">Julia Copus</a>'s remarkable collection \u2013 her third \u2013 makes one think about the risks involved in writing personal poetry. \"Write about what you know\" is not fail-safe advice&#xa0;because intimate poetry, unless of the highest quality, often comes across as paradoxically anonymous. Or worse, as many of the collections that come my way reveal, it can be as unsavoury and depressing as rummaging through dresses in a secondhand clothes shop. The wonder of Copus's poems is that although they could hardly be more personal \u2013 childhood; the end of an affair; a sequence on IVF treatment \u2013 there is no self-indulgence and no sense, for the reader, of being an intruder.</p> <p>In \"Ghost\" she avoids the first person and keeps a tight rein on emotion. The \"weeping fig\" and pregnancy kit \"in pieces\" may set the emotional tone but Copus permits herself no release beyond the \"small, controlled explosion\" (which could be a description of the poem itself). Instead, the moment of seeing the weak blue stripe, the hint of a pregnancy refusing to confirm itself, is recorded. And she finds an ending at once lyrical, with its escape into marine metaphor, and anticlimactic, as the moment demands.</p> <p>Sometimes there is a sense in poetry that the emotion is in charge of the poet, but Copus has the upper hand throughout. There is something about the control, the high resolution, that gives this collection its special, contradictory emotional mixture: it is elegiac and buoyant. It's as if she were conscious, right from the start, that whatever life might throw at her, there is nothing poetry cannot catch. Not that this serves as banal therapy. Far from it. There is the awareness that while capturing a loss in words may amount to a small artistic triumph \u2013 and be balm \u2013 it cannot erase it.</p> <p>Reading Copus, one thinks of Robert Frost's \"<a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173536\" title=\"\">The Road Not Taken</a>\" and his famous lines: \"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood/ And sorry I could not travel both/ And be one traveller.\" Copus is interested in being that traveller. Poetry, she proposes, can imaginatively have it both ways. \"This is the Poem in which I have not left you\" is an interesting experiment in taking it all back, reconfiguring the past. At the same time it's a subtle reversal that reminds one of the desertion it seeks to avoid. There is something give-way about the rickety cottage to which she and her lover return. It has \"leaky\" windows and a \"broken\" gate and, one feels, might not last the poem. Copus has time at her mercy. In \"Miss Jenkins\" and \"Raymond, at 60\" she ingeniously shows how narrative can be reversible \u2013 time a concertina. She is always interested in exploring \"what ifs\". There is a wonderful, outlandish poem \"Heronkind\" in which she speculates about a heron in a fish-free world.</p> <p>This is a beautiful, arresting, sympathetic collection \u2013 and hospitable to the reader. Copus has more than one voice and a musical ability to change key. This is particularly apparent in the IVF poems which alternate between reportage \u2013 witty, contemporary, exterior \u2013 and a more inward, traditional lyricism. Especially moving&#xa0;is \"Inkling\", where the trailing sea frond from \"Ghost\" has been replaced in an almost Shakespearean dream of a new life&#xa0;beginning:</p> <p>\"Then, in the coracle of my womb,<br>I'll carry him gently, every inch<br>home<br>though the hour is late<br>in the lengthening light<br>to the crook of my arm, the bay's<br>curved shore,<br>water-lapped, twilit, secure.\"</p>",
  "<p>At mid-morning a text message interrupted Peter Sands on his Canadian holiday. The boss of Standard Chartered had just begun his summer break and was relaxing after presenting yet another set of record half-year profits to the City.</p> <p>That an American regulator had accused the bank of breaching financial sanctions against Iran was a bolt from a blue. It was Monday and there were just minutes of trading left in London when the report, which claimed that the bank had helped Iranian clients avoid US sanctions in 60,000 transactions worth $250bn (\u00a3160bn), landed.</p> <p>For several years Standard Chartered, a bank which had pulled through the financial crisis with a remarkably squeaky clean reputation, had been telling shareholders in its annual reports that it was \"in discussions\" with American regulators about \"historic\" sanction breaches. But the nature of the allegations made by the state of New York's department of financial services (DFS) were extraordinary.</p> <p>Despite the tiny trading window, the bank's shares lost 6% of their value on Monday, and by Tuesday morning were in freefall, losing nearly a quarter of their value at one stage, as investors ditched the stock amid fears that the bank could lose its crucial banking licence in New York.</p> <p>It is the latest sorry chapter in what has been a bad year for London's Square Mile, which is still digesting the record fine meted out to Barclays for attempting to rig Libor and the fulsome apology from HSBC, which admitted helping Mexican drug barons launder money.</p> <p>Just a week ago Standard Chartered had boasted it was too \"boring\" for scandals and if evidence were needed that Sands, Standard's group chief executive, and his top managers were unaware of the ambitious New York regulator Benjamin Lawsky was preparing to land, it lay in the fact that it took them an agonising eight hours to respond. Standard Chartered insisted that 99.9% of its transactions had been lawful and apologised that just under 300, worth a total of $14m, had breached the rules.</p> <p>Meanwhile investors used that time to pore over the report and it didn't look pretty, not least the tough talk attributed to a senior Standard Chartered executive who gave a New York colleague worried about sanctions busting, memorably short shrift: \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians?\"</p> <p>It didn't take them long to figure out that the diatribe was supposed to have been uttered by Richard Meddings, now the bank's highly regarded finance director. The bank insists that the quotation is inaccurate.</p> <p>By Tuesday, Sands was on an aircraft back to London, leaving his holiday with his in-laws and returning to the bank's head office to begin the fightback that is crucial not just to savage his own reputation but to help restore the battered fortunes of the City itself.</p> <p>In New York, where the bank's chairman, Sir John Peace, had flown to meet the bank's lawyers, the episode is held up as yet another example of the City of London's rotten core. \"It seems to be that every big trading disaster happens in London,\" US congresswoman Carolyn Maloney told the house financial services committee as it investigated JP&#xa0;Morgan's massive London losses earlier this summer.</p> <p>Ironically, until the 2008 banking crisis, London was being held up by US politicians as a model of financial dynamism. \"Go back to 2005, 2006 and London was the envy of New York,\" said Peter Henning, Wayne State University law professor. London had lighter regulation and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was regarded as \"toothless\", a trait which Henning said was admired by Wall Street bankers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg, New York's mayor, and New York senator Charles Schumer were warning that the city was being \"stifled by stringent regulations\" brought in after the Enron scandal.</p> <p>As Henning pointed out, much of the \u2013 admitted and alleged \u2013 misconduct at Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered happened during this envied period of \"light-touch\" regulation. \"Well now I think we are probably seeing the consequences,\" he added.</p> <p>With the City's regulatory framework being tightened by the coalition government, which is disbanding the FSA and handing control of bank oversight to the Bank of England, there is concern in London that the US politicians are being opportunistic.</p> <p>As well as the DFS, Standard Chartered is in discussions with four other agencies, including the treasury department's office of foreign assets control, but it seems that Lawsky broke ranks without informing the other agencies .</p> <p>Labour MP John Mann, no friend of the banking set, feared \"an increasing anti-British bias by US regulators and politicians aimed at shifting financial markets from London to New York\".</p> <p>Even Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King waded in to say that the UK authorities hoped the various US regulatory bodies would work together while chancellor George Osborne sought assurances from US treasury secretary Tim Geithner that Standard Chartered would be treated fairly, given that US regulators usually work on settlements together.</p> <p>\"There's an election coming and Wall Street versus Main Street is very much going to be part of the debate,\" said James Cox, Duke University law professor. \"It's far safer for a politician to pick on some foreign bank than it is to pick on Citigroup.\"</p> <p>Washington is on holiday now, but before setting off for their summer homes, the politicians started preparations for what could be an autumn of British bank-bashing. Both the senate banking committee and the house financial services committee are looking into Libor. Barclays former boss Bob Diamond, who quit in the wake of the interest-rate rigging scandal, could be called to testify.</p> <p>Lawsky's DFS does not take holidays and Standard Chartered has been summoned to a hearing at 10am in New York on Wednesday to explain why it should be allowed to keep its banking licence. Speculation was rife this weekend that the hearing could be postponed to allow the US regulators to work together to try and complete a joint settlement. Sands and the bank's lawyers will spend the weekend poring over the allegations, which they insist contain numerous factual inaccuracies.</p> <p>Last week the measured Sands admitted the accusations had been \"very damaging \u2026 we are going to have to work hard to restore the damage\". At stake is not only his reputation but that of Meddings, the bank, and arguably the entire City.</p>",
  "<p>She is glamorous, sexy and has a taste for Botox and the high life \u2013 even while in prison. But the remarkable career of Sandra \u00c1vila Beltr\u00e1n, an alleged Mexican drug lord, looks set to end in an American jail.</p> <p>\u00c1vila was last week extradited to the United States, where she faces charges related to a vast network of drug trafficking and the shadowy power of the infamous Sinaloa cartel. She arrived in Miami at the end of last week destined for a Florida courtroom.</p> <p>Dubbed the \"Queen of the Pacific\" due to her allegedly immense influence on drug supply routes, \u00c1vila is one of the most colourful figures to emerge in recent years from Mexico's narcotics industry and the appalling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/23/mexico-elections-drugs-war\" title=\"\">violence that has cost as many as 60,000 lives</a> there since a government offensive began in 2006. \"She is a very interesting figure. She is the first really sexy drug <em>capo</em> to get media attention. She was glamorous and vain and there has been a fascination with her because she is female,\" said Howard Campbell, an expert on the Mexican drug trade at the University of Texas at El Paso.</p> <p>Mexicans have long been fascinated with \u00c1vila, who is the subject of a famous drug ballad, or <em>narcocorrido</em>, sung by a band called Los Tucanes de Tijuana. \"The Queen of Queens\" features the line: \"The more beautiful the rose, the sharper the thorns.\"</p> <p>\u00c1vila is famed for her taste for fashionable clothes and is rumoured to have a doctor visit her in jail in Mexico to administer her Botox injections. She has complained that prison rules that stop her having food delivered to her cell from nearby restaurants are an infringement of her human rights. She is also believed to be the inspiration behind a popular Mexican TV soap opera, <em>La Reina del Sur</em>, about a beautiful young woman caught up in the dangerous world of the cartels.</p> <p>However, the real life \u00c1vila is not that young any more. Her exact age is uncertain \u2013 she is believed to be in her early 50s \u2013 but she has spent nearly all of her life in and around the murky world of the cartels. She is suspected to be a third-generation drug trafficker, having been born into a family with extensive connections to the drugs trade. She is the niece of Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo, an infamous Mexican drug godfather currently serving a 40-year jail sentence.</p> <p>Using family or marital connections and her feminine charms, \u00c1vila is thought to have risen up the ranks of the Sinaloa cartel by specialising in money laundering. But it was a dangerous world \u2013 both of her husbands have been assassinated.</p> <p>If falling for the Queen of the Pacific could be potentially lethal, it is also a lucrative career move. Investigators believe that her love affair with Colombian drug trafficker Juan Diego Espinosa provided a vital link between that South American country and the Sinaloa cartel. It also allegedly gave \u00c1vila control of the narcotics flowing from Colombia to Mexico's Pacific coast ports, thus earning \u00c1vila her now famous nickname and funding a lifestyle of luxury cars and dining in fine restaurants.</p> <p>Much of the fascination with \u00c1vila is because of her sex. The drugs trade is often seen as being dominated by macho men and fuelled by testosterone, but experts say women have always played a key role in the Mexican drugs business.</p> <p>Last year Mexican media reported that Enedina Arellano F\u00e9lix had become the country's first female cartel leader by taking charge of the Tijuana organisation. That phenomenon is seeping into popular culture too. In the latest Oliver Stone movie, <em>Savages</em>, glamorous Mexican actress Salma Hayek plays a ruthless female drug lord.</p> <p>\u00c1vila has everyone's attention now. After years on the run, she was arrested in Mexico in 2007 and eventually convicted on money laundering charges, despite claiming that she was just a simple housewife who sold clothes to make money and dabbled in real estate. However, the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence for a drug trafficking conviction.</p> <p>The American authorities have sought her extradition ever since. \u00c1vila battled hard against the move, not least through a vociferous media campaign. She has written a book and even gave an interview in 2009 to an American TV journalist, Anderson Cooper, when she blamed the Mexican government for allowing the drugs trade to flourish. \"It's obvious and logical. The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>This highly entertaining Scandinavian thriller unfolds in a series of flashbacks after a massacre just before Christmas at a seedy strip joint outside a small town near the border between Norway and Sweden south-west of Oslo. The only survivor, found covered in blood and clutching a gun under the corpse of a blowsy stripper, is Oscar, who manages a small factory employing ex-convicts. As the snow falls, he's interrogated by the sardonic Norwegian police detective Sol\u00f8r (a splendid performance from Henrik Mestad), who is constantly surprised by finding that Oscar's wildly unlikely story seems to add up. Funny, outrageous and often surprising, it manages to combine black comedy with convincing police procedural detail and is based on a story by the redoubtable Jo Nesb\u00f8, whose novel <em>Headhunters</em> was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/08/headhunters-jo-nesbo-film-review\" title=\"\">successfully filmed earlier this year</a>.

The indignation one feels over the vindictive bureaucrats who framed, persecuted and jailed him is tempered by the wit and humour with which he responded.</p> <p>His defiant art is often extremely funny. There are several heartbreaking moments, such as his 78-year-old mother expressing her pride and concern, and some beautiful images such as Ai walking across the hand-painted porcelain sunflower seeds in the Tate's Turbine Hall accompanied by his little son. The film ends with the words \"Never Retreat, Re-tweet\", a characteristically pawky variation on the battle cry of the American socialist martyr Joe Hill, \"Don't Grieve, Organise\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/28/guardianobituaries.film\" title=\"\">Hubert Selby Jr</a> is one of the masters of gritty, Beat-era stories peopled by the homeless, the poor, the desperate. Dismissed from the merchant marines for ill health at the age of 19, Selby decided to try writing. The lung problems he suffered through his life led him to become dependent on painkillers and heroin, experiences that informed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jan/12/fiction.film\" title=\"\"><em>Requiem</em></a>, a novel that is utterly convincing and terrifying on the subject of how our habits can destroy us.</p> <p>Written in stream-of-consciousness street slang \u2013 this edition has retained the /s used instead of apostrophes (their closer proximity on the typewriter allowed Selby to write more quickly) \u2013 the novel follows Harry Goldfarb and his best friend Tyrone C Love as they roll Harry's mother's television down to the pawn shop to get the cash to score a \"taste\". When Sara, Mrs Goldfarb, comes to collect it, we discover these japes are routine; also routine are Sara's excuses and indulgences for her only son. The fantasies she harbours have a tragicomic, hollow ring to them.</p> <p>Harry does in fact have a nice girl \u2013 Marion, from a well off, emotionally unengaged family. Together they revel in love and youth, sex and drugs, dreaming of an existence running a chain of arts-themed cafes. With Tyrone they come up with a money-making scheme and it appears they could all make their dreams come true \u2013 if only the scheme didn't involve selling heroin. Meanwhile, Mrs Goldfarb's addiction to food and television is transformed into something much more dangerous when she is offered the chance to be a TV quiz show contestant; the prospect of fame has her hitting the diet pills and spiralling mentally out of control.</p> <p>Although <em>Requiem</em> is something of a morality tale, it is never patronising \u2013 the characters are too involving and alive; the dialogue, mashed as it is into the paragraphs, is full of classic, brilliant New York banter (\"You lookin good man\u2026 Watch you do, change embalmers?\"). The ending, mostly tragic, is leavened with hope, and reflects the life of the author who on his deathbed refused the drugs he had been addicted to for decades.</p>",
  "<p>Inspections of sites identified as potential breeding grounds for legionnaires' disease have almost halved over the last three years.</p> <p>The sharp decline has resulted in warnings that cutbacks are having a damaging effect on public health and comes as officials continue to investigate several outbreaks of the disease, including one last month in Stoke-on-Trent in which two people died.</p> <p>There has been a 44% fall in the number of inspections into legionella \u2013 the bacterium that causes the disease \u2013 carried out by the Health and Safety Executive since 2009. The total level of proactive inspections fell from 833 in 2009 to 464 in 2011.</p> <p>Proactive inspections are carried out at sites that are considered to be at high risk of causing an outbreak of the disease, which is spread through infected water sources, particularly industrial cooling towers and air-conditioning systems. According to the HSE, 90% of outbreaks in the past 10 years were caused by businesses failing to identify risks and implement effective control measures.</p> <p>There are around 5,800 cooling sites in the UK, of which 2,900 undergo inspections by the HSE. The number of legionella inspections at cooling towers carried out by the HSE fell from 237 in 2010 to 134 in 2011, according to the figures released to <a href=\"http://www.ehn-online.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Environmental Health News</em></a>.</p> <p>Graham Jukes, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, warned of a \"ticking time bomb\". He said: \"My concern is that, over time, we will see increases in the number of accidental deaths or outbreaks of disease that could be prevented from proactive actions.\"</p> <p>In June more than 100 people in Edinburgh contracted legionnaires' disease in an outbreak believed to have stemmed from a cooling tower. Three people died. A leading bacteriologist, Professor Hugh Pennington, has called for a public inquiry into the outbreak and a \"root-and-branch\" review of regulatory policy.</p> <p>He described the fall in inspections as \"highly unsatisfactory\". He added: \"The great majority of cooling towers can only be having inspections once every 10 years, some probably less.\"</p> <p>The number of deaths from legionnaires' disease has halved over the past three years but Pennington said this had been achieved through improvements in intensive care.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the HSE said it was the responsibility of operators of cooling sites to ensure they did not pose a risk to public health and that inspections were only one of a number of measures deployed in combating disease. She said the figures related only to legionella-focused inspections and did not include general inspections that might also reveal the bacteria.</p>",
  "<p>The defining characteristic of modern American politics is the growing conservatism, even radicalisation, of the Republican party. Beginning in 2009 with the birth of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\" title=\"\">Tea Party movement</a>, a party that was already fairly conservative began moving to an even more isolated spot on the American political spectrum. The result was, and is, an unprecedented period of legislative obstructionism, pronounced political polarisation and a party that is more ideologically conservative than perhaps at any point in history.</p> <p>It's a process unlikely to be reversed in the near future. The party's rightward tilt is going to get worse before it gets better and the polarisation of American politics and the extremism of the Republican party looks increasingly like the rule, rather than the exception.</p> <p>To explain why, move past the presidential election for a moment. Start in Texas where, in a Republican primary, Tea Party darling <a href=\"http://lubbockonline.com/editorial-columnists/2012-08-11/hightower-texas-cruz-control-illustrates-just-how-goofy-politics-has#.UCY3979y9E4\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz </a>defeated the state's Republican lieutenant governor, David Dewhurst. Cruz's victory was not necessarily the result of him being more conservative than his opponent. In fact, one would be hard pressed to find many policy differences between them. But Dewhurst was seen as a fixture of the Republican establishment while Cruz was viewed as a member of the party's insurgent, anti-establishment wing, vehemently opposed to any compromise of core values.</p> <p>Next we go to Kansas, where in Tuesday's Republican primaries for the state Senate, conservative candidates, pushed by the state's Republican governor, Sam Brownback, and backed by dollars from the infamous <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/11/billionaire-koch-brothers-fail-in-hitting-comedian-zach-galifianakis.html\" title=\"\">Koch brothers,</a> trounced all but one of the body's remaining moderate Republicans. Then Missouri, where congressman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/todd-akin-republican-missouri-senate?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Todd Akin,</a> another conservative darling, won a Republican Senate primary versus two more moderate contenders. Now a grain of salt is necessary here. In several of these races, Republican \"establishment\" candidates were beaten for reasons other than just ideology. None the less, it's simply impossible to ignore the unmistakable signs of ideological transformation in the party. Outside money, from anti-tax and anti-government zealots such as the Koch brothers' <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/koch-brothers-obama-campaign-americans-for-prosperity-donors_n_1316537.html\" title=\"\">Americans for Prosperity</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.teapartyexpress.org/\" title=\"\">Tea Party Express</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clubforgrowth.org/\" title=\"\">Club for Growth</a> as well as from social conservative groups such as Ralph Reed's <a href=\"http://ffcoalition.com/\" title=\"\">Faith and Freedom Coalition</a>, was a decisive factor \u2013 and not simply in advertising dollars, but also in improving conservative turnout. So too was the support of Tea Party favourites such as former Alaska governor and 2008 vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin and South Carolina senator Jim DeMint.</p> <p>The larger message from these political events is hard to ignore. If you are a Republican officeholder, what is the incentive to risk crossing the Tea Party or the Koch brothers? Is there any reason to consider political compromise or conciliation with Democrats, knowing that to do so means tempting a Tea Party challenge and millions of dollars in out-of-state cash being used to end your political career? The smart move for Republicans, indeed the only move, is to stay on the \"right\" side of the political fence. While this lesson has been hammered into the heads of Republican politicians over the last two election cycles, it is also evident on the presidential level. When Mitt Romney first ran for elected office in Massachusetts in 1994, he cast himself as a relatively centrist, technocratic businessman. He took more moderate positions on divisive social issues such as abortion and in a year in which Republicans had the political momentum at their back assiduously avoided being linked to Newt Gingrich and the national party.</p> <p>When he ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002, he strayed only marginally from those positions, continuing to stress his pro-choice bona fides and even adopted a position on gun control that ran counter to the powerful National Rifle Association. As late as 2008, when he first ran for president, Romney was prone to tout his one major domestic policy initiative \u2013 healthcare reform.</p> <p>Those were the days. As the Republicans have moved consistently further to the right Romney has followed the crowd, adopting increasingly strident political positions. This was true throughout the Republican primary season as Romney, facing off against a motley collection of Tea Party-approved also-rans, was forced to take stances on immigration, government spending, taxes, abortion and a host of other issues favoured by the party's most conservative members but that left him vulnerable to Democratic counterattack.</p> <p>Illegal immigration is perhaps the best example. It's an issue that is a veritable cri de coeur for the Tea Party and Romney embraced their views to the point where he attacked unpopular Texan governor Rick Perry for insufficient rigour in cutting social services for illegal immigrants in the state. It gave Romney a boost in the Republican primaries but also provides a hint as to why he is losing Hispanic voters to Obama by a 2-1 margin.</p> <p>But the romancing of the Tea Party continues. Just last week, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/guest-voices/post/obamas-war-on-religion-breaking-down-romneys-new-attack-ad/2012/08/10/9f9ece3e-e2fd-11e1-a25e-15067bb31849_blog.html\" title=\"\">Romney campaign </a>ran two controversial ads, one attacking Obama on welfare benefits, the other accusing the president of declaring a war on religion, because of his backing of a provision of the healthcare law that forces businesses to provides contraceptive services to their employees. Both ads are basically made-up attacks; lies for lack of a better word. But the mendacity of the Romney campaign is by now well chronicled.</p> <p>What's more interesting is the target for them: conservative voters who recoil at the thought of welfare cheats absconding with their taxpayer dollars and religious voters convinced by years of Republican rhetoric that their faith is under assault. Just as Republicans in the Senate have reason to be fearful of the wrath of the Tea Party, so does Romney. Just three weeks before his convention, he is in the uncomfortable position of reassuring the right about his conservative bona fides.</p> <p>With confirmation that Romney has selected a conservative favourite, Wisconsin congressman <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-to-announce-running-mate-saturday-in-va/2012/08/10/aaeb8ce4-e363-11e1-89f7-76e23a982d06_story.html\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan,</a> to be his running mate the capturing of Romney by the far right is complete. While Ryan is popular on the right, he is the author of the so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/romney-vice-president-paul-ryan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ryan budget</a>, a House of Representatives-passed bill that would eviscerate the social safety net and end the federal senior health programme, Medicare. His selection allows the Obama campaign to attack Romney even more directly over the most unpopular elements of the Ryan budget (which the candidate has already foolishly endorsed). It is a disastrous pick, but is emblematic of the extent to which Romney's hands have been tied by the Tea Party. Pacifying them is as important as reaching out to less conservative voters. Rather than leading the GOP, Romney is simply following the herd.</p> <p>But why should he be any different from the rest of the Republican party? In just four short years, any ideological variance has been washed almost completely out of the party. Republican moderates are something one reads about in history books rather than sees with one's own eyes.</p> <p>The Tea Party has become the Republican party. And if Romney should win in November his moderate political instincts (if they haven't been completely eroded by years of pandering to the right) will be no match for the sound and fury of Congressional Republicans who will demand fealty to their agenda. If that happens, Americans can say goodbye to large chunks of the social welfare state they often deride in the abstract but love in its specifics, such as Medicare, federal education funding, environmental and workplace regulation.</p> <p>If Romney loses in November, which increasingly appears likely, don't expect soul-searching within the Republican party. Instead, conservatives will likely convince themselves their mistake was failing to nominate a true rightwinger rather than Romney's brand of wannabe conservatism. As for Congress, the primary wins for Cruz, Akin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/09/indiana-us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">Richard Mourdock </a>\u2013 even if they lose in November \u2013 will mean that a body full of Republican politicians will toe the new party line. There will be zero political incentive to compromise with Obama and risk a challenge from the right. Ongoing challenges from a crumbling infrastructure \u2013 under-performing schools, growing environmental challenges and, above all, chronically high unemployment and an inadequate economic recovery \u2013 will likely see precious little attention from Washington.</p> <p>In short, the polarisation and dysfunction that have wrecked American politics over the past three and a half years will almost certainly continue. Through a combination of fear and intimidation, the far right of the Republican Party is today enforcing ideological rigidness in its purest and most uncompromising form, where even the slightest variation from the norm is reason for expulsion and exclusion. In the process, it is holding the US government hostage to its ideological whims. Welcome to the new normal in American politics.</p>",
  "<p>Another week, another UK economic data dump to provoke furious beard-stroking from our dismal scientists.</p> <p>Firstly the simple stuff: Tuesday's consumer price inflation figures, that seem certain to reaffirm recent moves within touching distance of the Bank of England's 2% target. But after that, things might get more complex.</p> <p>Wednesday will bring the unemployment figures for July, which are predicted to show a modest rise \u2013 good news that appears at odds with weak data elsewhere in the economy, including the UK's sliding GDP. That divining rod will be followed by what are expected to be stagnant retail sales figures from the ONS on Thursday.</p> <p>So, depending on which political party you prefer, the economy is either performing better than the figures show, or the numbers aren't telling the real labour-market story. But economists are rarely burdened by such certainty (or courage) so many will argue that both (or neither) scenario is correct: that each indicator is broadly accurate, but it is productivity that has weakened.</p> <p>For those still awake at the back, Bank governor Sir Mervyn King made a similar argument last week and many in the City reckon he may be right about slumping productivity. And, no, he wasn't talking about Threadneedle Street's own output during the crisis.</p> <h2>Virgin Rail bid likely to hit buffers<br></h2> <p>British rail passengers were once urged to \"let the train take the strain\" \u2013 but after assuming the responsibility on the west coast line for 15 years, Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Rail may soon be relieved of the burden.</p> <p>The government is poised to announce the winner of a new 14-year contract to operate the franchise, with an announcement pencilled in for this week \u2013 though, as with all things rail, keep an eye out for last-minute delays.</p> <p>Still, Branson's bid seems to be stuck firmly in the sidings and, like an angry commuter inconvenienced by a late-running service, the tycoon is resorting to haranguing the guards. He has penned a missive to the prime minister to remind him that governments have a record of accepting pumped-up bids for franchises that collapse (such as National Express on the east coast line) and suggesting that rival FirstGroup \u2013 which is believed to have outbid Virgin with an offer of up to \u00a37bn \u2013 will be forced to cut the quality of the services.</p> <p>Still, Whitehall looks likely to award the contract to the highest bidder in a competition where there are only prizes for coming first. All of which makes a mockery of Virgin Trains' slogan: Love every second.</p> <h2>Better times for JJB?<br></h2> <p>A big week for JJB Sports, the struggling sportswear and equipment retailer, whose future is again on the agenda of gossiping City types. The chain emerged on Friday as a possible target of private equity tycoon Jon Moulton, who remains best known for his failed attempt to rescue MG&#xa0;Rover in 2000.</p> <p>Moulton is believed to be offering to buy troubled JJB's debt via his firm Better Capital, in a move that would effectively hand him control. (Moulton, currently on a kayaking break, says that his interest has been somewhat overstated.) That vignette will interest Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley (for whom JJB is practically his only \u2013 if a rather feeble \u2013 competitor) as well as JJB's 47% shareholder, Invesco, which is also thought to be chasing a similar debt deal.</p> <p>Moulton is an entertaining and candid man who, on leaving his last firm, Alchemy, apologised to investors for making \"too many investment and people errors\".</p> <p>He pledged to raise his game (hence Better Capital) and is now chasing a retailer in urgent need of improvement, having just warned investors that JJB is running out of cash only four months after receiving a \u00a330m injection.</p> <p>For JJB's 4,000 staff, it might prove rather simple to believe in Better.</p>",
  "<p>First the good news: this government is disintegrating. Second, the bad news: the disintegration will take some time, and meanwhile even more economic and social damage is likely to be wreaked on a public that by now ought not to be quite as unsuspecting as it was.</p> <p>The Olympics have, of course, been a wonderful diversion from the harsh reality that will soon return. Those of us who never got our act together to abandon the metropolis for the duration of the Games are thanking our lucky stars.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are thanking neither the stars nor their coalition \"partners\". They have plainly been taken for a ride. In their desperation to achieve their reform of the House of Lords they entered into a Faustian pact with the Conservatives. In the process, they allowed themselves to be frightened by the Treasury and the Bank of England into believing that the British economy's financing problems were on a par with those of Greece.</p> <p>Right from the beginning a handful of commentators, including your own correspondent, tried to warn them that this was far from the case; that the British debt position was one of the strongest in the western world; and that a deficit reduction programme was a worthy goal when an economy was growing fast, but likely to delay such a recovery if embarked on prematurely.</p> <p>Indeed, when the economy is depressed, and business and the general public (we so-called consumers) are cutting back, the only way to prevent the situation from becoming worse is for the public sector to fill the gap, not to make it even bigger.</p> <p>\"Healey's Law\" has been quoted before in this column and is worth repeating. It goes as follows: \"When you are in a hole, don't dig any deeper.\" As for all that public sector borrowing, it is being done at negligible interest rates \u2013 much lower than the rate at which the private sector can borrow for all those \"private\" infrastructure initiatives the government is doctrinally trying to encourage. As Robert Stheeman, head of the UK Debt Management Office, observes: \"It's extraordinary. If you had told me just a few years ago how low they [the UK's borrowing costs] could go, I wouldn't have believed you.\"</p> <p>Stheeman has always been confident of the strength of the UK's position, often pointing to the very long average maturity of the debt (some 14 years).</p> <p>However, chancellor Osborne did not do us any favours by stressing, foolishly and far too often, that the UK's credit rating (given by the very agencies who failed to spot the imminence of the global financial crisis) was the be-all-and-end-all of the tests of the coalition's deficit reduction strategy. Now the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, can be heard proclaiming that it is not the be-all-and-end-all. Why? Because it is not working.</p> <p>Whitehall insiders recognise when a government is beginning to fall apart: Ministers become more obsessed than usual with \"tomorrow's headlines\". And the more obsessed they become, the worse are the headlines. Even those of us with long memories wrack our brains to think of any budget that has fallen apart so quickly as George Osborne's abysmal effort this year.</p> <p>Things have reached a pretty pass when even the International Monetary Fund urges the chancellor to think of easing up on the deficit reduction strategy and consider introducing temporary tax cuts. As it is, the premature rise in VAT to 20% is likely to go down as one of the great fiscal misjudgments in recent British economic history.</p> <p>Things have become so desperate that the refunds being made by the banks of mis-sold payment protection insurance are now being talked up as a reflationary measure. This, assuredly, as Dr Johnson said of patriotism, is \"the last refuge of a scoundrel\" \u2013 although I hesitate, for legal reasons, to call George Osborne a scoundrel.</p> <p>Talking of Osborne, one notes that there is much speculation about a cabinet reshuffle, although there is also much guidance that this will not involve the most obvious candidate for such a shuffle, namely the chancellor.</p> <p>Cameron's more illustrious predecessors, such as Harold Macmillan, would have had no hesitation in giving a discredited chancellor his marching orders. But to sack Osborne would of course be to admit the failure of the strategy, and invite retribution from the rating agencies. A Macmillan, of course, would have been big enough to call their bluff.</p>",
  "<p>Set against the topical background of the 2011 riots, <em>Offender</em> has the not unfamiliar plot of a man getting himself sent to jail in order to exact vengeance on some incarcerated criminals. In this case, a London teenager infiltrates a young offenders' institution to track down the gang who violently assaulted his pregnant girlfriend to prevent her giving evidence in a murder trial. The detail is realistic and it's a decent enough genre piece.

  "<p>Two little words begin to dominate media matters, words as legally potent as that infernal \"public interest\" definition dilemma that still eludes Lord Justice Leveson's best efforts. Turn to the defamation bill \u2013 the long-awaited move to clean up Britain's libel laws, now jogging through parliament \u2013 and there they lie at the heart of the reform. Do you think you've been libelled and want to sue? Then be sure you've suffered \"serious harm\".</p> <p>People unused to the wonders of British libel might take such palpable damage for granted, of course. But they haven't been following the way that \u2013 especially in American eyes \u2013 London has turned into the libel tourism capital of the world.</p> <p>Suppose, notionally, that you're Prince Boris Buzzoffsky of Ruritania and your last wife but three has posted a letter in the Hentzau Gazette accusing you of cheating at dominoes. Maybe only four copies of the said Gazette<em> </em>ever reach England. Maybe there's no evidence that anybody reads them or cares about your domino deceptions. But here come a willing troop of QCs, juniors, solicitors et al, eager to spend another two weeks in the Strand taking your money and bathing your wounds.</p> <p>The serious question henceforth will be: what hurts, apart from your pride and bank balance? Has a great corporation, howling libel, lost business? Has an author lost sales or contracts? Has a family fractured? That's serious harm, not cynical game-playing; a change for the good because it involves real, not confected hurt. But can such welcome seriousness truly stop there, tucked away in one discrete region of media law?</p> <p>Even Leveson probably wonders about that when he pushes tweets and blogs lower down his scale of seriousness. Are two sentences on Twitter as serious as two paragraphs in the <em>Times</em>? And, wandering into hacking territory, is a hack that the hacked one doesn't realise has happened until a policeman tells him so six years later as repugnant as the misleading of the desperate family Dowler? \"Victim\" is a very elastic word.</p> <p>Use the word \"serious\" then, and you automatically invoke ordinary common sense in ordinary language we can all understand. Is it sensible for police to descend on the house of <em>Sun</em> journalists to make an arrest when they could simply have asked the reporters to turn up at a police station? No, according to Tom Mockridge, the head minder of Wapping, because his News International is turning over every jot of evidence to the cops. Serious justice? Serious demos? A serious waste of police manpower?</p> <p>No one, for a second, is pushing thoughts of serious criminality aside here, or in many other reaches of the media scene. And \"serious harm\" doesn't even apply in libel yet, let alone wash across wider media borders. Nevertheless, it inevitably becomes more relevant to apply its tests day by day, to set harm in a context which counts its true cost.</p> <p>Maybe Leveson, as he hopes, will find a way to settle more disputes on a quick, level playing field devoid of silks. That would be common sense, too. But neither he nor we should get too excited yet. There are too many specialist eagles who know that any reform would mean fewer briefs, less cash \u2013 and thus very serious harm.</p> <p>\u25a0 Roll over, Jonathan Ross; bury your head in shame, Brucie; calm down, Paxo and Gary.

  "<p>The modern pentathlon is one of the great endurance events \u2013 and that is just for the spectators. Three hours of fencing, half an hour of swimming, two hours of showjumping and a 20-minute run interspersed with a bit of shooting. The crowd are left exhausted, so goodness knows how David Svoboda of the Czech Republic felt.</p> <p>Just after 7pm on Saturday he came home first ahead of 35 rivals to win Olympic gold and lay claim to the title of the world's best all-round male athlete \u2013 the women get their turn on Sunday. Cao Zhongrong from China took silver and Hungary's Adam Marosi bronze.</p> <p>Britain's Nick Woodbridge, the world No9, was 10th and Sam Weale 13th. Both were bitterly disappointed not to get among the medals, and the 26-year-old Woodbridge said that if he didn't think he could progress he would quit the sport. \"I'd rather give up than always be 10th. I thought I could get a medal here but I couldn't pull it all together. I feel more disappointed for the crowd than for myself \u2013 my disappointment will come later. They came along wanting something to cheer. They cheered in the warm-up; they cheered at every possible moment. I've never had a crowd like this, and I don't think I will again.\"</p> <p>Weale, the world No15, was also unhappy with his performance \u2013 three places worse than at Beijing. He said he struggled in the fencing, the first of the five disciplines, and never really clawed it back. On the plus side, he thought so close a competition played out in front of a large crowd could only be good for the sport. \"I hope we've made a few new pentathlon fans today, who've seen what a wonderful sport this is,\" he said.</p> <p>The modern pentathlon celebrates its centenary at this Olympics, so it is not actually very modern at all. The \"modern\" is used to distinguish it from the ancient Greek pentathlon. The updated version was created by Pierre de Coubertin, father of the modern Games, and legend has it that he imagined a Napoleonic cavalry officer stranded in hostile territory who had to fight a duel, swim for his life, ride an unfamiliar horse, shoot his enemies and then run for home. Hence the five disciplines \u2013 fencing, swimming, riding (on horses drawn in a lottery), shooting and running. Bizarrely, the last two take place simultaneously, with runners on the 3km course stopping to shoot every 1,000m. It is charmingly bonkers.</p> <p>Despite being De Coubertin's defining Olympic event \u2013 he said it would test mental as well as physical prowess and produce the \"ideal, complete athlete\" \u2013 its future at the Games is cloudy. There have been attempts to oust it, with critics attacking the military associations and arguing that it has little appeal beyond eastern Europe. But Klaus Schormann, president of the International Modern Pentathlon Union, claims the sport is growing worldwide and dismisses stories that it may not take its place in future Olympics as \"rumours\". \"These stories have been around for 20 years,\" he said. \"I don't care about them.\"</p> <p>One problem is that while fun for the competitors, who get to wear several different types of very fetching apparel, it can be tough on spectators. The fencing was tricky to follow, with nine one-minute bouts taking place simultaneously. The Russian world No1, Aleksander Lesun, and double Olympic champion Andrei Moiseev were the favourites, but Lesun faded after a strong showing in the fencing and could finish only fourth, while age caught up with the great Moiseev, who finished seventh. He is now 33 and has never quite recaptured his old form after a leg injury sustained in a car accident in 2009.</p> <p>Woodbridge blamed his failure to challenge for medals on his fencing. \"I knew I needed to get off to a good start and I did, but then it fell apart,\" he said. \"I stopped being aggressive and started to worry about losing.\"</p> <p>Svoboda performed strongly in the fencing and was never out of the top two. Cao briefly headed him after a powerful 200m freestyle swim but then lost points in the showjumping and, after briefly leading again at the start of the run, eventually succumbed on the third lap round Greenwich Park. Svoboda won by six seconds, which equates to 24 points in pentathalese. It was a remarkable victory after two lean years in which he struggled to maintain his motivation.</p> <p>The second Chinese competitor, Wang Guan, had a less happy afternoon than the silver medal-winning Cao. At one stage in the fencing he had fought 15 bouts and lost 15 \u2013 all the 36 competitors fence against each other \u2013 but he pulled it back to finish on 12 out of 35, joint last. Then in the showjumping phase \u2013 the whole shooting match had decamped from Stratford to Greenwich after the swim in the Aquatics Centre \u2013 poor Wang fell off his horse in the practice area, injured his back and had to withdraw.</p> <p>The Korean Hwang Woojin had a horrible fall on the same horse when it reared up, and was fortunate to avoid serious injury. Hwang bravely got back on and finished the course, but he had a mountain of time penalties and eventually finished well down the field. Coubertin, though, would have been proud of him. The Olympic spirit lives on.</p>",

Two goals from the 28-year-old centre-forward Oribe Peralta were answered only by a 91st-minute effort from Hulk, although Oscar, who will start the Premier League season with Chelsea, missed a wonderful opportunity to send the final into extra time with only a handful of seconds remaining.</p> <p>In May 1961 Mexico arrived at Wembley and suffered an 8-0 battering at the hands of the England of Johnny Haynes, Bobby Robson and Bobby Charlton, who scored a hat-trick. On Saturday their fans were setting off a Mexican wave five minutes into the match, in celebration of an opening goal which had come 29 seconds after the kick-off. Never has that usually intrusive and irrelevant ritual seemed more appropriate to the occasion.</p> <p>Coached by Luis Fernando Tena, Mexico worked hard, took their chances and defended with spirit. Brazil, as so often in recent years under a succession of coaching regimes, glittered with talent but lacked application and method. This was their third defeat in Olympic finals \u2013 they lost to France in 1984 and to the Soviet Union in 1988 \u2013 and it will be taken seriously back home. It may even cost their head coach, Mano Menezes, his job, since there was little sign on Saturday of progress towards the construction of a side capable of regaining the World Cup on home territory in two years' time.</p> <p>Once again London did its distinguished visitors proud as the sunshine that bathed Jamaica's sprinters turned up again for the footballers of South and Central America, and for a crowd of 86,162 who had arrived to witness the climax to a tournament that some British commentators had derided as irrelevant. A crowd 80,203 had turned up at the same venue 48 hours earlier to watch an excellent women's final between the United States and Japan, a world record for an Olympic football match featuring female teams. In the group stage almost 77,000 had thought it worth paying to see Gabon versus South Korea.</p> <p>This tournament has been a triumph, fully worthy of its place in the great international pageant of sport, and if it deserved a better final than it got that was hardly the fault of the winners. Mexico is a country in which the passion for the game runs deep but despite regular qualification for the World Cup \u2013 and places in the quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986, when the tournament was held on their home soil \u2013 their results have never lived up to that enthusiasm. Before this their only tournament victory had come when they beat Brazil to win Fifa's Confederations Cup, a second-tier tournament, in 1999.</p> <p>The statue of Bobby Moore overlooking Wembley Way welcomed the teams under a sun as bright as that in Guadalajara when the England captain and Pel\u00e9 embraced after a wonderful World Cup match in 1970. If there was no evident sign of the greatest Brazilian of them all on Saturday, that may have been something to do with one of his long-standing commercial affiliations: he is a spokesman for Mastercard and, as the Olympic slogan has it \"we are proud only to accept Visa\".</p> <p>Mexico, their starting XI consisting entirely of players from clubs in their domestic league, were given a wonderful start in the opening minute after Rafael da Silva, Manchester United's Brazilian right-back, played a loose pass infield and saw Javier Aquino deflect the ball to Peralta, who drove a low, firm right-foot shot inside the near post.</p> <p>Brazil, whose side were picked from five foreign leagues as well as their own, took 20 minutes to find any sort of pattern at all, though their attacking momentum improved when Hulk came on for Alex Sandro after half an hour. The Porto forward's swerving drive gave Jos\u00e9 Corona, Mexico's goalkeeper, his first really uncomfortable moment, and Marcelo, the Real Madrid left-back, placed a shot wide after a move involving Oscar and Leandro Dami\u00e3o. When the much-coveted Neymar shot wide moments before the interval, it seemed as though Brazil may be coming to life.</p> <p>Oscar delivered promising passes for Neymar on a couple of occasions early in the second half but the arrival of Alexandre Pato, the Milan forward, in place of Sandro, Tottenham's defensive midfielder, did little more than make it easier for Peralta to run across the face of goal without obstruction in the 75th minute to meet Marco Fabi\u00e1n's right-wing corner with a firm downward header past Gabriel, Brazil's defenceless goalkeeper.</p> <p>Another grotesque misjudgment by Rafael in the 84th minute \u2013 a misplaced backheel from the touchline inside his own half \u2013 brought the defender into a nose-to-nose confrontation with his team-mate Juan Jesus, and a minute later he was making way for Lucas.</p> <p>Four minutes of time were added on, and in the first of them Hulk chased a long ball before shooting across Corona. When the same player produced an inswinging cross from the right two minutes later, the fate of the gold medal seemed in the balance as Oscar rose alone to meet it at the near post. But the tall, slender \u00a325m 20-year-old could only direct his header wide, sending Brazil home to contemplate what will surely be a difficult and disputatious two years.</p>",
  "<p>I have occasionally been a bit troubled by those old Path\u00e9 newsreel clips of British sporting events in which, at climactic moments, the men in the crowd chuck their hats \u2013 flat caps and trilbys \u2013 in the air, and turn to clap one another on worsted and gabardined backs. It always seemed incongruous this Depression-era hat-hurling, and the film clips left the story unfinished: was there always a confusing and awkward five minutes on the terraces subsequently when all the hats were politely returned to their rightful owners, and bashed back into shape? And what of the impulse itself? Reckless, un-British, an expression of simple, unselfconscious joy \u2013 it seemed to come from another place entirely. I never quite understood it. I never quite understood it, that is, until this past fortnight.</p> <p>Journalists, even sports writers, are supposed to display professional detachment and reserve while working. They are supposed to hold tight to their cynicism, retain their objectivity, keep their seen-it-all-before expressions in place while all about them are losing theirs. Still, there have been several occasions in the last week or two when even in the press seats it has been clear that the only honest human response to what is happening<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUOl7PgggZw\" title=\"\"> has been to stand up and yell and scream along with everyone else</a>.</p> <p>It happened to me first at the rowing at Eton Dorney, the British men's eight clinging on for a heroic bronze. And then in the sub-tropical heat of the velodrome, when the ultimately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/02/britain-disqualified-women-sprint-final\" title=\"\">ill-fated women's team sprinters</a> smashed the world record on their very first ride. As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/05/mo-farah-olympics-2012-athletics\" title=\"\">Mo Farah rounded the top bend </a>in that unforgettable 10,000m race last Saturday, I was lucky enough to be sitting right at the end of the final straight and so could see the first of his life-loving, eye-bulging, you-can't-catch-me sprint for the line head on. I was right on deadline and in a panic not only to find fresh superlatives for the most electric hour of sport I had ever witnessed, but to string together any kind of coherent sentence at all. But even so I was on my feet roaring with 80,000 others. And as I jumped up, a thought popped into my head: I really wished I had a hat, so I could chuck it as far as I could up in the night air, and not worry about where it fell.</p> <p>Team GB has a motto, which has adorned the back of thousands of souvenir shirts at the park and beyond, \"Better never stops\". For more than a week now, as all but the most diehard naysayer has turned into an Olympic utopian, better has for once appeared the only option.</p> <p>It started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/28/olympics-2012-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's opening ceremony</a>. Of all the thousands of decisions that Lord Coe made about these Games, the one to give a free hand to the director to set its tone was probably the most inspired. I remember<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/05/danny-boyle-interview-tim-adams\" title=\"\"> talking to Boyle about the prospect, 18 months ago</a>. It had first come about, he mentioned, when Coe had dropped him a heartfelt note to say how much he had been moved by <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>, which had conjured up for the Olympic peer memories of the Delhi he knew from his Indian mother's family. When Coe asked Boyle if he would put together an opening act for 2012, it was no doubt that kind of \"Jai Ho\" inclusiveness that he imagined for the Games.</p> <p>The ceremony established narratives about London, and Britain, which the past fortnight has come to exemplify. Boyle sought to summon the magic of <em>The Tempest</em> in his Isles of Wonder theme, and you could half-imagine him channelling Prospero's control-freakery in subsequently orchestrating the plotlines he had set in motion. Some of these were obvious enough, but still thrilling: the contribution of the Windrush generation to the life not just of this country but directly to this Olympic team. The celebration of what the tweeting Tory MP Aidan Burley called \"multicultural crap\" was not only a theoretical value but a living example of possibility and achievement and love in the family of Jessica Ennis, and the soon to be expanding family of Mo Farah, among many others.</p> <p>And then there was the inspiring dramatisation of the virtue of simply being part of something bigger than yourself. The 10,000 volunteers who created the ceremony gave up four months of weekends to rehearse, 10 hours per day. Their enthusiasm at being here was properly rewarded with the biggest cheer of the night. That enthusiasm, given and received, continued in the spirit of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/olympic-volunteers-happy-to-help\" title=\"\">the 70,000 other \"Games makers\"</a>, of all backgrounds and from far and wide, who quickly became the human face of these Olympics, welcoming and marshalling with unfailing good humour, proud just to be involved.</p> <p>In some senses Boyle's exuberant vision appeared to have been conceived not only in response to the regimented order of Beijing, but also to the joyous but deferential spirit of the recent jubilee. In his still respectful script, the Queen was cast as one willing volunteer among many thousands. The cult of celebrity was likewise represented in cheerful quote marks \u2013 Becks in a speedboat! \u2013 without once forgetting that the superstars of our history, and of our present, were the people who had forged trade unions and created the NHS, the innovators and artists who had pioneered the freedom and dissent and tolerance of our democracy, and those who had fought for its preservation.</p> <p>The presence of the military at these Games was an afterthought, but as it has turned out a hugely welcome one. G4S's incompetence allowed British crowds an opportunity to show spontaneous respect for the Abide with Me sacrifices of young men and women back from Helmand, every time the big-screen cameras panned to them. And rarely can security checks have been more briskly efficient or warmly received.</p> <p>Though no doubt in the coming months politicians of all shades will try to make \"this is for everyone\" capital out of these Games, the overwhelming message from them is that \u2013 though political will made them possible \u2013 it is people, athletes and organisers and workers and volunteers who gave them their generous heart. The prime minister seems keen to build from the Games an argument for greater red-in-tooth-and-claw competition among schoolchildren, as if the single goal of the Games was to create more medal winners.</p> <p>What these Olympics have been about, though, is not the necessity of being the best, but the pleasures of finding out the best you can be. The rewards of dedication and participation should be the message, not some winner-takes-all elitism.</p> <p>Another vexed national question in the coming months will be this one: who is the most worthy winner of BBC Sports Personality of the Year? Should it be Bradley Wiggins, who set the ball rolling with his modfather sideburns on his golden throne? The mesmerising Jessica Ennis, who trumped David Bowie's suggestion that \"we could be heroes just for one day\" and did it effortlessly for two? Andy Murray burying his demons and Roger Federer, and finally finding love with the Great British Public? The seafaring great Ben Ainslie, ruling the waves off Portland Bill? The <em>Boy's Own</em> triathlete Alistair Brownlee, who engineered not only his own gold, but helped to secure kid brother Jonny's bronze? The non-stop giggling phenomenon that is Laura Trott, overnight heroine of asthmatics everywhere? Or the incomparable Sir Chris Hoy? Or mighty Mo himself?</p> <p>A more pertinent question might be: what have we done to deserve all these brilliant and vivid characters? There has been the usual British obsession, media-fuelled,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/05/ennis-farah-murray-state-school-myth\" title=\"\"> of separating them out in terms of perceived class</a>, as if the only thing that counted about anyone, ever, was where they went to school. But these didn't seem to be questions any of the team were asking themselves. They were not only called Team GB, they behaved like Team GB, drawing energy from each other across all disciplines, from dressage to boxing, as well as from the brilliant crowds. In post-race interviews, and on the various crowded BBC sofas, winners and losers, to a man and woman, also appeared to be walking articulations of Kipling's If: humble and emotional in victory, gracious and dignified in defeat.</p> <p>One legacy of these Games worth having would be a demand from the replica-shirt buying public, long fed \"the price of everything\" ethos of the Premiership, for a resurgence in values of sportsmanship. The football season starts next weekend, and rarely can there have been less appetite for sheikh-and-oligarch-funded hundred-grand-a-week egos. Next time you watch Alex Ferguson apoplectic about some perceived refereeing error or John Terry snarling, it might be hard not to bear in mind the good grace of the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/louis-smith-wins-olympic-silver\" title=\"\">Louis Smith, the charismatic British gymnast</a>.</p> <p>Smith had devoted much of his life to setting new standards at pirouetting on a pommel horse. He even gave up on love a year before his event because, having split up from his girlfriend, he didn't want another broken heart to get in the way of an Olympic medal. His coach reckoned he had performed more than a million revolutions on his apparatus in preparation for his 50-second assault on perfection.</p> <p>And then he came up against someone else who had done exactly the same. Smith was awarded the identical score as his Hungarian rival to three decimal places; he lost on countback \u2013 a comparison of earlier scores \u2013 and was entirely without complaint or rancour in defeat, satisfied he had lost out to the better man. His gracious example was matched by Victoria Pendleton, twice denied a likely gold by pedantic applications of the rules; and by the self-effacement of countless others.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/06/morrissey-olympic-games\" title=\"\">Morrissey was as adrift in his comments about \"blustering jingoism\"</a> as the MP Burley has been about multiculturalism in the opening ceremony. The response to success and failure has, in my experience at all the venues, looked a likably British kind of nationalism, a delight that it is all going better than hoped, and a sustained respect for brilliance from whichever nation it came.</p> <p>Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps have been afforded well-deserved love and respect, but so have all the other athletes. The tone has been well judged, too, by the BBC \u2013 the one corporation, despite fears to the contrary, that has been a dominant presence at them. The national broadcaster has rediscovered its purpose in reflecting the mood of the big occasion \u2013 and shown the emotional intelligence of it retaining the rights to such unifying events.</p> <p>When Seb Coe stood up and said at the opening ceremony, before it all unfolded, that what he hoped for the Games was that \"we will be able to tell our children and our grandchildren that we did it right\", it sounded a bit sententious. But in this and much else about these Games he has not been far wrong. Coe kept his faith in what the 2012 project might achieve, and has resisted any \"I-told-you-so\" moments now that so much of it has worked out. My favourite Coe moment of the past fortnight was seeing the Olympian in Chief held in a queue behind the back of the stands before the start of the triathlon by a super-efficient volunteer on the \"Olympic Family\" gate. I went in and watched the athletes plunge into the Serpentine, and 10 minutes later went back out; Lord Coe was still there in the queue behind the stand, patiently waiting his turn, with a slightly amused look on his face.</p> <p>I don't know if the closing ceremony will quote those other indelible lines from Shakespeare's great valedictory play, <em>The Tempest</em>, to bookend the opening epigram, but you can't help feeling it should: \"Our revels now are ended. These our actors/as I foretold you, were all spirits/and are melted into air, into thin air\u2026 We are such stuff/as dreams are made on; and our little life/is rounded with a sleep.\"</p> <p>King Bradley Wiggins said something of the same, when he stepped up to receive his gold medal at Hampton Court, a week after becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France. In the midst of all the wall-to-wall euphoria he admitted: \"There is almost slight melancholy. I realised on the podium that that's probably it for me. I don't think anything is going to top that.\"</p> <p>That slight melancholy will be widely shared when the flame moves on tomorrow night. It may be that the Olympic Games leaves behind little of tangible substance \u2013 though you trust at least that some of its physical infrastructure, all that massive concrete investment, will spread at least a little lasting benefit to the east of the capital. But even if all that lasts of the great memory machine of the past fortnight is the stuff that dreams are made on in a few million young \u2013 and old \u2013 imaginations, then you might argue it will have fulfilled its purpose.</p> <p>The brief sense of kinship, writ large, feels like that excitement you feel coming out of a life-changing play or film, back into the real world outside and anxious to talk 10 to the dozen about the drama you just witnessed. It is a reminder that, despite everything, despite all the crises and anxieties and frustration and pain of the world, life might just occasionally require you to throw a hat up in the air, because it is the only sensible thing to do.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's decision to put Paul Ryan on the White House ticket has seemingly done that rarest of things in American politics: delighted both sides of the party divide in equal measure.</p> <p>Republican grandees gushed over the youngish star of the GOP, even those \u2013 such as former House speaker Newt Gingrich \u2013 who had previously dismissed his tax plan as \"right-wing social engineering\".</p> <p>Meanwhile many Democrats were also whooping it up over the decision, in the belief that the pick would be unpopular with the public at large due to the swingeing spending cuts Ryan proposes.</p> <p>Bill Burton, a former White House staffer and founder of leading Obama Super Pac Priorities USA, tweeted: \"Romney picked one of the only people who could have had an impact in the race.

Paul Ryan almost perfect choice.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich has seemingly had a change of heart since dismissing Ryan's tax plan earlier on in the primary season.</p> <p>\"We're very, very happy,\" he told CNN, adding that the young Republican had grown into \"one of the great intellectual leaders\" in America today.</p> <p>As to that \"right-wing social engineering\" comment, it appears that Ryan had \"listened carefully\" to the former House speaker in recent months and had now learned the error of his ways.</p>",
  "<p>Fifty years ago, the cultural entrepreneur and radical publisher <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/society\" title=\"\">John Calder</a> hit on an idea that would change the world of literature altogether. Having successfully toured some of the new French writers he was publishing \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2819/the-art-of-fiction-no-91-alain-robbegrillet\" title=\"\">Alain Robbe-Grillet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2341/the-art-of-fiction-no-115-nathalie-sarraute\" title=\"\">Nathalie Sarraute </a>and <a href=\"http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/ucbio_duras_margaret.htm\" title=\"\">Marguerite Duras</a> \u2013 he suggested to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/11/the-earl-of-harewood\" title=\"\">George Lascelles, the 7th Earl of Harewood</a> and director of the Edinburgh festival, that the city might host a writers' conference, a bookish supplement to the atonal music and challenging theatre Harewood was then introducing to Edinburgh audiences.</p> <p>Nowadays, book festivals are an international phenomenon and it can seem as if every second village in the country has one. In 1962 it was an innovation. It is fitting that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/aug/12/edinburgh-international-book-festival-director\" title=\"\">Nick Barley</a>, the current director of the Edinburgh international book festival, has programmed a \"reinvention\" of the event for this year's festival.</p> <p>The Edinburgh writers' conference has been slightly superseded in the cultural imagination. The following year, Calder held the notorious dramatists' conference, where, as he recollects in his memoirs, a young woman called Anna Kesselaar \"appeared at the end of the organ gallery that ran behind the platform where the conferencees sat. She was hanging on to a BBC lighting trolley and was wheeled around the gallery by a BBC technician, naked, but within the law, as she was not moving, but being moved\".</p> <p>The Daily Express was outraged, not least because Harewood, who was attending, was the Queen's cousin. Duncan Macrae, the actor, lamented that \"if these people wanted to cause a sensation they would have been better advised to have gone to the Rangers-Celtic football match and thrown bottles at the referee. I did not appreciate the scene.\"</p> <p>In 1965, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jun/13/photography-poetry\" title=\"\">Allen Ginsberg staged his \"International Poetry Incarnation\" in the Albert Hall in London</a>, which was immortalised in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-qiHHg7Rsc\" title=\"\">Peter Whitehead's documentary <em>Wholly Communion</em></a>, and which became an iconic image for the new \"Beat\" tendency in literature and performance. In many ways the Edinburgh international writers' conference paved the way for Ginsberg's celebration; and in its own way was even more controversial than the \"shock strip\" (Sunday Mirror) in 1963.</p> <p>The five-day event was scheduled for the 20th to the 24th of August, and Calder assembled a staggeringly eclectic line of speakers: established novelists and poets, new voices, prominent critics.</p> <p>Like every festival director, he suffered from last-minute cancellations (Graham Greene, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell) and the purse-lipped scepticism of the establishment. But firmly on-side was the <em>Scotsman</em>'s then arts and features writer, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3561915.stm\" title=\"\">Magnus Magnusson</a>, who summarised the opening with typical eloquence: \"Everything went wrong. Crowds were still milling outside the hall long after the advertised starting time. Microphones sulked. The speech of welcome, on tape, didn't materialise. Promised stars failed to turn up. And yet, despite all this \u2013 or even because of it \u2013 the first international writers' conference to be held at the Edinburgh festival got off to a splendid start.\"</p> <p>Writing to the philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt\" title=\"\">Hannah Arendt</a>, the novelist <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/mary-mccarthy/\" title=\"\">Mary McCarthy </a>described it memorably. \"People jumping up to confess they were homosexuals or heterosexuals \u2026 an Englishwoman describing her communications with her dead daughter, a Dutch homosexual, former male nurse, now a Catholic convert, seeking someone to baptise him.\"</p> <p>McCarthy also mentioned the conference's most notorious contretemps, one which has resonances and ramifications to this day for Scottish letters, not all of them wholly positive. The second day, given over to the state of Scottish literature, had featured \"a registered heroin addict [<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/08/edinburghfilmfestival2003.fiction\" title=\"\">Alex Trocchi</a>] leading the Scottish opposition to the literary tyranny of the communist <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1557\" title=\"\">Hugh MacDiarmid</a>\". This was the notorious spat where Trocchi claimed all his writing was inspired by sodomy and MacDiarmid called him cosmopolitan scum.</p> <p>Among the luminaries attending the conference were <a href=\"http://www.faber.co.uk/author/angus-wilson/\" title=\"\">Angus Wilson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3249/the-art-of-fiction-no-65-rebecca-west\" title=\"\">Rebecca West</a>, <a href=\"http://www.henrymiller.info/bio/bio.html\" title=\"\">Henry Miller</a>,<a href=\"http://www.virago.co.uk/author_results.asp?sf1=data&amp;st1=profile&amp;exp=JKL&amp;ref=e2007030615140743\" title=\"\"> Rosamond Lehmann</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/17/lp-hartley-go-between-ali-smith\" title=\"\">LP Hartley</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/lawrence-durrell\" title=\"\">Lawrence Durrell </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/03/stephen-spender-journals-feigel-review\" title=\"\">Stephen Spender</a>; a proper mixture of the establishment, the experimental and the censored.

That the events became lively is an understatement.</p> <p>Looking back at the programme and reminiscences in volumes of memoir and correspondence, it's hard not to feel a pang of nostalgia for the days when literary discussions took place with such moral integrity and unsparing wit.</p> <p>The authors were there because they had urgent ideologies, not because they were on a publisher's jolly, although <a href=\"http://www.malcolmmuggeridge.org/\" title=\"\">Malcolm Muggeridge</a> seemed to attend solely to try to sleep with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/19/georgeorwell.biography\" title=\"\">Sonia Orwell</a>, and Goodsir Smith fell asleep after a liquid lunch.</p> <p>Rebecca West got things off to a fine and contentious start by declaring that \"the novel has suffered a lot from bad criticism. It wouldn't matter if most of the critics now writing had been strangled at birth\".</p> <p>Angus Wilson was equally forthright: \"The English novel is essentially middle-class, a novel on the defensive, conservative, attempting to protect the English way of life, the English country way of life, against town life and against cosmopolitanism. By nature it is defence of English roots, a discussion of what is right and wrong in terms of manners, not of good and evil in terms of metaphysics.\"</p> <p>That said, there was equal outrage when William Burroughs described his new \"cut up\" and \"fold in\" method, where pages from different books were collaged together to form new works. \"Are you serious?\" asked one delegate. \"Yes, of course,\" replied Burroughs, \"crisply, not even affronted,\" as Magnus Magnusson reported, \"as if a preacher were being asked whether he believed in God.\"</p> <p>Against the traditional humanism of the novel and its celebration of the individual, Burroughs claimed this new mode would create \"composite\" authors, allowing \"internal space-age experiments\". The future of the novel lay in space, not time.</p> <p>Lawrence Durrell praised the linguistics department in Edinburgh University for creating \"a computer that can already write sonnets and will be writing novels by Christmas\".</p> <p>Ethical and political debates became fraught, especially when <a href=\"http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petar_%C5%A0egedin\" title=\"\">Petar \u0160egedin,</a> the \"official\" Yugoslavian author, fumed that the dissident Aleksandr Stefanovic had been allowed to speak before him, and had stated that \"the job of writers is not to write for governments, but to educate them\" \u2013 this, apparently, was a CIA plot to humiliate him.</p> <p>It might have been possible, at first, to sympathise with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khushwant_Singh\" title=\"\">Khushwant Singh</a>, who denounced British and American novels for focusing on sexuality: \"these perversions are prevalent in these parts of the world; in India, we are up against much greater problems\". But empathy evaporated when he then said that \"homosexuals are incapable of love, just as hermaphrodites are incapable of orgasm\" \u2013 to which the chair, Stephen Spender, muttered, \"I should have thought they could have had two\".</p> <p>The debates were prescient: how will technology change literature? Indeed, although state censorship still exists, digital censorship is now a more pressing concern: the censorship of market forces is more insidious than the censorship of the party.</p> <p>Technology has inflected the debate about sexuality as well: we worry not so much about repression, but overexposure. The 1962 conference took place in the shadow of the cold war: but what might commitment mean now?</p> <p>From Tahrir Square to the Occupy Movement, technology is reshaping political commitment and activism; the swords may be bent, but not yet into ploughshares. Writers engaging in a global discussion of these issues may not come up with the answers, but they might formulate the powerful questions.</p> <p>\u00b7 The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\">Edinburgh writers' conference</a> runs from 17-21 August <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk\" title=\"\">www.edbookfest.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>For the second time, vice-president Joe Biden will face off against a Republican opponent on the bottom half of a presidential ticket.</p> <p>Though Paul Ryan may not appear as strikingly different from Biden as Alaska governor Sarah Palin was in 2008, the firebrand Wisconsin congressman is a formidable and contrasting opponent.</p> <p>Here are some of the key points of difference between the two vice-presidential candidates.</p> <h2>Age</h2> <p>Joe Biden is no spring chicken. He was born in 1942 as the second world war raged in Europe and Asia. He is now silver-haired and 69 years old, none of which is unusual in Washington DC, especially in the Senate where Biden spent so much time.</p> <p>Ryan, however, is a self-titled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-firebrand-wisconsin-profile\">Republican 'young gun'</a>.</p> <p>Just 42 years old, he was born in 1970: the first ever person on a presidential ticket from the \"Me Decade\". He is also a fitness fanatic and avid hunter.</p> <h2>Experience</h2> <p>Ryan may come across as a youthful breath of fresh political air compared to Biden, but there is the question of experience to consider.</p> <p>Biden has been at the heart of American power for four years already as the incumbent vice-president.</p> <p>Before that he spent long years in the Senate, first being elected in 1970 when he was just 30.</p> <p>He became a specialist in foreign policy, frequently travelling abroad and involving himself in often bitter foreign conflicts, something he has continued as vice-president.</p> <p>Ryan, however, has little practical experience outside Washington.</p> <p>Biden also had a career as a lawyer before he became a politician. Ryan basically went straight to Washington. He also has focused almost entirely on domestic policy issues. That lack of foreign experience was a notorious weakness for Palin.</p> <h2>Debating skills</h2> <p>Ryan is no slouch when it comes to debating. He is a confident speaker and, as a budget specialist, he has a mastery of facts and figures at his fingertips.</p> <p>He is, in short, about as far from Sarah Palin as you can get. Biden on the other hand is a successful politician, fluent and passionate.</p> <p>But he is also well known for making verbal gaffes and has a tendency \u2013 like many senators \u2013 to speak for far too long.</p> <p>In a famous exchange in Baltimore in 2011, Ryan had a brief public debate with President Barack Obama over fiscal issues.</p> <p>Ryan held his own and it made him a conservative hero. Biden just about beat Palin in 2004 in their face-off (and some would even debate that, saying Palin did better).</p> <p>Ryan will be a very different proposition.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Neither man has quite the compelling story of a personal journey of President Barack Obama. Or the colourful wonder of a Sarah Palin (a moose-hunting beauty queen turned state governor and mom of five).</p> <p>Ryan's background is solidly middle class and midwestern. He does not have Mitt Romney's wealth and privilege, instead hailing from a small city in Oklahoma. Biden's background is a little more blue collar.</p> <p>He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and had a slightly more hardscrabble life than Ryan as his father went through a period of struggling for work.</p> <p>But neither man can claim to have been born to true poverty in the way that, say, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid can.</p> <h2>Religion</h2> <p>Both men are Roman Catholics, so religion, at least, is likely to be an area of common ground and not something for too much debate (unlike Palin whose evangelical beliefs attracted a lot of unfavourable media attention).</p> <p>However, Ryan is staunchly anti-abortion whereas Biden is pro-choice.</p>",
  "<p>Walk the four-mile stretch of the river Lea from Hackney Wick up to Tottenham Hale, and it is easy to forget that you are in London's East End. It may be August but tangles of wild flowers can still be seen in the river's surrounding fields. On the river, moorhens attend to chicks marooned on islands assiduously constructed out of twigs.</p> <p>The many narrowboat owners who live on the Lea take advantage of the summer to repair their craft while rowers, urged on by their bicycle-riding coaches, guide single sculls through algae blooms and haughty swans. But something is missing from this English riverbank scene: anglers. There are almost none to be found, even on a sunny afternoon last Wednesday when throngs of fishing enthusiasts were out in force on London's canals.</p> <p>Chris, who appeared to be the lone angler on the Lea, was close to calling it a day. \"I came last Sunday and got nothing and I've come back today for my second visit, but I'm just killing time,\" he said in a soft Irish lilt. \"It's a nice spot, but there's no fish. I don't think I'll stay much longer.\"</p> <p>He removed his sunglasses and flexed a well-tattooed bicep. \"My friend told me not to come here because of the cormorants. I didn't know what they were until last week. I know they're not meant to be here: they're seabirds, like gulls.\"</p> <p>Known to anglers as the Black Death, the cormorant is a killing machine that can swim two minutes underwater and diving 80ft. In China, fishermen hunt with trained cormorants, but in Europe the protected species is a hated rival, blamed for emptying rivers of fish.</p> <p>Anglers have been petitioning the government to do something about the birds for more than a decade. But a perception that cormorant numbers are now out of control has resulted in a clamour for unprecedented action. Eleven groups, including the Angling Trust and the Salmon and Trout Association, are lobbying to influence a review by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) into the control of piscivorours (fish-eating birds) to be published at the end of the year.</p> <p>The groups want the law changed so that cormorants can be killed under a general licence, similar to those issued for the control of crows or wood pigeons. They complain that current licences allow holders to kill only a handful of birds a year \u2013 not nearly enough when cormorant numbers over winter have increased from around 2,000 in the early 1980s to nearly 25,000 now.</p> <p>Even this number appears conservative to some. The Angling Trust's new <a href=\"http://www.cormorantwatch.org/\" title=\"\">Cormorant Watch website</a> has logged close to 100,000 sightings of the birds. Anglers in Walthamstow Marshes close to the Lea say they often see 200-300 fly past them in just an hour.</p> <p>But allowing cormorants to be culled like crows has alarmed naturalists. \"This would be a new departure,\" said Grahame Madge of the RSPB. \"It would be the first time a provision had been made [to cull a species] for sport. The population of cormorants is far lower than wood pigeons, which are almost in their millions. If it were introduced, it would be difficult to monitor how many were being killed and it could result in the population being reduced.\"</p> <p>The RSPB is instead calling for anglers and fisheries owners to use non-lethal tactics to protect fish stocks.</p> <p>\"We tried scare tactics such as firing off a pistol, but that didn't work,\" said Dennis Meadhurst, secretary of Lee Anglers Consortium, which represents fishing clubs along the Lea. The consortium built reed beds and underwater cages to protect the fish from the birds, but with no success. Meadhurst said it had given up restocking the river because the cormorants, which alert each other to good prey, will simply descend on the new schools and devour them.</p> <p>\"We used to have lots of roach and dace and see gudgeon after gudgeon, but you hardly see any now,\" Meadhurst said. \"We used to take around \u00a360,000 a year [in fishing permits] but then in 1996 the cormorants came in and that was that. We are down to around \u00a315,000 now.\"</p> <p>Similar problems have been reported in the Lake District, Yorkshire, Kent and Scotland. Meadhurst, a birdwatcher, has no doubt what is responsible for the seabirds moving inland. \"Commercial fishing has depleted the sea of fish stocks, because boats have been trawling too close to the shore. At the same time you've got farmers diversifying into fish farms for trout, offering cormorants free dinners all over the place.\"</p> <p>The migration inland has affected the birds' diet. A cormorant needs around 300g of sea fish a day. But river fish are less fatty, meaning a bird will need to consume around double this amount.</p> <p>The previous government increased the number of cormorants that could be killed a year from 500 to 3,000, a level that troubles the RSPB, which disputes claims the birds are responsible for a significant decline in river fish. \"If there are cormorants at a site, most naturalists would say that means there are fish there,\" Madge said. \"If they were eating all the fish, they would decline in numbers. There is no science to back up claims the situation is getting worse, but anglers want to reach for the shotgun.\"</p> <p>Even the anglers think it unlikely the government will sanction a major cull. Meadhurst is gloomy about the prospects for the next generation of anglers. \"You can't teach them to fish when they know the float isn't going to go under,\" he said. \"They just won't be interested.\"</p>",
  "<p>When it came to the biggest single decision of his run for the presidency so far, Mitt Romney defied his stereotype as a cautious politician eager to please whatever audience he is speaking to.</p> <p>For his choice of congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 a young firebrand politician from the heartland state of Wisconsin \u2013 as his running mate in the 2012 White House race represents anything but politics as usual.</p> <p>Ryan, 42, is one of the so-called \"young guns\" of the Republican party in Washington, a group of politicians aiming to revitalise the party's brand and cast it as more revolutionary and activist, especially in the area of overhauling government spending. For that is where Ryan's main area of influence lies.</p> <p>First elected to Congress at the young age of 28, Ryan has emerged after 14 years in the Capitol as the powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee, determined to wield the axe on matters fiscal and slash American government in size. That has made him a Tea Party hero.</p> <p>His proposals on the budget have been hailed by his supporters as a way to save America from going broke as it struggles with a wave of retiring baby boomers and a vast amount of debt.</p> <p>His political opponents, however, cast his plans as a brutal attack on the poor aimed at stripping away or transforming cherished \u2013 and vital \u2013 benefits like Medicare and social security and food stamps.</p> <p>However, troubled times are something Ryan does know something about on a personal level.</p> <p>Unlike the vastly moneyed Romney, who was born the son of a state governor and an auto-industry magnate, Ryan's background is more modest and marred by tragedy.</p> <p>He was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, on 29 January 1970, in the south of the state, amid a region of rolling hills, farms and small towns struggling with the decline of American industry.</p> <p>His father, Paul Ryan Sr, was a successful lawyer, in Janesville, and from a long established prominent Roman Catholic family in the town. It was a stable and solidly middle class family ideal that Ryan himself has replicated.</p> <p>He remains a Catholic, married Oklahoma-raised tax lawyer Janna Little in 2000 and has three children.</p> <p>But Ryan's childhood was not always easy. His father died when Ryan was just 16 years old.</p> <p>Indeed Ryan \u2013 the youngest of four children \u2013 discovered his stricken parent in bed, laid low by a fatal heart attack at just 55.</p> <p>That trauma in 1986 forced Ryan's mother, Elizabeth, to go back to college to study interior design and his grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, to move back in with them to help with the family.</p> <p>In a New Yorker magazine profile Ryan described the death of his father as a huge moment in his life.</p> <p>\"It was just a big punch in the gut. I concluded I've got to either sink or swim in life,\" Ryan told the magazine.</p> <p>It also made him a fitness buff as he realised that the sort of heart attack that felled his father might run in his family.</p> <p>Ryan is a huge fan of an extreme form of workout, called P90X, which involves an intense mix of exercise, yoga and martial arts moves.</p> <p>He is also an avid outdoorsman and hunter, though given his childhood in Wisconsin that is little real surprise.</p> <p>One friend, former congressman Mark Green, told CNN he had sent Ryan an email once from his new job as an ambassador in Tanzania.</p> <p>\"I got this terse response saying, 'I'm sitting in a deer stand. It's hunting season. Leave me alone,'\" Green told the TV station. </p> <p>Ryan went to college at Miami University in Ohio and graduated in 1992 with a degree in economics and politics.</p> <p>After a brief period back in Wisconsin working as a marketing consultant Ryan headed to Washington, landing a job with Wisconsin Senator Bob Kasten, whom he had interned with while a student.</p> <p>He became enmeshed in the world of Washington wheeling and dealing, working as a speech writer and economic adviser.</p> <p>He also professed an admiration for the ideas of anti-government libertarian guru Ayn Rand.</p> <p>By 1997 he decided to run for Congress himself and a year later he won his election battle in his native state and entered the House, becoming its second-youngest member in 1998.</p> <p>He made cutting government and rolling back the welfare state the central tenet of his political beliefs.</p> <p>He first came to national prominence in 2005 when he was a fervent backer of President George W Bush's attempts to reform social security by changing much of it into private investment accounts.</p> <p>But Bush, despite devoting a huge amount of political capitol into the scheme, failed to make it popular with the American people.</p> <p>In the face of withering attacks from Democrats it was eventually abandoned.<br>But not by Ryan. He used his new high profile to keep pushing radical ideas on government spending reform.</p> <p>As the Tea Party emerged in the wake of the economic crises of 2008 Ryan was perfectly situated to ride that wave.</p> <p>His dubbed his budgetary plans the Roadmap, and along with other young guns, such as House majority leader Eric Cantor, pushed transforming the welfare state as an answer to America's economic woes.</p> <p>In the wake of the 2010 mid-term elections, which saw the Tea Party-infused Republicans get control of the House, Ryan ended up in a head-to-head public debate with President Barack Obama over his budget plans.</p> <p>That moment saw Ryan become even more of a hero to Republican conservatives.</p> <p>By 2011 the House had voted on Ryan's budget plan and passed it by 235 votes to 193. Though many Democratic strategists and leaders see Ryan's budget as rich fodder for attacks, that view is not shared by Republicans.</p> <p>When his budget passed the House Ryan's powerful influence was clear: just four Republicans dared vote against it. That showed how Ryan's career has seen him cement his grip on the Republican right.</p> <p>But now, with his name on a presidential ticket, Ryan is about to find out what the rest of the country thinks too.</p> <p>That outcome is far less certain.</p>",

  "<p>It is one of those \"Coubertain-meets-Cinderella\" stories that can only happen at the Olympics. Only last week, Giovanni Cernogoraz was virtually unknown in Croatia \u2013 or anywhere else, for that matter.</p> <p>An ethnic Italian whose roots lie in Montenegro, Cernogoraz was born in Slovenia, but his homeland is Croatia. That is where his family lives, and that is the country he competes for as a low-profile, low-key sports shooter.</p> <p>But then he surprisingly won Olympic gold in the men's trap \u2013 only the fifth gold medal in Croatia's two decades of history at the Summer Olympics. In normal circumstances, his discipline barely makes it into national newspapers' sports sections, but now Cernogoraz's picture \u2013 that bulky medal clenched tightly between his teeth \u2013 is all over the front pages. He instantly rose from near-obscurity to national hero status.</p> <p>\"I can't even describe how I felt,\" Cernogoraz says. He had just made the finals \u2013 qualifying with the fewest points of all competitors \u2013 but his performance was brilliant when it mattered the most. Missing only once in the finals, he secured a shoot-off for the gold with Massimo Fabbrizi of Italy.</p> <p>\"When I realised I was going to win at least silver, I broke down and started crying. Luckily, I managed to calm down in time to win the shoot-off,\" he says, adding that the atmosphere at the Royal Artillery Barracks motivated him. \"Never before did I have so many people watching me \u2013 they even applauded when I hit target and I really liked that.\"</p> <p>The sport also known as clay-pigeon shooting is not a cheap sport. World-class competitors use unique, invidually crafted and tailor-made guns, which can cost more than \u00a310,000. When you take into account the worth of the ammunition and targets used for practice, each training session costs around \u00a370 on average.</p> <p>The national Olympic committee backed Cernogoraz, now 29, when it became apparent that he could meet the standard required for the Games in London (he had narrowly missed both Athens and Beijing), but up to that point he was mainly left to his own resources.</p> <p>His family own a restaurant in Novigrad, a small town on the west coast of the Istrian peninsula, and were able to help him. \"Last year I went to too many competitions and spent more than I could afford. So this year I concentrated more on practising,\" Cernogoraz explains.</p> <p>What next, the journalists asked him after winning the medal. \"To be honest, I already got a bit bored in London,\" he answered. \"I can't wait to come home to my wife and kids, and I'm also needed at the restaurant \u2013 it's the peak of the tourist season, you know.\"</p> <p>The next evening he was in Novigrad. His fellow locals held \"welcome home\" banners, a live band played on the tiny central square and an Olympic flag fluttered high on the town hall \u2013 all in his honour. Foreign tourists swarmed around him, fighting for the perfect souvenir to show their friends and neighbours \u2013 their picture with an Olympic winner.</p> <p>But that was Tuesday. On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.tportal.hr/sport/magazin/208380/Dva-dana-nakon-olimpijskog-zlata-konobari.html\" title=\"\">Cernogoraz was already back at his old job</a>, working as a waiter at his father's restaurant. \"I love what I do, I'm not ashamed of it,\" he says. \"Besides, now people can say: 'Hey, let's get something to eat at that geezer's who won the Olympics.'\"</p>"
