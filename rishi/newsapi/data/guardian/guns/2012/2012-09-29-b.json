[
  "<p>Twenty years ago, Britain's greatest industrial companies were ICI and GEC. A third, Rolls-Royce, secured from hostile takeover by a government golden share, had a board that was boringly committed to research and development and to investing in its business. ICI and GEC, under colossal pressure from footloose shareholders to deliver high short-term profits, tried to wheel and deal their way to success. Neither now exists. Rolls Royce, free from concerns about hourly movements in its share price, has gone on to be almost our last remaining great industrial company.</p> <p>Britain, as the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/kayreview\" title=\"\">Kay review on the equity markets</a> reported, has far too few Rolls-Royces. Instead the report identified a lengthening list of companies \u2013 Marks and Spencer, Royal Bank of Scotland, BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Lloyds and now BAE \u2013 which have made grave strategic errors, taken ethical short cuts or launched ill-judged takeovers, hoping to benefit their uncommitted tourist shareholders. Their competitors in other countries, with different ownership structures and incentives, have survived and prospered.</p> <p>It is an unreported crisis of ownership that goes to the heart of our current ills. Over the last decade, a fifth of quoted companies have evaporated from the London Stock Exchange, the largest cull in our history. Virtually no new risk capital is sought from the stock market or being offered across the spectrum of companies. A share is now held for an average of seven months. Britain has no indigenous quoted company in the fields of car, chemical or building materials. They are all owned overseas, with design and research and development travelling abroad as well.</p> <p>The stock market has descended into a casino, served by a vast industry of intermediaries \u2013 agents, trustees, investment managers, registrars and advisers of all sorts \u2013 who have grown fat from opaque fees. It has become a transmission mechanism for highly short-term expectations of profit driven into the boardroom. Directors' pay has been linked to share price performance, offering them the prospect of stunning fortunes. As a result, R&amp;D is consistently undervalued.</p> <p>British companies are now hoarding some \u00a3800bn in cash, cash they would rather use buying back their own shares than committing to investment. We have allowed a madhouse to develop. An important reason why Britain is at the bottom of the league table for investment and innovation is the way our companies are owned or, rather, <em>not</em> owned.</p> <p>It is a crisis of commitment. Too few shareholders are committed to the companies they allegedly \"own\". They consider their shares either casino chips to be traded in the immediate future or as no more than a contract offering the opportunity of dividends in certain industries and countries; this requires no engagement in how those profits and dividends are generated. British law and corporate governance rules demand the narrowest interpretation of investors' and directors' duties: to maximise short-term profits while having minimal associated responsibilities.</p> <p>The company is conceived as nothing more than a network of short-term contracts. Any shareholder \u2013 from a transient day trader to a long-term investor \u2013 has the same standing in law. American directors' ability to defend their company from hostile takeover or German directors having to live \u2013 horrors \u2013 with trade union representatives on their supervisory boards are seen as obstacles to enterprise that Britain must not go near. But companies and wealth generation, as <a href=\"http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2012-07-09/now-for-the-second-bounce-of-the-shareholder-spring\" title=\"\">Professor Colin Mayer </a>argues in his important forthcoming book <em>Firm Commitment</em>, are about co-creation, sharing risk and long-term trust relationships: Britain's refusal to embrace these core truths is toxic. Companies were originally invented as legal structures to enable groups of investors to come together, committing to share risk around a shared goal and so make profit for themselves, but delivering wider economic and social benefits in the process. Incorporation was understood to be associated with obligations: a company had to declare its purpose before earning a licence to trade. There existed a mutual deal between society and company.</p> <p>No game-changing improvement in British investment and innovation is possible without a return to engagement, stewardship and commitment. Limited liability should not be a charter to do what you like. It must be conditional on a core business purpose, along with the creation of trustees to guard it. Directors' obligations should be legally redefined to deliver on this purpose. What's more, every shareholder should be required to vote, with voting strength, as Mayer argues, increasing for the number of years the share is held.</p> <p>To solve the problem that individual shareholders \u2013 even savings institutions \u2013 do not have sufficient muscle nor sufficient incentive to engage with managements, voting rights could be aggregated and given to new mutuals. These would support directors in delivering their corporate purpose, a proposal made by the Ownership Commission I chaired. Companies would become trust companies, with a stewardship code. The priority in takeovers would be the best future for the business, not the ambition to please the last hedge fund to take a short-term position.</p> <p>Stakeholders should also have a voice in how the company is run. In Germany, a company's bankers and its employee representatives have seats on the supervisory board. Why not copy success rather than continue with our failed system? The Kay review's proposals to stop quarterly profit reporting, while a useful first step, do not address the core of the problem. The company has become a dysfunctional organisational construct that needs root-and-branch reform.</p> <p>As part of the reform, Britain also needs more co-operatives, more employee-owned companies and more family-owned firms. It needs to be more attentive to which foreign companies own our assets and for what purpose. It is an ownership revolution to match the revolution in finance proposed last week. Together with an innovation revolution \u2013 see next week \u2013 the British economy could at last begin to deliver its promise.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Andrew Rawnsley claimed: \"Britain already has a well-established social democratic party\u2026 it is called the Labour party\" (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/andrew-rawnsley-future-for-lib-dems\" title=\"\">The Lib Dems aren't going to rescue themselves by being timid</a>\").</p> <p>The Labour party could be characterised as a social democratic party until John Smith's death, but it ceased to be as such in England with the advent of New Labour.</p> <p>It was then largely disestablished. Examples of non-social democratic practices included parts of education, health and housing being further removed from democratic control and the private sector being encouraged into the public sector to profiteer from public service and public taxation through the private finance initiative etc.</p> <p>Only in Wales did the Labour party survive as arguably a mainly social democratic party. Policies, for example towards prescription charges and student loans, indicate a clear difference between Welsh Labour and English and Scottish Labour.</p> <p>Health and education being paid for by the state through taxation is very different from the bill being passed to the individual. Social democrats treat the individual as citizens, not as consumers.</p> <p>England has no major left-of-centre party. This has created a large void that the Lib Dems under Kennedy and Campbell moved into slightly and Clegg has sped away from. Labour under Miliband shows little sign of promoting public service over capitalism or representing people as active citizens rather than passive consumers. Only the spirited little Green party seems to come anywhere near worthy of the label social democratic.</p> <p><strong>Mike Shone</strong></p> <p>Stafford</p> <p>So, a \"searing critique\" of the Tory-led coalition's economic policy, and Lib Dem acquiescence therein, comprises: \"I think the coalition tightened a little more than necessary in the first two years\" (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/coalition-cuts-nick-clegg-aide?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Coalition cuts have been too deep \u2013 key Clegg aide</a>\", News).</p> <p>Here's what I call searing: this Tory/Lib Dem coalition government has utterly failed the people of Britain. Its economic policies are disastrous and have done nothing except deepen the country's problems and widen the gap between rich and poor, to such an extent that it will be decades before the bottom 50% see their incomes rise to anything like decent levels.</p> <p>Its other policies are undermining the ethos of the National Health Service, disintegrating the education system (in both senses of the word, and from primary schools through to universities), utterly destroying the future of this country and its people.</p> <p><strong>David Reed</strong></p> <p>London NW3</p> <p>In the 1960s, when the Liberals had a majority on Wilmslow town council, I was chairman of one ward and on the executive of the Knutsford division. I was privileged to meet and sometimes work for so many sincere men. I spent many and long hours working for the Liberal party.</p> <p>Since then, and up to and including the last election, I have remained faithful with my voting.</p> <p>I did not vote for a coalition with the Tory party, which is anathema to all true liberals.</p> <p>There is no way I will be let down by the Liberals ever again and I regret all my wasted hours in the past. Clegg has finished off the Liberal Democrats on his own.</p> <p><strong>Russell Hickling</strong></p> <p>Altrincham, Cheshire</p> <p>Andrew Rawnsley must have gone to Specsavers. Those rose-tinted lenses provoked a headline that overran. It should have come to an end at \"themselves\".</p> <p>The Lib Dems have been seen not as poodles of the Tory majority but as well-trained pit bull terriers in supporting tuition fees and in privatising the NHS.</p> <p>The polls indicate a Lib Dem wipeout in the next election. I shall await Rawnsley's post-election article.</p> <p><strong>Phil Jones</strong></p> <p>Eastington, Gloucestershire</p>",
  "<p>In Blackburn's new market, a strange, sanitised place in the airless basement of a shopping centre, Jack Straw is buying fresh fish for his dinner and I am trying hard not to feel too much like a spare part. When he asked me to follow him in here, I was convinced this was a move designed to make him seem, in my eyes, more humble: the ex-minister carefully examining the mackerel and the maris pipers, just like the rest of us. I could easily have waited in the car with one of the protection officers who still travel with him whenever he visits his constituency. Now, though, I see that ordinariness isn't the half of it. It was surely the stallholders he wanted me to see: specifically, their reaction to him. For in Blackburn Market, at least, no one seems tempted to spring an unfortunate question about Iraq or extraordinary renditions. Rather, it is as if a distant but much loved uncle has arrived in town. There is gossip and there is banter. There are warm handshakes and updates on business. There is even \u2013 from one of the women behind the sandwich stall \u2013 a smacking great kiss.</p> <p>Straw has been Blackburn's MP for 33 years; he replaced Barbara Castle, for whom he had worked as a special adviser (something of a talent-spotter, Castle once said that she had employed Straw for his \"guile and low cunning\"). He loves the town, or so he says, and on the train up this morning \u2013 we travelled in what he calls, euphemistically, \"soft class\" \u2013 he happily bombarded me with Blackburn facts: the people, the places, the problems. In the unmarked police car that brought us from Preston to the town, he pointed out all the sights: the brewery, the abandoned mills, an unlikely shop called Reidys, otherwise known as the \"musicians' superstore\".</p> <p>His tourist-guide zeal is so passionate, you might take him for an exile, a deracinated Lancastrian, rather than for what he really is \u2013 an Essex boy, with homes in London and the Cotswolds. He faltered only when faced with the monolith of the 1960s extension to the town hall; not even he&#xa0;could find anything nice to say about that.</p> <p>Straw finishes his shopping \u2013 \"They're concerned, quite rightly, about plans to let some stalls to artisans at a reduced rate,\" he tells me as we scoot out \u2013 and we get on with the rest of our day. It's busy. First, we go to his constituency home (stoutly Victorian and now with added bulletproof glass), so he can drop off his shopping and submit to the first of several interrogations by me. Then we visit an engineering company, one that is having trouble with its bank. Lunch is taken at the constituency office, after which it's back in the car to see the police chief. Finally \u2013 it's by now tea time \u2013 Straw heads to the community centre where he will hold the first of two regular surgeries.</p> <p>As we walk in, it's clear the first of these will overrun wildly: the queue extends far beyond the cluster of chairs by the door. I shoot him a glance. Is he flagging? Apparently not. \"Right!\" he says, clapping his hands together. \"Let's get on with this.\" He has been holding surgeries for more than three decades, yet he still has all the enthusiasm of the tyro.</p> <p>It is, of course, a masterstroke to let me sit in on these meetings, an even defter move than dragging me to the shops. For this is Straw at his best: patient, kind and determined in the case of those whose need is obvious; firm and fair in the case of those who are trying it on. His knowledge \u2013 of the benefits system, of local housing, of the insurance industry \u2013 is pretty wide, but when he thinks someone has reached the end of the bureaucratic road, he would rather tell them than dish out false hope by promising to write futile letters. Unlike many politicians, he talks to those who come to see him in exactly the same way as he speaks to, say, his special adviser; not for him the phony glottal stop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916880\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348843884245/Jack-Straw-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw\" width=\"220\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw enjoys a pint before he watches Blackburn Rovers.  Photograph: Bethany Clarke/Eyevine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bethany Clarke/Eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there is his cheeriness, which is remarkable to me, because there are&#xa0;moments when, listening to people's struggles with poverty and ill-health, with scammers and officialdom, I feel close to despair. How do you do it? I ask him afterwards. He grins. \"What? Yes. Well. I don't know.\" We look at each other for a moment. Is he lost for words? Unlikely. But the clock is ticking. If he's late for his next engagement \u2013 Blackburn Rovers are playing Barnsley and his daughter, Charlotte, is coming over from Manchester specially \u2013 there will be trouble.</p> <p>Having witnessed all this, it's not hard for me to work out how Straw has hung on to Blackburn for so long (and he intends to stand at the next election at least; the Lords, he says, is not for him). He keeps his seat toasty and warm. An altogether trickier question is how he managed to pull off the great feat of remaining in the cabinet through all 13 of the feud-ridden Blair/Brown years (the only other people to do so were Brown himself and Alastair Darling; Straw was home secretary, foreign secretary, leader of the House and, finally, justice secretary). Is the answer to be found in his new memoir? Perhaps. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781447222750\" title=\"Last Man Standing\"><em>Last Man Standing</em></a><em> </em>is a very long book \u2013 his first draft came in at a mind-boggling 200,000 words \u2013 with a careful, slightly pedantic tone that sets it somewhat apart from the bitchy memoirs of his peers. Even now his frontbench career is over, it seems, he is reluctant to fall out with people. In this sense, he is the ultimate politician.</p> <p>But his diplomacy (slippery or adroit, depending on your point of view) also has its foundations in his childhood, for it was there that he learned the shape-shifting that has been vital to his survival \u2013 and this is why, I think, his book begins with an acquaintance telling him: \"Your father has just married my mother\", rather than with, say, Tony Blair uttering the fatal words: \"I'm making you the foreign secretary.\"</p> <p>In his Blackburn kitchen, Straw pours coffee. \"I haven't talked about my childhood in detail before,\" he says. \"I don't think you should wear these things on your sleeve. For a politician, it's a bit like talking about God.\" But does he agree that it is the key to his success? He looks slightly uncomfortable. On the one hand, he clearly relishes its narrative drama. On the other, he is reluctant to admit that it is chameleons who make the best politicians. \"Um\u2026 well, you can't change your background, can you? But it has given me a facility to be\u2026 <em>at ease</em>.\"</p> <p>Straw and his four siblings grew up in a flat on an Essex council estate. His father, Walter, a conscientious objector who was jailed for his refusal to fight, was an insurance salesman. His mother, Joan, was a teacher. Their marriage was desperately unhappy. At night, Straw would lie in bed listening to the rows, the racket echoed by a neighbour below banging a broom furiously on his ceiling in a desperate effort to restore peace. His father was moody, self-pitying and socially isolated; on one occasion, his shocked son saw his protective maternal uncles beat him up, a humiliation that resulted in Walter attempting, albeit half-heartedly, to gas himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916881\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348844237413/Jack-Straw-as-a-baby-with-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw as a baby with his father, Walter\" width=\"220\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Straw as a baby with his father, Walter, who became estranged from his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Straw took refuge in books. He loved Anthony Buckeridge's Jennings stories and it was under their influence that he applied for, and won, a scholarship to Brentford School. (He liked school, but it took a while. He ran away repeatedly at first. There was also, later, a horrific incident in which a student in his house gassed himself; the boy believed he was gay and couldn't bear the shame of it.) In 1957, however, shortly before Straw took up his place at Brentford, his father left. He did not see him again for 10 years. Walter only came back into his life when, shortly before Straw's finals at Leeds University, an acquaintance called Reg Gratton, the editor of the student newspaper, approached him as he was on his way to the library and announced that he and Straw were now step-brothers.</p> <p>What happened after this? In <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he reveals only that he and his siblings were eventually reconciled with Walter. \"Well,\" he says. \"I got his address, I wrote to him and we arranged to meet. I told Suzy [his sister], but not the others, and I didn't tell my mother because, at that stage, you had to wash your mouth out with carbolic soap if you spoke about our father in anything other than pejorative terms.\" Was he nervous? \"I was\u2026 anxious. Then, when he picked me up at Epping station, the conversation restarted almost without him pausing for breath: he began justifying himself in relation to my mother, going on about what a hard time he'd had, how unpleasant her brothers had been. It was awful.</p> <p>\"But then the others gradually got in touch and, after a while, the relationship [with us] normalised. When he died, we all made speeches at the funeral and it was rather wonderful.\" Did he love his father? \"Yes, I loved him. I felt he was my dad and I'd always yearned for a relationship with him. But I couldn't rely on him. I was on my own. He wasn't\u2026 solid.\"</p> <p>After his finals, Straw began his political career, moving smoothly through the various ranks: president of the NUS, Islington councillor, political adviser to two cabinet ministers, Barbara Castle and then Peter Shore. Somewhere along the way, he also qualified as a barrister. Though he had been through a divorce \u2013 he and his first wife, Anthea, separated soon after they lost their daughter at six days old \u2013 he was by now happily remarried to his \"soulmate\", Alice Perkins, a high-flying civil servant, and they had a baby boy, Will. Outwardly, his life was successful, happy, on course. The boy who, aged four, stood on a chair in the kitchen and shouted: \"All peoples be quiet!\" was on his way.</p> <p>Inwardly, though, he was in turmoil \u2013 and in 1981, he fell into a deep depression. Does he believe this was connected to his childhood? \"Yes, I've no doubt about that. There were various other traumas. I'd recently lost my hearing in one ear [the result of an infection] and there was the worry I would lose the second ear, too. Meanwhile, various militants in my local party were trying to get me out. But the root of it certainly went back to my childhood. I didn't have a nervous breakdown, but I was close to one.\" How did it manifest itself? \"Bad dreams. Horrible, horrible dreams. Waking up, shouting.\"</p> <p>His mother-in-law suggested that he see a psychotherapist and for the next decade, he did, twice a week. \"It turned out to be really important. I was able to talk about things that had happened in my life that I hadn't been willing to talk about before, and to try better to understand why I had [certain] anxieties.\" In <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he writes that he suffered from \"impostor syndrome\", expecting that everything he'd achieved would inevitably be taken away from him. To me, though, he makes a different point. \"I still had the view that 96% of what had happened was my father's fault. [In therapy] I gradually came to the view that there isn't an algorithm for these things and that even if there was, what would be the point? I was luckier than most. I was able to get on in life, thanks to my mum. But part of me is my dad. I realised that I would rather have some benign views of my father than spend the rest of my life feeling contemptuous of him.\"</p> <p>Does he believe more of his colleagues should try seeing a shrink? A lot of people outside Parliament think that politicians \u2013 to use a non-psychiatric term \u2013 are mad. \"I don't think they're any madder than Jeremy Paxman or John Humphrys!\" he snorts. But then he concedes: \"At the higher levels, people's flaws come out, and some find it really difficult to cope with that, and it leads to bad behaviour by them, and they're economical with the <em>actualit\u00e9</em> or blaming other people all the time.\" Would he, I wonder, be talking about anyone in particular? According to <em>Last Man Standing</em>, John Smith was a functioning alcoholic. Blair, meanwhile, has \"cold eyes\". As for Gordon Brown, whose leadership campaign Straw agreed to manage, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/21/jack-straw-plotted-against-brown\" title=\"his misgivings apparently set in early on\">his misgivings apparently set in early on</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396916882\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/28/1348844026924/Jack-Straw-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Straw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As foreign secretary on 26 February 2003, flanked by John Prescott and Tony Blair, opening the Commons debate on military intervention in Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why did Brown go in for so much negative briefing and why, I wonder, was no one in the party able to put a stop to it? \"Well, in retrospect, Tony should have moved him to, say, the Home Office. It was very deep in his [Brown's] psyche. I've thought about it a lot and I'm afraid it goes to his character. We all have extremes of character, but his are much wider. And he had round him bad people. He allowed them to do that stuff. It was insecurity. People who are in power who are desperate about the next step can get very neurotic. I don't want to throw the word paranoia around, but you can see people start to become fearful of others and it builds up in their heads. What gradually emerged with Gordon, which was a shock to his cabinet colleagues and the deepest trauma to him, was that he could not do the job and he has since retreated, and we don't see him. There is, sadly, no connection between an obsessive desire for a post and the ability to do it.\"</p> <p>Straw was appalled by the Browns' friendship with the former editor of the <em>Mirror</em>, Piers Morgan (it was Morgan who in 1997 telephoned Straw to tell him that his then teenage son, Will, had \"sold\" cannabis to a <em>Mirror</em> reporter). \"It is inexplicable that he got himself tied up with people like that. You deal with him on a very long spoon and you hold your nose.\"</p> <p>But Straw attended the wedding of Rebekah Wade, then the editor of the <em>Sun</em>, to Charlie Brooks. Does he regret that, too? \"It's hard, that. If I'd known then what I know now\u2026\" Naturally, I assume he's talking about phone-hacking. But, no. \"It wasn't that the <em>Sun</em> switched its support [from Labour to the Tories], it was the manner of it, which was nasty. It must have been in her mind at the time of the wedding that she was going to shaft Gordon.\"</p> <p>Did he attend because he liked Wade or because he wanted to keep her on side? \"Both. Alice was away. I was kicking my heels that evening, so I went. I liked her.\" Did he have a good time? \"I just observed the scene, which was the most extraordinarily lavish wedding I've ever been to.\"</p> <p>Straw sold the serialisation of his memoir to the<em> Daily Mail.</em> No qualms about that? \"If I had that many qualms, I would have tried to block the sale. So the answer is 'no'. I realise this is a crime before the people's court, but I've got a lot of respect for Paul Dacre. I've known him for over 40 years [he and the <em>Mail</em>'s editor were contemporaries at Leeds]. I've found him straight and he's a good journalist.\"</p> <p>And so to Iraq, though Straw is so amazingly verbose, this conversation has to take place two days later, in his Commons office. Straw's critics will say that in <em>Last Man Standing</em>, he yet again tries to have it both ways: that as foreign secretary, he backed the war, but that he also wants us to believe he was (in some other, more nuanced way) against it, at least at first. You can't hold two positions at once, I tell him. \"But I don't,\" he says, \"I was in favour of the war.\" He then launches swiftly into the usual spiel about legality, Resolution 1441, his desire to avoid a war by going through the \"UN route\" and the horror of Saddam. But isn't legality, in these kinds of conversations, a framework behind which he can hide? His book is striking for its failure to address the question in a wider moral sense \u2013 just because something is lawful doesn't make it right \u2013 though he does note that his wife, son and daughter would have been on the big anti-war march had family loyalty not been at stake.</p> <p>\"Well, it was the most serious decision I've ever had to take and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Bear in mind what my family felt. It wasn't as though the arguments weren't being tested.\" Did you have rows? \"No, we had discussions. It was too serious to have a row about.\" I tell him that he looked unusually nervous <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/21/jack-straw-chilcot-military-action-iraq\" title=\"when he appeared before the Chilcot inquiry\">when he appeared before the Chilcot inquiry</a>. \"Your interpretation is correct. It was quite an ordeal.\" Waiting for the inquiry's report must be like waiting for an exam result. \"No, it's not quite like that.\" He believes Chilcot will criticise the lack of process in cabinet and the aftermath of the war, but not, in the end, its legitimacy.</p> <p>A cause of rather more anxiety is, perhaps, that of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/28/libyan-dissidents-action-government-rendition\" title=\"Abdel Hakim Belhaj\">Abdel Hakim Belhaj</a>, the Libyan military commander who is suing Straw for his alleged complicity in illegal rendition and torture. But he can't say anything at all about this. \"We're in the middle of a legal process,\" he says, his hand rising to make a \"stop\" gesture. When is this process likely to be over? \"I don't know.\" He sounds cross (he has also, I notice, suddenly started using my Christian name a lot). \"You've never seen me cross!\" he says. And then: \"Look, I feel as strongly against torture as you do. It's unreliable. We discovered that in the Tower of London in the 16th century. But it's wrong anyway.\" And then: \"Are you comfortable sitting there?\"</p> <p>It's clearly time for me to push off. On the way out, we pass the office of the Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell who, at 82 and having served in the Commons continuously since 1966, is the father of the House. Will Straw one day succeed him? I don't know. Something may blindside him \u2013 and us \u2013 yet. But my strong hunch is that this is his latest ambition. Straw has a mania for the gym and a fetish, like Tony Blair, for clean shoes. His greatest addiction, though, is undoubtedly to the glad-handing that comes as standard in political life. I tell him that I know the way to Westminster tube station perfectly well, thanks, but he walks me there all the same \u2013 the better, I suspect, to lock eyes, just for a moment, with some poor, unsuspecting member of the electorate.</p>",
  "<p>The motley gaggle of miscreants shuffles into the court, lining up silently in three rows on the benches. There are some 20 of them, men and women of all ages, most with long records of theft, violence and weapons misuse, and all with hardcore drug problems.

Almost before he has sat down, he is picked out by the judge as the week's shining star, commended for his positive attitude and sent home as a reward. \"You look surprised \u2013 you shouldn't be,\" he is told.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1186478/1186478_2012-09-28-231518.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"460\" height=\"283\" id=\"cf56cf1oi\" name=\"cf56cf1on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><embed width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1186478/1186478_2012-09-28-231518.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf56cf1ei\" name=\"cf56cf1en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>Already it is clear this Dallas court for drug offenders is no normal court. As proceedings unfold, it seems like therapy crossed with a reality television show. The judge doesn't wear a robe, seldom sits on the bench and swears a lot. His name is Robert Francis, a fast-talking 52-year-old Republican, a rock fan and a keen hunter who proudly showed me, in his office before proceedings started, the heads of huge hogs he has shot.</p> <p>As the offenders troop in, he warns if anyone lies or bullshits he will go \"fucking ballistic\". Then he discusses the difficulties of staying straight as he dissects their jobs, their families, their desires for the future. He responds to their comments with bawdy jokes, short homilies or sharp threats. \"Stay positive, brother,\" one man is told, while another is warned: \"You might think I'm crazy but I'm the crazy bastard who can put you back in jail.\"</p> <p>There are outbursts of applause, then cheers for a young man who looks embarrassed as he reveals he got married two days earlier. The judge tells a woman who has started helping her mother around the home that she makes him proud. \"You gotta be proud, too,\" he says.</p> <p>Until recently, these people would have been discarded in overcrowded prisons. After all they were caught in Texas \u2013 the toughest state of a nation that locks up more offenders than any other in the world, with more than one in every 100 adults behind bars. Instead they receive counselling and assistance with housing and employment, although they can be sent back to jail if they fail drug tests, abscond or reoffend. One woman, a crystal meth addict, tells me the sessions in court are like walking on eggshells. But there are small incentives for those doing well, such as $10 gift vouchers or \u2013 on the day I visited \u2013 barbecue lunch out with Francis. \"These people have to believe we care and want them to succeed,\" he tells me later. \"Once they believe in me they can start to change.\"</p> <p>They are beneficiaries of a revolution in justice sweeping the United States, one with illuminating lessons for Britain. It is a revolt led by hardline conservatives who have declared prison a sign of state failure. They say it is an inefficient use of taxpayers' money when the same people, often damaged by drink, drugs, mental health problems or chaotic backgrounds, return there again and again.</p> <p>Remarkably, this revolution was unleashed in \"hang 'em high\" Texas, which prides itself on its toughness and still holds more executions than other states. But instead of building more prisons and jailing ever more people, Texas is now diverting funds to sophisticated rehabilitation programmes to reduce recidivism. Money has been poured into probation, parole and specialist services for addicts, the mentally ill, women and veterans. And it has worked: figures show even violent crime dropping at more than twice the national average, while cutting costs and reducing prison populations.</p> <p>In the process, right-wingers have allied with liberals who long advocated such an approach, detoxifying one of the most poisonous political debates at a time when US party divisions have never been sharper. \"This used to be one of the most emotive and ideologically divisive issues in the country,\" says Adam Gelb of the Pew Center on the States, a social-policy research charity which is backing the initiative. \"We are starting to see the triumph of sound science over soundbites.</p> <p>\"There is not agreement on the causes of crime or even the purpose of punishment,\" Gelb continues, \"but there is agreement on the solutions. Liberals and conservatives are getting to the same destination from very different routes.\" Now the Texan tactics are being adopted in other \"deep red\" republican states such as Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and South Carolina, while well-known conservatives flock to promote the cause, including Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal and Grover Norquist. It is a Nixon in China moment. \"The fact that it began in Texas has resonated around the country,\" says Gelb. \"We hear again and again that if Texas can do it, then it cannot be soft on crime.\"</p> <p>Just as in BRITAIN, it has been an iron rule in US politics that candidates win elections by talking tough on crime. The result has been a wave of stiff sentencing laws which, combined with the backfiring \"war on drugs\", mean that the prison population is currently growing 13 times more quickly than the general population. As a result, a nation with 5% of the global population accounts for 25% of prisoners worldwide \u2013 and is spending \u00a343bn a year keeping them there. The criminal justice system also stands accused of worsening racial inequality, with Hispanic men three times as likely to be locked up as white men and black men nearly seven times more likely. According to a landmark Pew report, one in nine black men between the ages of 20 and 34 is behind bars.</p> <p>Texas typified the trend. Just eight years ago, it had the highest incarceration rate in the world, with one in 20 adults in prison, on parole or on probation. The biggest deficit in state history had led to cuts in probation, giving judges little alternative but to increase prison admissions.</p> <p>In 2006, however, a political earthquake started to shake conventional wisdoms. It began when the state budget highlighted the need for $2bn for seven new prisons to accommodate a predicted 17,700 extra inmates by 2012. When Republican stalwart Jerry Madden was appointed chairman of the house corrections committee, the part of the state government responsible for criminal justice, jail and parole, he was asked to avoid building more prisons since they were too expensive.</p> <p>The white-haired Madden is an unlikely hero of prison reform. A fan of George W Bush and sympathetic to the Tea Party, he happily describes himself as \"a typical Texan Republican \u2013 which makes me very conservative when viewed nationally\". He admits that when he took over the committee, he knew nothing about the subject and had no interest in what has since become his life's mission. But he was trained as an engineer and, with an open mind, set about working out solutions. Perhaps it helps that he is at the end of his political career \u2013 when we meet, he is packing up his office in Austin, having announced his retirement. \"I'm not interested in the feel-good stuff, I'm interested in what works,\" he says. \"And since my job was not to build more prisons, I had to investigate the alternatives.\"</p> <p>Madden turned to Tony Fabelo, a former adviser to both Democrat and Republic governors, for evidence to defeat the \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" lobby. Fabelo's figures were frightening: in just two decades incarceration rates in Texas had risen from 226 people to 691 people per 100,000 residents, yet other states with slower growth rates saw faster falls in crime. Meanwhile, one in three Texan inmates was back behind bars within three years. \"They had created a totally broken system,\" says Madden.</p> <p>Fabelo told Madden to focus on short-term facilities to tackle the underlying problems of repeat offenders, such as substance abuse and mental health problems. He suggested spending $240m on these services \u2013 under half the amount earmarked for new prisons that year \u2013 and pointed out that every dollar spent in this way saved at least $2 in the long run. Each prisoner, after all, costs $50 a day.</p> <p>Madden looked at the numbers and took a&#xa0;leap of faith. He went on the attack, using traditional right-wing arguments to subvert those seeking hardline penal policies. \"We moved the issue from one of being soft on criminals to one of being smart over the use of money. If you are keeping people in prison who do not need to be there, then that is a waste of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>\"We call it the department of corrections, so we should try our best to correct people, not just incarcerate them,\" Madden continues. \"Some people deserve to be in prison until they die, but you don't fill up prisons with people we are mad at who have done dumb things in their lives. You try to change their behaviour.\"</p> <p>Few typify this better than Jose Barajas. As this bulky 31-year-old man told me his life story a shy smile flashed occasionally across his face; when it did so he looked almost like the sweet kid whose father was taken into the desert and shot dead by rival gangsters. Jose was just 11 then.</p> <p>In subsequent years Jose drank hard, took lots of drugs and was determined no one would get the chance to take advantage of him like the men who murdered his father or abused his mother. \"Me and my pistol was enough,\" he tells me. \"I felt like a cowboy in the Wild West. I did a lot of robberies, a lot of carjackings, all sort of other things.\"</p> <p>Barajas was furious at a world that seemed unforgiving. One night, off his head at a party, he decided to die in a blaze of glory. \"I wanted to go out with a suicide by cop, get them to shoot me down,\" he said. \"So when the police came I started shouting at them, taunting them, but they refused to shoot me. I was so angry I did not die. Now I realise how selfish that would have been to my family and kids.\"</p> <p>Given his record, Barajas was looking at a long stretch in prison when he was arrested. Instead he is working as a roofer, trying to be a good dad and nursing ambitions to open his own tyre shop. \"I always thought I was on my own and never understood all my anger,\" he says. \"I'm not saying I don't have bad days and bad experiences, because of course I do, but I&#xa0;am confident I am going to make it.\"</p> <p>There are only two ways to cut prison populations: slow down the flow of people entering the system or speed up the numbers being released. Texas did both. Figures reveal that crime rates fell 8.3% in 2011, far outpacing national falls, with murder and robbery rates down about 15%. Property crime fell 10 times faster than in the rest of the country. Meanwhile, despite the soaring state population, prisoner numbers dropped by 2,500 last year.</p> <p>Probation services used to rely on little more than gut feelings to determine if inmates might get into trouble again. Now they use sophisticated risk-analysis tools that have cut the number of low-risk offenders who reoffend within a year from 26% to under 1%. \"We kept asking politicians to listen to us,\" says Geraldine Nagy, head of probation in Travis County. \"But I thought the idea that prison was the only option was so ingrained in the minds of so many people we would never get this shift.\"</p> <p>At the root of the reforms is an idea alien to many on the right: to understand more and condemn less. \"The people we are dealing with are not like you and me,\" Judge Francis told me. \"I&#xa0;found this a shock. I grew up in a&#xa0;house with married parents, both of whom had college degrees. I thought this was normal, but now I know it isn't.\"</p> <p>The vast majority of people parading through his court come from broken homes, failed to graduate from school, began using drugs in their teens and had children before they were 20. \"These people are preconceived to have a harder path through life than the likes of us,\" he said. \"I don't even say we offer rehabilitation. We are trying to provide 18 years of parenting in one year of drug court.\"</p> <p>Francis's 15-strong team deals every year with about 320 offenders, who typically spend six months in special treatment units in prison, then a year attending court several times a week with regular drug testing, followed by a decade on probation. Recent graduates include Lavoris Neal, a smartly dressed 33-year-old who grins as he tells me his check shirt, chinos and shiny black shoes cost $12 from a thrift store. He never knew his father, had an illiterate mother, was drinking by the age of eight, delivering drugs by 12 and using them the next year. \"I thought this was normal,\" he said. \"No one told me I was raised wrong, and when they did I was in tears. But I was a kid and did what I was told.\"</p> <p>Soon he was armed and dangerous and using PCP \u2013 a hallucinogen that leads to paranoia. He stole, shot at people, went on the run from police for months. When I ask what was the worst thing he did, he smiles. \"I've not been caught for some things.\" Then he pulls out some documents from a folder. \"Look at this,\" he says. \"I've never had insurance for a car before.\"</p> <p>Now this energetic character works as a business consultant, has twins on the way with a new partner and spends his leisure time devouring political biographies at the local library. \"I never want to know that person I was again,\" says Neal. \"This was the best thing that could have happened to me. I feel like I am starting life completely afresh.\"</p> <p>The revolution that began in Texas and is sweeping conservative America remains in its infancy; the hope is it will also reach this country, which locks up more prisoners than anywhere else in Europe and where debate is stagnant. Whatever populist politicians say, it is far tougher to force people to change errant behaviour than it is to simply slam them behind bars. Yet all the evidence shows this approach cuts both crime and the costs of incarceration. As Judge Francis says: \"What I am doing here is the most conservative thing possible. I am getting the biggest bang possible for the bucks of taxpayers and achieving something positive for society at the same time.\"</p> <p><em>The author travelled to Texas on a grant from Make Justice Work (</em><a href=\"http://www.makejusticework.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>makejusticework.org.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Reported cases of \"modern-day slavery\" are becoming increasingly common, according to the police and homeless charities.</p> <p>Thames Reach, which works with homeless people in London, said that so far this year, it was aware of at least 37 incidents involving vulnerable people who had been forced to work for little or no pay and even made to break the law, compared with 22 last year.</p> <p>Megan Stewart, reconnections manager with Thames Reach, said the recent court case in which four men from a caravan site in Bedfordshire were convicted of controlling and exploiting homeless people had brought about a shift in how society viewed the problem. \"People are getting better at spotting the signs,\" Stewart said. \"Since the Luton story broke, the police are taking it more seriously when our guys report it.\"</p> <p>The exploitation involves trafficking people into the UK but also targeting homeless people on the streets.</p> <p>The Passage Day Centre in London's Victoria, which helps homeless people, said its clients were regularly targeted both at the centre and at soup runs. \"A couple of weeks ago, some people approached our clients with the offer of work in Belgium,\" said Mick Clarke, who runs the centre. \"They said they'd provide them with accommodation and money and when we challenged them, they sped off. It struck me how brazen they are in targeting the vulnerable.\"</p> <p>Clarke said the gangs were benefiting from a \"perfect storm\" because the economic downturn meant people were ripe for exploitation. \"It's linked to the economy \u2013 people are more and more desperate,\" Clarke said. \"And there is real diversity in the backgrounds of people who are doing this \u2013 there are builders, people in suits, people from all ethnicities.\"</p> <p>In many cases, those who were exploited had been offered alcohol as \"a reward\" and had been told that they or their families back home would face violence if they reported what had happened to them.</p> <p>A man from eastern Europe who was referred to Thames Reach by St Thomas's hospital had been trafficked into the country by a gang. When he complained about not being paid, he was beaten up and left on the streets with brain damage.</p> <p>Other cases include two Hungarian men who were held by travellers in Birmingham and forced to work on driveways, and a Czech man who was beaten by the owners of a car wash in north London before escaping. Another Czech resident did agency work in factories and farms across England, but his wages were paid to the gang who had brought him in. A 29-year-old wheelchair user was forced to beg to raise money for a gang that was exploiting him.</p> <p>Much of the exploitation appears organised. Thames Reach said it was aware of reports that a criminal gang was trafficking people from the Lithuanian town of Panevezys on a twice-weekly basis.</p> <p>\"There is a wide range of exploitation,\" said Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland, operational head of the Metropolitan police's anti-trafficking unit, which now operates four joint investigation teams focused on Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic and Poland.</p> <p>\"You get the seven-year-old child who is treated as a slave in Haringey \u2026 someone being trafficked through the UK to another country, and then someone else who has been brought over to supply the sex market.\"</p> <p>Hyland said his teams had uncovered examples of men who were trafficked into the UK to work in illegal casinos and who were required to give sexual services to gamblers during their breaks. There was also a 51-year-old man who believed he was being brought to the UK to work as an electrician but instead was forced to go out and commit petty crime or be raped if he refused.</p> <p>The Department for Communities and Local Government has worked with the Passage to fund a campaign in Poland to highlight the issue. Embassies in eastern Europe and the Middle East are also helping to raise awareness of the risk involved in working in the UK.</p> <p>Hyland said vulnerable people often did not recognise their predicament. \"Maybe because of their mental state or because they are dependent on drugs or alcohol, they may not be able to realise they are being exploited,\" he added.In other cases it could be that people had consented to being trafficked into but had been unaware what would be involved when they arrived. \"It could apply to man being brought over for tarmacing or a woman for prostitution,\" Hyland said. \"They might know what they are coming here for but they don't appreciate how much they will have to work.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week we'll find out if Tesco boss Philip Clarke's \u00a31bn trolley dash is adding up at the till. In April, that was the huge estimated cost of turning around the supermarket's ailing UK stores after everything fell apart during the crucial Christmas trading period.</p> <p>After years of denying that its home market chain had a problem, the company issued a shock profit warning in January and since then has been washing its dirty laundry in public. This week promises to be another bruising one, even for Tesco's notoriously thick-skinned executives, as Clarke presides over the first drop in half-year profits since 1993.</p> <p>After earning a reputation for being one of the most consistent performers in corporate Britain, Tesco is expected to announce a 10% fall in group profits to \u00a31.6bn (in the UK they are forecast to be down around 13% at \u00a31.1bn). That will be hard to digest at head office in Cheshunt.</p> <p>Shareholders will have steeled themselves for the bad news and are now likely to more interested in whether the turnaround plan announced by Clarke in April is working. The money is being spent on sprucing up stores, hiring extra store staff and a long-overdue revamp of its own-label foodstuffs. The plan is not rocket science \u2013 in fact, it reads like basic good housekeeping for a retailer the management textbooks have led us to believe is among the best in class.</p> <p>How the UK stores ended up in such a sorry state remains a moot point and Clarke avoids assigning blame. The less diplomatic would point to the reign of his lauded predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, who used profits generated at home to plant flags abroad but starved the home market chain of investment.</p> <p>But they are where they are, and last week's Tesco senior executives appeared confident as they led a guided tour of one of their new-look \"Extra\" stores in Hertfordshire. It is hard not to be impressed by the zeal of the team, known as the \"Baldock Group\" after the Hertfordshire store where early crisis meetings were held. They trumpeted new attractions such as artisan-style bakeries, hundreds of \"new, improved\" products and quirks such as sports nutrition departments, which loyalty card data tells them is a growing market after the Olympics.</p> <p>There was talk of \"green shoots of progress\", a sentiment backed up by recent data that suggests Tesco's market share has at least stabilised. On Wednesday it is thought that Clarke will report flat underlying sales \u2013 a key measure of performance \u2013 ending six quarters of decline in the UK.</p> <p>Britain is not Tesco's only problem. Clarke is still grappling with the loss-making US chain Fresh &amp; Easy and a setback in South Korea, Tesco's biggest overseas market, where legislation allowing local governments to impose shorter trading hours is hitting sales. But there is also a larger dimension to the depressed Tesco share price. After years of celebrating it for its reliable returns, investors have lost their appetite for the grocery sector as a whole, reappraising it in a new world of turgid sales where shoppers are increasingly turning to the internet to make purchases.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan goes as far as to describe the supermarket sector as \"uninvestable\" in its current form, relying as it does on expensive new store openings to grab increments of market share. He has calculated that, over the last decade, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have splurged \u00a334bn to increase operating profits by a measly \u00a31.7bn. And with the internet sucking all the growth out of a depressed retail sector, the rush to devote new space to clothing and homewares looks foolhardy.</p> <p>Clarke has already called a halt to the space race, slamming the brakes on UK expansion to focus on the internet and existing stores. It's time other supermarket chiefs followed suit and did a better job of running the stores they've already got.</p> <h2>A platform for renationalisation</h2> <p>While a judge somewhere slowly ponders the merits of Sir Richard Branson's latest legal challenge, passengers wanting to travel between Britain's biggest cities might well be wondering just who is going to be running their trains in 10 weeks' time.</p> <p>The west coast main line franchising decision is slowly turning from controversy via farce into a question far more fundamental than which firm's livery is painted on the carriages. FirstGroup, who \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 offered to pay a billion more to the taxpayer than Virgin to run the line, still claims to be confident of organising the transfer of 3,500 staff, thousands of contracts and several dozen rebranded Pendolinos.</p> <p>But as the December deadline approaches, the government has clearly thought it prudent to get its own people ready to take over the trains instead. Many believe that Directly Operated Railways, the state company currently operating on the east coast main line after the last franchising fiasco, will have to step in for a while, at least when Virgin's time is up.</p> <p>And during this hiatus, some interesting facts have emerged. The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said that though the cost of keeping FirstGroup in the waiting room could run into millions, revenues would far exceed it. While First thought it could stump up \u00a310bn over the term of the franchise and still coin it in, Virgin was targeting a 7% profit margin.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the state-run east coast service, punctuality is at its highest since 1999, passengers numbers and satisfaction figures are up, and the company has returned the best part of \u00a3200m in profits to the taxpayer.</p> <p>The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, has stopped short of calling for a renationalisation of the railways, although she has signalled that the debate is on. With the prospect of the two main rail arteries being in state hands by Christmas, there may be a few more voices at Labour party conference wondering if it's time to cut out the millionaire middlemen.</p> <h2>Bankers and jail</h2> <p>There is always a clamour for heads to roll when mistakes are made. No more so than during the continuing banking crisis. Many of the big names at the top of the larger banks have moved on.</p> <p>But this has not answered the lingering question of why no one has been jailed for their part in the financial crisis. Martin Wheatley, the Financial Services Authority executive, summed up the mood when he called for powers to jail those found to have rigged Libor in the interest rate manipulation scandal that gripped the markets during the summer. \"Society wants the people who commit these sorts of crimes to pay the price and if that includes jail for the most extreme fraud in the system, then that's what should happen,\" he said.</p> <p>The threat of jail is a serious deterrent, and Wheatley is right to hold it over future miscreants. But a society unable to move on from the financial crisis until a banker is behind bars is not a pretty spectacle.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone thinking of buying the current leftwing line that the Liberal Democrats are a party of the right should have been at their conference. Concern for the poor and greenery dominated the fringe. The activists were typical <em>Observer</em> readers: kind and thoughtful people. Ministers made sarcastic asides about the Conservatives to cheer up the base and pretended, without conviction, that they were \"plebs\" fighting the Tory toffs in the corridors of Whitehall. \"I float between Labour and Lib Dem,\" Steve Coogan told the delegates. \"But never the Tories. I'd rather pull my own eyes out than vote Tory.\"</p> <p>So would most of the Brighton crowd. But there they were in a coalition with Conservatives they despised, scorned by former friends and missing several million voters, who now regret ever listening to them.</p> <p>Socrates said that living with the male libido was like being chained to a madman. The Liberals feel much the same about living with the Tories. How can it be that people who went into politics to help the unfortunate and the unrepresented have ended up supporting an austerity programme that is grinding down the disadvantaged without bringing the promised recovery? Their big reason for joining the coalition \u2013 their grand justification for the alliance with conservatism \u2013 was to enact constitutional reform. In this, they have failed utterly. They blew their chance to change the voting system and lost their fight to democratise the House of Lords. Satirists should relish their position. After decades of pounding the pavements, the Liberals are in power for the first time since 1945. Yet there will be less constitutional reform in the 2010 parliament than in any parliament in living memory. They haven't even removed hereditary peers from Westminster.</p> <p>You can hear their disorientation in Nick Clegg's language. It has degenerated into a cliche-infested jibber-jabber in which words no longer connect to cogent thoughts. Just before the 2010 general election, he told the <em>Observer</em> that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/11/tight-election-win-social-chaos-nick-clegg\" title=\"\">Britain would be hit by waves of \"Greek-style unrest\" if the new government tried to push through draconian</a> spending cuts. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/sketch-nick-cleggs-speech\" title=\"\">Now he warns that Britain would share the fate of Greece if it did not accept austerity</a>. As the conference began, Clegg said of his attempt to persuade parents<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2012/sep/23/nick-clegg-pension-property?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> to give money from their pension pots to their children</a>: \"This is part and parcel of something which I think most people agree with, which is that as we fill in the black hole in the public finances we have also got to make sure that we do not put Humpty Dumpty back together again and make the same mistakes, that we rewire the British economy and make it fairer and give people more opportunities.\"</p> <p>Only men who no longer think before they speak refuse to acknowledge contradictions or mix four metaphors into one sentence. Clegg does not talk to make an argument but to pass the time and fill the silence. His speeches are like an overcooked stew, whose ingredients have boiled down to mush. You swallow them without tasting them.</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at the collapse of British liberalism Clegg is presiding over. The political journalist tries to predict the Liberal Democrats' performance at the next election. The rest of us wonder if anyone will mourn the party's passing.</p> <p>The scale of its collapse seems vast at present. Peter Kellner of YouGov says <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/death-by-coalition/\" title=\"\">that on current polls the parliamentary party will be reduced from 57 seats to 10</a>. Of the 1.6 million Labour-leaning or otherwise leftish voters who supported the Lib Dems in 2010, 1.4 million have abandoned the party. Of the 1.8 million Lib Dem voters with no fixed allegiance, 1.5 million have gone. Kellner acknowledges that you cannot be certain that leftwing voters in marginal seats won't support the Lib Dems again if it is the only means of stopping the Tory candidate at the next election.</p> <p>I cannot see the future but wonder if the old appeals for tactical voting will wash. The left can hate as viciously as the right. The left can indeed hate along with the right. As with Tony Blair before them, Liberal Democrats in general and Nick Clegg in particular are on the receiving end of abuse from both sides. I cannot see leftwing voters supporting them to stop the Tories again, when to their minds the Lib Dems are <em>as bad</em> as the Tories. More importantly, Liberal Democrat politicians share the same doubts.</p> <p>Until I went to the Brighton conference, I thought the answer to the party's problem was simple: make Vince Cable leader, win back leftish supporters and save a few seats. But when you speak to the party's leading figures in private, you learn that they will do anything to stop Cable. He is vain, they say, so egotistical and ambitious that he cannot work with his colleagues. Whether their allegations are true does not matter. Because they are believed, Cable will be fought and, if his enemies have their way, defeated.</p> <p>Even though I did not vote for them, I accept that the implosion of the Liberal Democrats will damage the causes of civil liberties and accountable government. Even though I think the euro is a machine that destroys democracies and livelihoods, I accept that Britain needs one mainstream party that makes the case for the European Union. I'll miss the Liberal Democrats if they slink off into obscurity, in other words, and so may you.</p> <p>Perhaps they will have the chance to redeem themselves. If the Liberals' big reason for entering coalition was constitutional reform, the Conservatives went into government to impose an austerity programme they believed would restore the public finances and allow growth to resume. To date, the Conservatives' failure has been as great as the Liberal Democrats' failure. The 2010 coalition may be remembered as a bad marriage in which neither party got what it wanted. If stagnation continues into 2013, if \u2013 even of its own terms \u2013 austerity proves to be self-defeating and continues to deplete the tax base the Treasury needs to reduce the deficit, then the Liberals would have an excuse to cut their chains and seek to force a general election. They would be acting in the national interest. They would be giving the voters a chance to speak their minds. They may even save themselves a few seats.</p>",

The footage also suggests that birds are force-fed to the point of being unable to move freely.</p> <p>Fortnum &amp; Mason declined to identify the two farms belonging to the co-operative, which it says supply its own brand of foie gras, for fear of reprisals from animal rights activists, but it insists it visits them regularly to ensure its high standards of welfare are met.</p> <p>However, the store has until recently sold another brand of foie gras that, according to a representative from the co-operative, captured on video by Peta, can come from any of the 24 farms. It appears that the store, which boasts two royal warrants, removed the brand from its shelves when it became aware Peta had infiltrated the farms.</p> <p>One of the farms infiltrated by Peta featured in a promotional video in which Fortnum's previous managing director, Beverley Aspinall, highlighted the store's stringent welfare standards. Footage taken at the farm shows blood dripping from an injured bird.</p> <p>The Peta footage also appears to show a bird at another farm unable to stand as a result of force-feeding, contrary to assurances provided in Fortnums' corporate social responsibility policy.</p> <p>According to its website, Fortnum's insists \"we will never allow our birds to reach a stage where they can't support their own weight and move around freely\".</p> <p>Footage from the abattoir appears to show that some geese are not properly stunned and continue to lift their heads for some time after their throats are cut. French regulations state that \"the stunning of animals before slaughter is mandatory before killing\".</p> <p>Peta intends to release the footage on the internet with a voiceover from Sir Roger Moore, a critic of foie gras production. \"We are imploring all Fortnum &amp; Mason customers to keep out of the store until it joins Selfridges, Harvey Nichols, Waitrose and others in refusing to sell foie gras, or 'torture in a tin',\" a Peta spokesman said.</p> <p>The row between Peta and Fortnum's is the latest battle in a long campaign by the animal rights group to stop the store selling foie gras. The product, which is produced by force-feeding geese so their livers expand, is prized by gourmets.</p> <p>However, in blogs several gourmets have defended the store's right to sell the delicacy and say it has gone to great lengths to ensure the food is produced to the most humane standards.</p> <p>Peta's campaign against Fortnum's comes at a time when foie gras production is under scrutiny. California has banned the sale of foie gras, while the UK catering company Compass Group, which supplies Michelin-star restaurants and Whitehall departments, has dropped the product from its menus.</p> <p>Last year, in response to complaints from Peta about its sale of foie gras, Fortnum's was ordered by Westminster trading standards to amend misleading statements in its corporate social responsibility that suggested all of its meat met the highest welfare standards.</p> <p>A Fortnum's spokesman said: \"Fortnum &amp; Mason maintains rigorous quality control procedures and would expect all of its suppliers to adhere to our gold standard production requirements.\"</p> <p>The spokesman stressed it had not yet been able to prove or disprove Peta's allegations. \"We are acutely aware of our reputation as one of the world's leading purveyors of quality foods and have subsequently instructed the appropriate individuals within the business to look into the allegations.</p> <p>\"However, it's important we do not pre-empt that process in light of the questions that we continue to have regarding the footage in question.\"</p>",
  "<p>On a foggy morning in February, a group of BBC sports reporters toured the Olympic Park. The site was mainly mud and scaffolding and looked grim, yet, inside the minibus, the heady spirit of the coming summer of sport was busily fermenting.</p> <p>\"Clare Balding and I were giggling in the back,\" says Gabby Logan, who was to star in the team that brought the Games to viewers. \"It was a miserable day, the worst possible way to see the park, but we were like naughty schoolgirls. There was nothing fake about our level of excitement.\"</p> <p>Looking back, Logan thinks the unprecedented female weighting of the BBC's London 2012 broadcasts gave its coverage an infectious note of fun that matched the public mood. Her own late-evening chat show <em>Olympics Tonight</em>, in particular, had a playful tone she would like to try again. \"I loved it, but I just don't have the opportunity in a lot of the shows I do.\"</p> <p>Presenting <em>Match of the Day</em> on Saturdays, she says, does not give her the same scope. \"There is only so far you can go with Alan Hansen and Alan Shearer! It is a different kind of banter. But I would love to do more comedy.\"</p> <p>The elegant Logan, 39, coped with a changing cast of celebrity pundits and victorious athletes each night in her Olympic studio and became a twinkling gem in a vindicatory fortnight for women in television. A strong chain of female presenters anchored the coverage with ease. This month the new director general of the BBC, George Entwistle, pledged to put more women in front of the camera, so the lesson appears to have sunk in.</p> <p>\"It was a chance for us all to show what we could do,\" says Logan, pointing out that she and Balding, along with Hazel Irvine and Sue Barker, were already there, covering sport. \"We had all been working in our own niches, but it changed people's perceptions slightly, seeing us all doing it side by side. Hopefully, it was a positive thing.\"</p> <p>As the closing ceremony swelled to a climax, Logan found herself in tears. \"I was quite bereft, sitting there in the studio; wondering if I would do anything again in my whole life as fun in broadcasting. So I am going to have to make sure I do.\"</p> <p>Her one regret, she says, is that the show meant she missed much of the action. \"My kids were seeing events in the park every day, though, and told me what was going on.\" Logan has seven-year-old twins, Lois and Reuben, with her husband, former Scotland rugby player Kenny Logan.</p> <p>Sports presenting, she believes, has led the way for other BBC departments. \"We have good pathways in presenting and production, especially for women who know their subject and perhaps have a journalistic background. It has been pretty representative ever since Helen Rollason was the first woman to present <em>Grandstand</em>.\"</p> <p>Logan suspects the Olympics were deemed suited to women presenters because of a residual resistance to them covering football. Although she grew up visiting one football ground after another, as the daughter of Terry Yorath, an international player and manager, Logan is clear-eyed about the dark side of the beautiful game. She came across little sexism at the Olympics, but did encounter some covering Euro 2012.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,708320,00.html\" title=\"\">Football really is the last bastion of all that</a>. There was a sense sometimes of, 'Oh, it is a woman asking those questions.' And it is funny, because so many of the Olympic sports are more technical. You would think men would be more suspicious about women talking about those sports, whereas football is everywhere and actually not that hard to understand \u2013 although you could spend your whole life trying to remember first XIs.\"</p> <p>The only gender-related issue Logan has faced recently concerned her looks. A question mark hung briefly over what she calls her \"love of dressing-up\": \"The BBC had this idea that they should get somebody to look at what their presenters wear and I was warned they were going to say I was too glamorous.\"</p> <p>Logan was bemused. \"I don't wear low-cut tops, I don't wear short skirts. I am not obscene! They asked me whether I would wear the same thing for washing the dishes. I will never forget it.\" The indignant presenter replied that she had a dishwasher at home and that, anyway, she was not washing the dishes but doing live telly at 10.30 at night. \"People at home expect a little bit more from telly,\" she explains. \"And I like to be smart. I'm not naturally good at dressing down.\"</p> <p>Unveiled this month as the model for Speedo swimwear, Logan wore a succession of chic gowns for her Olympic show that had all been planned in advance. \"I borrowed from Stella McCartney, as well as using my own dresses and a few new pieces. It was so lovely having all that worked out. It meant I could go into makeup at the last possible moment before the show.\"</p> <p>The presenter wanted time to research her guests. It was this preparation, she says, that allowed her to \"freewheel\" on screen. \"When people realise you are having fun with them and are up for it, it is great.\"</p> <p>She was tested, however, when Olga Korbut, the former Russian gymnast, let rip with the full force of her quirky personality. \"She said there were no stars like her now. It became 'The Olga Show' and, as I left the studio later, my other guest, Michael Johnson, who is normally very calm, mouthed, 'well done!' to me.\"</p> <p>If Logan is cool on set, she puts it down to a perspective on life that has been hard-won. In 1992, her brother, Daniel, died of an undiagnosed heart condition when he was 15 years old, just as she was about to go to Durham University to study law. The loss changed her attitudes for ever.</p> <p>\"Within days of Daniel's death I felt I had to live really well now. I remember walking back from a lecture in my first term at university and telling two lads sat smoking on a bench that they should be in school.</p> <p>\"I was just thinking, 'My brother is not here any more and you are just sitting there',\" she recalls.</p> <p>\"I did decide later it wasn't a good idea to go around being evangelical, but I have a strong sense of making the most of your life.\"</p> <p>Daniel Yorath, a talented footballer, died suddenly while playing in the family garden and Logan has worked with heart charities since she gained a national profile. \"I remember sitting around our dining table and hearing how he had died. I could not understand how this could happen to a 15-year-old. He could run all day. We just did not know what was going on inside him.\"</p> <p>This summer, as she held her daughter Lois close and felt her heart racing, Logan says she thought back to something her mother had once said. \"A week after Daniel died, my little brother, who was six, got into my mother's bed. She told us that as he cuddled her, it was as if his own heart had fallen into her hand, with all its power. The heart is so symbolic and we take it for granted.\"</p> <p>She has been checked for Daniel's condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and remains health-conscious. \"I want to be well for my family. Half an hour of basic exercise is my backstop morning workout. It would be lovely to do two hours, but I don't have the time.\"</p> <p>This autumn, she is promoting the Love Your Heart campaign and on 1 November, she will present the first <a href=\"http://www.flora.com/proactiv/love-your-heart/\" title=\"\">Love Your Heart Awards</a>, both supported by Flora pro.activ and the <a href=\"http://www.bhf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Heart Foundation</a>. While heart screening is important for high-performance athletes, Logan says taking exercise and avoiding bad fats is enough for most people.</p> <p>\"You can be quite slim and still have the makings of heart disease, but there are things you can do for your heart that will benefit your life in other ways, too,\" she says.</p> <p>For now, arranging a half-term family break is Logan's priority. \"I would go and sit in the Highlands and so would the kids, if I told them it was an adventure. But Kenny really wants sun and he had the burden of childcare this summer, so we will be lying on a beach.\"</p>",
  "<p>Given that both are such strong visual mediums, video games and films have endured a surprisingly fractious relationship. Yet it is one that neither seems willing to walk away from \u2013 the&nbsp;symbiotic allure at its heart is just too strong. The games industry brings&nbsp;ready-made scenarios, characters and a fanbase to movie producers, while exposure on the big screen feeds back into game sales.</p> <p>Tempting, yes, but the relationship has been repeatedly tarnished, <em>House of the Dead</em> and <em>Wing Commander </em>being prime examples. Now, however, the very model of how film is made and distributed is being examined anew. In Microsoft's first foray into the market, it has chosen to debut its films based on the <em>Halo</em> games not at the cinema but in the form of a free-to-view online series that begins on Friday.</p> <p>A <em>Halo </em>film was in the offing several years ago but the project was dropped, largely over disagreements about finances and the level of artistic control Microsoft wanted to retain over its franchise. Instead of revising its demands on Hollywood, the company has chosen to make <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w13bLncPkPM\" title=\"\"><em>Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn</em></a>, a series of five 15-minute live-action episodes that will air once a week on YouTube, the video game website Machinima and Microsoft's own Xbox Live platform. The story is presented as a prequel to the three existing <em>Halo</em> games and also a lead-in to the fourth: alongside the Master Chief, it will feature characters playing as recruits who will appear in the <em>Halo 4</em> game, to be released in November, when 15 minutes more footage will be added and the whole will become a single feature, effectively the first <em>Halo</em> feature film.</p> <p>Microsoft is not alone in taking this route. Warner Brothers recently aired a web-only series based on <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, as did Ubisoft with <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the latter currently being redeveloped as a film without a Hollywood studio. It is not only games, either. A new series of <em>Arrested Development</em> is under way for online distributor Netflix, as is a remake by David Fincher of the British series <em>House of Cards</em>.</p> <p>There remains a nagging doubt, however. Last year, the cyberpunk author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/william-gibson\" title=\"\">William Gibson</a>, revisiting his 1999 essay on digital technology and film, noted the \"problem that a lack of broad theatrical release is still taken to mean that your film didn't really happen\". Perhaps, with Microsoft premiering a high-end franchise such as <em>Halo</em> in the online market, that perception is beginning to change.</p> <p>In almost every way, outside distribution, <em>Forward Unto Dawn</em> is a full-scale production. At the shoot on location in Vancouver last May, it was clear that the crew were industry professionals and that their attention to detail, with&nbsp;hardcore fans in mind, was high. There may be no cinema release but in every other sense this new media approach <em>is</em> happening.</p> <p>Director <a href=\"http://www.stewarthendler.com/index.php?/featurefilms/h/\" title=\"\">Stewart Hendler</a>, who recently completed the ambitious <em>H+</em>, another online series produced by <em>The Usual Suspects</em>' director Bryan Singer, has witnessed this first hand.</p> <p>\"I did my first web series two years ago and it was slightly unclear where the art form was heading,\" he says. \"Now they're putting in real resources \u2013 these things are being made at the level of TV pilots and feature films.\"</p> <p>Chris Symes, the supervising producer on <em>Forward Unto Dawn</em>, who has been making films since 1994, echoes this view. \"There is,\" he says, \"a real sense that this is the future, not a one-off. This will be copied as a business, film-making and distribution&nbsp;model.\"</p> <p>It is also, of course, a marketing tool for the new game. But that is not to demean it. The attitude of British actor Anna Popplewell, who played Susan in the <em>Narnia</em> series and here takes the role of one of the recruits, was echoed by many others on set. \"I don't mind how it is distributed, if it's a good product. For me, it's not so important how people watch this, it's more important that it's good.\"</p> <h2>Preview: Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn</h2> <p><strong>Setting</strong> <em>Halo 4:</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Forward Unto Dawn</em> is a prequel to the first <em>Halo</em> game, set at the beginning of an interstellar war between humanity and an alien alliance known as the Covenant.</p> <p><strong>Premise </strong>A section of cadets at the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) military academy are training to&nbsp;be the next generation of soldiers in the ongoing war with insurrectionists in the outer colonial planets.

  "<p>One of the problems of humanity's dependence on the black stuff (oil, not Guinness) is that it gets shifted around the globe. Accidents will happen. First, good news: the oil industry in the 70s averaged 25 major spills a&#xa0;year. This dropped to nine a year in the 1980s, declining to eight in the 1990s. We now stand at around three (though they are only defined as major spills if the oil company admits them). If one of these spills hits a community dependent on fisheries and tourism, these figures are cold comfort.</p> <p>An oil spill traumatises for decades. It's harrowing to hear accounts of the 1996 Sea Empress disaster in your native Pembrokeshire, even though the clean-up effort was effective and quick (thanks to volunteers), and the&#xa0;weather and the tide washed the oil out of the bay relatively quickly.</p> <p>They weren't so fortunate in Prince William Sound, Alaska. In 1989, when the Exxon Valdez hit a reef, the hull was perforated, releasing up to 32m US gallons of crude. America's Oil Pollution Act of 1990 followed, requiring single-hulled tankers to be replaced with a double hull. These double hulls have saved other coastlines from disaster but there are several trends that I find disturbing.</p> <p>We're increasingly dependent on long-haul crude, from Brazil, Africa, China and India, so more tankers carry oil further. Incredibly, given the need to scale back production and carbon emissions, we have recently seen oversupply. The world is also oversupplied with supertankers, which are going for a song. Speculators, including banks and oil companies, fill these tankers with oil and let them drift around the oceans until the price rises.</p> <p>To make matters worse, a move is afoot in the UK to tweak legislation to remove double hulling of oil tankers. This is ostensibly to liberate boats from the heavy steel which slows them down and makes them use more oil, because pollution from shipping is so high \u2013 by 2050 the industry must cut emissions by 1,013m tonnes. A cynic, however, might say that it is a vast cost-cutting exercise which will save the shipping industry an estimated $200bn a year. I'd love to be able to tell you to put oil spills out of your mind, but I can't. If there's a&#xa0;disaster, the real cost of reverting to single-hulled tankers will be picked up by the ecosystem and people like you in coastal environments.</p> <h2>Green crush of the week<br></h2> <p>When you see a&#xa0;man with a giant fly calling himself an \"environmental capitalist\", your natural inclination might&#xa0;be to run.

  "<p>This is a wonderful novel. JK Rowling's skills as a storyteller are on a par with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-louis-stevenson\" title=\"\">RL Stevenson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/arthurconandoyle\" title=\"\">Conan Doyle</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/pdjames\" title=\"\">PD James</a>. Here, they are combined with her ability to create memorable and moving characters to produce a state-of-England novel driven by tenderness and fury. The vacancy of the title occurs when a local councillor, Barry Fairbrother, dies while in office. This is the key event that triggers the action in the superficially idyllic West Country village of Pagford, whose well-heeled inhabitants are at war with the nearby council estate, The Fields. \"Nearly two-thirds of The Fields dwellers live entirely off the state and a sizable proportion pass through the doors of the Bellchapel Addiction Centre.\" The novel charts the struggle between \"old\", respectable England and the \"new\" underclass of the estate and it revolves around who will get the vacant council seat. It is a fierce battle \u2013 in language, in tone and in its urgency.</p> <p>It is not too difficult to see certain similarities with <em>Harry Potter</em>. (It would be very odd if that were not the case.) <em>Harry Potter </em>came out of the depths of Rowling's imagination and is in the tradition of portal novels \u2013 Alice down the rabbit hole, the children finding their way to Narnia through the&#xa0;wardrobe and Harry through Platform 9\u00be at King's Cross. Pagford, the ideal English village, is another \"other\" world and once you pass into it you are under its spell.</p> <p>This time, however, it is grounded in current realities \u2013 drug addiction, racism, schoolboy bullying as well as the usual stiletto snobberies around the ruined abbey and the village green. Just as Rowling, in her Potter series, got liftoff from Jennings and Tom Brown and other school stories and turned them into something far darker, grander and universally compelling, so here she takes the quiet English village thought to be the copyright of Miss Marple and rebirths it entirely without caricature or wearisome stereotypes. It's a place where the fight between good and evil, between love and despair, never ceases.</p> <p>As in the Potter series, even some good characters can have a streak of badness in them. Harry is a Horcrux (a vessel containing a fragment of the evil Voldemort's soul); in this novel Parminder, a virtuous doctor, is blemished by her wicked undermining of her youngest and least able daughter.</p> <p>But above all, as in the Potters, there is the final redeeming grace of love. Severus Snape, who has a lifelong commitment to Harry, protects him because of his unrequited love for Harry's mother. The love in this book is for Barry Fairbrother, who was born on the unspeakable Fields estate but then moved into Pagford, a good man with a mission to integrate the children of The Fields with this privileged village. His chosen instrument for this task is Krystal Weedon, a hardcore resident of The Fields and a stunningly vivid creation. Krystal's background is utterly desperate: she has no idea who her father is; her mother is a drug addicted prostitute; her family lives in squalor. One of her dearest wishes is that they might afford to have a television set and she spends much time at school lying about the programmes she hasn't seen. One of her new friends from Pagford, who wants to be like Krystal, describes her as \"funny and tough, impossible to intimidate, always coming out fighting\".</p> <p>When posterity wields its cleansing sword, I suspect that, just as the <em>Harry Potter </em>series will go on being read and cherished, so will the story of Krystal Weedon. Barry includes her in a girls' rowing eight at the comprehensive school. This is the first time anyone has taken any positive notice of Krystal and for a brief moment she thrives. Barry's goodness hovers over the book and becomes its moral touchstone, a counterpoint to the nastiness elsewhere. There's a vile character called Simon, whose domestic reign of terror over his wife and two sons echoes the fascist stratum throughout <em>Harry Potter</em>. Another villain is a school bully who (verbally) tortures a young Asian girl and drives her to extreme self-harm. Then we learn that he is adopted, which tempers our judgment. Screens are pulled away again and again and someone who seems simple to judge \u2013 and Rowling's characters provoke judgment \u2013 becomes more complex.</p> <p>The ability to create characters who move you so much that you want to shout aloud \"Don't do that!\" or \"Don't say that!\" is rare. Krystal Weedon moved me to laughter, admiration, distaste, anger and finally, in her great battle against such unfair and immense odds, to tears. Rowling is expert in tracking through a trivial plot line (the stealing of a watch) and making it play its part along the way in the bigger game. She is a compelling organiser of debate. The arguments put forward by the Pagford loyalists against what they see as the evasive sullen rabble from The Fields are laid out with conviction, as is the opposing view.</p> <p>But at other moments, she erupts into partisan rage. There's a scene where Parminder the doctor, a councillor, listens at a meeting to the \"extravagantly\" fat chairman condemn those in The Fields for the expense they cause to the NHS. Parminder, unwisely but uncontrollably, then spells out what this man's total refusal to lose weight has cost the NHS in heart operations, expensive drugs, constant appointments and so on. There are moments, too, of utterly bleak comedy, such as when Terri, Krystal's mother, whose council house is a rubbish dump, attempts to defend her patch against the predators from the social services.</p> <p>One mark of Rowling's determination to get to the nerve of reality in this book is her vigorous use of industrial language. Fs are everywhere, Cs are not withheld. But it never feels gratuitous.</p> <p>Rowling has spoken of the sense of risk in embarking on this novel. The<em> Harry Potter</em> series must have been a tough act to follow. What she wanted to do here, I guess, was to seize on the world we can all see without going through Platform 9\u00be. She has done that to stunning effect.</p>",
  "<p>Next Sunday in Soho Square, central London, a group of people will gather around a park bench.

A great singer and a genius with harmony.\"</p> <p>\"You know what I think she is?\" says Billy Bragg, whose song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4CNoq8nC4\" title=\"\">A New England</a> she took to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrXl-KEaO5s\" title=\"\">No 7 in 1984</a>. \"I think she's the missing link between Sandie Shaw and Lily Allen. A couple of Christmases ago someone bought me one of those encyclopedias of rock. It was a real doorstep of a book. Kirsty wasn't in there, and I was really shocked by that. She was a huge talent who made brilliant records and wrote brilliant songs and deserves to be cherished among British songwriters.\"</p> <p>The reasons to cherish MacColl lie in the music she recorded, from her first single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1byhkWlWnQs\" title=\"\">They Don't Know</a> \u2013 a beautiful three-minute confection of 60s girl group and folk rock, as if the Byrds had been writing for the Shangri-Las in 1979 \u2013 to her final album, 2000's <a href=\"http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/music/albums/tropical_brainstorm/reviews/guardian.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Tropical Brainstorm</em></a>, on which she vigorously celebrated Latin American music.</p> <p>The common thread throughout was a withering and regretful eye for men and their defects, from the bad boy of the first single to the serial liar committing seduction against the background of a 1998 World Cup match on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7vsoVR5NX4\" title=\"\">England 2 Colombia 0</a> from <em>Tropical Brainstorm</em>.</p> <p>Mark Nevin, who wrote and performed with MacColl in the late 80s and early 90s says: \"If you took most songwriters, put all their lyrics into a computer and pressed 'equals' you'd get two lines that sum up everything [they'd written] in a nutshell. Kirsty's would be: 'All blokes are gonna lie, cheat and let you down'.\"</p> <p>So why, despite those glorious songs, is she not in Bragg's encyclopedia? MacColl's was the model of a stop-start career. She suffered from stage fright, which discouraged her from touring for much of her career. \"I said to her: 'If you get so worried, Kirsty, why don't you go and do something else?'\" remembers her mother, the dancer and choreographer Jean Newlove. \"Her eyes filled with tears and she said, 'But I love this. I can't think of anything I'd rather do.'\"</p> <p>She also insisted on making her own decisions \u2013 something she determined to do from an early age, her mother says \u2013 consistently refusing to have her career directed by the men of the record industry. So she switched between labels, never building up the momentum to lift her unassailably into the public consciousness. \"She didn't suffer fools,\" says her ex-husband Steve Lillywhite, who produced two of her albums, \"and to be honest, to make it in the business \u2013 especially if you're a woman \u2013 you have to suffer fools.\"</p> <p>And so we're left with a smattering of singles and only five albums, recorded between 1981 and 2000. The first four \u2013 <em>Desperate Character</em>, <em>Kite</em>, <em>Electric Landlady</em> and <em>Titanic Days</em> \u2013 are <a href=\"http://www.unionsquaremusic.co.uk/shop/cd.asp?Marid=349&amp;arid=2140\" title=\"\">being reissued</a> the day after the birthday celebration, and listening to them afresh, one after the other, provides a vivid reminder of MacColl's talent. She could capture the world in songs that seamlessly interweave heartbreak and humour (\"There's a guy works down the chip shop swears he's Elvis/ Just like you swore to me that you'd be true,\" she sang on her<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL2GmaI3Xus\" title=\"\"> breakthrough hit</a>) set against a constantly evolving musical background.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6K8R8KqpCE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6K8R8KqpCE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>MacColl immersed herself in music as a child. Not the music of her father, the folk singer and songwriter Ewan MacColl, but pop. Though he had left Newlove for Peggy Seeger, his will was known to his daughter. \"I was very aware of the fact that he disapproved completely of anything he regarded as commercial,\" she later said. \"Her dad was very scornful of pop music,\" Bragg says. \"He really didn't like it at all. Not just her doing it, but anyone doing it.\"</p> <p>Nevin believes her father exerted an influence in one way, though, through his having left: \"She didn't talk about her dad much, but it was an underlying thing that coloured the way she saw the world \u2013 men would let you down and mess you about.\"</p> <p>Since her dad was absent, MacColl could sing along to her brother Hamish's singles, apparently teaching herself the vocal harmony parts to the Beach Boys's Good Vibrations when she was seven. Newlove remembers her daughter waiting for the musical interludes in Andy Williams' TV show: \"Kirsty would take her violin out of the case and accompany him. I would have a quiet laugh to myself, but she took it very seriously. Then she'd put the violin away until Andy Williams came out for another song, and out would come the violin.\" Newlove thinks MacColl started writing songs after she passed her English O-level early, at 14, leaving her with free periods to while away in the teacher's office. She'd been a prodigious writer since early childhood \u2013 a piece she wrote when she was seven for a competition run by the <em>Observer </em>was published in a Penguin book edited by the educationalist Edward Blishen, <em>The School That I'd Like </em>\u2013 but now her thoughts turned to writing pop. In her late teens&#xa0;she joined a punk band called the Drug Addix.</p> <p>\"This was a far cry from what I expected,\" Newlove says. \"'What's your daughter doing?' 'Oh, she's one of the Drug Addix!' I went to pick her up when she did her first gig. I stood downstairs waiting and a man said to me: 'Cor, listen to those kids. I can't stand it, can you?' I didn't want to say, 'No, it's dreadful,' so I just weakly smiled.\"</p> <p>Still, the Drug Addix were enough to get MacColl signed in her own right to Stiff, and so came They Don't Know. It had \"hit\" stamped all over it: great song, great arrangement, great musicians. It was all over the radio \u2013 the second most played song in the UK one week. But a strike at Stiff's distributors meant the single didn't reach the shops, and it didn't even enter the singles chart.</p> <p>One of the many joys contained in They Don't Know is MacColl's voice. The time spent practising the vocal parts in Good Vibrations was echoed down her career. She adored Brian Wilson, and used to layer her own voice to create distinctive velvet harmonies like the Beach Boys had done, which became a trademark. \"She would sing like a keyboard,\" Lillywhite remembers. \"She sang without vibrato and when you don't have vibrato you have this wonderful glassy sound, which is how you can get that Beach Boys thing.\"</p> <p>\"She knew how to use her voice,\" Bragg says. \"She'd tell the engineer where to put the mics, and she'd tell the producer what she was going to do next. She did this amazing thing where she'd do a take, then go round into a different position and do another take to layer up this amazing sound, then: 'That's all. Let's go to the pub.\" Though eight years elapsed between MacColl's first album in 1981 and its follow-up, <em>Kite</em> \u2013 arguably her best \u2013 MacColl wasn't idle. She brought up the two sons she and Lillywhite had after getting married in 1984; sang on plenty of sessions, notably Fairytale of New York; and two other artists got significant boosts thanks to her.</p> <p>One was Tracey Ullman, then an up-and-coming comedian on the TV shows <em>A Kick Up the Eighties</em> and <em>Three of a Kind</em>. \"I got obsessed with They Don't Know,\" she says. \"I used to play it and play it and play it.\" When Ullman started recording for Stiff in 1983 she had a big hit with the song \u2013 accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZSdCTcS-A\" title=\"\">video starring Paul McCartney</a> \u2013 and recorded several other MacColl numbers. Ullman has been in America for 30 years now, winning Emmys along the way, \"but my entry to America was getting into the Billboard top 10 with Kirsty's song \u2013 they got me over to be one of the first MTV veejays\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MrXl-KEaO5s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MrXl-KEaO5s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Billy Bragg, meanwhile, says he owes her for the push that made him a crossover pop star of sorts. \"I was indie No 1 \u2013 the Smiths' first album pushed me off No 1 \u2013 that's where I was,\" he says of his position in the early 80s before MacColl had a hit with A New England in December 1984. \"<em>Life's a Riot</em> [his debut album, featuring his original of the song] had already gone silver; within two weeks of her getting in the charts it went gold.\" These days, when he plays A New England live, he always adds the extra verse from her version. \"I shout, 'Let's the sing the last verse for Kirsty!', and everyone cheers. There's still a great deal of love for her.\"</p> <p>By the time <em>Kite</em> was released in 1989, MacColl's writing had changed \u2013 it was still personal, witty and engaged but now it was in her own voice. \"I know the reason why,\" Mark Nevin says of the change in tone. \"It was Morrissey. She said: 'I heard the Smiths and realised, I get it \u2013 I can write about anything.' She didn't have to write songs that sounded like they'd been written by songwriters. That was the thing that transformed her writing.\" Where before there had been what Bragg calls \"Play for Today songs\", now the eye for a bitter truth was combined with a weightless touch for the right phrase: \"What else is there to do/ But turn and wet the baby's head/ And pray he will be happier than you and me?\" she sings, devastatingly, on Tread Lightly.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3E7wHBG3WWo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3E7wHBG3WWo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"She always said, and I believed her, that the songs were pretty much not about one specific person,\" says Lillywhite, who produced <em>Kite</em> and its successor, <em>Electric Landlady</em>. \"But later on, after we'd made our amends, she said they were probably more about me than she had realised at the time.\"</p> <p><em>Titanic Days</em>, released in 1993, was not a happy time. First, MacColl's marriage was ending. Then there was another new label. Then the album was all but ignored by the world. MacColl resolved not to make another record until she was happy \u2013 and so it was seven years before <em>Tropical Brainstorm</em> was released in 2000, to a delighted reception, before her return was ended abruptly by the tragedy in Mexico.</p> <p>Like most re-releases, the four MacColl albums will probably slip by, barely noticed. Dedicated fans might update their copies, scouting for previously unissued bonus tracks. If any DJs pick up the albums, some new listeners might hear a singer they don't know on the radio. Maybe one or two people will read a review or an article like this, investigate further and discover one of English music's most vivid songwriting personalities. Fame will be as distant as it was when she was still making records.</p> <p>\"Being a pop star is a bit daft,\" Bragg says. \"If you go for that you have to give up your personality. Jessie J would be a good example \u2013 what's she like offstage? Who knows? Or Cheryl Cole? What's she like when she's kicked back in front of the telly, having a fag and a beer? I don't think Kirsty could ever have been that kind of pop star.\"</p> <p><em>Kirsty MacColl's first four albums will be reissued on Salvo on 8 October</em></p>",
  "<p>Water defines our world. When viewed from space, the blue seas that cover 70% of the surface of our planet form its most striking feature. As Arthur C Clarke once observed: \"How inappropriate to call this planet Earth when it is quite clearly Ocean.\"</p> <p>Water has also played an extraordinarily important role in the development of our species. All animals are essentially bundles of cells made mostly of water. But in the case of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, water has displayed an extra importance. In learning how to travel across the swaths of water that cover our world \u2013 a task we were tackling more than 50,000 years ago \u2013 we discovered great stretches of real estate that had been denied to our land-bound hominid predecessors. Our conquest of the seas brought us new homes and made possible our survival as a global species.</p> <p>Later, when we learned how to store and distribute water in our new homelands, we gained another evolutionary boost by providing ourselves with the means to farm crops and maintain herds of animals in a reliable manner. Irrigation meant assured food production, and human numbers have risen ever since. As the Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi put it: \"Water is life's mater and matrix, mother and medium. There is no life without water.\"</p> <p>The publication of these two books, which provide intriguing insights into humanity's exploitation of water, is timely. After all, we now live in a world that is starting to run out of the matrix of life. As Earth's population heads inexorably towards the 10 billion level, our capacity to provide fresh water for ourselves is being pushed to the limit. We are beginning to parch. Similarly, our exploitation of the seas \u2013 as we harvest fish and seafood on an industrial scale \u2013 is now stripping them of all life, turning the oceans that nurtured us into dead zones.</p> <p>In <strong>Beyond the Blue Horizon</strong>, Brian Fagan \u2013 an anthropologist from Santa Barbara and an experienced sailor \u2013 focuses on humanity's conquest of the seas and presents a vivid picture of the nautical experiences that must have been endured by the first sailors. In tiny canoes or rafts, these people were crossing substantial chunks of sea more than 50,000 years ago. At this point, <em>H&#xa0;sapiens </em>\u2013 having embarked on the great exodus from its African homelands 20,000 years earlier \u2013 had reached the south-east tip of Asia and were only a couple of short ocean journeys from New Guinea and Australia. The fact that the latter two landmasses were populated around this time indicates that humans must have made those voyages. Australia could not have been conquered any other way. \"No canoes survive from these early voyages, nor do we know much about the people who paddled them,\" adds Fagan. \"Their history, shared through the generations by word of mouth, has long since vanished in the passing of more than 50,000&#xa0;years.\"</p> <p>This lack of evidence has led many archaeologists to suggest that those first great journeys may have been accidents. A family on a canoe in coastal waters may simply have been swept out to sea by a sudden squall and ended up dozens of miles away in Australia. Fagan, however, argues that they were expert sailors. They had mastered the business of sailing in coastal waters, a far harder task than taking a boat on the open seas, and they would have known that the winds which would blow them towards the open ocean would reverse as seasons changed and would allow them to return. \"They must have also known from tell-tale signs that land was out there, over the horizon \u2013 great pillars of dark smoke from natural bushfires started by lightning strikes and distinctive cloud formations that mass over higher ground,\" adds Fagan.</p> <p>Thus humans knew exactly what they were doing when they turned their craft to the oceans. To dismiss their nautical prowess, and maintain that their epic journeys were down to chance, is temporal chauvinism. As Fagan's authoritative account makes clear, the human species has a remarkably long history when it comes to mastering ocean travel.</p> <p>By contrast, Steven Mithen's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780297864790/thirst-water-and-power-in-the-ancient-world\" title=\"\"><strong>Thirst</strong></a> \u2013 an investigation into the human exploitation of water for agricultural and industrial purposes \u2013 is concerned with more recent affairs in the tides of men, although the end result is every bit as compelling. Mithen, an archaeologist based at Reading University, believes that water, when viewed from a historical perspective, turns out to have been a powerful tool for maintaining political control: from the aqueducts of the Romans and Incas to the canal systems of the ancient Chinese \u2013 even to the first flushing toilets of the Minoans of Crete, whose temples were fitted with sewage and drainage systems of stunning sophistication.</p> <p>The key point is that the ability to store and deliver water has been the cornerstone of civilisation. \"Ever since the Neolithic, the world has had an unquenchable thirst for water,\" says Mithen. \"Meeting that need was a key driver of social, economic and political change within the ancient world, one that played a fundamental role in both the rise and then fall of ancient civilisations.\"</p> <p>Crucially, Mithen adds, this unquenchable thirst continues today, though it is \"perhaps more desperate than it has even been before\". In this respect, he is almost certainly correct. We take the matrix of life for granted today. In the overheated, over-populated future that lies before us, we may no longer have that luxury.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron proudly announced in Brazil last week that he had helped British businesses to bring in \u00a3100m in contracts. That's great news; but since UK&#xa0;plc ran up a trade deficit of \u00a310bn \u2013 one hundred times that \u2013 in a single quarter earlier this year, it barely registers as a drop in the ocean.</p> <p>Encouraging foreigners to buy British is just part of the coalition's effort to rebalance the economy, away from unsustainable asset bubbles and buy-now-pay-later consumer spending, towards manufacturing, which tends to create more jobs, and more export earnings.</p> <p>The logic of George Osborne's argument about instigating a \"march of the makers\", spelled out in last year's budget, was impeccable.</p> <p>But the picture of Britain that emerged from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/uk-gdp-economy-data-second-quarter?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">balance of payments numbers published last week</a> showed that transforming an economy is much tougher than crafting soaring rhetoric \u2013 or shaking hands with a few Brazilian businessmen.</p> <p>Britain's current account deficit with the rest of the world \u2013 the trade deficit, plus the losses UK plc makes on its overseas ventures \u2013 has hit its highest level ever, at \u00a321bn, above 5% of GDP. In other words, we're living well beyond our means.</p> <p>Back in the days before Britain struck oil in the North Sea and opened up the City to allcomers, a poor set of balance of payments statistics was political dynamite. If the country couldn't pay its way in the world \u2013 because it wasn't exporting enough to afford the foreign goods consumers wanted to buy \u2013 it was a severe blow to national pride, which risked triggering a sterling crisis; a recurring nightmare for 20th century British politicians.</p> <p>Those days disappeared with the end of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and the overseas earnings that came from North Sea oil.</p> <p>During Labour's 13 years in office, it was <em>de rigueur</em> to claim that, just as boom-and-bust was a thing of the past, the dull old trade figures, measuring the value of the aircraft and machine tools we had flogged abroad, were no longer a critical indicator of economic success.</p> <p>A slowly increasing surplus on services such as the banking, law and management consultancy in which the Brits so excel also helped to fuel the idea that in the \"knowledge economy,\" a rapidly widening deficit in old-fashioned tangible exports didn't matter.</p> <p>At the same time, a credit splurge and a house-price boom convinced us our buying power was increasing.</p> <p>But with oil and gas extraction in the UK's mature fields now well past its peak, that era is over. The US economist C Fred Bergsten argued in a 2002 paper that industrial countries \"enter a danger zone of current account unsustainability when their deficits reach 4\u20135% of GDP \u2026 At these levels, corrective forces tend to arise either spontaneously from market forces or by policy action.\"</p> <p>Jim Leaviss, of City investor M&amp;G, pointed out that each time in the past 50 years the current account deficit has exceeded 3% or so, it has precipitated a steep slide in sterling.</p> <p>A devaluation would not be a wholly bad thing \u2013 it would help to make our goods cheaper on international markets, and smooth the transition to a more externally focused, less skewed economy. And there are some thriving pockets of industry (albeit largely foreign-owned), such as car-making, that could benefit relatively quickly.</p> <p>But by driving up the price of imports, a depreciation would also bring a surge in inflation, hammering consumers' spending power; and what the past four years of non-recovery helps to show is that there is nothing automatic about rebalancing.</p> <p>As Vince Cable has recognised \u2013 though business groups doubt his power to match promises with actions \u2013 fitting the economy to compete in the world will take a conscious industrial strategy from government. We can't assume that an army of vibrant exporters will spring up unbidden from the depths of a double-dip recession.</p> <p>If it is serious about aligning the rhetoric up with reality, the coalition will have to do battle with an army of well-documented problems facing the UK's out-of-kilter economy: the perceived inferiority of vocational education; the lack of in-work training and career paths through lower-skilled industries; the short-termism of the financial institutions on which firms rely for financing; and the tendency to cut investment to the bone when times are tough.</p> <p>Ed Miliband has listed some of these as areas he hopes to tackle as part of his new-found philosophy of \"pre-distribution\", which we may hear more about at this week's Labour conference. In truth, they are blunt instruments when it comes to narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and ensuring a fairer share of the economy's resources between those at the top and bottom of the income scale.</p> <p>A more direct approach \u2013 taboo to modern Labour, and impossible for Miliband to countenance \u2013 would be to work towards strengthening workers' bargaining power, and ditching the dogma of \"flexible labour markets\", which is effectively a claim to create jobs by driving down wages, undermining aggregate demand in the process.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean all these problems aren't worth tackling, in a bid to make Britain work better, particularly if, as the latest official data suggest, productivity across the economy has been hit hard by the crisis. Both sides of the political spectrum should be looking again at the tax treatment of debt and equity financing, for example, and whether capital allowances are generous enough to spur investment.</p> <p>Nick Clegg said in his conference speech last week that rebuilding a new economy from the \"rubble\" of the old would be a \"gargantuan task\". Judging by the scale of the current account deficit, he's not kidding.</p>",
  "<p>My hair is so thick that when I go for a cut, hairdressers remark on it. \"Don't you get bored blow-drying all this?\" asked one. I do. The solution is: don't blow-dry.

  "<p>The second law of thermodynamics is often called upon to explain the state of teenagers' bedrooms. (\"Entropy,\" sigh the parents knowingly, as the bedroom, tidied only yesterday, once again tends towards chaos and decay.) Matt Bellamy, frontman of Muse, a singer prone to entertaining apocalyptic scenarios, was apparently watching the BBC at some point during the economic crisis when the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-muses-wild-new-album-the-2nd-law-20120815\" title=\"\">second law</a> became real to him.</p> <p>The second law may formally concern the waste of energy inside a closed system, but it can be applied widely \u2013 to teenagers' bedrooms and other systems as well. \"An economy based on endless growth is unsustainable,\" a TV economist pointed out, quoting the second law as evidence. Bellamy thought: there's an album in that. And so The 2nd Law: Unsustainable, the \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqFZGnfMLMw\" title=\"\">trailer</a>\" for Muse's assured, ridiculous sixth album, repeats the assertion, whipped on by scything strings and portentous operatics. An evil robot delivers the dubstep bass drop. Orchestral dread and belly laughs are a peculiar combination, one that has become familiar after a clutch of albums in which the Teignmouth band stopped taking themselves quite so seriously and started enjoying soundtracking the end of the world.</p> <p>Of course <em>The 2nd Law</em> isn't all about the madness of unfettered markets. It's about love, the Olympics and the particularly funky vein that Muse began to explore in earnest with the standout cut from <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>. 2006's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LgcDpTH47g&amp;feature=fvwrel\" title=\"\">Supermassive Black Hole</a> was probably the bravest and most entertaining trompe l'oeil yet issued by Britain's premier pomp rockers. Its analogue here is the superb single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0SgwWmF9w\" title=\"\">Madness</a>, a farty funk bagatelle about the fruitlessness of arguing with a loved one (in Bellamy's case, wife-to-be Kate Hudson). Muse may have begun as a rock band coasting a little more metallically on the vapour trails of Radiohead, but Madness is pure, joyous pop music.</p> <p>The brassy Panic Station tries to repeat the feat, with a slap-bass riff on Michael Jackson, not quite achieving the same effect but <a href=\"http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/blogs/panic-station-have-muse-recorded-the-maddest-song-of-2012/\" title=\"\">wrong-footing preconceptions</a> all the same. In the bronze position, the consolatory <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7ZXBV5qJw\" title=\"\">Follow Me</a> piles on the rave dynamics and dubstep nods in another bow to the maximalist productions of the chart mainstream. Somewhere in this extremely successful rock band is a slinky pop band clamouring to get out.</p> <p>The rock band is quite a lot of fun too. By now, most will be familiar with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66molzUEkWI\" title=\"\">Survival</a>, the Olympics jingle that broke all records for enhanced performance silliness and quasi-Nietzschean pep talking. It sturms, it drangs and finally collapses in on itself in a flurry of falsetto, having out-Queened Queen. It's not alone. The opening track also heads straight for the nuclear option. \"Wake to see/ Your true emancipation is a fantasy!\" intones Bellamy at the start of Supremacy, another maximal workout (low-slung metal bass, strings, military rat-a-tat, falsetto, kitchen sink) that soon matures into a warning \u2013 to the bankers and their political friends, one might assume.</p> <p>Bassist Chris Wolstenholme says of <em>The 2nd Law</em> that \"this time, we really went the whole hog\". Presumably this relegates the super-massive airborne rock piggery of their previous efforts to mere bacon sandwich status. Bellamy is not blind to the contradictions of his band's attempts continually to ramp the ludicrousness up to 11; endless growth is, of course, unsustainable. But for now they remain pretty comfortable with the idea of obscene over-inflation. So should we.</p>",
  "<p>\"A nasty little shocker\" was how the <em>TLS</em> described <em>A Clockwork Orange </em>when it was published in 1962. Half a century on, Anthony Burgess joins TS Eliot and Shakespeare in having his work turned into a blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/lp/aclockworkorangeapp\" title=\"\">iPad app</a>.</p> <p>Like Faber's pioneering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/12/ts-eliot-waste-land-ipad-app\" title=\"\"><em>The Waste Land</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/08/the-sonnets-william-shakespeare-app\" title=\"\"><em>The Sonnets</em></a><em> </em>apps, <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> (William Heinemann and PopLeaf, \u00a39.99) combines interactive text, archival documents and video and sound recordings in a lavish production that for once warrants the words \"unique\" and \"spectacular\" in the press release.</p> <p>You don't have to adore the novel (I prefer the film) for the app to make you a mad-eyed evangelist, prone to shoving your iPad in strangers' faces. \"Hey, check out the integrated glossary of Nadsat slang! Listen to Tom Hollander narrate it! Watch Martin Amis talk about the controversial last chapter! Hear Burgess being interviewed! Look at his doodles on the original typescript!\" Yes, the <em>Clockwork Orange </em>app's major downside is that it will turn you into a bore.</p> <p>As with other literary apps, its real value is educational: the democratisation of material once the preserve of scholars and biographers. The archive section is great fun, like rifling through a shoebox belonging to Anthony Burgess's stalker. I enjoyed the advance information sheet, where the author's hobbies are listed as \"drinking, educational broadcasting, comparative philology and the occult\".</p> <p>Anyone who still believes new technology will turn us all into illiterate morons needs to be marched off to a correctional facility, strapped to a chair and given the <em>Clockwork Orange </em>app to play with. It may well cure them.</p>",
  "<p>Historians often dream of being able to eavesdrop on history, but few can hope to obtain such spectacularly direct access as that presented in this major addition to the literature on the second world war. Discovered in 2001 by the historian S\u00f6nke Neitzel, the transcripts of conversations between German prisoners of war, secretly recorded by the British and American intelligence services, offer a vivid and at times surprising insight into the mentality of the German military.</p> <p>Organised into sections on various aspects of the wartime experience \u2013 \"fighting, killing and dying\", \"sex\", \"technology\" \u2013 the book focuses on reconstructing what the authors term the prisoners' \"frame of reference\". While Neitzel and Welzer \u2013 a social psychologist \u2013 quote extensively from the transcripts, much of the book is an analysis of the prisoners' fluctuating psychology.</p> <p>The authors insist that what the transcripts document is not so much the historical facts (although discussions of troop movements and equipment were of considerable use to the allies) as the perception of these facts by the German military. Their study thus amounts to a lesson in hermeneutics: however repulsive rape and mass executions appear from a peacetime perspective, the tone of the conversations suggests that to most of the German soldiers, such things were simply the background to their lives. In order to understand their world view, condemnation is much less productive than a careful reconstruction of their attitudes and assumptions.</p> <p>Particularly striking is the extent to which all combatants see themselves in terms borrowed from industrial labour. They focus on hitting \"targets\" and achieving \"results\", as an efficient way of rationalising violence and instrumentalising human casualties. Indeed, the authors conclude that the decisive factor in making atrocities possible was \"a general realignment from a civilian to a wartime frame of reference\". For many of the recruits, war was simply the continuation of work by other means.</p> <p>This attitude extends to their view of the Holocaust. The transcripts prove once and for all that \"practically all German soldiers knew or suspected that Jews were being murdered\". The traditional argument, that it was only the SS who had any knowledge of the genocide, is simply untenable. However, the authors conclude that ordinary soldiers had strikingly little interest in the Holocaust, preferring to swap stories about medals and comrades.</p> <p>Time and again, the prisoners display what the authors term \"cognitive dissonance\", whereby they hold seemingly contradictory views. The ever-more convoluted attempts to exculpate the F\u00fchrer, despite the increasingly obvious fact that the war was lost, provide a striking example of this mechanism: the German military had simply invested too much emotional energy in Hitler to allow him to fail. The transcripts also suggest that some of the best-known cliches are unfounded: most of the soldiers needed no period of \"brutalisation\" \u2013 they simply transferred their work ethic to their new tasks. Nor do their discussions support the idea of a decline in morale towards the end of the war.</p> <p>Deftly translated by Jefferson Chase, these transcripts constitute an invaluable historical document precisely because the prisoners did not know that they would become a \"source\". Unlike memoirs, interviews or legal records, there is no personal agenda, nor are these conversations prejudiced by the kinds of ex post facto knowledge that can distort retrospective discussions. Instead, they offer \"live\" commentary on how the war was unfolding from the German perspective. In this, they are a military counterpart to the civilian perspective recorded in the anonymous diaries published as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/26/anonyma-a-woman-in-berlin?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"><em>A Woman in Berlin</em></a>.</p> <p>The psychological analysis offered by the authors, meanwhile, is insightful and largely persuasive. If the psychologists Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich famously diagnosed the postwar German \"inability to mourn\", this book presents an unprecedented source for understanding the ability to massacre.</p>",
  "<p>Something confusing happened last week. The BBC security correspondent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza1\" title=\"\">Frank Gardner, went on the radio</a> and accidentally told people something that the Queen had once thought. Apparently, it's against protocol to reveal any of the Queen's thoughts or feelings, and, if she ever shares them with you, at an informal dinner, garden party or knighting, you have to take the secret to your grave as if she's shown you her donkey ears. The BBC immediately and unreservedly apologised in obvious terror of the sovereign's wrath. This, in turn, seems odd because, by making it so clear that she'd be angry, they accidentally let the whole nation in on another of her top secret royal emotions.</p> <p>What makes this even odder is that the monarchical opinion that Gardner reported is so deeply unworthy of remark: he said that she'd been \"pretty upset\" that Abu Hamza couldn't be arrested when he was such an obvious ne'er-do-well. In terms of controversy, this is on about the same level as \"What a pity it rained on the jubilee weekend\" or \"That Louis Walsh seems like an odd fellow.\"</p> <p>She's been on the throne for six decades, but we know so little about her: she likes corgis and horses, she hates Abu Hamza, and she hates people knowing that she hates Abu Hamza. I don't quite understand why. Maybe she thinks Abu Hamza is really popular. Maybe she's scared that the monarchy will be overturned if the public realise how much she despises their beloved Hamza. Maybe she thinks he's a rap star or something. Maybe she meant Monty Panesar.</p> <p>I suppose the idea is that the monarch should be above political views \u2013 that must be why Prince Charles is working so hard to get all his out of his system in time. This is a democracy and so, if our unelected head of state is associated with any opinion more contentious than regret at a tsunami, people will begin to suspect that she's influencing policy. This case is a particularly juicy opportunity for republicans to moan because Gardner claimed that she communicated her displeasure at AH's continued liberty to the home secretary. That's practically ordering his arrest, they could argue. \"Off with his head!\" says the Queen. The fact that everyone then ignores her is hardly an argument in favour of the continued funding of the civil list.</p> <p>But I think the main reason for the presumed palatial anger is that the Queen's opinions, if made public, are likely to disappoint everyone. While they're still secret, monarchists can believe that Her Majesty's head is full of wise and noble thoughts, that she gives pertinent and timely advice to stressed premiers and provides continuity and perspective. Meanwhile, her detractors can assume she's a Nazi. But the truth is likely to lie somewhere disappointingly and blandly in between \u2013 as exemplified by her views on Abu Hamza.</p> <p>I decided to test my hypothesis and have spent the past few days investigating. I've been exploring the secret bars where footmen go to drink. Armed with a truth serum and the offer of unlimited Dubonnets, I've been quizzing disgraced butlers, dismissed bodyguards, ladies too long in waiting and former ambassadors from failed states. I've made a pass at the Dowager Duchess of Carnarvon and I've posed as someone offering to tarmac the King of Greece's drive. I was worried I'd be exposed but none of these people has ever seen <em>Peep Show</em>. And I have now compiled an exhaustive list of Her Majesty the Queen's secret opinions:</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson is refreshingly honest</strong></p> <p>\"He's not like the other politicians, is he?\" the Queen apparently recently said of London's ubiquitous mayor. \"He doesn't take himself too seriously.\" Her Majesty believes that politics has become too much about presentation and spin and that it makes a nice change to see someone a bit scruffy, who's happy to make a joke, in a position of power. She has also ventured the view that this means that it's OK for him to have affairs if he wants to.</p> <p><strong>John Humphrys interrupts people too much</strong></p> <p>An avid listener to the <em>Today</em> programme, what the Queen has uniquely pointed out is that John Humphrys doesn't listen properly to the people he's interviewing. \"Why doesn't he let them say their piece, even if he disbelieves them!?\" Her Majesty shouts at the radio every morning over the din of her breakfast bagpiper.</p> <p><strong>Tim Henman is a choker</strong></p> <p>While the tennis star's style of play greatly impressed Her Majesty, she believed that, when it came to key moments in high-pressure matches, he lacked the focus and drive to push for victory. The Queen's view was that the British player's comparatively affluent middle-class background had deprived him of the hunger that spurred his rivals on to success.</p> <p><strong>Ted Heath wasn't gay but just sort of asexual</strong></p> <p>The Queen doesn't go along with the theory that Ted Heath must have been gay. \"I think sexuality is much more of a spectrum,\" Her Majesty often says. But Mr Heath \"was different\" and showed no sign of fancying either the Queen or Prince Philip which was apparently \"almost unheard-of for a political leader until about 1982\".</p> <p><strong>Canned laughter ruins a sitcom</strong></p> <p>\"I don't need to be told when to laugh,\" the Queen often remarks. She thinks it's a terrible shame when perfectly good comedy programmes are ruined by intrusive and patronising laughter tracks. \"You don't get audience laughter on the classic comedies like <em>The Good Life</em> and <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em>.\"</p> <p><strong>Mineral water is a waste of money</strong></p> <p>The Queen never ceases to be amazed by the amount of money people waste on mineral water. \"You can drink it out of the tap \u2013 what's the problem?\" she has often been heard to moan to the Earl of Wessex who is seldom without an accompanying Volvic.</p> <p><strong>Terry Venables should be England manager</strong></p> <p>\"I don't understand why we didn't just stick with that \u2013 it seemed to be going reasonably well,\" the Queen often complains when her footman brings her the latest England result, embroidered on a napkin. \"All this chopping and changing is confusing. Why don't we just make him do it permanently?\"</p> <p><strong>If global warming exists, how come Balmoral is so draughty?</strong></p> <p>\"We could do with a bit of global warming up here, I tell you!\" the Queen repeatedly jokes. \"Talk to me about global warming when the Land Rover is stuck in six feet of snow.\" It's believed that Prince Charles did just that for several hours last January.</p>",
  "<p>Hacking comes in three varieties. The first two that came to our collective attention are bad. One is an invasion of privacy practised mainly by middle-aged men on celebrities and the vulnerable; the other is carried out mainly by teenage boys on the military-industrial complex. Both are well-documented and often result in a court appearance. But there's a third kind, a good kind, so far unfeatured on <em>Newsnight</em> and mainly practised mainly by young men with enthusiastic smiles and creative facial hair who know their Python from their Ruby on Rails (they're programming languages, dummy). The good kind is about taking something apart \u2013 a computer, a line of code, a set of data \u2013 and rebuilding it, hopefully making it better, giving it a new function, or just doing something surprising and disruptive.</p> <p>When these good hackers meet up it's sometimes called a hackday or a codefest, but more often it's called a hackathon. These events have been around for a while: the word was coined back in 1999. Since then hackathons have flourished. Hackers love to meet other hackers, team up and collaborate \u2013 and then show off the results.</p> <p>Here in the break-out area of the donated London headquarters of Mozilla \u2013 the maker of the Firefox web browser \u2013 nearly 80 people have assembled for an all-weekend hackathon. It's Friday evening, and the event doesn't end till 9pm on Sunday: many of the participants have come prepared with sleeping bags, energy snacks and anti-perspirant. The majority are male and under 30, dressed in check shirts or tees with geek-joke slogans, such as \"Se\u00f1or developer\" or \"Munch my data\".</p> <p>The event's organisers are called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3_Beards\" title=\"\">3 Beards</a>, though it turns out there are four of them and only three have significant bristles. They also organise a Friday-night meet-up for technology types in east London called the <a href=\"http://www.silicondrinkabout.com/\" title=\"\">Silicon Drinkabout</a>; a <em>Dragons' Den</em>-style event for tech startup businesses called <a href=\"http://dont.pitchmebro.com/\" title=\"\">Don't Pitch Me, Bro!</a>, and something called the <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalsizzle.com/\" title=\"\">Digital Sizzle</a> \u2013 a tech event with a barbecue as its defining feature. This is Digital Sizzle number 6: the first one that isn't free (tickets are \u00a345) and the first one to take the form of a hack.</p> <p>Hackathons come in many varieties: they can be themed around a particular programming language; focused on creating stuff for a particular platform, such as Android; or a company might invite hackers to build new things using its content \u2013 Yahoo! has run an open hack day since 2006. The 3&#xa0;Beards thought London hackathons tended to concentrate on creating startups. \"They are mainly focused on creating a business idea, then pitching it on the final evening, along with all the relevant trimmings \u2013 revenue plan, target market, etc,\" says 3 Beards's Michael Hobson. \"We thought that by making the output purely artistic, it would foster more creativity and allow people to really run wild with their ideas.\"</p> <p>So this hack has a theme: art meets tech. The aim of the weekend is to encourage the hackers to take some of the masses of data living on the internet, or even create some of their own (in one case with goldfish), and present it in new, unusual ways, to make something from it \u2013 a piece of music, an artwork, a machine, a game \u2013 something that brings the data to life. Not everyone here has a computing background: a smattering of artists, designers, musicians have signed up to collaborate.</p> <p>Some hackers have come prepared with an idea. About a dozen take turns to explain their plan to the rest of the group, hoping to fire imaginations and recruit fellow hackers to their team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397021347\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348837639891/DataDress-social-media-pa-001.jpg\" alt=\"DataDress social media pattern\" width=\"200\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DataDress, woven from social media pictures generated during London Fashion Week.

She would like to remind the nerds of the age-&#xa0;old link between weaving looms and the computer.</p> <p>Stef Lewandowski describes himself as a hacker and knows how to work a crowd of geeks: \"What we need is lasers!\" gets a cheer. He's booked time on Saturday with a laser-cutting workshop. His plan is to turn tweets into wearable jewellery.</p> <p>Developer Gavin Clark says he has two ideas. One is a \"death clock\", which will use basic personal information to calculate when and why you will die \u2013 and use a projector to display an image of, say, a heart attack on to your body. He also wants to make a machine that will reproduce the weather from somewhere else in the world using lights, fans and a hose.</p> <p>Other hackers say they plan to do work with football data, or make art from Transport for London information. Another suggests turning \"emotional data into liquid\".</p> <p>For inspiration, the crowd watch a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/aaron_koblin.html\" title=\"\">TED talk from Google data artist Aaron Koblin</a>, whose team worked on the <a href=\"http://thewildernessdowntown.com/\" title=\"\">Arcade Fire/Chris Milk film for We Used to Wait</a>, which allowed you to incorporate Google Street View images of your home town into the video \u2013 an exemplary instance of tech meeting art. Wrapping up, Benjamin Southworth an ex-3&#xa0;Beard who is now deputy CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.techcityuk.com/#!/home\" title=\"\">Tech City Investment Organisation</a> (Tech City is what the government wants us to call Silicon Roundabout) implores the gathering to \"take something that's raw and honest, turn it into magic\".</p> <p>Tonight the hackers have to go home, but, after they return at 9am on Saturday, they don't have to leave until Sunday night. The organisers have supplied everything a hacker could possibly need: powerful Hewlett Packard PCs, XBox Kinects, various bits of hardware they might need to add GPS, lighting and sound to their projects. There are mentors from cloud communication firm <a href=\"http://www.twilio.com/?_kk=twilo&amp;_kt=901dc98a-a739-4dbf-8df3-6cf16043d540&amp;pi_ad_id=10117003744&amp;gclid=CMPD65zW1bICFYKMfAod9GwAdA\" title=\"\">Twilo</a> and social media monitoring specialists <a href=\"http://www.brandwatch.com/\" title=\"\">Brandwatch</a> giving expert advice and access to their web services. There is a generous supply of beer, coffee, burgers and Mexican food. And there's one shower.</p> <p>Yet participants aren't here for the new toys, diabetes-inducing diet and natural odours. A hackathon is about much more than that. As Michael Hobson explains: \"The participants get an experience which is hard to find elsewhere. It's only in this high-pressure, time-sensitive environment that you can really come face-to-face with yourself, and see what you're capable of. People surprise themselves with what they can output over a weekend\u2026 At the very least, it can give them a thirst to be more productive in their day-to-day life.\"</p> <p>There's also a brand of tech speed-dating going on. \"As well as the 'inward' development,\" says Hobson, \"they also form close bonds with the people they collaborate with. It can go either way \u2013 if you really get on with the person, you'll have a great friendship, but, if they get on your nerves, then it will come to the surface much quicker.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-HJs_gbKic?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-HJs_gbKic?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>By Sunday, the sense of bonhomie is palpable and rather surprisingly the sense of body odour is not: these are clearly quite hygienic people. The 20 teams are given three minutes to present their hacks to the audience. Judges are going to select a number of the works for a one-night-only show at the Whitechapel gallery, who, like the <em>Observer</em>, are sponsoring the event.</p> <p>Rachel Taylor and her team present their dress made entirely from Instagram and Flickr pictures, a mask made from faces, and a hat made from tweets \u2013 all grabbed from London Fashion Week. The death clock was jettisoned very early on, but Gavin Clark and his team have a rudimentary weather machine to show the crowd. It works like this: the audience vote by text for the city weather they would like to witness (Jakarta, New Delhi, Rio, Cape Town and Beijing are on offer), then, with the help of a lamp, a fan, a strobe light and pond pump that streams water down a plastic sheet, they get to see 10 days' worth of weather in 100 seconds. Beijing wins, and each time it rains there's a big&#xa0;cheer.</p> <p>Stef Lewandowski (who worked alone; he calls this a \"solo hack\") asks for six women \u2013 which is most of the women in the room \u2013 to model his data jewellery. Some is in the form of coloured acrylic strands that hang from a necklace, some cut from felt and sitting on the collarbone. His wife's past 3,000 tweets are visualised as a necklace (\"The length of the strands corresponds with how chatty she is in a given period\"), while a \"necklace of death\" uses red acrylic strands to visualise how many people are talking about death on a given day, and includes an engraving of the name of someone who appeared in the <em>Guardian</em> obituaries that day. After some deliberation, the judges decide on three winners: Stef's necklaces, the See-Thru Planet iPad app, and the RSVP Network.</p> <p>Ten days later, 600 people turn up to see the projects at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/whitechapel-gallery\" title=\"\">Whitechapel gallery</a> in east London, not far from Silicon Roundabout. The teams have had a chance to polish their work and get it ready to show off in the gallery's vast white spaces.</p> <p>Stef, a veteran of many hackathons, tells me that that is what made the Digital Sizzle hackathon unique. \"This event raises the whole thing. Instead of making something that only my fellow hackers see, I'm making something that is worth someone else's time to look at.\"</p> <p>Some of the projects have already attracted commercial interest. Stef has had orders for his necklaces, and \"the wife of someone famous\" has expressed an interest in investing. If that doesn't work out, he's thinking of raising funds when <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> launches in the UK. The weather guys have set up meetings with Virgin Atlantic and Emirates, which are both interested in the idea of machines in airports that simulate the weather in travellers' destinations.</p> <p>The tech-art culture clash has pleased Iwona Blazwick, director of the Whitechapel, who says: \"We have been so impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit as well as the sheer speed at which the techies work. Everything is possible! The results demonstrate how the collaborative power of artists with technology experts can make us see our world with fresh eyes.\"</p> <p>3 Beards's Bryce Keane is sipping on a well-earned raspberry beer. Plans are already being made to turn it into a annual event with a longer two-week exhibition. \"I don't think we imagined it would be this successful, but we're really happy that it is. It shows the London tech scene is alive and well.\"</p> <p><em>The organisers would also like to thank headline sponsors <a href=\"http://www.wpschallenger.com/\">WPS Challenger</a>, along with <a href=\"http://mindcandy.com/\">Mind Candy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wirehive.net/\">Wirehive</a>, <a href=\"http://designa-z.tumblr.com/\">Hewlett Packard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.diginate.com/\">Diginate Printers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.casio-projectors.eu/uk/\">Casio Projectors</a> and <a href=\"http://www.leaderboarded.com/home/\">Leaderboarded</a></em></p>",
  "<p>\"Photography is nothing,\" the great photojournalist <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/cartierbresson/0,,1276080,00.html\" title=\"\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a> once said. \"It's life that interests me.\" This quote came back to me on first seeing Maciej Dakowicz's images from the series <em>Cardiff After Dark</em>, published as a monograph tomorrow. All human life is here, the gamut of exaggerated human emotion as it is played out each weekend on a few central streets and bars of the Welsh capital.</p> <p>Because of the subject matter of these photographs \u2013 the ways in which young people choose to enjoy themselves to excess on a Saturday night \u2013 you could say that <a href=\"http://www.thirdfloorgallery.com/exhibitions.html#upcoming\" title=\"\"><em>Cardiff After Dark</em></a> is a visual essay about Britain's binge-drinking culture. If you were you so inclined, you could even view it as a snapshot of what has gone wrong with Britain since deference and good manners gave way to lack of respect and vulgarity. \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2040260/Maciej-Dakowicz-Cardiff-After-Dark-binge-drinking-images-turned-Britain-laughing-stock.html\" title=\"\">Captured on our streets by a foreign lens, the shaming images that turned Britain into a laughing stock,</a>\" ran a <em>Daily Mail</em> headline from September 2011, which managed to shoot the messenger <em>and</em> fume about this nation's disgrace.</p> <p>On closer observation, though, Dakowicz's work evades this kind of reductive appraisal. The photographs in this book are loud, the behaviour they show often vulgar. The more you look, though, the more you glimpse a certain collective doggedness in this wild pursuit of pleasure and abandonment, a doggedness that suggests much deeper discontent.</p> <p>However, it is not all outrageousness and vulgarity: Dakowicz also catches the sense of camaraderie and celebration in Cardiff on a Saturday night. He has an outsider's eye for telling detail, a way of showing us, in often brilliantly dramatic fashion and with a degree of gleeful humour, what is right under our noses.</p> <p>\"I live in Cardiff but I am not from here,\" says Dakowicz. \"And, though I often take a few drinks for courage, I was not partying with the people I photographed. I was on the outside watching, observing. So, yes, I am an outsider, but I also interact. I am not a sneaky photographer, trying to shoot something and then run away.\"</p> <p>Dakowicz was born in 1976 in Bialystok, Poland. He came to Cardiff from Hong Kong in 2004, to work and study at the University of Glamorgan for a PhD in computer science, which he obtained in 2010. That same year, he opened the <a href=\"http://www.thirdfloorgallery.com/\" title=\"\">Third Floor Gallery</a> in Cardiff with his friend and fellow photographer, <a href=\"http://www.jonikaranka.com/\" title=\"\">Joni Karanka</a>.</p> <p>One thing I admire about Dakowicz&nbsp;is his obsessive dedication. For this book, he photographed the same few streets in Cardiff on a Saturday night for five years. On a good night, Dakowicz shot up to 500 pictures; on a bad one, only 50. <em>Cardiff After Dark</em> condenses those many long nights of wandering the streets and shooting into one. It is, in many ways, a hymn to the city's ever-shifting after-hours momentum, a narrative that tracks the moods and rhythms of a night on the town.</p> <p>Often, Dakowicz catches several moods and rhythms in one image. One of the most intriguing photographs in the book is also one of the strangest: a couple are kissing in a bar, her face is hidden by his head and her hand is outstretched across his chest towards another young man, who appears to be biting her nails. It is a glimpse of that strangely suspended reality that holds sway in certain bars at certain times of the night, when all the normal rules of behaviour start to dissolve into a more fluid kind of human interaction.</p> <p>What strikes the viewer initially is the full force of Cardiff's drinking culture, the sheer spectacle of this weekend ritual of excess. There are a lot of horizontal people in these pictures, a lot of bare flesh on show. The skirts tend to be short, the heels high \u2013 and that sometimes goes for the men as well as the women. You will see women having their breasts felt and men with their trousers around their ankles. There is, inevitably, some blood, a lot of sweat and more than a few tears. There is vomit and violence and there is litter. So much litter.</p> <p>Having lived with these pictures for some time now, I have found myself increasingly drawn to the quieter ones, especially those in which a single figure or a couple are the still centre of the frame. There is the haunting portrait of a beautiful young woman perched on a stool in a low-lit bar who catches the eye of Dakowicz's camera just as he presses the shutter. She looks as composed as a sitter in a traditional, posed portrait, except for that glimmer of curiosity in her eyes. In her beautiful calmness, she, too, is part of the narrative of <em>Cardiff After Dark</em> just as much as the butch lad in the negligee or the woman face down on the pavement or the defiant man with the smashed and bloody nose.</p> <p><em>Pictures from the series Cardiff After Dark will be exhibited at the </em><a href=\"http://www.thirdfloorgallery.com/exhibitions.html#upcoming\" title=\"\"><em>Third Floor Gallery, Cardiff</em></a><em>, from 14 October to 2 December</em></p>",
  "<p>Ever since the early days of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/muse\" title=\"Muse\">Muse</a>, frontman Matt Bellamy and drummer Dom Howard have shared a running joke about success. Before each major concert, each step up the ladder, Bellamy turns to Howard and says: \"Is this it? Have we made it yet?\" Every time, the drummer shakes his head and replies: \"Not yet. Nearly.\"</p> <p>Muse's unabashed hunger for megastardom is unique among British bands of the post-indie era, who tend to reject it (Radiohead), blow it (Oasis) or be pathologically humble about it (Coldplay). Muse, however, never flinch at excess. Only health and safety thwarted their plans to dangle acrobats from a helicopter over Wembley Stadium in 2007. Their forthcoming tour in support of sixth album The 2nd Law will find them playing beneath an inverted pyramid of LED screens: an upside-down version of the \"all-seeing eye\" beloved of conspiracy theorists. \"It's turning the power structure of the world on its head,\" Howard says matter-of-factly.</p> <p>Muse have sold more than 15m albums. Their last one, 2009's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/11/muse-the-resistance-review\" title=\"The Resistance,\">The Resistance,</a> was No 1 in 19 countries. Like Depeche Mode in the 1980s, they are taken more seriously outside their homeland, in countries where people are less likely to arch an eyebrow at songs with rococo arrangements and titles such as Exogenesis: Symphony Part 2 (Cross-Pollination). Since releasing their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, the trio from Teignmouth, Devon have made their quixotically ambitious music a global concern by touring longer, farther and harder than anybody else. They used to say yes to everything, working themselves to exhaustion and becoming, says Howard, \"cynical and weird\". Success has bought them a saner work-life balance.</p> <p>I meet Bellamy, Howard and bass-player Chris Wolstenholme <strong> </strong>separately during breaks in tour rehearsals at north London's Air Studios. When they made <em>The Resistance</em> each of them was living in a different country but this time they're all based in or near London, although Bellamy and Howard also have homes in Los Angeles. The singer is engaged to the actress Kate Hudson, which makes him future son-in-law to Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, and the couple have a one-year-old son, Bingham Hawn Bellamy, whose foetal heartbeat is sampled on the new album's dubstep-disco-U2 monster Follow Me.</p> <p>So by any measure 34-year-old Bellamy is a star, but he doesn't have the aura of one. His sharp features and stick-figure frame jangle with a wary, wiry intensity and he talks quickly, with many nervous giggles. If you didn't know what he did, you might assume he was a talented software programmer with a small fortune in Silicon Valley stock options.</p> <p>\"On stage it's easy,\" he says. \"There's something about the audience and the energy that takes you to this place. I have trouble being like that when I'm not on stage. I tend to be a bit quiet \u2013 a touch avoidant, y'know? I think you do get what you visualise. I never dreamed about being in a limo or being backstage with loads of girls. I only visualised playing very well and enjoying it.\" He says that seeing the attention Hudson gets \"definitely puts your world into perspective\". Howard reckons that family life has made the singer \"slightly more relaxed, but to me he's still as manic and weird and meticulous as he's always been\".</p> <p>Because Muse's success rests on tours and albums rather than hits and headlines, they are not quite household names, so some viewers were doubtless puzzled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/12/london-2012-olympics-closing-ceremony-live\" title=\"during the Olympics closing ceremony\">during the Olympics closing ceremony</a> by the trio's performance of Survival, a berserk, operatic anthem that seemed more appropriate to a supervillain than an athlete: \"I won't forgive/ The vengeance is mine/ And I won't give in/ Because I choose to thrive.\" Bellamy admits that the song was already written when the organisers approached him. \"It was definitely a bit more demented than I think they realised,\" he says with pleasure.</p> <p>Survival makes a lot more sense in the context of <em>The 2nd Law</em>, an album which encompasses the global economic crisis, peak oil theory, food security, evolution, the taxation proposals of 19th-century economist Henry George and the concept of the \"stress nexus\". \"It's talking about the second law of thermodynamics and how, as a limited ecosystem, we are on the verge of needing an energy revolution in order to sustain the way that we're living,\" says Bellamy. \"This inner strength we have, this desire to evolve and expand and explore, I do love that about humanity. At the same time it's scary what it does on a global scale. I'm very much caught between the two.\" Bellamy is self-aware enough to have considered the quandary of criticising overconsumption while traversing the globe in a gas-guzzling stadium rock band. \"Exactly! We're all a function of the world. I think for every finger you point out there should be three pointing back at you.\"</p> <p>You don't get this kind of stuff from the Kings of Leon, but then Muse have been putting grand ideas into their records for years now. <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>, the 2006 album which broke them in the US, was in part a bilious condemnation of the architects of the Iraq war while <em>The Resistance</em> was an us-vs-them concept album heavily inspired by <em>Nineteen-Eighty-Four</em>. (They dismiss as \"complete nonsense\" a recent $3.5m claim that it was plagiarised from US songwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/12/muse-resistance-lawsuit\" title=\"Charles Bollfrass\">Charles Bollfrass</a>.) I suspect Bellamy's politics are often overlooked because (a) he has never aligned himself with a specific cause and (b) he frames them in such a blockbuster manner that people assume he's joking \u2013 which, he insists, he is not. \"I don't think our records contain obvious humour,\" he says, a touch defensively. \"We're not cracking gags.\"</p> <p>A few years ago, Bellamy's reading list was more outr\u00e9. He often recommended that interviewers imbibe the wisdom of David Icke, although even he admitted the theory about the royal family being alien lizard people was a little too ripe. \"I was getting very drawn into obscure conspiracy theories,\" he concedes. \"As time's moved on I've become far more rational and empirical and I've managed to focus on slightly more realistic, tangible things.\"</p> <p>It's a wise move. Muse were taken aback when <em>The Resistance</em> was embraced by swivel-eyed Fox News demagogue Glenn Beck (\"the lyrics are just dead-on [about] what's coming our way\") and the single Uprising began soundtracking YouTube clips produced by the kind of people who believe climate change is a socialist conspiracy and Obama is an Indonesian Muslim. (Conservative attention seems to run in the family: Bellamy's father George used to play rhythm guitar in the Tornados, whose 1962 chart-topper Telstar was one of Margaret Thatcher's <em>Desert Island Discs </em>choices.)</p> <p>\"In the US the conspiracy theory subculture has been hijacked by the right to try to take down people like Obama and put forward right-wing libertarianism,\" Bellamy agrees. He defines himself as \"a left-leaning libertarian \u2013 more in the realm of Noam Chomsky. It doesn't all have to be about guns and land protection, y'know? So yeah, I do find it weird. Uprising was requested by so many politicians in America for use in their rallies and we turned them down on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>Bellamy's motives as a lyricist aren't polemical but personal, even therapeutic. \"When I dabble in watching the news and reading about current events I tend to get a future negative view and that's something I've dealt with through music. It's quite possible I'm slightly paranoid.\" A giggle. \"But I'd say making music is an expression of feelings of helplessness and lack of control that I think a lot of people can relate to.\"</p> <p>His songwriting stems from the belief that music can transform and transcend the everyday. \"I remember the first classical music I heard, Berlioz and Chopin\u2013 it did something to me that I still can't put into words. It's a sense of timelessness. It's something to do with the whole condition of life and death and time. It somehow makes all those things connect.\" He's full of wonder when he talks about music, but laughs neurotically whenever I mention fame or ambition. \"Dom's the one to speak to about ambition,\" he says. \"I think basically the band's career is me trying to please Dom.\"</p> <p>Dom Howard is Muse's unflappable rock pro: the free-and-single, up-all-night one who uses the phrase \"rocking out\" without reservation. \"Even when we were sitting around in Matt's nan's basement writing songs we'd be dreaming of <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/nme-video/muse-at-reading---our-fans-are-the-most-dedicated-in-the-world/1133191383001\" title=\"headlining the main stage at Reading\">headlining the main stage at Reading</a>,\" he says. \"We've always had our sights set on being the biggest band in the world.\" He laughs, because it's an unfashionable thing to say these days, but not that hard, because he means it. \"Still going for it. Why not? If you're going to do it, do it properly.\"</p> <p>Before they wanted to be the biggest band in the world, Muse simply wanted to be bigger than Doctor Frank, a funk covers band from Teignmouth. \"They were the local heroes: the big boys with their posh instruments,\" says Wolstenholme, remembering Muse's first \"battle of the bands\" show in 1994. \"There wasn't much of an original music scene in Devon and when we started we realised why \u2013 because nobody wanted to watch original music. We played gigs to nobody.\"</p> <p>Here are the roots of Muse's unusual tenacity. For a long time they had no supportive scene, no wise mentor, no industry connections. Bellamy, a gifted musician but naturally shy, only reluctantly became singer and chief songwriter because \"nobody wanted to join our band\". They played gigs for five years before releasing <em>Showbiz</em> and even then Bellamy struggled as frontman. \"It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be,\" he says. \"The songs were a bit moody. When you're having to play them every night it can be a bit draining.\"</p> <p>He had an epiphany during Muse's first concert in Japan. Maddened by the audience's lethargy, he thought \"fuck it\" and executed a corny knee slide while shouting \"Come on!\" \"They suddenly went mental,\" he remembers, smiling. \"I thought: if I act stupid and have fun the crowd likes it. That's when we stopped taking it seriously.\"</p> <p>Muse have had many \"fuck it\" moments, becoming more fearlessly flamboyant each time. When I ask bassist Chris Wolstenholme if he's ever thought, in the studio, that a Muse song was too ridiculous he replies, half-jokingly: \"Probably every song we've ever done [is]. You can go on writing traditional pop-rock songs and get stale or try something new. There are risks either way.\" Howard cheerfully says, \"I love the excessiveness of the whole thing. I love Survival for that. You could say the choir's too much but you know what? It makes it. I like pushing it as far as we can.\"</p> <p>It's always an achievement for a band to retain its original line-up on the long and tricky path from youth clubs to stadiums. It's especially remarkable when one band member trod most of that path as an alcoholic. If you had to guess which one you'd choose the neurotic singer or hard-partying drummer over Wolstenholme, an affable family man who has the names of his wife and four of his six children tattooed in various languages on his arms and, until recently, still lived in Teignmouth. He is so untouched by fame that the other dads at school only found out he was in Muse while talking in the pub after playing football and went home to google him to check he wasn't making it up.</p> <p>But there's a genetic precedent: his father, a pub landlord, drank himself to death when he was 40. Wolstenholme combines rock-solid blokiness with the compulsive candour of someone who has undergone rehab. Only his nervous hand-rubbing betrays the weirdness of discussing the worst experience of his life with a stranger.</p> <p>His drinking began in earnest when Muse's career first took off and he was away from his family for as long as two months at a time. As the band grew so did his intake, until he was knocking back a pint of spirits, two bottles of wine and countless beers a day. It seems inconceivable that, for several years, nobody but his wife realised there was a problem. \"I kept my guard up,\" he says. \"I was quite crafty about how I drank and where I did it. Matt and Dom probably didn't realise how bad it was because I wasn't a nasty drunk. I didn't cause anybody any problems. I just retreated.\"</p> <p>\"For some reason he could still play the bass, even though he was shitfaced,\" says Howard. \"It went wrong literally two or three times in 10 years, which is nothing.\" Eventually, however, it became unignorable. \"He was drinking on stage,\" says Howard. \"I started counting how many drinks he was having during the set and I could see him getting more and more glazed. By the point we came off stage he'd be fucked. It just got too weird.\"</p> <p>Did they give him ultimatums? \"Yeah, a few times. Chris now says things like, I can't believe they put up with me for 10 years. Which is true. I can't believe we did. But we did. I've always believed in band integrity and sticking together. There's something about the fact we all grew up together. We've been together for 18 years now, which is over half our lives.\" Asked what difference Wolstenholme's sobriety has made to the band, he says simply: \"It's given us a future.\"</p> <p>During 2008 Wolstenholme developed panic attacks. \"You drink more to cover the anxiety and then the drink triggers more anxiety and you find yourself in this cycle of hell, basically.\" On April Fool's Day 2009, after a particularly bad period, he \"had a bit of a meltdown and that was it. I made a decision\". The hardest part, he says, was confronting all the difficult emotions he had spent so long submerging. \"Everything I should have dealt with in the previous 10 years suddenly hit me in the face. There are some things I regret. There are probably moments I should have enjoyed more than I did and that's a bit upsetting. With the mess I was in you don't feel any intense emotion any more. You're just subdued all the time. But the upside of that is I'm enjoying it now. I threw myself into music in a way I hadn't done for 10 years. It sounds corny but it was the only thing that made me feel peaceful.\"</p> <p>Previously unable to finish a song, Wolstenholme wrote two about his condition, Save Me and Liquid State, for <em>The 2nd Law</em>. Bellamy compositions such as Madness and Big Freeze are also unusually personal. Together, they suggest a quieter, more intimate Muse. Bigger-is-better escalation has got them this far but you wonder how much further they can push it without toppling into absurdity. I put it to Bellamy by quoting a track from <em>The 2nd Law</em>: \"An economy based on endless growth is unsustainable.\"</p> <p>\"It's a funny one,\" he says thoughtfully. \"As you asked that question, I realised for the first time there's a link between that and the political moments I'm talking about. If there's not an energy revolution we'll have to devolve and live a simpler lifestyle. In Muse, in our music and political things, we're striving for that not to be the case but knowing that we have to change. So yeah, I do want to expand on the subtler, quieter side of the band. Maybe go to a farm in Devon, live off the land, get out the acoustics and go full devolution.\" He laughs self-consciously. \"But I have said that before.\"</p> <p>It's an intriguing idea, this downsized Abel &amp; Cole version of rock's most expansionist band, but Bellamy has no time to dwell on it now. He's been summoned back to rehearsals and leaves the room to address the pressing business of touring the world with an upside-down LED pyramid.</p> <p><em>The 2nd Law is released on 1 October on Warners</em></p>",
  "<p>Since my Channel 4 investigation into <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-105/episode-1\" title=\"\">sex gangs in the UK</a> was aired a year ago, I've not once failed to be left distraught by the photos splashed month after month on our front pages. There seems to be a never-ending number of men convicted of a crime so grotesque that the worst details are often kept out of the press.</p> <p>I stare at the faces of these criminals searching for a hint of evil that will give them away. Yet I am only ever struck by just how ordinary they look: they are blokes you'd pass in the street, someone's father, brother or son. But these men, from towns and cities such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/09/rochdale-gang-jailed-exploiting-girls\" title=\"\">Rochdale</a> and Derby, are far from ordinary: they are guilty of committing some of the vilest and most terrifying sexual crimes against children.</p> <p>Last year, along with a C4 <em>Dispatches</em> team, I started investigating some of these sex gangs and how they preyed on young girls just hitting puberty. They used a deadly combination of charm, coercion and violence to groom them for sexual abuse, rape and&#xa0;gang-rape. What I learnt during those months has often kept me awake at night.</p> <p>This crime has today become heavily politicised due to its racial dimension, the systemic failures of the authorities and the manner in which it has unravelled over the last couple of years. But to understand the complexities around it, it's important to understand the dark heart of the crime.</p> <p>It starts with a pernicious and sophisticated grooming process. Girls between the ages of 11 and 14 are often targeted by boys their own age. They are befriended in the most innocuous of places \u2013 schools, shopping malls, libraries. During this first stage the girls receive gifts, alcohol, cigarettes and are taken to fun places, driven around in cars. Not long after, these young, impressionable girls are introduced to an ever-growing group of older men. Soon they become completely out of their depth as they are sucked into a whirl that is as exciting as it is overwhelming. A girl as young as 12 or 13 might be defenceless against such a potent social vortex.</p> <p>It's at this point that the friendly, warm atmosphere they've been engulfed in turns murky and dark. Many victims of this crime report being suddenly and unexpectedly attacked and raped \u2013 in a public toilet, a yard, an alleyway, even a children's playground. The testimonies of many of the victims then detail that daily and weekly life involves being raped and gang-raped multiple times for several months.</p> <p>One police officer described some of the assaults to me in great detail. The level of sexual violence involved made me feel physically sick; anal rape, horrific internal injuries and sexual humiliation I cannot describe in a newspaper. Who knows, I wondered, as I stared at victims' photos on a police wall, if these girls will ever recover? One young woman I met spoke eloquently about her years of abuse. She told me with well-rehearsed conviction that she has put it behind her, only her glassy eyes gave her away.</p> <p>The question I've been asked more often than any other is why the girls return to their attackers knowingly to face further assault. The question can be offensive if it carries with it an accusation of complicity. I explain that these girls have been through such a destructive form of grooming and assault that they've lost all free will. The crime is so exploitative and manipulative that the girls have no control over their own behaviour.</p> <p>Victims, victim support groups and the parents of victims I interviewed all talked about the omnipotent power the perpetrators wield over the girls. The men use drugs and alcohol to gain compliance; fear, the threat of rape and violence, and the terrible shame the girls feel coerces them into returning. And so the vicious cycle of abuse continues. Some of the experts I interviewed described it as being similar to domestic violence with 10 times the power because the crime was so vicious and the girls so young. Trauma, manipulation and extreme fear are powerful tools to use against anyone, let alone a young teenage girl.</p> <p>Yet some of these victims have been courageous enough to come forward and over the past year there has been court case after court case, with many successful convictions. What <em>Dispatches</em> lifted the lid on no longer surprises. It should come least of all as a surprise to the police, social workers and child protection teams who have known about these crimes for more than a decade. The spotlight appears to have now moved from the criminals to a system that failed to protect young, vulnerable teenage girls. Police officers I have spoken to, a local politician I interviewed \u2013 all told me the crime was not new. In their view, it was at least a generation old.</p> <p>This crime does have one very significant factor that has left me feeling deeply ashamed. The brutality and horror of these acts have nothing to do with me; they are as far removed from my life as the next person's. Yet I somehow feel responsible when I look at the names or faces of the perpetrators.</p> <p>Why? Because a disproportionate number of them are British Pakistani \u2013 just like me. We speak the same language, have the same culture and home life and were probably raised with similar values. Yet somewhere along the way, something went very wrong.</p> <p>This very thought ran through my head when I met two men in Sheffield who claimed to know gangs who groomed girls. They spoke casually about the kudos, easy sex and money that follows the gross exploitation of young girls. It was shocking and nauseating.</p> <p>It's important to stress at this juncture that the vast majority of sexual crimes against children in the UK are committed by white men and that this type of grooming is only a small percentage of those crimes. Of the 1.2&#xa0;million Pakistanis in Britain only a tiny minority has any connection with such deplorable acts of sexual violence. I'm writing this carefully because I want it to be read carefully. These men may be British-Pakistani but that does not mean that this is a crime specific to British-Pakistani men.</p> <p>It was heartening to meet some young Pakistani men in Keighley who felt the same way as I did. They were keen that I make it clear that they, along with the vast majority of British Pakistanis, utterly condemned the evil acts being perpetrated against young girls. \"This is not what we are,\" one told me. \"Our values as British and Muslim people condemn this altogether.\"</p> <p>I often worried during the filming of my investigation, and when writing this article, about how they would contribute towards a terrible new stereotype about British Pakistani men, who include my own decent, respectful and kind brothers. But they, along with many friends of similar background, have been equally sickened by this crime and feel it needs to be condemned vociferously from all quarters.</p> <p>Since my investigation, many high-profile British Pakistanis, politicians and public figures have also joined the chorus. On the ground, community workers have taken up the mantle. Anyone who accuses British Asians of burying their heads in the sand has not met the Pakistani women, youth workers and religious figures who told me enough is&#xa0;now enough. The message appears to&#xa0;be sinking in that if there is silence on this, then the far right will move to fill the gap with their disgraceful rhetoric.</p> <p>But as this last week has evidenced, there is still a long way to go. The authorities need to take responsibility for not spotting the scale of this crime. Child safeguarding boards need to be much more proactive, social workers and police need to look for signs of exploited kids, not just wait for them to come forward, and the courts need to understand that these are not sexually active young women but damaged girls who have endured an unimaginable hell of rape and gang-rape. It's been almost a year since I first reported this; I can only hope it's not still a story this time next year.</p> <p><em>Tazeen Ahmad is working on a follow-up to her Dispatches investigation into Britain's Sex Gangs.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/howard-jacobson?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Howard Jacobson</a> started writing his new novel, a bitter satire on the demise of literary culture in the 21st century, before his previous one, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408808870/the-finkler-question\" title=\"\"><em>The Finkler Question</em></a>, received the 2010 Man Booker prize. You'd think such conspicuous success might have softened his attitude to the reading public, or at least given him pause \u2013 it's surely a bit awkward for an author whose work has been mentioned on the <em>10 O'Clock News</em> to rage about a culture \"which held that a novel didn't have to be well-written to be a masterpiece, indeed was more likely to be a masterpiece for being ill-written\" \u2013 but it seems that his years of perceived neglect can't be forgotten so easily. <em>Zoo Time</em> is a 400-page tantrum directed at reading groups, Amazon reviews, three-for-two offers, Kindle, Richard and Judy, graphic novels, vampire novels, Scandinavian crime novels, declining advances, declining standards of grammar, declining interest in language and psychology, and much else besides.<br>Guy Ableman, the novel's hero, is (like his creator) a middle-aged Jewish author of sex comedies from the north of England. He's involved in an extravagant midlife crisis, largely caused by his dwindling sales, and largely manifested in a frantic desire to sleep with his mother-in-law. To begin with, it's all good, dirty fun. There are some decent jokes and a couple of well-made set pieces. Jacobson has a thundering oratorical voice and a mad priapic energy that at times recalls the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a> of <em>Sabbath's Theater</em>. But pretty soon his hobbyhorse outrides his interest in storytelling, and the narrative becomes cluttered with explicit statements on the plight of serious writers in the marketplace: \"Novels are history\"; \"No one had readers\"; \"Fiction was fucked\". <br>Since <em>Zoo Time</em> deals with character, setting and plot in an entirely cursory way, you can only really engage with it as a piece of pure rhetoric \u2013 and yet its complaints are either unfocused or plain unconvincing. At its heart is nostalgia for \"the idea of the book as a prestigious object, source of wisdom, and impious disturbance\". But the idea that a book might be both \"impious\" and \"prestigious\" is relatively new, and has only ever held sway within a narrow stratum of society. <br>It's unclear quite when the golden age of reading that Ableman pines for is meant to have occurred, but judging from his frequent allusions to Joseph Conrad, Henry James, James Joyce and Henry Miller, he'd situate it at least partially during the modernist period. Those were certainly great years for literature, but were they really so different in terms of literature's reception? Conrad's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9780141389448/nostromo\" title=\"\"><em>Nostromo</em></a> and James's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780199538584/the-golden-bowl\" title=\"\"><em>The Golden Bowl</em></a> were both published in 1904, and it's true that they found contemporary readers, but Marie Corelli published two schlock bestsellers the same year, and these were incomparably more popular. Joyce's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/classics/9781847492173/ulysses\" title=\"\"><em>Ulysses</em></a> and Miller's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007204465/tropic-of-cancer\" title=\"\"><em>Tropic of Cancer</em></a>, meanwhile, far from securing for their authors the kind of universal esteem denied to Jacobson and his contemporaries, were banned for several years after they were written. So much for the good old days.<br>The same goes for Ableman's horror of recent technological innovations such as ebooks and Twitter. In the past hundred years, the advent of mass-market paperbacks, radio, film and television have all been viewed as dooming the novel. For as long as literary culture has existed, there have been warnings of its imminent demise. It's a deeply reactionary attitude. <br>Another predictable source of outrage is the diminished revenue of the publishing industry. (Ableman's editor is pitied because \"he couldn't any longer afford oysters\".) It's true that advances are shrinking drastically at the moment; it's true that writers earn considerably less than pop stars or film directors, and that literary writers earn considerably less than thriller writers. Well, so what? I have nothing against authors earning lots of money \u2013 I wish they earned much more \u2013 but that isn't a cogent reason for saying that they should earn any more, and <em>Zoo Time</em> fails to provide a better one. Just because Howard Jacobson cares more about Henry James than EL James, he takes it as self-evidently depressing that most people don't feel the same. As a basis for satire, that's a non-starter.</p>",
  "<p>Almost without noticing it, our world crossed a significant threshold last week. Jerry Brown, the governor of California, signed into law <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1298&amp;search_keywords=\" title=\"\">a bill</a> that will allow driverless cars on to his state's roads from 2015. Insofar as most people noticed this event at all, they probably sniffed derisively. For some, it'll be seen as an example of techno-hubris \u2013 \"flags on the moon stuff\" \u2013 as one of my acquaintances put it. For others, it will be seen as yet another confirmation of the proposition that the continental United States slopes gently from east to west, with the result that everything with a screw loose rolls into California.</p> <p>Governor Brown signed the bill at Google's HQ in Mountain View. This was good PR on his part, but it also made sense because Google has led the charge into autonomous (aka driverless) vehicles. For several years, Toyota Prius hybrids that have been specially adapted by the company's engineers have been driving the roads of California. To date, they have logged 300,000 miles with only one accident \u2013 caused by a human-controlled car that ran into one of them. And they have now logged 50,000 miles without a human having to take the wheel.</p> <p>At the ceremony in Mountain View, Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/25/google_automatic_cars_legal/\" title=\"\">announced the company's intention</a> to bring autonomous vehicles to the market in five years. In a pre-emptive attack on critics, he pointed out that autonomous vehicles would be significantly safer than human-controlled ones. That seems plausible to me: 40,000 people are killed every year in road accidents in the US and many, if not most, of those are caused by human error. \"This has the power to change lives,\" Brin said. \"Too many people are underserved by the current transport system. They are blind, or too young to drive, or too old, or intoxicated.\" He also argued that manual operation of cars was inefficient: autonomous vehicles could make better use of the road and reduce the size of car parks by fitting into smaller areas than humans could get them into.</p> <p>Ignore the evangelism for a moment and think about what Google has achieved. Its engineers have demonstrated that with smart software and an array of sensors, a machine can perform a task of sophistication and complexity most of us assumed would always require the capabilities of humans. And that means our assumptions about what machines can and cannot do are urgently in need of updating.</p> <p>This isn't just about cars, by the way. Economists in the US are increasingly puzzled by the fact that even after its recession officially ended, the rate of job-creation is much lower than expected and the mean length of time for which people are unemployed has rocketed to 40 weeks, twice as long as that observed during any previous postwar recovery. Economic theory (and history) says that when companies begin to grow or become profitable again, they buy equipment and hire workers. But that isn't happening. Companies are still buying kit, but they're not employing workers.</p> <p>So where did the jobs go? As you'd expect from economists, there are lots of theories. The most intriguing explanation, for my money, has been offered by two MIT academics, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, in their book <a href=\"http://raceagainstthemachine.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Race Against the Machine</em></a>. Crudely stated, their view is that advances in computing of the kind embodied by the Google self-driving car represent the next wave of job-eliminating technology. Many skills that were hitherto deemed secure (such as driving) may be devalued and might eventually become worthless, at least in the job market.</p> <p>You don't have to subscribe to techno-utopian dreams such as Ray Kurzweil's idea of the technological \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity\" title=\"\">singularity</a>\" \u2013 the point at which artificial intelligence (AI) surpasses human intelligence \u2013 to see that Brynjolfsson and McAfee might be on to something. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\" title=\"\">Moore's law</a>, which says that computing power doubles every 18 months, is still doing its stuff. And lots of things that we once thought required fancy AI turned out just to require massive processing power. Think of Siri on the iPhone or the Dragon Dictate software that I'm using to \"write\" this piece.</p> <p>And as for those sceptics who think that driverless cars are too anodyne to appeal to most motorists, there is the uncomfortable fact that, at least in the industrialised world, the car <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563280\" title=\"\">has peaked</a>. We're driving less, year on year. Gridlock drains the romance from driving. And young people are not lusting to own cars like they used to in the era portrayed in the film <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Graffiti\" title=\"\"><em>American Graffiti</em></a>. All that remains is for us to file a Sorn (Statutory Off Road Notification) for Jeremy Clarkson and we're done.</p>",

  "<p>Passengers making one-way journeys on some of Britain's busiest train routes could save money by purchasing return tickets, an investigation for the <em>Observer</em> has revealed.</p> <p>A pricing quirk means that many off-peak travellers could get a better deal by asking for a return ticket that begins at their final destination,&#xa0;even if they only want to travel one way.</p> <p>The anomaly can be taken advantage of by people wanting to make one-way journeys from London on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays, when train operators offer Super Off-Peak tickets. Some operators also offer these tickets on weekdays, but then they can only be used outside busy morning and evening periods.</p> <p>The tickets were designed to attract day-trippers into the capital at quieter times, but a loophole in the system means anyone can buy them then use the return portion to get a cheaper one-way trip from London.</p> <p>Someone taking today's 15.03 from London King's Cross to Cambridge might expect the cheapest single ticket (walk-up price \u00a321.20) to offer the best value. But if they asked for a return from Cambridge to King's Cross, they would be offered a Super Off-Peak fare of \u00a316, saving \u00a35.20.</p> <p>These fares are also available online, through thetrainline.com, which allows passengers to collect tickets from a station of their choice two hours after booking.</p> <p>The passenger could travel on the same train using only the return portion of the ticket. The National Rail Conditions of Carriage, which dictate how tickets may be used, state that after using the return part of a ticket, passengers \"may not use the outward part\". But return part of a ticket can be used on its own.</p> <p>Other passengers on the same First Capital Connect service, to destinations including Stevenage, Hitchin and Hatfield, would save between \u00a31 and \u00a32.70 each when buying tickets this way. But check before buying \u2013 on other First Capital Connect routes, it can be cheaper to stick with a single ticket.</p> <p>A First Capital Connect spokesman said: \"We are not raising the price of our singles, rather we are discounting the cost of our returns into London on certain journeys to encourage more people to use the railway when it is less busy. Most people buy return fares rather than singles, so this benefits the majority.\"</p> <p>Passengers taking many of today's South West Trains services from London Waterloo to Southampton, Bournemouth and Portsmouth could also save up to \u00a31.70 using the same method . However, other passengers, including those heading to Weymouth, Guildford and Staines, would still find it cheaper to buy a single ticket.</p> <p>On Southern's service from London Victoria to Worthing at 15.32 today, the cheapest off-peak single costs \u00a325.50. But when buying a Super Off-Peak return that terminates in Worthing, the total cost drops to \u00a316.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies said the government is encouraging train operators to boost the overall number of rail passengers. One approach is to offer lower fares at quieter times.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'm flattered,\" he laughs. The flattery comes from an unexpected source: the Tories and their plans, extensively pre-briefed to the media, to make a personal target of the Labour leader by trying to define him as weak, weird, callow and much too red to be a suitable occupant of No 10.</p> <p>\"A sure sign I'm succeeding,\" he laughs again. \"When you announce your strategy in advance that you are going to go for somebody because you're really relishing it, it's a sure sign that actually the opposite is true.\" For him, it just goes to confirm that the government is both \"failing\" and \"flailing\".</p> <p>Ed Miliband returns to Manchester, the venue of his narrow victory in the leadership contest two years ago, in a more solid position than many critics or friends then expected. His party looks more united than the fractious coalition and the lack of overt sniping from within about his leadership is the envy of both David Cameron and Nick Clegg.</p> <p>The Labour leader says he is \"pretty satisfied\", while acknowledging \"we've got a lot more progress to make\". Some of that work has to be on himself. Labour's continuing lead in the opinion polls means that people will start to appraise him as a potential prime minister. Many are as yet unconvinced that he possesses some of the key qualities of leadership, as our poll underlines. That makes his conference speech an important opportunity to showcase his character and his beliefs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396904947\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/29/1348944122899/Observer-poll-party-leade-001.jpg\" alt=\"Observer poll: party leaders crop 2\" width=\"220\" height=\"436\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Observer poll: party leaders crop 2, Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I want the speech this year to be about me: who I am, why I am in politics. Secondly, how are we going, in concrete terms, to tackle the economic challenges the country faces? People need to know that. And, thirdly, what kind of Britain does Ed Miliband as prime minister want to create?\"</p> <p>He plans to explain why he chose a political career rather than follow his father's footsteps into academia. \"If you see an injustice, you don't just shrug your shoulders, you don't just write an academic book, you do something about it. That's my upbringing. You might say, well, my Dad was an academic, but he was not someone who had contempt for people who went into practical politics.</p> <p>\"I remember having this conversation with my dad \u2013 he died in '94 so it must have been&#xa0;the year before that. I said 'Look, you know I'm drawn to politics. I'm not really drawn to academia.' And he said: 'Well, do it. You've got to follow what you believe.' \"</p> <p>Mind you, Ralph Miliband, a committed Marxist, wrote that the parliamentary road to socialism which has been pursued by both his sons was doomed to failure. Reminded of this, the Labour leader laughs.</p> <p>\"It's funny, actually. I do remember meeting his friends after he died and they said: 'Ralph was such a great man. He'd be so sorry what's happened to you.' A sort of: where did it all go wrong? Where did you go off the rails? Sort of the equivalent of taking drugs.\"</p> <p>Miliband's enthusiasm for the importance of ideas in politics is refreshing, but it comes with its problems. One is a personal struggle to translate theoretical concepts such as \"predistribution\" into practical policies and language accessible to voters who don't live in academic seminar rooms. Another is that he only has to mention the author of a book he might have read for that person to be described as the Labour leader's latest \"guru\".</p> <p>He grins in recognition of the point. \"Disaster having any gurus, I think.\" It's often not that healthy for the gurus themselves. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/apr/24/blue-labour-maurice-glasman\" title=\"\">Maurice Glasman</a>, whom he made a peer, has gone rather quiet after making disobliging remarks about Miliband's leadership style.</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" he agrees. \"It's a disaster for the gurus. The gurus then sneeze and it's interpreted as a sort of bitter attack on me.\"</p> <p>Glasman did more than sneeze. \"Well, OK, it was a sort of flu.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/30/virtuous-citizen-review-tim-soutphommasane\" title=\"\">The latest alleged guru is Tim Soutphommasane</a>, who is so close to the Labour leader that Miliband cannot remember his name. \"There's now this new Australian bloke who's my guru.\"</p> <p>Have they actually met? \"I met him for 15 minutes or half an hour.\"</p> <p>This year's speech will build on the theme of \"responsible capitalism\" that he made the centrepiece of his address last year. That got a rough reception from many quarters, which was made worse when he and members of the shadow cabinet floundered explaining exactly how a Labour government would distinguish between \"the predators and the producers\". But after another year of financial scandals, even some of the critics now accept that he is on to something potentially powerful, allowing him to say \"I was on the right lines\".</p> <p>\"We live and learn,\" he says of the confusion that followed last year's speech. \"But there's two more deeper things I'd say. One, ideas matter in politics. Ideas matter a lot more than people realise. When Cameron comes along and says 'hug a husky, hug a hoodie' and now he wants to lock up the hoodies and who cares about the huskies, I think it massively undermines not just his authenticity. When events, dear boy, events push you around you've got to have a project which you stick to.</p> <p>\"Our political world is quite contemptuous of ideas often, but actually ideas matter a lot more to political success than people realise.</p> <p>\"I've got a very clear direction. That's what's sustained me. You have ups and downs and I suppose the thing I've always known is I've had a very clear sense of how the country needs to change. Responsible capitalism? It's not what they say on the streets, but it's a very clear agenda about how you change our economy so it works for all working people and not just a few people at the top.\"</p> <p>It may be clear to him, but he now seems to have a better appreciation that it is also imperative to express it coherently and attractively to those people on the street. He takes the point that no one is going to march to the chant: \"What do we want? Responsible capitalism and predistribution! When do we want it? Now!\"</p> <p>Agreed, he says. \"It's got to translate into real things\", which is a cue for a major announcement in respect of the banks. He creates some context by relating an anecdote about Alan Henderson, a businessman in Putney, south-west London, whom he met in July. Henderson had run a successful sign-making firm for four decades.</p> <p>\"He had been with the same bank for 40 years. Four years ago, he took out a loan, but he also took out what's called a dual interest rate swap. After a long discussion with him, I couldn't understand what it really was or how it worked, but suffice to say he lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. His family has been going through a nightmare. He's had to make 10 people redundant. What does that say to you? You've got to change the culture so that high-street banks aren't the arm of a casino operation.\"</p> <p>The Miliband solution is full implementation of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019\" title=\"\">recommendations made by the Vickers commission</a>, not the \"watered down\" and delayed version of the reforms proposed by the coalition.</p> <p>He gives an ultimatum to the banks. \"I'm saying very, very clearly \u2013 there's two things that can happen. The banks can change direction and say we're going to implement the spirit and principle of Vickers to the full, which means the hard ringfence between retail and investment banking. Either they do that or I'm giving a very, very clear message which is that the next Labour government will just by law break up retail investment banks. You'd do what they call Glass Steagall.\"</p> <p>That is the former American law that imposed a rigid division between retail and investment banking so that the speculative excesses of the latter could not endanger the former. \"It is a drastic step doing Glass Steagall. I want to get the culture change whatever way I can get it. If it can be done in another way, I'll do it.\" But if the banks don't heed his ultimatum, it will be one of the very first acts of a Labour government.</p> <p>This initiative will be attacked by critics on at least two grounds. One: it will put fragile financial institutions in jeopardy by cramping their profits. Two: it will provoke banks to abandon Britain and move their operations abroad, taking jobs and tax revenues with them. \"On the first, the best way of guaranteeing safety is by having a proper culture change,\" he responds. \"On the second, we can't give in to those arguments any more. For too long governments have succumbed to those kind of arguments and we haven't done the right thing for the country.\"</p> <p>How is this meaningful to the voter in the street? \"For the ordinary person\" it would mean a lot more confidence that high-street banks were \"going to sell you simple, comprehensible products [and] the focus of the bank was serving you not on how they're doing playing the international money markets.\"</p> <p>It is interesting that he, not the shadow chancellor, is launching this initiative. The state of his relationship with Ed Balls is a persistent source of speculation. Is it true that he once rebuked the other man for using his BlackBerry at a shadow cabinet meeting?</p> <p>\"Absolutely 100% untrue,\" insists Miliband. \"I remember at my first shadow cabinet meeting as leader \u2013 I will let you into the magic \u2013 I said 'Let's try and be sparing in the use of BlackBerrys. Absolutely was not directed at Ed Balls. It's total, total rubbish.\"</p> <p>Even if that particular story is untrue, there are well-sourced accounts that their relationship can be difficult.</p> <p>\"Look, we go back 20 years.\" That could be a lot of the problem. \"We work incredibly closely together and we have an incredibly good relationship.\" Balls wasn't his first choice as shadow chancellor (his pick was former home secretary Alan Johnson). So will Balls definitely be chancellor if there is a Labour government? \"I think I'll make my cabinet when it comes to ... I think measuring the curtains is not my style.\"</p> <p>So Balls is not guaranteed to be chancellor? \"Oh come off it. No.\" Why not? \"You start with one member of the cabinet and then you move on to all of them. Look. Ed and I work incredibly closely together and we're a team and we're going to be a team going into the election.\"</p> <p>A complaint sometimes heard about Balls is that he smothers initiatives by other members of the shadow cabinet. \"It's always the case, if you're the shadow chancellor, that you've got be watchful about tax and spending, and making sure that people don't make commitments. I don't remember Gordon [Brown] being very popular before the 1997 election with colleagues. No shadow chancellor is popular with colleagues because you've got to be tough.\"</p> <p>Because of his reputation and pugilistic build, voters probably don't have much trouble imagining Balls being tough. For Miliband, not being capable of taking tough decisions is one of the serious weaknesses in his personal image identified by our poll.</p> <p>\"The way I think about it is that people form a view about your character and who you are over time. You know, no one wants to repeat Clegg mania, do they? Clegg mania which then became Clegg phobia.\"</p> <p>When voters look at him, does he think they see a future prime minister? \"Well, that's for them to decide.\"</p> <p>They may decide \u2013 as they did last time \u2013 that they are not entirely convinced by any of the candidates for prime minister and produce a hung parliament. He has said before that he could never work with Clegg in a coalition. Is that still the case?</p> <p>\"I'm not interested really in that sort of poker game, but, you know, the position hasn't changed. The card I'm playing for is a majority.\"</p>",

  "<p>Householders concerned about record high energy bills over the winter are being urged to switch suppliers now as two of the cheapest deals have just been pulled from the market and the remaining best buys may soon follow suit.</p> <p>Two weeks before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/22/sse-announces-energy-price-rise\" title=\"\">millions of householders are hit by a 9% rise from energy giant SSE</a>, Sainsburys has pulled its market-leading variable rate energy tariff and Scottish Power has stopped offering the cheapest fixed rate deal without exit penalties. Variable rate tariffs let energy companies put prices up or down whenever they like; fixed tariffs set the price for a fixed period, usually a year.</p> <p>The best deals now come from one company, First Utility. Its online variable rate tariff, iSave v12, will cost a typical household \u00a31,054 a year. This compares with, for instance, \u00a31,274 a year someone who stays on SSE's standard tariffs and pays by direct debit will be on in a fortnight if they do not switch provider. First Utility's cheapest fixed rate tariff, iSave Fixed v4, which sets prices until March 2014, costs \u00a31,087.</p> <p>\"Consumers wishing to take advantage of First Utility's offer should switch now,\" said Mark Todd, director of price comparison service Energyhelpline.com. \"It's not clear how long this offer will be around and market predictions show price increases are likely to be imposed by the UK's leading energy suppliers.\"</p> <p>However, signing up to First Utility does not come without catches. The supplier is charging a \u00a330 per fuel exit penalty for people who sign up to its fixed price tariff then want to leave before March 2014.</p> <p>Perhaps of more concern, it does not rank highly when it comes to customer satisfaction.

  "<p>Away from the numbers, away from the domination of digits and dollar signs, away from the cold, hard diktat that compels sportsmen to make career decisions based on immediate financial gain \u2013 endlessly consulting their magic eightball agents, away from the disingenuous and the downright deceitful manoeuvring that precedes new contracts everywhere, sometimes a decision is based on more than lucre. Thus, although \"money\" is the word publicly connecting McLaren to Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton's move between them, it seems only fair to also acknowledge that in this case there may have been an all too human rationale in the driving seat as well.</p> <p>In Formula One, numbers are all. They are both the goal (to finish first) and central to the means by which it is achieved (the quest to go faster), as well as the grease that keeps the whole infernal difference engine furiously spinning (those dollars, those digits, again). In the paddock they are held in a fetishistic reverence that eightball-wielding agents would admire and they are the mechanics with which the personal in the sport is so often subsumed.</p> <p>But it is there nonetheless. Last year, when Hamilton took pole in Korea, it was the first time Red Bull had been knocked off the top spot. Yet he was outwardly unmoved and appeared indifferent at best. After a hard race, driving brilliantly to hold off a charging Mark Webber to take second place, he seemed even grimmer.</p> <p>\"I've had the worst year, if you expect me to be all happy-doolally after a race like that you're not going to hear it,\" he responded to inquires as to why he was not taking more pleasure in a fine drive.</p> <p>A difficult year it had been, the championship was gone and his team-mate, Jenson Button, was beating him on points, but his reaction still appeared out of character. Soon afterwards his split with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger was revealed and it all seemed to make sense.</p> <p>He was going through a difficult period in public, a man of 26 dealing with emotions that most people endure repeatedly in private, while much younger and with the freedom to really let go, bury themselves, perhaps, in a bottle of cider and a Joy Division album, to emerge all the better, several weeks later.</p> <p>Hamilton, in contrast, grew up in a much more controlled environment. He had an extraordinarily advantageous start to his career that could not have been better in terms of becoming a successful driver but as everyone in the more chaotic, ordinary world knows, there comes a point when it is just time to strike out on your own.</p> <p>McLaren signed him to their young driver programme when he was 13 and he has been part of the team ever since, taking an F1 seat in 2007. In motor racing terms they are his family, with all that the concept entails. They have nurtured and protected him, revelled in his successes and comforted his failures but also had demands on and control of, much of his behaviour and his time.</p> <p>Proving to oneself that you are in control of your destiny is so very much a given rite of passage that it is almost unnoticeable. Hamilton has had to do it in public and in the form of finally making the break with the team that has been his life.</p> <p>John Watson, who drove for McLaren between 1979 and 1983, believes that this need to develop and assert himself away from the team was a central tenet of his decision. \"It's like a kid growing up and leaving home, getting away from the parental control,\" he says. \"When you become a McLaren driver everything about you becomes, in effect, the property of the team. McLaren are a great team to drive for but they've got limitations and I think Lewis felt those limitations were intruding into the time that he wanted to develop, from a non-motor racing perspective.</p> <p>\"Because he came in so young he doesn't know anything differently. Jenson is a more rounded personality and character by virtue of life experiences. Lewis's life experiences are very much contained within the strictures of McLaren.\"</p> <p>Money would have been a factor but Watson believes that far more important is what the Mercedes team principal, Ross Brawn, has told Hamilton to expect from their new car \u2013 certainly the manufacturer will expect to be strong in 2014 when the new engine rules are introduced. But these are the intangibles debated over the previous weeks of will-he won't-he debate. What seems more concrete is that Hamilton wanted to grow and develop and to do so he simply had to move on.</p> <p>\"Principally, I think the kid just wants to be his own person. Whatever he perceives as a burden, he's shed that now,\" is Watson's verdict on the first step of what he sees as a longer journey. \"I would love to see Ross, Lewis and I go fishing,\" he says. \"Show Lewis that there are other qualities or values in life that are very simple. I'd love to see Lewis&#xa0;with a mayfly trying to catch a trout. He's won grands prix, he won a world championship but he'd find it a lot more difficult to catch a trout. It's all about life balance.\"</p> <p>Whether the move delivers for Hamilton, the driver, is yet to be seen but he seems to have made it as much for Hamilton, the person, a man who is looking at the numbers and trying to make them balance.</p>",
  "<p>By the third weekend of the rugby season London Welsh were already deep into sport's euphemisms. Their summer had been \"a challenge\". That meant they hadn't had time to recruit any players. Heavy defeat by Leicester in the opening game was \"a reality check\". And an even more comprehensive battering by Harlequins in the second round was \"a bad day at the office\". Candour might have revealed: \"We're totally out of our depth and, with seven and a half months to go, this is already a nightmare. Much, much worse is to&#xa0;come.\"</p> <p>Not only were they struggling to cope with the cruel demands of the Premiership, it seemed they were doing it in front of practically nobody. When Exiles have to go into exile to play \u2013 when, that is, dear old Old Deer Park becomes the Kassam Stadium in Oxford \u2013 the faithful may be forgiven for losing the will to follow. A crowd of 6,850 attended the Leicester game, satisfactory by the standards of the distant Welsh motherland but abject when set against what other London clubs can pull in.</p> <p>And at least half those supporters had to be Leicester's travelling hardcore, because for the second home game, the Kassam attendance was more than halved, down to 3,150, a figure even the Welsh regions would deem a bit paltry. Had this been another off day at work \u2013 and what else could be expected against Exeter, hardly known for their mercy? \u2013 the crowd for Sunday's game, round three in this season of torture, would be measured in tens, not thousands. Euphemistically, that would have been a \"small but enthusiastic group of friends and family\".</p> <p>But there will be a lot more than that for Sunday's game against Gloucester in Oxford because London Welsh only went and beat Exeter. And barely had the dropped jaws up and down the Premiership been surgically raised than the Welsh went and did it again \u2013 and on the road this time \u2013 beating Sale up in Salford.</p> <p>Now this takes a little bit of explaining. And who better to do it than the assistant coach of London Welsh, Kingsley Jones, who is combining being the national coach of Russia \u2013 he was their assistant at the World Cup last year \u2013 with working alongside Lyn Jones, head coach of the Exiles? Incidentally, both Joneses played at No7 for Wales and they form one of the more \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 eccentric partnerships in the game.</p> <p>Kingsley's dad, Phil Kingsley Jones, used to manage Jonah Lomu and work the clubs as a stand-up, and Kingsley Jr has inherited the comedic gene and can, when he's in performing mode, insert more jokes into a sentence than Bob Monkhouse. He is of Valleys stock and used to play for Ebbw Vale and Pontypridd, before crossing into England with Worcester and Gloucester.</p> <p>The Valleys background means most of his jokes are about disease and death, and dictates that he learnt to play, as they say at Eugene Cross Park, in an uncompromising style. He coached alongside Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 at Kingsholm and followed him to Sale, taking over there when the Frenchman was appointed coach of his country.</p> <p>Lyn comes from further to the west and played for Neath and Llanelli, before going on to coach the Ospreys. He then went off to coach at a school in Abu Dhabi before being appointed by London Welsh. He is more a visual gagster. You could, for example, meet him in the street and strike up a perfectly sane conversation before he'd, I don't know, take off his clothes, scale an office block and start cleaning the windows on the 18th floor.</p> <p>Anyway, the Joneses are now at London Welsh, with Lyn in overall charge, and of attack in particular, while Kingsley concentrates on the set-pieces. \"Those first two games were all about the players standing in the changing rooms, shaking hands with each other and introducing themselves,\" said the assistant. \"They didn't know a thing about each other. Leicester and Harlequins were like pre-season games, not the real thing. Except they were, of course, and it hurt \u2026 but it just showed how far from ready we were after the summer we had.</p> <p>\"Then we beat Exeter and you could feel the confidence levels rise. There's a massive appetite here and a massive potential for improvement. If you asked me if anything had changed rapidly I'd say the scrummaging, with the two French boys that have come in. Arthur Joly and Franck Montanella. I've already had Philippe on the phone saying he's heard great things about them, and it's true. I'd also say that the captain, Jonathan Mills, has been an example to all. He's got real grunt to him, a real worker in the back or second row.</p> <p>\"Can we beat Gloucester today? The team think they can. Sale and then Gloucester \u2013 for me, that would be the double over my two clubs in England. We know everyone's taken notice of us \u2026 nobody can relax now. No team can experiment, safe in the knowledge that London Welsh are going down. None of that caper.\"</p> <p>The good thing about Kingsley is that he only needs one question. He ended: \"Got to go, I'm playing golf. Trying to putt as I speak \u2026 \" And the thing about his London Welsh is that, far from wondering what one victory might feel like, they're now looking for a third good day in the office.</p> <h2><strong>Barry and the All Blacks baulk at bulk alone</strong></h2> <p>The other day, I was wandering out of the Docks Office in Barry, as you do, when I bumped into Matthew Silva. He was nearly the Gavin Henson of his day (and I would like to point out that I have managed to file an entire piece on London Welsh above without mention of the Lost One) without ever quite managing to make it to the very top. But he was talented and a free spirit.</p> <p>He now works as a Welsh Rugby Union development officer in the Vale of Glamorgan. I grumbled a bit about the obsession across the sport with pumping iron and putting muscle bulk on teenagers, but instead of staying on-message with a reminder that strength and size are prerequisites in the modern professional game, Matthew<strong> </strong>started waxing lyrical about what they're up to in his patch. The obligation on 16 year olds was not to kick the ball, but to stretch their lungs and minds and to run with joy and the ball. Weights are an essential part of the rugby training regime, but bulk is a protective layer, not a weapon. On occasions every player will have to take heavy contact, but elasticity is more important than muscularity.</p> <p>New Zealand know this, and a few people in Barry know it too.</p>",

No cameras were allowed in, while pens were confiscated from the eight journalists admitted in case they concealed recording devices. Once inside they were handed new pens.</p> <p>A defence request to admit evidence from a separate inquiry into the scandal by a team of cardinals, which was commissioned by the pope, was turned down.</p> <p>The court's three judges are set to call a series of witnesses, including Monsignor Georg G\u00e4nswein, the pope's personal secretary, who maintains a low profile but is thought to wield great influence at the Vatican. Cristina Cernetti, one of the lay nuns who cook and clean for Pope Benedict, was also called.</p> <p>The court opted to try separately Claudio Sciarpelletti, a Vatican IT technician accused of handling sensitive documents on Gabriele's behalf and called William Kloter, the vice-commander of the Vatican's Swiss guard as a witness in his trial. Sciarpelletti declined to appear in court on Saturday because he was too \"agitated\", his lawyer said.</p> <p>Dressed in a grey suit and tie, Gabriele looked on impassively as his lawyer, Cristiana Arru, argued that parts of his interrogation should be excluded from the trial since no lawyer had been present and requested that the gold nugget be fingerprinted, a request that was turned down.</p> <p>Gabriele, who faces a four-year sentence for aggravated theft, has been depicted by experts as a paranoid individual who craves the attention of others and is vulnerable to manipulation \u2013 a judgment that could make a papal pardon more palatable.</p> <p>After beginning to leak documents, Gabriele told investigators: \"I reached the point of no return and could not control myself any more.\"</p> <p>The pope has said Gabriele's arrest \"brought sadness in my heart\".</p> <p>But investigators have made it clear that they are still searching for other Vatican staff they suspect leaked embarrassing documents to the Italian press.</p> <p>The trial resumes on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>The middle-aged man sitting on a railway station bench protects a younger man by wrapping his arms around him as he shouts desperately at the helmeted, baton-wielding police officers running up and down the platforms at Madrid's Atocha station.</p> <p>\"Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you!\" he bellows repeatedly in a video that shows how police charged into the station during violent demonstrations that shook Madrid last week.</p> <p>On the other side of the ticket barrier a younger man is whacked with truncheons by two policemen. \"I don't know whether he is a passenger or a protester,\" one of them admits. A third man who was waiting for a train is bundled down the platform by police officers as he asks: \"And what have I done?\" A youth points to blood running down his face. \"What the hell is this?\" he asks.</p> <p>On Friday, police told a judge they had needed to chase a group of violent protesters across the railway tracks and had later arrested some in a nearby bar. They, too, had suffered injuries. \"People who had been hurling stones at police tried to hide in the station, passing themselves off as normal passengers,\" a spokesman said. \"We had to go in.\"</p> <p>As Spaniards respond with dismay to the violence shown by demonstrators, who launched attacks on police, and the response of some riot police, during scuffles in the area around Madrid's parliament building last week, the long-running drama of the country's deflating economy has lurched into a newly confrontational stage, amid fears that there will be more violence to come.</p> <p>While police and the conservative government of prime minister Mariano Rajoy were accused of authoritarian behaviour, radical protesters from both the far left and the far right were putting a hard, street-fighting edge on to the once peaceful protests of the civilised but ineffectual <em>indignados</em>.</p> <p>Cristina Cifuentes, the government delegate in Madrid, had warned before the protests that they were being infiltrated by violent members of Spain's far right and were attracting the country's most radical leftwingers. But protesters later pointed to a group of undercover policemen who, they claimed, had been at the front of the protest waving red flags and encouraging others to violence.</p> <p>Other police certainly thought their undercover colleagues were troublemakers, and there is also film of one of them being dragged out of the crowd to be arrested and shouting: \"I am a colleague! I am a colleague!\"</p> <p>On Saturday, a 72-year-old man was among some 30 demonstrators who had been accused of attacking police and given bail. \"But I was sitting down when they arrested me,\" he said.</p> <p>The radicalisation came amid worries that the ratings agency Moodys would downgrade Spain's creditworthiness, reigniting the pressure on its debt and sending the interest rates that it must pay spiralling up again.</p> <p>Ministers have said that \u20ac10bn (\u00a38bn) of cuts and tax increases must come in next year's budget just to cover a leap in interest payments. On Friday night, they said a coming round of bank bailouts, paid for by the eurozone rescue fund, would send the country's debts soaring by some \u20ac50bn. Spending is to be cut by 7% next year, bringing another wave of cuts in health, education and other welfare services. Yesterday, Spain's civil servants heard that, for the third year running, their wages were being frozen.</p> <p>A period of calm in Europe's more troubled economies created by the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, when he announced plans to buy the debt of countries who asked for bailouts in the future, also seemed to have come to an end. And with the threat of Catalan separatism adding to worries about Rajoy's ability to control events in Spain, many now expect him to ask for a full bailout for the country \u2013 placing it in the hands of those who have forced Greece, Portugal and Ireland into round after round of spending cuts.</p> <p>Budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro presented an austerity budget to parliament on Saturday, with analysts widely seeing it as an attempt to pre-empt the conditions that Spain would have had imposed on it anyway for the bailout. \"Reducing our budget deficit is essential,\" he said.</p> <p>With unemployment at 25%, however, and the economy already set to shrink for the next two years, Spaniards see no end to the tunnel of misery.</p>",
  "<p>In some ways, it is just like old times. Huge crowds mob the presidential candidate as he swings through dusty villages and towns promising a new Venezuela. They surround his bus, chanting his name, and when he emerges they scream and surge forward, desperate to embrace him. Many clutch notes \u2013 handwritten pleas for a job, a house, an operation \u2013 and if they manage to slip them into his hands or pockets they near explode with joy. \"He knows things can't go on like this. He knows we're ready for a change,\" Josmir Meza, 25, a student, shouted over cheers.</p> <p>The trouble for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> is that he is no longer that candidate. In 1998, he was an insurgent outsider, a young, athletic campaigner who promised to overthrow the established order and \"refound\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\" title=\"\">Venezuela</a>. He was unstoppable and roared to victory.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, however, as he seeks a third term in next Sunday's election, it his youthful challenger, <a href=\"http://www.newint.org/blog/2012/09/25/venezuela-elections-capriles-chavez/\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, 40, who electrifies the crowds.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, 58, in contrast, is an ailing, elusive figure who now represents the establishment. He wishes not to storm the presidential palace, Miraflores, a pink, neocolonial spread in downtown Caracas, but to keep it. Having dominated Venezuela like a colossus, leading his socialist revolution to consecutive electoral landslides, he is facing the electoral fight of his life.</p> <p>With both sides depicting the vote as an existential test to vanquish or save the unique political and economic experiment known as chavismo, the stakes could scarcely be higher. If Ch\u00e1vez loses, his movement will almost certainly fracture, dismaying foreign supporters who hailed the \"<a href=\"http://worldnews.about.com/od/venezuela/f/bolivarianrevolution.htm\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a>\" as a leftwing showcase. If he wins, critics at home and abroad will warn of a slide into autocracy and dysfunction.</p> <p>Either way, it will be another chapter in the great drama that is the life of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. How a boy from a humble family in Sabaneta, a speck of a town on the vast grasslands known as <em>los llanos</em> rose to become not just president but a global figure simultaneously adored and reviled is a remarkable tale.</p> <p>Like the fireside legends of horsemen, demons and rebels that so enchanted the young Hugo \u2013 he memorised the poems, stories and songs \u2013 his rise is the stuff of myth. He was the second son of schoolteacher parents; if a girl, they planned to call him Eva (Venezuela's version of Eve), complementing the firstborn who was called Adan (Adam), but instead named him after his father. As more children arrived (six, all boys), the two eldest were sent to live with their grandmother, Rosa, a kind, industrious woman who doted on the boys.</p> <p>Hugo was by all accounts a happy, chatty boy who when not at school played baseball with a homemade bat and ball, painted, read books and supplemented household income selling his grandmother's \"spiders\", sugar-coated papaya strips. \"I would go round shouting, 'Hot spiders, tasty spiders for pretty girls!'\" he recalled recently. As a skinny teenager with big feet he was nicknamed Goofy.</p> <p>By the 1960s, Venezuela, once a sleepy corner of South America ruled by dictators, was a fledgling democracy with growing oil revenues and hunger for modernity. A new elite and middle class grew amid the skyscrapers but most rural migrants ended up in hillside shacks around cities.</p> <p>Hugo, a talented baseball player, dreamed not of politics but pitching for the major leagues. He became a military cadet hoping to vault from the academy to baseball clubs in Caracas. Instead, he fell in love with soldiering. \"A uniform, a gun, an area, close-order formation, marches, morning runs, studies in military science \u2013 I was like a fish in water,\" he recalled later.</p> <p>As Ch\u00e1vez moved up the ranks, he studied the writings of <a href=\"http://www.embavenez-us.org/kids.venezuela/simon.bolivar.htm\" title=\"\">Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar</a>, the 19th-century liberator who ousted the Spanish, as well as philosophers such as Nietzsche and Plekhanov. He also noted extreme poverty and inequality amid the oil boom. Inspired by revolutionary military leaders in Panama and Peru, and leftwing Venezuelan intellectuals, an idea began to form: revolt.</p> <p>Over a decade, he gathered fellow officers into a conspiracy to replace what they saw as a venal, sham democracy with a progressive, real democracy. The February 1992 coup was a military fiasco, letting the unpopular government survive, but Ch\u00e1vez turned his televised surrender address into a political triumph. Eloquent and dashing in his red beret, he introduced himself to a startled nation \u2013 \"listen to comandante Ch\u00e1vez\" \u2013 and said his objectives had not been met \"por ahora\", for now. He deserved 30 years in jail, went the joke: one for the coup, 29 for failing.</p> <p>Pardoned and released after two years, he was adopted as a figurehead by a coalition of grassroots movements and leftwing parties and stormed to victory in the 1998 election, cheered not only by the poor but a middle class fed up with ossified political parties. With a barrel of oil just $8, the petro-state was near broke.</p> <p>Few outside Venezuela, until then best known for beauty queens and oil, knew what to make of this mercurial arrival who praised Fidel Castro but said he was neither left nor right but seeker of a Blairesqe \"third way\". Within a few short years, Ch\u00e1vez became one of the world's most recognisable and polarising figures.</p> <p>Vehement rhetoric \u2013 he railed against the wealthy as \"squealing pigs\" and \"vampires\" who looted oil wealth \u2013 endeared him to the poor and alienated the middle class and traditional elites. They called him a monkey and worse. In April 2002, the elites briefly ousted him in a Bush administration-backed coup, tried again with an oil strike, then a recall referendum. Ch\u00e1vez survived and grew more radical, declaring himself a socialist and nationalising swaths of the economy. Soaring oil prices gushed billions into the treasury, which he used to fund Cuban-run health clinics and other social programmes, easing poverty. He created a state media empire that promoted a personality cult and tightened executive control over the armed forces, the judiciary and the legislature.</p> <p>He called George Bush a \"donkey\", \"Mr Danger\", \"an asshole\" and, during a memorable UN speech, \"the devil\". Supporters such as Ken Livingstone, Sean Penn, Danny Glover and Noam Chomsky paid homage in visits to Caracas. After winning a second term in 2006, Ch\u00e1vez won a referendum abolishing term limits and talked of ruling until 2021, then 2030. That looks fanciful now. Ahead in some polls, he trails in others.</p> <p>He remains revered in the barrios. \"He is a gift, he means everything to us,\" said Aleira Quintero, 55, a red T-shirted canvasser in Petare. But even supporters are fed up with horrific crime rates, inflation, shortages and crumbling infrastructure. Bridges collapse, refineries blow up, blackouts shroud cities.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez has proved a shrewd political strategist and inspired communicator but disastrous manager, warping the economy with contradictory controls, creating and dissolving ministries by caprice, launching and abandoning initiatives, neglecting investment and maintenance. Despite record oil revenues, Venezuela is borrowing billions to try to plug the holes.</p> <p>Charisma, giveaways and institutional control, not least the ability to monopolise the airwaves, could yet clinch re-election but Chavez faces two formidable obstacles.</p> <p>Drained and bloated by cancer treatment, he sometimes has trouble walking. Instead of the barnstorming of old, his public appearances are few and often melancholic. \"If it were up to me, you know I'd get down off this stage and I'd go walking, as in times past,\" he told a rally, tears in his eyes. Some supporters fear the cancer is terminal and that a vote for Ch\u00e1vez is a vote for uncertainty and power-grabs by unloved ministers and courtiers.</p> <p>The other obstacle is Capriles. Unlike previous inept, shrill opposition leaders, the state governor is a disciplined, energetic campaigner. A jogger and basketball player, his nickname is El Flaquito, the skinny one. He has seized the initiative by crisscrossing the country, visiting 274 towns, and casting himself as a centrist who will keep Ch\u00e1vez's social programmes while offering competent administration. To woo \"soft chavistas\" he does not call Ch\u00e1vez a dictator or even Ch\u00e1vez. Conscious of the name's power, Capriles calls him \"the candidate of the (ruling party) PSUV\".</p> <p>Whether the president wins or not \u2013 and given his electoral track record you would be foolish or brave to bet against him \u2013 his fame will live on. In or out of power, there will be no forgetting the name Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.</p>",

According to Pakistani media, Iqbal was gunned down while staying at a relative's home on Rawalpindi's Chakri Road and died on the way to hospital.</p> <p>During his kidnapping last year, Iqbal was blindfolded, chained and starved for almost three weeks before his family paid a ransom for his release.</p> <p>Speaking to the <em>Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus</em>, as news of the murder broke, friend and former councillor Riaz Ahmed said: \"He was a strong, defiant man, and this is an absolute tragedy for his family and everyone.</p> <p>\"He flew out to Rawalpindi at the back end of August and the court case was due to last four weeks.</p> <p>\"But he was badly let down by the authorities, the case was held up, and he had to stay later and delay his return home.\"</p> <p>Ahmed added: \"He was very aware of the potential risk to himself, but he was a very strong-minded man and wanted justice to take place. He was defiant, he knew there would be problems, but he had high principles he couldn't ignore.</p> <p>\"Before he left he told me 'justice has to be done to prevent this happening to anyone else'.\"</p> <p>After being released last year, Iqbal described how he had been snatched while visiting his family in Rawalpindi and kept chained in a shed on a farm for 20 days, surviving on the occasional tea and biscuits his kidnappers provided.</p> <p>Iqbal, who was originally from Kenya but moved to Bradford in 1968, was kidnapped on 4 September last year, two days before he had planned to return home, after giving a female friend of a relative a lift to an area close to Islamabad airport. When they arrived at their destination, Iqbal said he was ambushed by five men and a gun was put to his head. During his ordeal a kidnapper stayed with him at all times. His family, local farmers, were forced to sell some of their livestock to scrape together the ransom money.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of his release, Iqbal had vowed: \"I will never go back. It's too frightening,\" adding: \"I didn't think I would come out alive.\" He told the BBC in an interview last September he believed that as a British citizen he was seen as wealthy and a \"good target\".</p> <p>Confirming his death, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: \"We can confirm the death of a British national in Pakistan. We are providing consular assistance.\"</p>",
  "<p>Warrington Wolves will finally get the chance to compete for the Super League title on Saturday after booking a place in their first ever Grand Final with a stirring win at the home of their local rivals St Helens.</p> <p>The Wolves survived a first-half onslaught and then rallied through second-half tries from former Australia internationals Joel Monaghan and Trent Waterhouse to set up a repeat of the Challenge Cup final against Leeds Rhinos in a match that pits Tony Smith, a former head coach at the Rhinos, against Brian McDermott, the man who served Smith as assistant during his four-year stint at Headingley.</p> <p>Monaghan's score turned the momentum in Warrington's favour, but two tries in four minutes from Waterhouse provided the confirmation that the Wolves can now count themselves among British rugby league's elite.</p> <p>It is 57 years since Warrington were last crowned champions and they will be confident of ending that run when they emerge from the Old Trafford tunnel in next Saturday.</p> <p>\"It's enormous for the club, town and everybody involved,\" Smith said. \"It's nice to be involved at Wembley [at the Challenge Cup final], but to be competing to be top of the pile is big for everyone.</p> <p>\"It takes a lot of people to work in the same direction to get to this match, and when you all pull together you can achieve big things. I just hope you don't have to lose one [Grand Final] to win one. We've finals experience from Wembley and I hope that will steady our nerves.\"</p> <p>Chris Riley claimed his second score soon after Waterhouse's brace to give the Wolves enough breathing space to relax into the final 10 minutes, and even Francis Meli's late try was not enough to set nerves jangling.</p> <p>The St Helens caretaker coaches Mike Rush and Keiron Cunningham must take credit for rescuing a season that included the dismissal of Royce Simmons but they were ultimately well beaten in their quest to grab a seventh successive Grand Final appearance.</p> <p>\"We were pleased at half-time, but we were a little slow in the second half and Warrington were fantastic,\" Rush said. \"Trent Waterhouse was the best I've seen him, and Brett Hodgson, Lee Briers and Richie Myler did what they do best. I'd have taken being 40 minutes away from a Grand Final when we took&#xa0;over.\"</p> <p>Saints held only a 14-12 half time lead, but they should have been further ahead. Three times in the opening exchanges Briers was forced to kick from deep within Warrington territory as the hosts displayed the defensive intensity that has made them such fierce play-off competitors.</p> <p>Saints sniffed blood, and a deft kick from Jonny Lomax cranked up the pressure before Lance Hohaia and Chris Flannery presented Tommy Makinson with the smallest of openings. His acrobatic finish was as eye-catching as it was effective, beating his opposite man, Riley, with a horizontal dive that defied all probability until video replays proved conclusively he had touched down in the corner.</p> <p>St Helens appeared in control, but Jon Wilkin's knock-on soon gifted Warrington their first genuine attack and Hodgson fed Riley for his 100th Warrington touchdown. However, Saints were in no mood to let up, with Mark Flanagan off-loading Jonny Lomax's flat ball to allow Meli to squeeze over.</p> <p>Makinson's missed conversion meant Saints only held a slender two-point advantage, but the winger was on target when Paul Wellens registered the hosts' third score from Wilkin's towering bomb.</p> <p>Warrington needed something \u2013 anything \u2013 and found a way through when Simon Grix crashed over from Briers' pass after Paul Wood and Michael Monaghan had both kept the ball alive in midfield.</p> <p>It was enough to bring the Wolves to life, and their second-half aggression was too much for St Helens. Warrington are now within touching distance of an increasingly rare domestic double. Few will doubt they are capable of making their mark in rugby league's history books.</p>",
  "<p>Wet noses are leaving trails on his fleece, cows snuffling on one sleeve and Stig the border collie on the other. Ankle-deep in mud on his beef cattle farm near Stratford-upon-Avon, Adam Quinney doesn't hunt, fish or shoot and shakes his head at the idea he is fired up with \"bloodlust\". He lost 18 of his 70 cattle a year ago, one of the 24% of farms in the southwest of England to find their herds infected with bovine TB, a disease which not only costs stock but also puts the whole farm into shutdown, escalating costs just as income dives.</p> <p>He has heard all the arguments, read the science, personally debated with rock guitarist Brian May, and accepts many of the points put forward by the badger lobby: \"We shouldn't have got to this point; we should have culled years ago and we wouldn't have TB. We all want the same thing in the end, healthy cattle and healthy badgers. But this polarisation is worrying. A lot of people have no knowledge and no understanding and they're getting fired up.</p> <p>\"We've had the activists talking about coming on with fireworks and dogs, but if they scare the badgers, will they return to their setts or move on? They could be walking through badger latrines carrying the TB themselves. What about bio-security?\"</p> <p>As vice-president of the National Farmers Union, Quinney helped set the boundaries for the Gloucestershire pilot cull area, which was given its licence last Monday. He sees a cull as only part of the solution. The lack of an organised plan to tackle bovine TB is what the majority of farmers are fed up with, he says.</p> <p>\"We need a complete programme, not a pick and mix. Farmers were promised a vaccine. Each year for 20 years we have been told there is a vaccine just a few years away and have been sold a pup. We shouldn't have got to this point. Bovine TB is hardly a new disease.\"</p> <p>Last year he invited volunteers from the Badger Trust on to his land and for four weeks they tried to trap and vaccinate badgers against TB. They managed to vaccinate just one of them. \"I felt desperately sorry for them \u2013 they were out every night,\" Quinney says. \"I can't even estimate the effort and money they put in and was disappointed on their behalf as much as mine.</p> <p>\"Badger numbers are on the rise. They don't have a natural predator: the only one they have is the Ford Mondeo. Hedgehogs on the other hand are disappearing pretty fast from around here and their predator is the badger. Maybe someone should start speaking up for Mrs Tiggywinkle.\"</p> <p>This latest run-in between country folk and town folk, the old stereotypes from the days of mad cow disease and the fox hunt debate, have come back to haunt farmers.</p> <p>On one side is the image of the hard-nosed farmer with his shotgun who stuffs his cows with too many antibiotics; on the other anti-cull supporters are accused of being over-sentimental townies who want their food cheap and animals cuddly. When the shooting finally starts, it is expected to get far worse. Hunt saboteurs and animal rights activists last week held meetings in Bristol and Brighton to start mobilising volunteers prepared to take part in night patrols across 300 sq km (116 sq miles) of Gloucestershire. Armed with vuvuzelas and high-visibility vests, activists are being encouraged to take dogs and to urinate on any bait traps they find to scare the animals away. They are being asked not to set off fireworks.</p> <p>Some anti-cull campaigners have been posting contact details for pro-cull MPs and farmers and, although organisers are appealing for people to remain polite, last week Jan Rowe, a farmer from Cheltenham, said he and his wife, Gill, had been targeted by hate mail. Tripadvisor had to take down dozens of nasty comments posted under Mrs Rowe's B&amp;B listing on the holiday website.</p> <p>Farmer baiting and animal activist mocking is set to become an internet sport.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396906303\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/9/29/1348947992834/Bovine-TB-spreading-002.jpg\" alt=\"Bovine TB spreading\" width=\"460\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bovine TB spreading. Illustration: Defra 2011</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Defra 2011</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jack Reedy of the Badger Trust said: \"It's an ugly spot we're in. Everyone is getting nervous about the debate and coming out on one side or the other. There's pressure on farmers as a body to back this and say vaccination won't help, but there's a lot feeling uncomfortable. We have farmers being intimidated.\"</p> <p>Tony Hunt has been making nocturnal visits to the same family of badgers at a sett near his Gloucestershire home for more than 25 years and, although he is against activism, admits: 'They'd have a job stopping me going up to sit there every night if they were coming for my family sett.</p> <p>\"There's no science to support a cull. It won't work. A lot of farmers I know don't want it. But they can't talk about it out in the open any more for fear they'll be hung, drawn and quartered. I know of at least one who has been threatened.</p> <p>\"After the foot and mouth, when people were replenishing their herds and moving cattle all over the country, no one was testing them for TB first. In the 1970s an opportunity to develop a vaccine was lost. The government has let it slip. They don't even know how many badgers there are. They don't know how many of them have TB.\"</p> <p>EU laws currently prevent cattle from being vaccinated against the disease because the effect of current inoculations can make it difficult to detect if the disease is present. That ban discourages any pharmaceutical company from getting involved in the research.</p> <p>Scientist Lord Krebs, a government adviser who led an eight-year study into the spread of bovine TB, has also branded the two government-led culls as \"crazy\".</p> <p>The debate has been further polarised by the RSPCA, which has come out against the cull and ignited further controversy as chief executive Gavin Grant called for \"badger-friendly\" labels on milk and yoghurt so shoppers can boycott farms involved in culls.</p> <p>\"This campaign is gathering incredible momentum,\" he said. \"The speed of this growth shows the scale of public interest. The government must listen to what the public are saying and give this matter parliamentary time. It needs to look at this science and reverse this short-sighted decision immediately to one of vaccination. Let's cure, not kill.\"</p> <p>An e-petition set up by former Queen guitarist Brian May moved over the 136,000 signatories mark yesterday, something which supporters hope will win badgers a debate in the Commons over their fate. So far, out of 10 petitions which have passed the 100,000 signature threshold, eight have won a parliament debate.</p> <p>Adam Quinney still faces the TB test at his farm with his heart in his mouth. The cull is expected to reduce the prevalence of bovine TB in cattle by 16%. \"That's a start,\" he says. \"If you were offered a pay rise of 16% you'd be pleased, wouldn't you? It's better than nothing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The United States are firmly on course to dish out some severe sporting retribution. Europe's recent success has irked those on the other side of the Atlantic to an extent perfectly demonstrated in all but the very early stages of Friday's first session.</p> <p>By the time Saturday's morning foursomes had reached their conclusion, the Europeans were facing a genuine challenge to halt a home procession. The United States, playing in Chicago, with a useful lead and boisterous levels of support is not a particularly easy animal to contend with.</p> <p>The United States led their visitors by eight points to four by lunchtime, with the home crowd vociferously lapping up the dynamic this Ryder Cup has adopted.</p> <p>Europe require not just a turnaround, but glimpses of magic; something the late Seve Ballesteros \u2013 who provides a constant backdrop to the 39th playing of this competition \u2013 would historically provide. Sunday's singles already have an ominous look about them for supporters of the European cause.</p> <p>If the seeds of Europe's stumbles were sown on Friday morning, when they failed to press home an advantage, the handing of momentum to the United&#xa0;States a day later looked to be even more damaging.</p> <p>There proved merely a glimpse of success for Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, Europe's increasingly under-pressure captain, as Justin Rose and Ian Poulter saw off Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson. Sadly for Olaz\u00e1bal, that one-hole victory only prompted further questioning of why Poulter was omitted from Friday's fourball groupings. Simpson, that said, passed up a decent chance to square the match on the 18th&#xa0;green.</p> <p>\"The match was absolutely key,\" Poulter said. \"Jos\u00e9 put us out first for a reason, to go out and get a point and put it on that board. We got up early, then they came back at us with two quick holes, then we managed to rally really well. It was tough, a bit of a doggy match at times, but that's foursomes. You've just got to get it done.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, there was early European carnage. Lee Westwood and Luke Donald, players ranked within the top four in the world, were demolished 7&amp;6 by Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson. It would already be a surprise if Bradley, a rookie, does not emerge as the player of this event after cantering to three wins in the company of a rejuvenated Mickelson.</p> <p>Nicolas Colsaerts and Sergio Garc\u00eda slipped to defeat by Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson. Colsaerts, who had displayed such wonderful putting touch on day one, suddenly mislaid it.</p> <p>In completing Europe's foursome tale of woe, Jim Furyk partnered Brandt Snedeker to victory over Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell. The Europeans failed to hold even a single-hole's advantage at any stage in either of those matches.</p> <p>McDowell and Westwood unsurprisingly dropped out of the action for the afternoon fourballs, with the Englishman's poor form surely a particularly unwanted issue for Olaz\u00e1bal.</p> <p>It looked like an act of mercy from Davis Love III to omit the outstanding Bradley and Mickelson from the pairings. There was a fourball return for Tiger Woods. \"Historically and mathematically, the guys that have played five matches have not done as well in the singles,\" Mickelson said.</p> <p>\"We want to make sure we are rested and focused on the singles. We have got a lot of guys on this team who are playing some great golf, who need to go out and play as well. We don't want to risk two points [in the singles] for one [in the fourballs].\"</p> <p>The only tinge of annoyance for Love appeared in bizarre circumstances. The United States captain was said to be somewhat unimpressed at the antics of the bookmaker Paddy Power, who utilised smoke from aeroplanes to send out messages 10,000ft above the Medinah course. That sentiment, a reproduction of tweets sent by members of the public to Paddy Power, included digs at Woods and support for Europe's players.</p> <p>More routine work from bookmakers left the United States as short as 1-8 to reclaim the Ryder Cup on Sunday evening. Could complacency, then, provide a danger to the Americans? In 1999, at Brookline, the&#xa0;United States rallied from 8-4 behind to triumph in the Ryder Cup.</p> <p>\"We don't want to think about the outcome,\" Love said. \"There are a lot of points still to play for, there is a long way to go in this tournament. But our guys are enjoying what is happening out there. They are just playing golf and playing great.\"</p> <p>Garc\u00eda and Colsearts had squared their foursomes match at the 11th. Simultaneously, the Northern Irish duo of McIlroy and McDowell had pulled Furyk and Snedeker back to one up. In both cases, though, the American pairs regained a sufficient advantage to claim their points.</p> <p>The story of Garc\u00eda and Colsaerts was the more wounding for Olaz\u00e1bal. Garc\u00eda chipped in from off the 16th green to again move the Europeans to within a hole of their opponents; Colsaerts sent his tee shot from the 17th into water and the match was over.</p> <p>\"It is pretty painful,\" Colsaerts admitted. \"When you are in a game that you have the chance to go all the way to 18 or get something out of it, it's a big difference. It's very, very painful.\"</p> <p>A birdie putt from McIlroy on 16 hauled them back to within a hole of Furyk and Snedeker. The penultimate hole proved significant once again, as McIlroy missed a putt to the left that would have squared the match.</p> <p>An unlikely European recovery on American soil would rank among the most stunning in the Ryder Cup's illustrious history. It would also, without question, be rendered the greatest achievement of Olaz\u00e1bal's decorated professional life.</p> <p>\"We are certainly giving 100% out&#xa0;there,\" insisted Donald. \"We are going to still fight. And it's not over until&#xa0;Sunday.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This weekly blog is for those who have been watching the new series of Doctor Who. Don\u2019t read ahead if you haven\u2019t seen episode five \u2013 The Angels Take Manhattan</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/22/doctor-who-power-of-three\" title=\"\">Dan Martin\u2019s episode four blog</a></p> \n<h2>\u2018This is not any old future Amy, it\u2019s ours. Once we know what\u2019s coming, it\u2019s written in stone \u2026\u2019</h2> \n<p>Those who complain that in Doctor Who love always saves the day, please hang your heads in shame. Love just ruined everything! The Doctor will never see the Ponds again, and neither will we. Amy and Rory\u2019s bond was always going to win through \u2013 it has done for many months \u2013 but it has never been played better than this. From the Doctor\u2019s point of view, however, it tore everything else apart.</p> \n<p>Amy and Rory left the only way they really could. The Weeping Angels felt like they were created for this very scene: Amy and Rory zapped back in time to live out their long, happy lives without the Doctor. Since the Tardis crashlanded into her back garden, Amy\u2019s story had been one about growing up. At the start, she chose a life of adventure with her Raggedy Man over the prospect of normality with Rory. But now, faced with that decision again, there was no contest.</p> \n<p>This was a fitting end to a golden era, and bravo to Steven Moffat for telling such an involving, emotional story with such style. That last scene, as the Doctor darted through the streets of New York \u2013 grabbing at the final page as it flapped in the wind, speeding toward the ending he\u2019d refused to accept was coming! Here ended Doctor Who\u2019s ultimate fairytale in the way it had begun \u2013 in the pages of a storybook.</p> \n<h2>\u2018When one\u2019s in love with an ageless god who doesn\u2019t age, one does one\u2019s best to hide the damage\u2019</h2> \n<p>River returned, free from the shackles of last year\u2019s big mystery and able to wreak havoc as she does best. Yet it\u2019s proper that the story didn\u2019t shy away from the tragedy of her unconventional marriage. And it\u2019s nice to know that she can still return.</p> \n<p>But I\u2019m now rather flummoxed by where we\u2019re supposed to be in River\u2019s timeline. She has long since been pardoned (the man she killed \u201cnever existed\u201d), so we should be further along in her timeline \u2013 probably somewhere between The Time of Angels and Silence in the Library. But in <em>our</em> timeline, this is after the events of Demon\u2019s Run and she is already \u201cmarried\u201d. Should she not be getting younger? Surely, from her perspective, the astronaut shooting hasn\u2019t happened yet? Have we done away with the reverse-timeline thing? Or, as we shall get to \u2013 is there all together more going on here?</p> \n<h2>Fear factor</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s a marvellous play to put the Angels in New York, feeding on time energy off the city that never sleeps. But it also gives a new sphere to their terror; a new time and place. The gangster stylings play nicely against their very gothic horror, and <em>of course</em> the Statue of Liberty is the mightiest Angel of all. Fear that they would become less effective with each appearance seems unfounded \u2013 this was easily this year\u2019s scariest episode.</p> \n<p>As for those cherubs \u2026 There\u2019s nothing worse than an evil baby. Not since the dancing babies of Ally McBeal have I been more freaked out by a child .</p> \n<h2>Mysteries and questions</h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve spent the last month coming up with endless theories about flickering light bulbs and eggs and Christmas. In the end, none of it factored at all \u2013 or not yet, at least. But one theory that is still a goer is the that these adventures have happened in an order that\u2019s different from the one we\u2019re watching them in.</p> \n<p>River\u2019s confused timeline would support that, as would the references to the phone charger in Henry VIII\u2019s en suite. And the Doctor\u2019s tortured manner for much of this year. When he told Amy last week that he\u2019d known for a while they would stop one day (and you <em>could</em> definitely read Amy\u2019s sacrifice as a decision to stop), is that because this adventure happened before a lot of those other episodes? That maybe, sick with grief, the Doctor\u2019s done something reckless with time and gone back to see them? Could it be his fault that new companion Jenna Louise-Coleman appears to be fractured across space and time.</p> \n<p>I may be reading far too much into events, but there\u2019s still one thing I don\u2019t understand. The timelines are so scrambled that the Tardis can never go back to New York, meaning Amy and Rory are trapped. But couldn\u2019t they just travel to Washington or Boston and see him again that way?</p> \n<h2>Time-space debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Some nice New York references scattered throughout here. Voiceover guy Mr Garner tells Mr Grayle that for $25 a day, plus expenses, he\u2019ll believe anything you say. That\u2019s an echo of Winston in Ghostbusters. And Amy\u2019s round glasses are surely a nod to Diane Keaton\u2019s in Annie Hall.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The New York shoot was the final proof that Doctor Who is now officially a Big Deal in America. There were 1,000 onlookers watching in admiration, and mobbing the cast.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Did you recognise <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McShane\" title=\"\">Mike McShane</a> from 1990s late-night improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cMy lipstick was primed and ready, and I was packing cleavage that would fell an ox at 20ft.\u201d Would the Doctor not have known that this was River talking?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Think I could\u2019ve done without Englishman in New York. Bloody Sting.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cYou think you\u2019ll just come back to life?\u201d \u201cWhen don\u2019t I?!\u201d Good to see they\u2019re remembering how many times they\u2019ve killed Rory off.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Hopefully the events of this episode mean Daleks in Manhattan never happened too.</p> \n<h2>Next week!</h2> \n<p>Nothing. Nothing until December. We\u2019ll just have to watch The X Factor live shows. See you all at Christmas!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6d7356c-35df-444b-aa63-782a4127441b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

  "<p>Ed Miliband will make his boldest, most controversial policy commitment since becoming Labour leader on Sunday when he pledges to force the break-up of Britain's biggest banks unless they agree to revolutionise their operations and put ordinary customers first.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/29/ed-miliband-banks-gurus-coalitions\" title=\"\">In an interview with the Observer</a>, the Labour leader says he will confront the City of London with what is seen as the nuclear option for reform if the banks fail to separate their \"casino\" investment operations from services to account-holders, savers and businesses.</p> <p>In terms that will incense the investment banking industry, Miliband says a Labour government, as one of its first acts, would push through a modern-day equivalent of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which split the commercial and investment operations of US banks after the 1929 stock market crash.</p> <p>The move is part of an attempt by Miliband to flesh out his promise to deliver a more \"responsible capitalism\" \u2013 amid signs that the public does not yet believe he is tough enough, nor has a sufficiently clear vision, to be prime minister.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of Labour's annual conference, opening in Manchester on Sunday, Miliband says banks must concentrate on core functions such as lending to small businesses \"rather than playing the international money markets\". Such behaviour puts ordinary customers at risk of having to share the consequences of failed investments.</p> <p>Echoing concerns expressed last month by Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, who believes that reforms proposed last year by Sir John Vickers are being \"watered down\" after lobbying by the banks, Miliband said it was time to stop backsliding and change banking culture for good. The recent Libor scandal involving the fiddling of inter-bank interest rates and the \u00a310bn scandal over mis-selling of payment protection insurance showed the culture was still rotten.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Either they can do it themselves \u2013 which frankly is not what has happened over the past year \u2013 or the next Labour government will, by law, break up retail and investment banks.</p> <p>\"The banks and the government can change direction and say they are going to implement the spirit and principle of Vickers to the full. That means the hard ringfence between retail and investment banking. We need real separation, real culture change. Or we will legislate.\"</p> <p>The coalition government says it will implement the majority of the Vickers report, which will be the subject of legislation due to reach the statute book by 2015. But the changes will not come into effect until 2019. The plans have, however, been watered down, with ministers agreeing that the ringfence will only apply to the UK operations of banks \u2013 even though many in the UK have vast overseas operations.</p> <p>Vickers also wanted the government to insist that banks hold higher grade assets in their reserves to insure against another financial collapse. But the government relented after the industry complained that buying these assets would be expensive and the \u00a31.3bn estimated cost would be passed to customers.</p> <p>Miliband called on Saturday for the \"rebuilding of Britain\" and for 16-year-olds to be given the vote. Speaking to the<em> Observer</em>, he said: \"It is incredibly important to show that we 'get it' on spending. We are very serious about understanding that the next Labour government is going to face difficult economic times.\"</p> <p>But fiscal discipline had to be balanced with an appreciation that borrowing was rising faster because the government had cut too deep and fast. \"If you don't have a growing economy, businesses aren't paying taxes, people are claiming benefits and it is not working. So it is a two-pronged approach.\"</p> <p>Labour is a solid 10 points ahead of the Conservatives, according to the latest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/29/labour-tories-10-points-conference\" title=\"\">Opinium/Observer poll</a>. Labour is on 39% (down 3% on a week ago) and the Tories are on 29% (down 1%).The Liberal Democrats are up 2% on 10%, the same as Ukip.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396905368\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/29/1348943620085/Observer-poll-parties-2-001.jpg\" alt=\"Observer poll: parties 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Source: Opinium/Observer poll</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Miliband's personal ratings, particularly against David Cameron, remain poor, as does the party's reputation for economic competence. Depressingly for Labour, 29% say the coalition government is responsible for the state of the economy, against 46% who blame the last Labour government.</p> <p>Jon Cruddas, who heads Labour's policy review, tells BBC's <em>Sunday Politics London</em> that Labour could retain the coalition's limit on immigration. Asked whether Labour could stick to the 21,700 cap on non-EU immigrants, he said: \"We're looking at it, obviously. It's part of our review of the whole area. We haven't got a specific position on it, in terms of the level at the moment, but it's something that we're monitoring.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Ed Miliband tells Labour conference delegates that he plans to break up Britain's banks should they backslide on tough new regulations, he is going further than the usual banker-bashing. When he attacks the government, which he argues has capitulated to intense lobbying and let the banks off the regulatory hook, it is not from the easy hit school of political point-scoring.</p> <p>His strategy is broader and goes back to his long-held belief that a buccaneering, devil-take-the-hindmost approach to business is out of place in the 21st century. More than that, it is counterproductive and harmful to an economy that needs to shift away from a reliance on the money made by banks and their chief asset \u2013 the inflated loans made on seemingly irresistible property speculation.</p> <p>Miliband may seem an awkward, even alien performer to some , but he will strengthen his appeal if he can stitch together policies that resonate with an audience that has spent the last four years watching incredulously as the City and the wealthy successfully defend their corner. Responsible capitalism sounds dull and un-British, but it also presents an opportunity for a little reinvention and a greater degree of fairness. It also has the potential to enthuse disenchanted Liberal Democrats as much as it does delegates desperate for some policy meat from the podium.</p> <p>At the moment, we are going backwards, with income inequality getting worse and austerity leaving the wealthy unscathed. The crimes of the banks are many and well documented. They stretch from the branches and call centres that mis-sold payment protection insurance to the trading rooms that fiddled industry-wide interest rates and the boardrooms, where characters such as Barclays' boss Bob Diamond sanctioned aggressive tax-avoidance schemes. Not to mention the drug-running and money-laundering schemes that went on under the noses of HSBC and Standard Chartered and for which they have paid multibillion pound fines. Yet their lobbying power remains undiminished.</p> <p>The coalition's laudable decision to commission Sir John Vickers, former boss of the Office of Fair Trading, to redraw the regulations governing the industry gained widespread approval. Vickers rejected the rules established in 1930s America that split behemoth banks into constituent parts to protect savers from the wheeler-dealing casino bankers that operated in the international money markets. Instead, he opted for keeping them under one roof with a ringfence around the savings deposits of the retail business.</p> <p>George Osborne broadly accepted the report, only to publish a white paper that let banks off the hook in several key areas. As such, it accepted the industry's argument that regulations cost money and increased costs are necessarily passed to customers. So for lending to increase to small business and home buyers, regulations cannot be too tight.</p> <p>This message is not just delivered by the banks. The major accountancy firms and City law firms are making more money than ever from advising the financial sector. They have the ear of ministers and wasted little time in persuading them a golden goose was about to be killed. From an economic point of view, they said, Britain needs its banks to be strong and aggressive to get the country back on its feet and generate overseas sales. The UK's foreign exchange reserves are filled with the profits from legal, accounting and financial services much more than our manufacturing industry.</p> <p>Ed Miliband is cast as a naif by the lobbyists. Thankfully, he has some friends. Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has voiced his disapproval of the government's intention to water down the Vickers rules. Robert Jenkins, a former banker, fund management boss and soon to be senior regulator, has taken on the bankers. Martin Wheatley, acting head of the Financial Services Authority and another major figure in Osborne's regulatory pantheon, is also prepared to upset the industry.</p> <p>Jenkins has said that, contrary to industry spin, the banks will win more business if they look invincible; London will be a more successful financial centre when there are clear regulations that make contracts safe and policing fair; and borrowing costs are falling, not rising, as the banks threaten, when the sophisticated services on offer in London are married to a robust regulatory system.</p> <p>Adair Turner, who sits in the House of Lords and is in the running to be the next central bank governor, is also known to favour giving banks a harder time.</p> <p>But more than individuals, Miliband has the example from across the Atlantic. For many on the left, the US is a shining example of a country that has spurned austerity in favour of running a bigger deficit. Turning away from the disturbing effects of public spending cuts and unemployment across continental Europe, the US has moved closer to a model of recovery supported by Keynesian demand theory.</p> <p>However, Congress has failed to put in place a coherent set of rules to offset the eye-watering amount of money the Obama administration pumped into the banks, leaving the US with much the same arrangements as before the Lehman Brothers crash. Banks, awash with cheap funds, lend to the same people under the same rules and pay the same bonuses to their executives. Senators Dodd and Frank, who put their name to the new banking regulations, have sadly found their legislation lobbied to death, increasing the danger of another crash in a few years.</p> <p>Miliband is right to say the same is happening in the UK.</p> <p>Michael Sandel, the American philosopher and author of <em>What Money Can't Buy</em>, is a star guest in Manchester. Sandel's arguments on the moral limits of the markets have a resonance in Ed Miliband's so far stumbling efforts to explain the rules of responsible capitalism. In his book, Sandel gives the example of the rich hiring the homeless to do their queuing for them \u2013 for the theatre, the cinema. Sandel isn't against the market but says a moral line has been crossed and unfairness and the degradation of values flourish, at a cost to us all.</p> <p>Splitting the banks cannot overturn decades of devotion to the monopolistic markets favoured by established elites.

  "<p>It was a match of extraordinary drama and in the end Tottenham Hotspur had their first victory at Old Trafford since 1989 and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas could reflect on his finest moment in English football. His team played with authority and togetherness and their supporters will like to believe that this result could be a defining moment under the direction of their ambitious new manager.</p> <p>Spurs survived some fraught moments during the late, final onslaught as Manchester United tried desperately to demonstrate why there is probably no better side in the world at rescuing seemingly irretrievable positions. Eleven years ago to the day Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge of a team that came back from 3-0 down at half-time to score five times at White Hart Lane. Three years ago Spurs had a two-goal lead at Old Trafford before being swamped by five United goals in 22 minutes. This time there was no feat of escapology; no late, dramatic twist. The visitors dug deep, refused to crumple and now they surely deserve to be taken more seriously when it comes to the teams competing for the top places.</p> <p>Ferguson will reflect that his players had left themselves with far too much to do after Jan Vertonghen opened the scoring inside the first two minutes and Gareth Bale brilliantly doubled the lead during a first half in which Spurs were magnificent, superior in every department, while United were so short of ideas their manager could barely explain it.</p> <p>United did not burst into life until a second half that incorporated a high form of drama and began with three goals in as many minutes. Nani and Shinji Kagawa got two of them, but in between Clint Dempsey registered his first goal for his new club, while in that last half hour when Spurs had to defend for their lives, they did so in a manner that makes it feel absurd that Villas-Boas woke up to headlines about a mutinous dressing room.</p> <p>Tottenham have been a soft touch far too often during that 23-year barren run at this stadium. They had to give everything here during those last moments and they did so with nerve and competitive spirit against a team that finished the game with four strikers on the pitch. Rooney hit the woodwork with a free-kick, a Michael Carrick header looped on to the crossbar and Robin Van Persie screwed his best chance of the match wide. There were penalty appeals, as well as any number of close misses. The Spurs of old would have capitulated but the new-look side refused to be cowed.</p> <p>They had started the match as though affronted that their record on this ground could be so undistinguished. Bale was superb, staggeringly so given that he almost missed the match because of a virus. Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 excelled, just as he had when Fulham visited Old Trafford last month, reminding Ferguson of the talents that had seen United bid for him earlier in the summer. Vertonghen's willingness to break forward and supplement attack, playing at left-back in place of the injured Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto, was one of the features of the game. Aaron Lennon offered width and penetration on the right. Jermain Defoe was sharp, lively and confident. In the opening 45 minutes Spurs played with great ambition, knocking the ball around with a lovely balance to the team. It was rare to see United lacking so many ideas on their own ground and, just as disappointingly for Ferguson, reacting so sluggishly to the shock of going behind so early.</p> <p>From a United perspective it was a terribly soft goal to concede, but Vertonghen deserves an enormous amount of credit for his perseverance, surging into the penalty area and playing a one-two with Bale to elude the two nearest players, Nani and Michael Carrick. The Belgian moved inside Rio Ferdinand to take aim with his right foot and when Jonny Evans slid in to try to block the shot, he succeeded only in diverting it past his own goalkeeper.</p> <p>Tottenham's second goal was counter-attacking at its best \u2013 fast, incisive and devastating. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9's clever pass set Bale running clear and from there the Welshman reminded us that when he is running full-pelt with the ball at his feet there are few more exciting sights in the sport. His change of direction and burst of acceleration was enough to keep Ferdinand at bay and the shot was angled perfectly to go across Anders Lindegaard into the bottom corner.</p> <p>United's improvement coincided with Wayne Rooney's introduction as a half-time substitute, replacing the ineffectual Ryan Giggs and quickly making his impact felt, crossing from the right for Nani to direct a shot past Brad Friedel. The excitement was unremitting from that point. Within a minute smart work from Defoe teed up Bale inside the penalty area. Lindegaard saved but was hopelessly exposed as Dempsey put in the rebound. Straight from the kick-off United were on the attack again. Van Persie slipped a pass into Kagawa's path and the Japan midfielder's control and turn was exquisite, culminating in a shot just inside the post.</p> <p>Villas-Boas has his own painful memories of United's comeback habit, with a 3-0 lead becoming a 3-3 draw when he was at Chelsea last season. Now he had to endure some nerve-shredding moments at the end of the game, but William Gallas and his defensive colleagues excelled and the Stretford End howled with anguish. The final whistle went and the Spurs manager could be seen pumping his fists on the touchline.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. When the Guardian posted a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/sep/11/joy-of-six-spurs-man-utd\">Joy of Six on Manchester United v Spurs in 2009</a>, the response was strangely negative, best summed up by this comment:</p> <blockquote> <p>cannot wait for forthcoming joy of sixes on other meaningless premiership matches between two teams with no rivalry, arsenal vs. aston villa should be a cracker</p> </blockquote> <p>All of that was what the point was not. Manchester United v Spurs is not about the rivalry, darling; it's about the <em>glamour</em>. This fixture has produced so many iconic moments, from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUm5iHbXjME\">George Best's lob</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_uzU85htH4\">Eric Cantona's pass</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-8dOjeVC80\">Pedro Mendes's goal that never was</a> (I'd still like to see it from a side-on angle as I'm not entirely convinced it crossed the line). </p> <p>In the pre-Premier League era, United v Spurs almost came with a guarantee of spills, thrills and bellyaches. Both sides were cup specialists with attacking football in their DNA; their league meetings, full of boyish joy and a simple desire to score one more than the opposition, reflected that.</p> <p>It has changed identity a little in recent times, with Spurs struggling to beat United first at Old Trafford (no wins since 1989, when Gary Lineker scored <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaQyQjBfPLs\">from outside the box</a></em>) and then anywhere (no wins since 2001), but there has still been plenty of drama in that time. Expect more today. Andre Villas-Boas doesn't really do fear at places like Old Trafford; his side will certainly have a go. <br><strong><br>Prediction</strong>: Spurs to be the better team and lose 2-1.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> <a href=\"http://www.offthepost.info/blog/2012/09/tottenham-manager-andre-villas-boas-hilarious-response-to-hugo-lloris-frustration-question/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+offthepost%2FTLAa+%28Off+The+Post%29\">Andre Villas-Boas 1-0 The Press</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Spurs' Premier League record at Old Trafford</strong> P20 W0 D3 L17 F8 A42.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Manchester United (4-2-3-1)</strong> Lindegaard; Rafael, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra; Carrick, Scholes; Nani, Kagawa, Giggs; Van Persie.<br>Substitutes: De Gea, Wootton, Anderson, Cleverley, Hernandez, Rooney, Welbeck.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1)</strong> Friedel; Walker, Gallas, Caulker, Vertonghen; Sandro, Dembele; Lennon, Dempsey, Bale; Defoe.<br>Substitutes: Lloris, Dawson, Falque, Huddlestone, Mason, Sigurdsson, Townsend.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>5.14pm</strong> Sir Alex Ferguson has just mentioned Tottenham's Christian Bale in his pre-match interview. An easy mistake to make. It's not like he referred Shinji Kagawa as Ji-Sung or anything.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Spurs kick off from right to left. They are in white; United are in the red.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> \"Scholes, Carrick and Giggs are three of the most technically proficient British midfielders of the past two decades. They're a joy to watch,\" says SB Tang. There's a 'but' coming here, isn't there. \"But they're slow and two of them are borderline geriatric. I can't see how they're going to be able to get the ball off a Spurs team which is now attuned to AVB's collective, systematic high-pressing game and \u2014 in Sandro, Dembele, Lennon, Dempsey and Bale \u2014 boast one of the quickest, most mobile midfield units in the league.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 0-1 Spurs (Vertonghen 2)</strong> For the fifth time in six league games this season, Manchester United concede the first goal. Spurs kept the ball for at least 90 seconds before the left-back Vertonghen decided to push things forward. He played a crisp one-two with Bale and surged into a scandalous amount of space. Eventually he got into the area, ignored a woolly challenge from Ferdinand and stabbed a shot that deflected off Jonny Evans' hand before wrongfooting Andres Lindegaard.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> United have already taken nine points from losing positions in 2012-13, six more than they managed throughout last season. They are going to have to do it again today.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> \"Yes, Cantona's pass was exquisite,\" says Matt Dony. \"The acting in that little skit, however, wasn't. Maybe they should draft Christian Bale into the Premier League after all. At least then we could look forward to some future reminiscing that had some real depth! ('Look forward to future reminiscing'? I should pitch that to Christopher Nolan...)\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> Spurs have started very strongly, much sharper and more confident in their passing. The atmosphere at Old Trafford is... well you don't need to be told, do you.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Dembele rolls Scholes cleverly and finds Dempsey, 25 yards from goal. He whistles a good left-footed shot not far wide, although Lindegaard had it covered.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Spurs are destroying United at the moment. Lennon charges straight at the heart of the defence, running from right to left and into the area before his shot is deflected wide for a corner. United's <em>geriatricos</em> are being overrun, just as SB Tang said they would in the second minute.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> A loose ball breaks to Van Persie on the left of the box, and he is <em>clattered</em> by Gallas as he attempts to drill a shot across goal. The ball goes nowhere but Van Persie has been hurt by that tackle. Gallas went through the ball and then planted his studs into the side of Van Persie's leg as he followed through. I'd need to see that challenge again before judging whether Gallas should have penalised/sent off/shot. I suspect not.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> \"I was at OT the last time Spurs won there, twice within a month I think it was, with Gary Lineker's best ever goal in one of them,\" says Adam Hirst. \"I reckon after United's Getting Away With It start to the season, I won't be able to say that any longer after tonight.\" It was twice in two months, but yes, they stuffed United 3-0 in the League Cup that season despite an heroic substitute performance from Giuliano Maiorana.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> \"Did Ferguson just single out Bale for praise?\" says Enna Cooper. \"I'd have thought that Willem Defoe and Sandro Bullock deserved a mention as well.\" Not to mention Benicio friedel Toro. Oh dear. I'm sorry.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Spurs have been electric on the counter-attack, and another such attack brings a corner on the left. That leads to a second corner, which comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> As always in sport, it's hard to know how much the scoreline is down to Team A being rubbish and how much is down to Team B being very good. About 54/46 I'd say.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Giggs runs down a blind alley and is dispossessed with disdain by the excellent Dembele. The level of Spurs' superiority is almost embarrassing for United.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> Evra blunders into Walker, giving Spurs a free-kick down the right. It's swung deep by Bale and headed over from only six yards by the unmarked Vertonghen. He couldn't get over the ball, which made it a very difficult chance, but the marking was appalling.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Kagawa is needlessly fouled by Dembele, right on the right corner of the penalty area. Van Persie may hit this.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> Van Persie does hit it, a bit meekly, and it goes behind for a corner off Gareth Bale. That corner is drilled deep by Giggs and eventually cleared by Bale.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> United's performance has been rubbish, almost as bad as the one at Liverpool last weekend.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> \"Just a left back, centre back, winger and two midfielders away from being the equal of Spurs,\" says Alex Netherton. \"Eff's sake.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Nothing has happened in the last 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> A cute reverse pass from Giggs, on the right of the box, is intercepted well by the influential Vertonghen.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Man Utd 0-2 Spurs (Bale 32)</strong> What a wonderful goal from Gareth Bale! It came from another electric counter-attack, led inevitably by Dembele. He stabbed a little pass to Bale, just beyond the centre circle, almost like a relay runner handing over a baton. Bale eschewed niceties and went straight at the heart of defence with a swerving run that took him from centre to right, past the floundering Ferdinand and into the box. It still needed a finish, and Bale screwed a low shot back across Lindegaard with his right foot. That was a thrillingly decisive goal.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> United could be thrashed here. They are a rabble. Of course they were 2-0 down against Spurs at Old Trafford in 2009 and won 5-2, but they had Rooney, Ronaldo, Tevez and Berbatov on the field then.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> \"Does anyone have any explanation why Sir Alex is starting Giggs and why he hasn't started Rooney?\" wonders Ashwini Dubey. He's all out of wingers I suppose, so he feels he has to play Giggs, although I'd expect one of Rooney/Welbeck/Kagawa/De Gea/Phelan to play from the left in the second half. You have to say that Ferguson has made an awful hash of his team selection today.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Somewhere in the bowels of Old Trafford, a flunky is plugging in a metaphorical hairdryer.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> The United fans have started singing. Quite loudly too. Valiant support in the face of adversity and all, but it might have been a better idea to open their mouths an hour ago.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> United are wrongly given a corner. No matter, for it produces the cube root of eff all.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> \"Watching the game in Germany while switching over to Dortmund game!\" says Dion Govender. \"Kagawa is a big hit over here and based on German commentary from SKY he seems to be MOTM candidate so far!\" He's been \u2013 what's the word I'm striving for \u2013 crap. But he's hardly alone in that.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> United are having a bit of the ball. It's all in front of Spurs though.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> United should have had a penalty there. Scholes, in the penalty area to the right, lobbed a lovely short pass over his own head and a couple of defenders. It was going towards Nani, on the right of the six-yard box, and he was clearly tugged to the floor by Vertonghen. That was a penalty and maybe a red card too. In the referee's defence, he was probably unsighted. A corner was given instead. When that was half cleared, Nani swooshed a decent 20-yard shot straight at Friedel.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> \"What's Sir Alex going to do with the hairdryer?\" says SB Tang. \"Point it at himself?\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>45+1 min</strong> \"I just wanted to say that I can't believe nothing more was made of that Gallas lunge on van Persie earlier,\" says Paul Henly. \"Shelvey did that last week on Evans and was, quite rightly, shown a red. This week Gallas does it, should be a red card and a penalty for an awful over the top challenge that could easily be a leg breaker, and it's seemingly ignored. Not even Fergie looked angered by it... bizarre.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Half time: Manchester United 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur</strong> There are a few boos around Old Trafford. United should be thankful it's only 2-0. Spurs have been extremely good \u2013 slick, purposeful and courageous \u2013 and are surely set for their first win at Old Trafford since 1989. See you in 10 minutes for the second half to see how Spurs contrive to balls this up.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>\"<strong>What's Fergie going to do with the hairdryer</strong>?\" says Alex Netherton. \"He could try it in midfield, I suppose.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> United kick off the second half. Wayne Rooney has replaced Ryan Giggs, so Shinji Kagawa will play from the left.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Nani puts a simple return pass into touch. He has had another stinker, playing with the kind of confused individualism reserved for those who feel unloved.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> \"What ungodly pattern did Robin van Persie just reveal on his boxers?\" says Matt Bobrowicz. \"Andy why, oh why, do they not show it in HD? Were you able to tell what was on it? Animals? Cartoon characters? Surely the second half MBM is writing itself from now on, right?\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> United have started the second half better than they did the first, in that they have put two passes together. Actually they've had most of the ball. But, as in the first half, almost all of it is in front of Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1-2 Spurs (Nani 51)</strong> Wayne Rooney has the desired impact with a stunning low cross from the right that Nani stabs under Friedel from six yards. A reversal of the usual roles, with Rooney creating and Nani scoring. It was a wonderful ball, hit with such pace, and Nani did really well to control the finish with his left foot.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1-3 Spurs (Dempsey 52)</strong> Spurs have restored their two-goal lead straight away! It's Clint Dempsey's first goal for Spurs. The move started when Defoe ignored the hapless Ferdinand down the left wing and played a brilliant reverse pass inside Rafael to find Gareth Bale. He smashed a first-time shot towards the far corner that was brilliantly saved by Lindegaard, but it ran loose for Dempsey to score gleefully from a few yards.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2-3 Spurs (Kagawa 54)</strong> Three goals in three minutes! This is preposterous. Van Persie took four defenders out of the game with a stunning sliderule pass. Kagawa took it in his stride with a great first touch, turning towards goal as he did so, and then drifted the ball across Friedel into the far corner.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Detailed analysis of the second half so far: crikey.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Those three goals came in just 140 seconds. Dear me.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> There's a big penalty appeal against Walker after a challenge on Kagawa in the box, but he got the ball with a brilliant tackle.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Kagawa is clattered 25 yards from goal by Lennon, a thoroughly inept tackle. It's just to the left of centre, so either Rooney or Van Persie could hit this.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> It's Rooney to take it .... and he smacks the post with a fantastic effort! It curved over the wall and bashed off the left-hand post as Friedel dived desperately to his right. He wouldn't have got there.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> \"Eleven different players have scored United's last eleven goals,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"I think what that stat tells us is WE SHOULD HAVE SIGNED A MIDFIELDER IN THE SUMMER, IF WE SPELL IT OUT IN FIREWORKS IN THE NIGHT SKY FOR YOU WOULD THAT MAKE IT OBVIOUS ENOUGH FERGIE?\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Van Persie has a goal disallowed for offside. He was put through by Scholes and finished classily, but he was definitely a yard ahead of the last man.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Another huge penalty appeal from United, this time for handball against Sandro. It bounced up and definitely hit his outstretched right hand. Hmm, I don't know about that. Sometimes they are given, sometimes not.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Rafael plays a nice one-two with Nani and finds Rooney in the box, back to goal. He has plenty of options but decides to try a shot on the turn that whistles wide of the near post. I'm not sure that was the right decision. That said, Rooney has been brilliant since coming on.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Spurs are temporarily down to 10 men because William Gallas needs a new contact lens. He's back now. United have had <em>76 per cent</em> of possession in this half. Spurs are being totally overwhelmed.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> \"Apparently Messrs Ardiles, Francis, Gross, Pleat, Graham, Hoddle, Santini, Jol, Ramos &amp; Redknapp put a combined be of \u00a336247000.05 on Manchester United at half time,\" says Niall Mullen. \"They know. We all know.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> A terrible miss from Van Persie! He was put through on goal in the inside left channel by a masterful 35-yard pass from Carrick, sidefooted with pace all along the floor. Van Persie raced to within 10 yards of goal but then drilled a hopeless shot well wide of the far post.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Gylfi Sigurdsson has replaced Clint Dempsey for Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Villas-Boas has pushed Dembele further forward onto Scholes, who has controlled the second half in the Pirlo/Scholes style.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Spurs cross the halfway line for four seconds.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Van Persie, on the stretch, heads Carrick's right-wing cross wide from 12 yards. That wasn't a bad chance; he couldn't quite get over the ball.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> United would surely want to bring Hernandez on now. I'm not sure who you'd take off though. It's still all United. Spurs have everyone behind the ball.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Spurs have been better the last five minutes. They still can't put two passes together but their defending has been a little more comfortable. Saying which, Van Persie on the left flashes a glorious sidefooted ball across the face of goal that is hoofed away by Caulker.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> A fierce, low 25-yard shot from Nani is a touch too straight and held well by the plunging Friedel.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> United do make a substitution, but it's Danny Welbeck rather than Javier Hernandez. Shinji Kagawa is the man to go off. He played well in the second half and looks a good option playing from the left.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Nani slips Vertonghen and clips a superb cross towards the far post that Gallas does superbly to head behind for a corner, under considerable pressure from Rooney. In the last five minutes United have had 86 per cent of the possession.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> \"Spurs have now completely abandoned their AVB-mandated high pressing game in favour of sitting deep, closing their eyes and praying,\" says SB Tang. \"Eerrm, are they England in disguise?\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> A loose ball comes back to Scholes, 20 yards out, and he works Friedel with a beautifully struck half volley. Thankfully for Spurs it was straight at Friedel, who got down to beat it away.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Another Spurs substitution: Tom Huddlestone reaches Dembele, who looks shattered. No surprise: he went to Scholes school in the second half.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> Carrick hits the bar! Van Persie's corner from the left was helped on by the head of Carrick, in front of the near post, and it looped onto the crossbar as all the players gawpd at it.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> I certainly didn't think I'd be typing this at half-time, but it will be a travesty if United lose this game. In the second half the pitch has only had one half.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> With Lennon and Walker leaving the ball to each other, Evra attacks Rafael's deep cross only to head it straight at Friedel from eight yards. He should have scored.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> I have no idea why Sir Alex Ferguson brought on Welbeck rather than Hernandez. I'm not sure Welbeck has touched the ball.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Rooney buys Spurs some time with a stunningly stupid and inept hack at Sigurdsson. He should probably have been booked for that.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> There will be four additional minutes of utter misery for Spurs fans.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90+2 min</strong> Nani blooters one high and wide from 25 yards, the daft fool. United bring on Javier Hernandez for Rio Ferdinand; Spurs replace Jermain Defoe with Michael Dawson. Sometimes substitutions tell the whole story.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester United 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur. SPURS WIN AT OLD TRAFFORD FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE YEAR DOT</strong> Well, 1989 to be precise. Andre Villas-Boas punches the air and screams with hard-faced delight before breaking into a warm, wide smile. Quite right too. What a moment for him and for this new Spurs team. In the context of some tedious and unjust media pressure on Villas-Boas, that is a monstrous victory. In truth it's a pretty fortunate one, despite a wonderful first-half performance, but Spurs will not and should not give a solitary one about that. It would have been so easily to fold in the second half, too easy, yet they showed huge character to resist a United assault and a persuasive history of failure in this fixture. It's their first win at Old Trafford since December 1989, and their first against United anywhere since May 2001.</p> <p>As for United, I suspect their fans might have secretly enjoyed that. Their second-half performance was fantastic, and for the first time this season they actually resembled Manchester United, playing football taught by Matt Busby. The hairdryer trumps the chalkboard yet again. Still, enough about United. This is Spurs' day, and AVB's day. I'm off to enjoy some ABV. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",
  "<p>Venezuela is gearing up for its closest presidential poll in more than a decade. The revolutionary incumbent, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is battling cancer and fighting for his political life. A telegenic young challenger from the centre-right, Henrique Capriles, is gaining ground. With one week left, one voter \u2013 the hatmaker of Caracas \u2013 weighs up the options.</p> <p>For half a century Juan Torres has provided hats for Venezuela's heads of state. Earning little more than the minimum wage, he shaped the panama owned by the \"father of democracy\", R\u00f3mulo Betancourt, when he took power in 1958, the borsalino of the centrist leader J\u00f3vito Villalba, and the stetson donned by Luis Herrera Camp\u00edns, who presided over an era of economic decline in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Now he is watching with a professional eye as a nation decides whether the revolutionary red beret that has been the trademark of Ch\u00e1vez, 58, during his 14 years in power will be replaced by the baseball cap of Capriles.</p> <p>With just a week until polling day, most forecasters predict a narrow victory of between three and five points for the incumbent. But the gap has been closing, with many voters undecided and the huge turnouts for opposition rallies providing more momentum for Capriles, who is 40, than many analysts would have believed possible.</p> <p>In this politically polarised nation, there is no doubt which side of the divide Torres is from. His neighbourhood is 23 de Enero, a bastion of Ch\u00e1vez supporters. In next week's poll, the president will cast his vote alongside local residents here in the Manuel Pelacios Fajardo school. Electoral banners and graffiti are everywhere \u2013 all in favour of the incumbent: the words \"100% Ch\u00e1vez\" are daubed on countless car windows. \"Ch\u00e1vez: Heart of the Fatherland\" read the posters that are fixed to every lamppost.</p> <p>Although this is one of the president's strongholds, there is ambivalence: a mix of appreciation, frustration and anxiety that reflects not only many of the reasons why Ch\u00e1vez has held on to power but also why the vote on 7&#xa0;October is likely to be closer than any other since he first won in 1998.</p> <p>Torres and his son, Jon\u00e1s, escort us through the neighbourhood, pointing out some of the benefits they say Ch\u00e1vez has brought to local people during that time: a clinic staffed by Cuban doctors, a public bus service and a new school where the walls have already been painted with a slogan, \"Socialist Anti-Imperialist Commune\".</p> <p>Local collectives have been given considerable power, including the authority to initiate projects and bid for central government funds. Memphis Paris, the representative of a group of 5,200 residents called Three Roots Collective, said his group had been given money to improve plumbing in the tower blocks and a playground with exercise machines overlooking the valley.</p> <p>At first glance the improvements look modest at best, particularly given that Venezuela is one of the world's three biggest oil producers and Ch\u00e1vez's presidency has been marked by a surge in the price of crude from $9 (\u00a35.50) a barrel to more than $100 today. The country's state-run oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has generated revenues of more than $980bn.</p> <p>Critics say Ch\u00e1vez has squandered this income with programmes aimed at buying off the electorate, while supporters say the money has been used for a long-overdue redistribution of income.</p> <p>The government has spent almost $300bn on social programmes that aim to improve literacy, high school education, accommodation for the homeless, and to provide subsidies for groceries or affordable home appliances. Partly as a result, poverty levels have decreased. Unemployment has fallen from 13% in 1999 to just over 8%. Infant mortality has almost halved.</p> <p>Torres's shop is in a central district of Caracas that the government has made the flagship of efforts to revitalise the city. Public squares are being cleared for music concerts, dilapidated theatres and buildings are being renovated. The British architect Richard Rogers, who was introduced to Ch\u00e1vez officials by Ken Livingstone, has designed a new central bus terminal.</p> <p>But many voters complain that many ideas are never implemented because of corruption and inefficiency. Oil production has fallen due to poor maintenance and weak investment, the road system is dire, crime is rampant and social campaigns have petered out.</p> <p>Torres says the government earmarked funds to improve the facades on buildings in his neighbourhood, but the money never reached the local community. \"I think Ch\u00e1vez has good ideas, but the people around him have failed to carry them out. I'm disappointed. They are serving their own interests, not the revolution,\" he says.</p> <p>Venezuela's economy has grown on average by 2.8% between 1999 and 2011. It's been outperformed by neighbouring Colombia, Brazil and Chile, none of which have enjoyed the windfall from oil. Inflation for 1999-2010 grew 961%, more than 10 times the average of the other seven larger economies in Latin America.</p> <p>An overdependence on oil exports and failed currency controls have created a huge black market for dollars. Torres stopped making hats himself a couple of years ago because it was cheaper to import and sell them. He earns the minimum wage, plus commission. \"Business has been bad this year. I hope it settles after the election,\" he says. \"What we need is economic change.\"</p> <p>The lack of dynamism is evident. Most of the buildings and vehicles in his neighbourhood look dilapidated. The national murder rate has more than doubled in the last 10 years, making Venezuela one of the three most dangerous countries in the world, with almost 20,000 people killed each year. Locals in the 23 de Enero district say that, on an average weekend, there are between five and 10 homicides. The police are not in control here.</p> <p>The revolution began in 23 de Enero long before the <em>comandante</em> came to power. In his youth, Torres was a member of the urban guerrilla movement. \"Here's where we used to throw molotov cocktails,\" he says as we walk through his district.</p> <p>Today a red-starred flag on the lamppost in the main square of his neighbourhood proclaims this as the territory of the GHPP urban guerrilla group. One wall is daubed with a mural of the Virgin Mary holding an AK-47. Another has a portrait of Che Guevara and a declaration, \"We will never go back to the past. Onward with the revolution.\"</p> <p>Torres's son, Jon\u00e1s, is a passionate Ch\u00e1vez supporter. \"Things have improved. I have read about how it was before and I have heard from my mother about the social injustice and indiscriminate violence by the police. Ch\u00e1vez is the best chance for change,\" he says.</p> <p>Nevertheless, for the first time in any presidential election since Ch\u00e1vez came to power, the outcome is in doubt. After a year of battling cancer, Ch\u00e1vez has been uncharacteristically subdued for much of the campaign, while Henrique Capriles has jetted back and forth across the country, drawing vast crowds wherever he goes.</p> <p>Capriles is the first opposition candidate to be selected in a primary vote and has benefited from youthful good looks and a reputation as a political winner. Although many of his supporters hail from the neoliberal right, he has successfully eaten into Ch\u00e1vez's traditional vote by promising to continue many of his social policies and implement them more effectively.</p> <p>The narrowing gap in the polls has prompted rumours of unrest in Ch\u00e1vez strongholds if the outcome is disputed. The president's aides insist they are ready to accept the choice of the electorate, but this has not ended suspicion on the streets. \"The armed guerrillas have always existed. If it is a tight result and they feel cheated, they'll go out and fight for the <em>comandante</em>,\" says Torres.</p> <p>Torres predicts Ch\u00e1vez will win by a close margin, but is reluctant to say outright who he will vote for. \"If the opposition get in, I don't know what will happen. But I'm not afraid of them. I'm not afraid of anyone.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 30 September. It originally described Caprilles as rightwing. This has been changed to centre-right since Ch\u00e1vez's challenger has greens and labour activists among his supporters.</p>",
  "<p>It's been five years since Demetri Martin: Person, the first hour-long televised stand-up special for the person Demetri Martin, broadcast in the US. On Saturday, he returns with a similarly straightforwardly titled special: Demetri Martin. Stand Up Comedian.</p> <p>Since Person aired in 2007, Martin has left New York \u2013 his home for 14 years \u2013 for California, appeared in an Ang Lee film and created and starred in two seasons of his own show. The new special is a platform for Martin to take five years of rigorous joke-writing and present a pared-down set, after the multi-instrumental, costumed chartfest that was Person.</p> <p>\"This time I didn't do any of that. It was just me, and I did some drawings,\" Martin told the Guardian. \"No piano, no keyboard, no screen with slides. I thought it would be cool to simplify it.\"</p> <p>As well as adding film, TV and books to his resum\u00e9, in 2011 Martin went out on a 30-city stand up tour. He was able to test his jokes on a range of audiences, and the exhaustive schedule and other media commitments influenced the toned-down set for his newest broadcast.</p> <p>\"A lot of what I do in stand-up is the most basic, old-fashioned thing you can do: stand there and tell jokes,\" he says. \"So often I try to see how I can vary that fundamental part of it. I try to tell jokes and different ways of presenting it, but sometimes it's like: yeah, these are just jokes \u2013 let me just tell them.\"</p> <p>A week before his special aired, Martin was in Brooklyn finishing his second book, Point Your Face At This, which is set for a March 2013 release. This follows his 2011 New York Times bestseller, This is A Book, which was filled with drawings, one-liners and short stories. His move to Los Angeles coincided with his first major Hollywood appearance, in Ang Lee's 2009 film Taking Woodstock. Now he is is writing a film that he wants to direct and star in.</p> <p>There was also the half-hour Comedy Central show Important Things with Demetri Martin, in which he applied his trademark style to single topics like safety, attention and chairs. He's hoping to continue his TV career, and is writing a pilot for an animated show.</p> <p>The other major development in Martin's life is the treadmill desk he bought four months ago, on which he logs five to six miles while writing and dictating his work. He says he's the only person he knows with the treadmill desk \u2013 and his friends had mixed reactions to the idiosyncratic purchase.</p> <p>\"Half of them were like: 'That's great, I should get one of these.' The others were like: 'No, that's dumb, you're crazy.'\"</p> <p>Martin, who comes from New Jersey, is a Yale graduate who famously left New York University's law school to pursue a comedy career. He eventually landed a job on the staff of Late Night with Conan O'Brien and made his name in the UK at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2003, winning the Perrier Award. A one-off BBC show followed.</p> <p>Then there was his gig as The Daily Show's youth correspondent \u2013 a 'position he held despite being in his 30s \u2013 where his 'Trendspotting' section aimed to answer the big questions facing America's youth, such as: <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-november-14-2005/trendspotting---wine\">\"Do you think wine makes people pee as much as beer does?\"</a> He also made a brief but legendary appearance on Flight of the Conchords, and has appeared in multiple music videos. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>Demetri Martin.

  "<p>One of America's most famous newspaper publishers, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, whose family owns the New York Times, died on Saturday at the age of 86.</p> <p>Sulzberger was one of the \"gray lady's\" best known executives. His tenure in charge of America's best-known newspaper spanned a period of vast and dynamic changes in the media industry. </p> <p>His son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr, is the current publisher of the paper, overseeing the traumatic adjustment to a digital world that began at the end of his father's period of control. In a statement reported by the New York Times the Sulzberger family said that Sulzberger, who was known to many by his nickname of \"Punch\", had died at home in Southampton, New York, after struggling with a long illness.</p> <p>The Sulzberger family has run the New York Times since 1896: when Sulzberger took charge in 1963 the media world it dominated was one of hot metal, ink and newspapers delivered by hand. </p> <p>The Times was also a somewhat insular institution which was financially vulnerable. Sulzberger embarked on a rapid expansion, snapping up radio and television stations and expanding the newspaper from its New York homeland to become far more national in scope. He had turned the company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise by the time he turned it over to his son, in 1997. </p> <p>In an era of declining newspaper readership, weekday circulation had climbed from 714,000 when Sulzberger became publisher to 1.1 million in 1992. Over the same period, the annual revenues of the Times' corporate parent rose from $100m to $1.7bn.</p> <p>The commercial expansion of the newspaper was not the only dramatic change that was overseen by Sulzberger. Journalistically, perhaps his greatest triumph was the decision to publish the \"Pentagon papers\", a trove of military documents that revealed shocking truths about the Vietnam War. He also oversaw the growth of lifestyle and sports sections aimed at consumers. The development was dismissed as unserious by some critics, but it is now an entrenched part of journalism culture. </p> <p>Sulzberger's time in charge saw the Times win the Pulitzer Prize, the highest accolade in American journalism, 31 times.</p> <p>Sulzberger was born in New York City on 5 February 1926, the only son of Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger. One of his three sisters was named Judy, and from early on he was known as \"Punch\". </p> <p>Sulzberger was the only grandson of Adolph S Ochs, a son of Bavarian immigrants who took over the Times at the end of the 19th century. Sulzberger served with the Marine Corps in World War II and Korea before joining the newspaper as a reporter.</p> <p>In a statement, his son paid tribute to his legacy and achievements, especially in fighting for the truth. </p> <p>\"Punch, the old Marine captain who never backed down from a fight, was an absolutely fierce defender of the freedom of the press,\" Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr said</p>",
  "<p>They spent much of the afternoon stumbling rather than strutting yet, by the end of it, Sunderland had won a Premier League game for the first time since March. With Martin O'Neill's team unbeaten this season, the final whistle signalled that the Northern Irishman's glass will be regarded as half full, but for much of the first hour his players looked to be running on empty.</p> <p>Everything changed early in the second half when Jordi G\u00f3mez was sent off and, as Wigan struggled to adapt, Steven Fletcher continued to make his once apparently rather steep \u00a312m transfer fee appear a bargain by scoring the winner. It was Fletcher's fifth goal since arriving from Wolves in the summer.</p> <p>While the Scottish centre-forward is already a cult hero on Wearside the home goalkeeper rightly enjoyed a mini ovation at the end. Simon Mignolet faces a strong challenge from the Republic of Ireland's Keiren Westwood for the first choice goalkeeper's jersey but the Belgian did not take long to demonstrate why he remains O'Neill's preferred option. When Jean Beausejour's cross was met by Arouna Kon\u00e9's outstretched boot at close range only Mignolet's brilliant diving save came between Wigan and an early lead.</p> <p>Despite Adam Johnson's eagerly awaited return from a thigh injury, Sunderland started in scrappy, slapdash mode. Although Iv\u00e1n Ramis was required to clear off the line following a Sebastian Larsson free-kick, Roberto Mart\u00ednez's fluid, flexible, 3-4-3 formation appeared to be flummoxing O'Neill's players.</p> <p>Without the much-missed Lee Cattermole around to break up their attacks \u2013 Sunderland's captain, a former Wigan midfielder, was suspended again \u2013 the visitors found themselves able to weave passing patterns. Indeed they might have scored shortly before half time had James McCarthy \u2013 who along with James McArthur controlled midfield \u2013 not sent his shot wide of an upright.</p> <p>Earlier Mignolet had reacted smartly to repel a McCarthy drive with his feet but O'Neill must have been frustrated with his side's failure to test Ali al-Habsi's reflexes. Granted, Fletcher directed a header wide but, with Johnson seeing too little of the ball to make his presence felt, it was all too easy to understand why Sunderland had gone so long without a League victory.</p> <p>No matter; G\u00f3mez and Howard Webb combined to offer their hosts a little help, the referee showing the Wigan forward a straight red card for a studs-up tackle on Danny Rose.</p> <p>Webb was adhering to the letter of the law but, although reckless, it was the sort of challenge which sometimes receives a yellow. ''The sending off changed things,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"I thought we'd started really well and I could only see Sunderland being a threat from a dead ball situation. In the end they had one shot on target and collected three points.</p> <p>''I think the sending-off was harsh because Danny Rose loses the ball slightly, Jordi G\u00f3mez tackles like a striker showing his studs but he doesn't leave the ground. I understand the reason the referee gave it but Sunderland's Larsson later made a worse challenge and he was only shown a yellow.\"</p> <p>St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon and James McClean were disappointing \u2013 (the latter proving fortunate to escape a booking until late on) \u2013 but Sess\u00e8gnon's clever pass and McClean's left wing cross prefaced Fletcher sweeping a first time shot beyond Habsi.</p> <p>\"The win was vitally important and I want to thank Mignolet for a couple of incredibly good saves,\" O'Neill said. \"It was edgy but Steven Fletcher was brilliant; he's looking a bargain.\"</p>",
  "<p>Never put your head in a lion's mouth, never play football on the M1 in the rush hour and never play rugby at Welford Road the week after the home side has lost there. This latter truism was underlined thrice by Adam Thompstone, the former London Irish wing, who scored a hat-trick on his full Leicester debut.</p> <p>His first came with his first touch of the ball, worked clear in the seventh minute, his second with his first touch after the break, in the 46th minute, and his third with a quarter of an hour to go. Needless to say, the Welford Road faithful loved it. But the resolution of their crescendo was not forthcoming, as the Exeter defence held strong to deny the Tigers that fourth bonus-point try. Not many sides would have managed that with Leicester in this mood.</p> <p>The home side will wonder how they did not score more tries with their comprehensive dominance of the set piece \u2013 but there was devil in everything they did, the anger from last week's defeat to Harlequins fairly steaming from their noses. Nevertheless, the turning point, which made the rout a possibility, as opposed to the comeback, was, tediously, tarnished by yet more dissatisfaction with the role of the television match official.</p> <p>It surrounded Thompstone's second, which, first, deserves description. Ignacio Mieres spilled a pass on his five-metre line and, with some impudence and a hell of a lot of skill, Toby Flood, under pressure, flicked the bobbling ball to Matt Smith with the outside of his right boot. Two passes later Thompstone was over.</p> <p>The referee referred the matter upstairs, asking the TMO to check for a knock-on by Leicester, which there clearly hadn't been. There had, though, been a manly bear hug by Thomas Waldrom on Mieres as he tried to rectify his mistake, which had not been referred and was thus not commented upon. It did not affect the result, and the try would probably have been scored either way, if nothing else at the subsequent scrum for Mieres's knock-on, but both coaches joined the growing chorus of weariness at this trial extension of the TMO's powers.</p> <p>With the try left to stand, the score read 23-3, in the 46th minute, and it now became a question of whether Leicester could clinch the bonus point. Their task would have been helped enormously, had Lugovi'i Mulipola scored on 52 minutes rather than allowing Mieres to redeem himself with a heroic tackle a good couple of metres past the tryline.</p> <p>Thompstone clinched his hat-trick later, gathering Smith's clever chip to race home. That was as many tries as they could score, though, which is some tribute to Exeter, who claimed the mild consolation of a try at Welford Road, when Ben White drove over at the death, which, again, required TMO approval.</p> <p>So 30-8, a good mauling in anyone's book, but most teams in this league would have copped it worse. It was Exeter's misfortune that the fixture computer had drawn them a headlong leap into the Tigers' mouth.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Claunch lived and died in the Healing Hands home for people with mental-health problems, a drab little house in Houston's deprived East End. It stands on a tree-lined street that is quiet but for the baritone horns of passing freight trains with better places to be.</p> <p>At around 2am last Saturday Claunch, a wheelchair-bound double amputee, became unruly after demanding a fresh supply of cigarettes and soda from the home's caretaker, who dialled 911. According to police, Claunch grew violent and made threats when officers arrived and the 45-year-old \"waved a shiny object in his hand in their direction\". Fearing for the safety of his cornered fellow officer, Matthew Marin shot Claunch in the head. The object was a ballpoint pen.</p> <p>Claunch had lived at the home since last March. Healing Hands was one of 12 facilities in which he had spent time after becoming a ward of the Harris County Guardianship program in 2003.</p> <p>Judge Mark Kent Ellis came across Claunch in 2009, when he was charged with possession of cocaine. Ellis sent him to a Texas mental-health facility. Claunch, who had suffered brain-damage, was schizophrenic. Unfit to stand trial, he was placed into care in the community. </p> <p>\"He was homeless, basically, before he was arrested in this case,\" Ellis said. \"According to him he had brothers and sisters and had even been married in the past and had children but none of them had anything to do with him. He was a mess.\"</p> <p>Claunch kept vanishing. On one occasion he left a home because staff refused to let him watch television. </p> <p>\"He'd leave many of the homes where he was placed and be gone for months at a time,\" said Estella Olguin, a spokesperson for the Harris County Guardianship program. \"He was stable and stayed in this home, probably a pretty long time for Brian to stay put.\"</p> <p>Court records show that since the mid-1980s Claunch had spent time in prison for drug offenses and crimes such as trespass and auto theft. Over the last decade he had been regularly assessed by doctors, after being found mentally incompetent. He apparently had a sense of humor. One court document, from 2006, asked Claunch to note the age of his mother. He wrote: \"Up there.\"</p> <p>The Associated Press reported that Claunch had told authorities he had lost an arm and a leg in 1990, after lying down on a railroad track because he wanted a train to dismember him and purge the devil from the left side of his body.</p> <p>Judge Ellis runs a successful special court program for defendants with mental-health problems. In three years more than 500 people have gone through the process and the recidivism rate is 11.7%, far below the norm. Claunch was too ill to be healed, but he could be managed.</p> <p>\"He was a success, from our standpoint,\" Ellis said. \"We feel like we'd placed him in a situation where he could function. Everyone who interviewed him said he was pleasant, cooperative, but when you got beyond the standard measures, the basics, his mind would wander, he could not do any high-level mental functioning. He could not make decisions. He would not have reacted to a high-stress situation like you or I.\"</p> <p>John Garcia, who runs the Healing Hands care home, told KHOU local news it was possible that static on the line during the 911 call could have meant the operator had not realized Claunch was mentally ill. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying he would hurt the police, but Brian was very strong and he was very agile,\" Garcia said. \"He was fast. He could spin that wheelchair around like kids on a bicycle.\"</p> <p>Claunch's death prompted fresh protests from Houston community groups who had previously accused the police of using excessive force. The groups want changes in how officers are trained and incidents are investigated. In 2011 Houston's mayor, Annise Parker, created a citizens review panel, the Independent Police Oversight Board. Its activities are not made public.</p> <p>\"This man did not have to die. He was killed in cold blood. The training of the Houston police department's officers must change,\" said Quanell X, a community activist, at a vigil outside the Healing Hands home on Tuesday. \"They called to get him assistance. They did not call to have him murdered.\"</p> <p>Last May, there were protests outside the Harris County Courthouse in downtown Houston after an all-white jury acquitted a former officer accused of involvement in the beating of a black burglary suspect, Chad Holley. Video footage of the incident, which occurred in March 2010, showed officers kicking and stomping on the teenager as he lay on the ground. Three officers are awaiting trial. Seven were dismissed by Charles McClelland, the chief of police, though two regained their jobs on appeal.</p> <p>On Monday, McClelland issued a statement saying that he had brought in the FBI to help with the investigation into Claunch's death and asking for public judgment to be reserved until all the evidence has been gathered.</p> <p>The Houston Chronicle reported that since taking charge almost three years ago, <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/default/article/Numbers-show-HPD-chief-is-serious-about-policing-3886569.php\">McClelland has fired 63 police officers and disciplined nearly 1,300 of the 5,200 members of the department</a>. Another 983 were ordered to receive counseling.</p> <p>In 2008, the Houston police department pledged to revise its firearms training after a legal fight by the parents of Eli Escobar Jr, a 14-year-old killed five years earlier by a rookie policeman who was subsequently convicted of negligent homicide. But controversies have continued. John T Barnes Sr was shot dead in 2009 after an officer intervened in an argument between Barnes and his partner. It took more than five months for the city to release the autopsy report, which revealed that Barnes had been shot repeatedly in the back.</p> <p>Rufino Lara was killed by an officer last July. Police said he had turned around rapidly with a hand tucked under his shirt, but two witnesses said his hands had been in the air. Lara did have something concealed in his waistband: a beer can.</p> <p>The district attorney's annual report states that last year Harris County's police integrity division investigated 36 officer-involved shootings. Of those, 16 were fatal, up from 13 in 2010. The city of Chicago, which has a population roughly two-thirds the size of Harris County but more than twice as many officers, saw 60 police shootings last year and 23 fatalities. By comparison, all police in England and Wales discharged firearms on average 6.6 times per year between 2001 and 2009.</p> <p>A Houston police spokesperson said that because of the ongoing investigation he was unable to say why an officer from the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), a unit specially trained to deal with people suffering mental-health problems, had not been sent to the Healing Hands home. </p> <p>Ellis said: \"They are literally a model for the country. We could have had officers... who would have dealt with it in a much different way.\"</p> <p>Healthcare budget cuts mean that states increasingly rely on police as first responders in crisis situations involving people with mental-health problems. Police in San Francisco decided to form a CIT last year after a string of high-profile shootings.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the US Department of Justice announced that an investigation into policing in the city of Portland, Oregon, found that the Portland Police Bureau \"has engaged in an unconstitutional pattern or practice of excessive force against people with mental illness\" and that \"gaps in the State's mental-health system [led] to an increase in police encounters with people with mental illness\".</p> <p>Harris County, which covers about four million inhabitants of Houston and surrounding areas, spends $50m a year on incarcerating people with mental-health problems. </p> <p>Ellis said: \"Our legislature has persistently cut mental-health funding. [Among the 50 states, Texas is] No50 in mental-health funding per capita. At any given time a quarter of our population in the county jail are on psychotropic medication.\"</p> <p>Brian Claunch will be buried on Monday. </p> <p>\"For the first time in 30 years he was in a situation where he was safe, supervised, on his medication, functioning as well as he could function in our society at this point in time. That's the sad thing as much as anything,\" Ellis said. \"We finally got him in a good place and he gets shot by a policeman.\"</p>",

  "<p>The killing of the US ambassador to Libya is rapidly becoming election fodder, as Republicans seize on confusion over the circumstances of Chris Stevens' death in Benghazi three weeks ago and accuse the Obama administration of covering up an al-Qaeda connection.</p> <p>US officials reiterated on on Friday that they regard the killing of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department at the US consulate in Benghazi as an assault by terrorists who planned the attack. But a dearth of real information about the exact circumstances of the assault has left open the question of whether such planning was merely the work of a few hours, to take advantage of a spontaneous anti-US protest over a short internet video that prompted demonstrations across the Middle East by offended Muslims, or weeks and months, to mark the 11th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on the US. </p> <p>Disagreement over that question is dividing along political lines. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Republican senators wrote to the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, demanding that she explain her statement, five days after the killings, that they were part of a spontaneous anti-US protest. Four senators signed the letter, including John McCain, which said Rice made \"several troubling statements that are inconsistent with the facts and require explanation\". </p> <p>The former New York mayor Rudolf Giuliani, who sought the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008, went further, accusing the White House of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking to Fox News, Giuliani said: \"This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history. And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\" </p> <p>Rice's explanation of a spontaneous assault by a well-armed Libyan militia was maintained by the administration until 10 days ago when Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Centre, called the killings a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, and the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, this week shifted away from the initial line. Clinton on Wednesday hinted that the al-Qaeda offshoot in North Africa may be tied up with the Benghazi assault.</p> <p>\"Now with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to manoeuvre, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions,\" Clinton told a meeting of international leaders at the UN which discussed the crisis in North Africa, including the seizure of northern Mali by armed Islamist forces. \"And they are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi.\"</p> <p>Administration officials were careful to say afterwards that Clinton was not claiming firm evidence of a link. Olsen was similarly cautious in speaking to senators this week.</p> <p>\"The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved, so it's not necessarily an either/or proposition,\" he said. </p> <p>Officials say that while there is some evidence that individual members of the local militia responsible for the attack, Ansar al-Shariah, may have been in touch with extremist elements in other countries, no hard information has so far emerged of a direct foreign or al-Qaeda link to the attack in Benghazi. </p> <p>The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Martin Dempsey, on Thursday said there \"was a thread of intelligence reporting that groups in the environment in eastern Libya were seeking to coalesce but there wasn't anything specific\". He added that there was no intelligence indicating a looming attack. </p> <p>Officials say US intelligence picked up a call by a member of al-Qaeda in North Africa celebrating the attack, but that is not hard evidence of a link. </p> <p>Panetta said on Thursday that there was some preplanning involved in the assault.</p> <p>\"As we determined the details of what took place [in Benghazi], and how that attack took place it became clear that there were terrorists who had planned that attack,\" he said.</p> <p>But whether that was over the proceeding hours, when the militia realised it could take advantage of the existing protest outside the consulate, or over the previous days and weeks remains a question investigators are struggling to answer. At present, the Americans are unable even to establish how large the protest was and how long it went on.</p> <p>Administration officials continue to maintain that if there was preplanning, it was not long term. But some Republicans argue that there is already evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, of a plot. For a start, they say it is no coincidence that the assault on the Benghazi consulate was on 11 September. </p> <p>The discovery in the wrecked consulate, by CNN, of Stevens' diary has also fed claims that the White House is underplaying a broader terrorist connection. Stevens wrote that he feared he was an al-Qaeda hit list and was alarmed by his lack of security after earlier attacks on US and British targets in Benghazi and amid what he described as a growing al-Qaeda presence in Libya. </p> <p>The state department's furious reaction to CNN's reporting of Stevens' fears \u2013 calling the use of non-personal information from the diary without the family's approval \"disgusting\" \u2013 suggested alarm in the administration at the potential damage to its denials of a conspiracy and that it will be open to criticism that it did not provide sufficient protection to the Benghazi consulate.</p> <p>There are also questions about the circumstances of Stevens death and whether Libyan militias knew he was at the consulate. However, given the large footprint American diplomats make as they move around the Middle East, it would not have been difficult to discern that an important US official had arrived in Benghazi. </p> <p>Giuliani said the White House was reluctant to admit al-Qaeda involvement because it wants to dismiss that threat following last year's killing of Osama Bin Laden.</p> <p>\"I think it's because they have this narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\" he said. \"They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia \u2013 he was going to declare this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very convenient narrative.\"</p> <p>Libya's president, Mohamed Magariaf, has also made the link by blaming \"al-Qaeda elements\" hiding in his country for the death of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department.</p> <p>\"It was a preplanned act of terrorism directed against American citizens,\" Magariaf said this week.</p> <p>But claims of an al-Qaeda connection has been met with scepticism by others in Libya who say it is feasible for well armed militiamen to have taken advantage of the protests outside the US consulate to launch a substantial attack. </p> <p>The likelihood of a definitive explanation any time soon looks dim. </p> <p>The Obama administration has said an FBI investigation will establish the facts. But the New York Times on Friday reported that the FBI team remains in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, over 400 miles away, because of fears for its safety. </p> <p>Meanwhile the crime scene of the killings in Benghazi has been picked over by Libyans, who are assumed to have compromised what ever evidence there was that would have been of use to investigators. </p> <p>One US law enforcement official in Tripoli told the New York Times that they may never make it to Benghazi.</p>",
  "<p>A generation of women who fought for equal pay, improvements in childcare and maternity leave are being caught in a bind between caring for elderly parents and grandchildren while suffering from outdated workplace practices, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian on women's issues, Cooper said: \"A toxic combination of sexism and ageism is causing problems for this generation.\"</p> <p>Cooper's comments come as Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, announced a new commission to tackle the issue of discrimination against women over the age of 50. The Commission on Women will be led by the former BBC Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly and include the Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips, who like O'Reilly was dropped from presenting work on the BBC. The panel will help draw up proposals for preventing ageism and sexism and will also consider whether new legislation is needed to prevent discrimination. A social care information service for what the Labour party describes as a \"true squeezed middle\" is also due to launch as part of the commission.</p> <p>Cooper, who has responsibility for women and equalities as part of her Home Office brief, said: \"This is really a first step for women who don't even know where to go for help. They may have a mum in Bolton who increasingly needs help and support and they may live somewhere else and have no idea what to do. Whether it's the council, a voluntary organisation or just a neighbour, this information service will help.\"</p> <p>The scheme is similar to the family information service piloted by the party in the early 1990s to publish information on childcare providers.</p> <p>Women over 50 are bearing the brunt of the government's economic policies while often trying to cope with the increasing burden of caring for relatives, according to research carried out by the Labour party.</p> <p>Since the coalition came to power in May 2010, unemployment among women aged 50-64 has seen a huge 31% increase to 142,000, compared with an overall increase in all unemployed people over 16 of 4.2% to 2.6m, according to Office for National Statistics figures.</p> <p>Women as a whole have lost more jobs than men since 2010 (an estimated 11% increase) but women over 50 in particular have been hit hardest by the big cuts in local authority budgets.</p> <p>The number of long-term unemployed (those out of work for 12 months or more) has increased by 105,000 to 904,000 since May 2010 and women make up 82,000 of the rise, or 78%, although men are still a majority of the unemployed overall. In contrast, unemployment among men above the age of 50 has barely changed since 2010 despite the overall increase and budget cuts.</p> <p>As well as suffering from increased unemployment and changes to pension provisions, the over-50s are also dealing with the increasing life expectancy of their parents.</p> <p>Harman, who will chair the new commission, tackled the issue of women in television. \"Of course there is age discrimination against men. But the combination of age and gender discrimination against women is of a different order of magnitude,\" she said. Harman criticised George Entwistle, the BBC's new director general, for his \"woeful\" response to criticism that the corporation freezes out older women while keeping older men on its screens.</p> <p>\"Basically, he said: 'We have got to reach out and find these [older] women.' In fact, they are right there under his nose but they are being got rid of,\" Harman said in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/29/police-figures-met-corruption-cases\" title=\"\">interview with the Independent</a>.</p> <p>She added: \"He was saying: 'We can't start chucking out the older men.' Miriam [O'Reilly] was told to devise her own programme and then she could be on it. He needs to wake up right away and realise that women will not tolerate that any more. We need action, not pitiful excuses. He is still stuck in the old mould that the older man, the experienced, wise sage, has to be matched [on screen] by the younger woman.\"</p> <p>Harman said that women on television feel the clock ticking in a way that it isn't for older men.</p> <p>An opinion poll for the Huffington Post this week suggested that Labour is ahead of the Tories by 22 points when it comes to looking after the interests of women.</p> <p>Overall, about 34% say Labour is best at looking after the interests of women, compared with 12% for the Conservatives.</p> <p>In a speech at the pre-conference on Saturday, Cooper aims to take issue with the suggestion by the Tory minister David Willetts that the first generation of women to benefit from changes in equality laws were somehow selfishly denying less educated men a chance to work. \"These women are the very opposite of selfish. They are often the generation holding the whole family together.\"</p> <p>The changes to tax and benefits come into force next April. The social care information service will start in Salford, and then the party plans to extend it across Labour-run authorities before the next election.</p>",

  "<p>Around 30,000 people have taken part in a march in Belfast to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Ulster covenant, signed to oppose home rule for Ireland in 1912.</p> <p>Thousands of spectators lined the streets to watch the event, while a cultural festival was being staged in the grounds of the Northern Ireland assembly at Stormont.</p> <p>The six-mile march from central Belfast to Stormont is in memory of the covenant and in honour of Sir Edward Carson, the founding father of modern unionism.</p> <p>While a feeder parade of more than 2,000 Orangemen and their bands from north Belfast passed off peacefully along the route, Catholic residents who live nearby accused loyalists of breaking a legal ruling that banned them from playing unionist anthems close to one of Belfast's oldest Catholic churches.</p> <p>The Parades Commission \u2013 the body that adjudicates on controversial marches in Northern Ireland \u2013 ruled on Thursday that only religious hymns could be played while the procession went past St Patrick's chapel in Donegall Street.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of the bands that passed the church played a selection of hymns such as Abide With Me and Onward Christian Soldiers.</p> <p>But Frank Dempsey, the chairman of the Carrick Hill Residents Association, claimed that at least one band played the loyalist anthem The Sash before they entered Belfast's major thoroughfare, Royal Avenue, a clear breach, the nationalists insisted, of the Parades Commission ruling.</p> <p>\"The determination was that only hymns were to be played down to Royal Avenue. That determination has been smashed. Some of the bands, yes, they did stick by the ruling \u2013 I have no problem with that \u2013 but a number of them broke it.</p> <p>\"Let's put it this way: it went over peacefully, but we are going to wait with bated breath, because when they [the unionists] get there and get a few liquors into them it might be a different story coming back,\" he said.</p> <p>The Orangemen and bands from north Belfast are expected to pass Donegall Street by St Patrick's at around 6pm on Saturday evening. There is a massive security operation in place across parts of Belfast to ensure the unionists' return from the Stormont estate passes off peacefully. Hundreds of armoured police Land Rovers have been deployed along sectarian flashpoints across the city.</p> <p>Speaking outside the church, the St Patrick's administrator Father Michael Sheehan expressed relief that the morning parade had passed off relatively peacefully.</p> <p>Gerry Kelly, a Sinn F\u00e9in minister in the power-sharing government, observed the parade and praised the \"dignity\" of the protesters and also welcomed the fact that no violence had erupted along the route.</p> <p>The Sinn F\u00e9in North Belfast assembly member called for dialogue between the residents, the Orange Order and others in the loyalist community to prevent the area around St Patrick's become yet another permanent sectarian flashpoint in the parading disputes.</p> <p>The head of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Edward Stevenson, used the event to warn of the new threat to the unity of the UK from Alex Salmond's drive towards Scottish independence.</p> <p>\"We are delighted to welcome members of the loyal orders from England and Scotland. They too have demonstrated their loyalty to the crown and our Scottish brethren have publicly opposed any suggestion of independence for their country.</p> <p>\"We are all very clear about our long-term vision and that is to stay within the United Kingdom,\" he said.</p> <p>Another senior Orangeman used the event to accuse the IRA and the Roman Catholic church of setting out to destroy the state of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The deputy grand master of the Orange Order in Ireland, the Rev Alastair Smyth, said the Westminster parliament had \"rejected biblical values\" and \"encouraged homosexual activities with civil partnership legislation and the pressure is currently on to legalise same-sex marriage\".</p>",
  "<p>For the past five days, 1,000 female Nigerian pilgrims have been detained at an airport and various detention facilities in Saudi Arabia. They arrived in the country to conduct the annual pilgrimage, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj\" title=\"\">the hajj</a>, a duty that every Muslim must fulfil once in their lifetime if they can afford to do so. Despite the fact that they had valid hajj visas, Saudi authorities would not allow them into the country as they were unaccompanied by male guardians (<em>mahrams</em>). While about 200 have already been sent back, the rest remain, awaiting a resolution of the matter between the Nigerian and Saudi governments.</p> <p>The issue has precipitated a <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201209270091.html\" title=\"\">diplomatic spat</a> between the two countries. A spokesman for the Nigerian vice-presidential office said he had received reports that the women were being subjected to \"dehumanising treatment\", being deprived of food and forced to sleep on cold floors. Paradoxically, and hypocritically, the women are being subjected to the very dishonour that a male guardian is allegedly required to protect them against.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia prides itself on being \"the custodian of the two holy mosques\". Every year, the country hosts up to 3 million pilgrims as they perform the holy rite. It is a political and logistical feat, and Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in hajj infrastructure. However, the hajj is blighted with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidents_during_the_Hajj\" title=\"\">practical and logistical failures</a>. And female pilgrims are often disproportionately affected, as they fall foul of arbitrary legal innovations and immigration disarray.</p> <p>While the mahram requirement is notoriously well known, its application has been erratic. Female members of my family were sent back for not having a mahram as far back as the 1980s, but since then it has been common for women to be allowed to travel in convoys, sponsored by their diplomatic missions or equivalent authority. It seems that Saudis themselves admit that this is a new enforcement of the letter of the law: the Saudi ambassador in Abuja said that they had been \"flexible in the past\", but had decided to apply the law this time. To add to the humiliation, the implication that these women are not complying with religious law (of which Saudis believe their interpretation is the only arbiter) is insulting in the extreme: to want to complete the hajj at all (not to mention incurring the significant costs and physical hardship) would suggest a certain level of committed religious observance. In addition, the mahram rule is applied in its current extreme form only in Saudi Arabia. It is by no means a universal Islamic stipulation that other Muslims with <a href=\"http://abubakrsiddeeq.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/women-can-perform-hajj-without-mahram.html\" title=\"\">different religious cultures</a> would adopt, especially on a hajj trip lasting three days.</p> <p>It is not the first time that female pilgrims have fallen victim to Saudi Arabia's random legislation. Last year, based on some internalised cultural stereotype, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.net/news/pages/0e5fc167-3ee3-457d-88ae-a719ced1f839\" title=\"\">Saudis banned Moroccan women</a> of a certain age from the <em>umrah</em>, a shorter pilgrimage, even if they were accompanied by mahrams, because of a belief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/29/saudi-arabia-ban-moroccan-women-stereotype\" title=\"\">that they were of loose morals</a> and would somehow slip through the (very tight noose) of the umrah visa and entice Saudi men into underground prostitution rings.</p> <p>Both incidents reek of national and racial discrimination. Nigerian officials claim that only Nigerian women were screened and subjected to such treatment. Unfortunately, in a region where there is sensitivity about the treatment of black Muslims \u2013 the term <em>abda</em> (slave) is one I heard often while living there \u2013 the cordoning off and manhandling of hundreds of black Muslim women looks very bad.</p> <p>As the kingdom deported several thousand Nigerian overstayers last year, the mahram issue may well be a ham-fisted cover for a pre-emptive crackdown on immigration. Though it is perfectly within the kingdom's rights to apply entry conditions, it is unreasonable to do it under false pretences.</p> <p>Whether it is the result of clumsy instruction from above or airport officials acting stubbornly and forcing the government to back them, the incident and the scores of angry women arriving in Nigeria and venting their ire to international media are an embarrassment to the Saudis at the beginning of hajj season.</p>",
  "<p>Air accident investigators from the UK are heading to Nepal to investigate the plane crash that killed seven Britons on Friday.</p> <p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch said it was sending two staff to Kathmandu to assist local authorities looking into the accident, which killed all 19 passengers shortly after takeoff from Kathmandu airport.</p> <p>The Britons, who were on a trekking holiday, were among those killed after the twin-engine propeller Dornier plane crashed in a field.</p> <p>Initial reports suggested the plane had possibly hit a large bird but pilot error or a malfunction are now being investigated. Ratish Chandra Suman, an official from Tribhuvan international airport, said the pilot had reported trouble two minutes after takeoff and appeared to have been trying to turn back to the airport.</p> <p>The plane crashed on the bank of the Manohara river at 6.18am on Friday in clear weather and witnesses said the plane was already on fire before it hit the ground.</p> <p>Tributes were paid to the group of Britons, who included the lawyer Ben Ogden, 27, from Buckingham, an Oxford University graduate who worked for the international law firm Allen &amp; Overy. He was on the Everest Base Camp trip to celebrate just having qualified. The firm said the young lawyer, who lived in London, \"had an incredibly promising career ahead of him\".</p> <p>The Britons, named by the local travel company Sherpa Adventures, also included Timothy Oakes, 57, a married father and secondary school adviser for Lancashire county council. He loved mountaineering and was on the trip of a lifetime with an old school friend, his distraught wife, Angie Gaunt, said at the family home in Winwick, Cheshire. She added: \"He was going because he always wanted to see Everest. If you love the mountains, it is the ultimate.\"</p> <p>His travelling companion was Stephen Holding, 60, a retired teacher from the village of Barlaston, Staffordshire, who was also a keen mountaineer, according to Keith Finney, brother of his wife, Maggie.</p> <p>\"My sister just wants to say Stephen had gone out on a trip of a lifetime. He had been planning the trip for 18 months and was with a lifetime friend,\" he said.</p> <p>Another victim, Raymond Eagle, 58, a keen fell runner, from Macclesfield, who lived alone, worked for Cheshire East council as a support worker for disabled people. His neighbour Pauline Girdwood said he was very active and ran every day. \"This was the sort of thing he did. He did go trekking, he was a fell runner and very, very active in outdoor activities.\"</p> <p>Vincent Kelly, 50, and his brother Darren, 45, were also part of the group, who arrived in Nepal on Wednesday and were due to begin a three-week trek in the Khumbu region around Mount Everest on Friday.</p> <p>Darren Kelly, a property developer and businessman living in the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway, was originally from Bolton but had moved to the village in recent years, where he renovated property for holiday lets. The vice-chairman of a local diving club, he was described by residents as a \"first-class guy\" who was active in the community. The club's treasurer, Chris Harrison said: \"He'll be a great loss to the club but mostly to his wife and family. He was a dynamic and enthusiastic person.\"</p> <p>Vincent Kelly, a company director of Lostock, Bolton, was a \"most prolific\" and \"well respected\" supporter of Bolton Lads &amp; Girls Club \u2013 raising funds to replace its Astroturf by cycling from John O'Groats to Land's End \u2013 said the club in a statement. \"There aren't enough words to describe just how wonderful Vincent was \u2013 a dedicated family man with a generous heart of gold who was a perfect role model for all,\" said Mark Brocklehurst, a member of the club's board.</p> <p>The seventh Briton to die was named as Christopher Davey, 51, believed to be from Northampton.</p> <p>The group were travelling with the Hampshire-based company Explore Worldwide, which said in a statement it was \"devastated by this news\".</p> <p>All those on board the plane, operated by the domestic airline Sita Air and bound for Lukla, died</p> <p>The victims included five tourists believed to be from China, four Nepalese passengers, including Explore's local tour guide, and the crew.</p> <p>Aviation accidents involving small aircraft are not uncommon in mountainous Nepal. In September 2011, 19 people including 16 tourists were killed when a Buddha Air flight crashed on a similar route.</p> <p>In August 2010, 14 passengers including four Americans, a Briton and a Japanese national were killed after a plane heading to the Everest region crashed as a result of bad weather. In December 2010, all 22 passengers were killed when another plane came down.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article was amended on 1 October 2012. The original referred to a \"Dorier plane\".

  "<p>As the impact of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> continues to be felt across many parts of the Middle East, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jordan\" title=\"\">Jordanian regime</a>'s unwillingness to heed calls for meaningful political reform, greater press freedoms and democratisation is antagonising political and civil society activists alike.</p> <p>While protests and demonstrations in Jordan have been small and relatively peaceful compared with those in other countries in the region, the royal court's continued intransigence could lead to further unrest, including violent clashes with security forces.</p> <p>In what was widely seen as an effort to stamp out criticism of the royal court, the Jordanian parliament \u2013 which consists mainly of conservative pro-regime members \u2013 recently passed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19634056\" title=\"\">a controversial press and publications law</a> that requires online media organisations to register and obtain licences from the authorities.</p> <p>In addition, online publishers will be held accountable for comments posted by readers on their website and they will be prohibited from publishing comments that are not strictly relevant to the published article (how this is to be determined is far from clear). This law is clearly designed to limit the dissemination of political commentary that may be critical of the regime.</p> <p>Although the royal court has in recent months proposed <a href=\"http://al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/meii/features/main/2011/10/05/feature-01\" title=\"\">changes to the constitution</a> and the electoral law, these have largely been dismissed as a cosmetic exercise since the king will retain the power to dismiss parliament at will and the proposed new electoral system is still rigged in favour of regime supporters.</p> <p>In addition, the majority of Jordanians (ie Palestinian-Jordanians) will be significantly under-represented in the parliament. The leading opposition group in Jordan, the Islamic Action Front (IAF \u2013 the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood) has vowed to boycott legislative elections planned for early next year and has called for <a href=\"http://www.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleno=132496\" title=\"\">a mass rally</a> to take place in early October.</p> <p>The IAF is demanding meaningful constitutional amendments to reduce the powers of the king and to amend the current electoral system, which mainly benefits regime supporters. Additionally, influential <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan\" title=\"\">Transjordanian</a> tribes have been calling for anti-corruption measures as well as amendments to the constitution to give further powers to the parliament.</p> <p>While there have not been calls for the abolition of the monarchy, the royal court's refusal to properly engage with the protesters is likely to increase tension in the kingdom and could ultimately lead to calls for the removal of the king.</p> <p>The royal court has a difficult balancing act to perform. First, the protesters are divided. Transjordanians, who have been traditionally loyal to the Hashemite regime, are opposed to political reform that challenges their inherited privileged status and position, and are resisting calls to increase the representation of Palestinian-Jordanians in parliament.</p> <p>While the king will have to respond to the demands of the IAF and the Palestinian-Jordanians, he will also have to remain sensitive to the needs of the Transjordanians. This will not be an easy task.</p> <p>Second, if the royal court agrees to real constitutional and political reform there is a risk that the IAF will obtain control of parliament and as a result it would be able to challenge the authority and power of the king \u2013 for example by introducing further amendments to the constitution.</p> <p>Third, the Jordanian economy and the royal court's patronage network is largely funded by financial aid from Saudi Arabia, which strongly opposes further democratisation in the Middle East. The royal court is, therefore, coming under pressure from one of its main financial backers to resist calls for political change.</p> <p>Given the strategic geopolitical importance of the Hashemite kingdom, it is not in the interests of western or regional governments to see Jordan descend into chaos or experience further unrest. So what should be done? A low turnout in the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place later this year under the royal court's new electoral law will be a disaster for the regime and it will raise questions over the legitimacy of the king's reform agenda. Thus the royal court needs to positively engage with protesters and postpone the elections until agreement is reached with stakeholders on political and constitutional reform.</p> <p>Jordan has the potential to transition to democracy in a more peaceful and organised way by following the Moroccan example. In 2011, the Moroccan monarchy agreed to transfer more powers to parliament, including the authority to form cabinets. This ensured the survival of the monarchy and averted further unrest and violence there.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it does not appear as if Jordan's king has the vision or the courage to follow this path \u2013 but failure to learn the lessons of the Arab spring may mean that the Jordanian people will make that decision for him.</p>",
  "<p>Today's lengthy Daily Telegraph editorial, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9573574/The-threat-to-our-free-press-is-grave-and-foolish.html\">The threat to our free press is grave and foolish</a>, appears to betray an increasing nervousness about the coming Leveson inquiry report. </p> <p>Its strapline, \"The growing clamour for press regulation backed by statute threatens a priceless British freedom\", either implies some kind of inside knowledge of Lord Justice Leveson's intentions or amounts to a shot across the judge's bows. </p> <p>The paper seems convinced that Leveson will recommend a reformed system of regulation underpinned by statute. Most, if not all, national paper publishers and editors regard this as a no-no.</p> <p>The Telegraph begins by asserting that the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, recommended Leveson to the prime minister as the right man to head an inquiry into press ethics because he - like Judge - passionately believed in a \"free press.\" But, says the paper: \"We worry that this is not the case.\"</p> <p>It does not say why it holds that suspicion. Instead, the leader reiterates arguments for self-regulation advanced by its editor, Tony Gallagher, other editors and several of the industry's senior representatives during the inquiry hearings: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is a real danger that, because some newspapers allegedly behaved in a criminal manner, efforts will be made to reduce the whole press to an emasculated cipher of high-minded opinion...</p> <p>Newspapers are not above the law \u2013 nor do they wish to be. It is widely accepted in the industry that the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) needs to be reformed \u2013 more independent members should be recruited, it should have greater power of sanction, and contractual obligations should be placed upon newspapers. It is nevertheless essential that the press remains self-regulating.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then the paper contends that \"on several occasions\" Leveson \"has signalled that he believes the reformed regulatory body needs to be underpinned by statute, and it is apparent that this view is gaining currency in political circles.\"</p> <p>In support of that argument, it points to a statement by deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during there week in which he said he would support \"proportionate\" state regulation of the press, an idea supported by Labour leaders. The leading article continues:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Since the prime minister is compromised by his personal connections to News International, it is hard to see how he will be able to resist imposing a statutory system if one is recommended in the Leveson report. It is not at all clear that he will want to.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> It says that \"once a regulatory measure, however well intentioned, is on the statute book, MPs will seek to define the public interest in law, and governments will be tempted to use the legislation to choke off dissent.\" It goes on:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Those who regard statutory regulation as an acceptable quid pro quo for state financial help do not have the interests of a free press at heart. </p> <p>This includes pressure groups that talk blithely of public subventions for 'high-quality' journalism, but that are in reality attempting to constrain the influence and reach of right-of-centre and tabloid newspapers that have traditionally opposed Labour.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And, in conclusion, the paper says that \"the most illuminating story of the conference season so far came not from a broadsheet investigation, nor from a TV interview, but from the disclosure in The Sun of Andrew Mitchell's foul-mouthed rant at police officers guarding the gates of Downing Street\u2026</p> <p>\"We are sleepwalking into a world in which such ostensibly demotic stories \u2013 which actually reveal deeper truths and spark useful national debates \u2013 will be officially frowned upon. </p> <p>\"The growing clamour for press regulation backed by statute threatens a priceless British freedom. A Conservative prime minister should have no part of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1912, the legend goes, some Ulster loyalists signed the covenant opposing Home Rule in their own blood. Almost exactly 100 years later there are fears that blood may spilled today as up to 30,000 loyalists pour into central Belfast to commemorate the mass rally at City Hall where the loyalist leader Sir Edward Carson threatened to plunge Ireland into civil war.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/26/northern-ireland-parades-commission-march?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">potential sectarian flashpoint is a route past one of the city's oldest Catholic churches </a>near the city centre, which thousands of loyalists are expected to pass later this morning.</p> <p>A last-minute legal bid to further tighten restrictions on the loyalist parade was rejected by the high court last night when a judge in Belfast refused leave for a judicial review of measures already imposed. The Parades Commission \u2013 the body that adjudicates on controversial marches \u2013 had banned loyalist bands playing sectarian tunes as they passed St Patrick's chapel on Donegall Street but some residents felt the measure did not go far enough and wanted a ban on any music near the church, with bands restricted to a single drum beat.</p> <p>The church was originally a symbol of close co-operation and mutual toleration between Belfast Catholics and Protestants in the late 18th century until the first decade of the 19th. The second Catholic church built in the city at the start of the 19th century was constructed thanks in part to the largesse of wealthy Protestants.</p> <p>Donegall Street \u2013 named after the Protestant landowner who leased the land to the Catholics for the church \u2013 is a north-south arterial route from the most divided sector of Belfast into the city centre, leading down into the post-ceasefire bohemian arts district known as the Cathedral Quarter.</p> <p>Now it has become the latest in a series of territorial battlegrounds, from Derry's ancient walls to the Presbyterian church at Drumcree in Portadown, connected with the seemingly never-ending parades disputes between loyalist marchers and nationalist residents across the north of Ireland.</p> <p>The spark that lit this recent conflagration was the behaviour of a Shankill Road loyalist marching band on 12 July \u2013 the most sacred day in the Ulster Protestant calendar. The Young Conway Volunteers were caught on video outside St Patrick's playing a sectarian tune mocking the Irish Famine.</p> <p>In response, the Parades Commission ruled that, in a subsequent loyalist parade in August, the band should not play music as they passed by the chapel. But the marching band ignored the ruling and continued playing outside the church doors, enraging local Catholics and sparking 72 hours of rioting, which left 67 police officers injured.</p> <p>With up to 30,000 loyalists expected to gather to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Ulster covenant's signing, all the focus is on a feeder parade of Orangemen and their supporters marching past St Patrick's church this morning.</p> <p>There were several flickers of hope at the end of this week when it emerged that the Orange Order had, without much prior warning or fanfare, lifted its official ban on the institution holding talks with nationalist community groups.</p> <p>The Rev Mervyn Gibson, a Belfast Orangeman, confirmed that the loyal order had changed its policy. \"We have no law in the institution that now prevents us from talking to residents groups with Sinn F\u00e9in [members] in them or anybody else in them,\" Gibson said.</p> <p>As late as Thursday afternoon, however, no direct talks had taken place between the Orange Order and the Catholic residents of Carrick Hill, the nationalist area to the right of St Patrick's, the latter complaining that up until now no dialogue had taken place between the two sides.</p> <p>Gerry Kelly, a Sinn F\u00e9in member of the Northern Ireland assembly for the area and a Stormont minister, repeated his call for the loyalist marching orders to start talking directly to the residents living around St Patrick's church. \"The residents still want dialogue and that dialogue should happen now,\" Kelly said.</p> <p>Both Sinn F\u00e9in and the Carrick Hill Residents Association later issued appeals for peaceful and dignified protests.</p> <p>Mindful of the potential for violent disorder outside his church, the Very Rev Michael Sheehan, the administrator of St Patrick's, also called for a lowering of communal temperatures. \"In the absence of local agreement, the Parades Commission has now made their determination about this parade. It is incumbent on all law-abiding citizens to adhere to their determination. In advance of the parade I would appeal for calm and respect over the coming days,\" the priest said.</p> <p>That ruling includes only hymns being played by loyalist bands as they file past St Patrick's as well as restrictions on the number of nationalist counter-demonstrators to just 150. The Parades Commission also took most of Northern Ireland by surprise in their ruling this week that Orange and loyalist bands must also only play religious music while passing by St Matthews Catholic church, beside the nationalist enclave of Short Strand in east Belfast.</p> <p>The loyalist paramilitary groups, which are observing a ceasefire, have also signalled a desire for Ulster covenant day not to descend into sectarian warfare, particularly in north Belfast where a quarter of all the deaths during the Troubles occurred between 1969 and 1997.</p> <p>A secret envoy who carried messages back and forth between the loyalist terror organisations and the Irish government in the run-up to the 1994 ceasefires has come out of retirement to help defuse tensions within loyalism.</p> <p>Chris Hudson, a Dublin-born trade unionist who has been holding talks with the loyalists over the last fortnight, told the Guardian last night that both the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had assured him that they had no interest in allowing Ulster covenant day to degenerate into sectarian disorder, possibly triggering a fresh round of civil conflict.</p> <p>\"My view is it should be much calmer this weekend unless others [republican dissidents from elsewhere] get involved. They [the UDA and UVF] accept that Sinn F\u00e9in are not using this [to foment protest] and have no interest in raising the temperature.\"</p> <p>Hudson said: \"They have assured me that they are not involved in any attempt to make the situation worse. That they have no interest in escalating matters, that they have nothing to gain.\"</p> <p>He said reports that the UVF had directed previous unrest in August from the balcony of a local Orange Hall a few hundred metres north of St Patrick's were \"nonsense\".</p>",
  "<p>Anti-ceasefire republicans have stolen up to 30 high-powered rifles with telescopic sights that can be used in sniper attacks against the security forces in Northern Ireland, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The theft of the long-range rifles has raised the spectre of a new lethal sniper campaign similar to the one the South Armagh Provisional IRA conducted that resulted in the deaths of several soldiers and policemen in the 1990s.</p> <p>A security operation is still ongoing in the Irish Republic to track down the weapons, which can hit a target from over half a mile away and are normally used to shoot deer.</p> <p>In 1997, British soldier Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick died after being hit by a high velocity bullet fired from a sniper's rifle near the border with the Republic.</p> <p>The Garda Sioch\u00e1na has confirmed that their officers in County Wicklow are investigating the theft of firearms during a break-in at a gun dealer's premises in Ashford on 8 September.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that up to 30 rifles with telescopic sights may have been taken in a highly organised robbery at the gun shop in the town. It is understood only two of the weapons taken have been recovered so far.</p> <p>Security sources in Northern Ireland say the gang behind the break-in was organised by a terror unit controlled by the late Real IRA commander in Dublin, Alan Ryan.</p> <p>He was shot dead in the same month following a dispute with armed non-political criminals in the Irish capital.</p> <p>They say the fact that almost all of the weapons are still at large is causing a major security headache on both sides of the Irish border. The guns have been handed over to a new self-styled IRA which is an amalgam of the Real IRA, Republican Action Against Drugs and various armed dissident republican units in Tyrone, Derry, Armagh and Antrim, the security forces say.</p> <p>In the Republic, Garda sources are linking raids over the last fortnight in the greater Dublin area to a desperate attempt to recover the rifles before they are smuggled across the border.</p> <p>The two guns that have been recovered were found in north Dublin a fortnight ago during a \"tailing\" operation directed at associates of Alan Ryan who have vowed to take revenge against the Dublin crime gang behind his murder.</p> <p>However, it is not expected that the long-range rifles would be used in the continuing feud between republican dissidents in Dublin and one of the city's most notorious group of gangsters.</p> <p>One man was arrested in connection with the robbery of the rifles and released after questioning. A file is being prepared for the Republic's Director of Public Prosecutions.</p> <p>Police believe the gang who broke into the shop at the Coolawinna Business Park used an electronic jamming device to disable an alarm signal from the shed used to house the business.</p> <p>Gun dealers throughout the Irish Republic are being contacted to ensure that their premises are secure.</p> <p>However, most gun dealers use conventional \"dual-com\" alarm systems which use landline telephone and GSM back-up phone signals. The robbers of the Wicklow gun dealer cut the phone line and jammed the GSM signal with the electronic blocker.</p> <p>In the past organisations such as the Real IRA have tried to smuggle in such high-powered rifles from dealers in eastern Europe but their last attempt to buy weapons in Lithuania was thwarted and two men were arrested following a \"sting\" operation involving the British secret security services.</p> <p>It is believed the dissidents have now opted for the \"safer\" option of stealing the high-powered hunting rifles, which are almost compatible with military rifles, from the legitimate Irish dealers.</p> <p>A car used in the robbery is believed to have been stolen from south Dublin in the weeks before the robbery.</p> <p>Asked about the theft of the weapons, a spokesman at Garda headquarters in Dublin said the break-in happened between 12.45am and 2.35am.</p> <p>\"It is believed at least five people were involved in the burglary, in which a number of firearms were stolen. The scene was preserved for a Garda technical examination.\"</p> <p>He said a car was stopped three days later in Dublin. \"During the course of the search Garda\u00ed discovered two firearms which had been reported stolen.\"</p> <p>A 26-year-old man was arrested and investigations were continuing to establish if the firearms were taken during the burglary.</p> <p>The Garda press office did not confirm or deny whether other weapons were still missing, or specify the number that had been stolen.</p>",
  "<p>My sheepshank isn't what it used to be. Nor is my half-hitch. I doubt the scouts would give me the camping badge these days, but I remember they taught me to \"be prepared\". That and the reef knot. For many years, I thought I could get through life knowing only those two things. But, though I plan to use the reef knots while wild camping later, I'm reminded, as I watch the back of a blue whale rise, and rise and rise, from the freezing Greenland Sea, that there are some things for which one can never be prepared.</p> <p>We're bobbing around in Skj\u00e1lfandi bay, off Husavik in chilly northern Iceland, with a trio of leviathans for company. They're alternately spouting like the Bellagio's fountains. Before we got on board, the Gentle Giants tour group had said it couldn't guarantee that we'd see whales, though with a 98% hit rate they might as well have. Even so, three blue whales is an incredible haul.</p> <p>When we can't endure the cold any longer, we head back to shore. Daniel, our guide, says he hopes we have somewhere warm to go. Teeth chattering, my partner Katy explains that, no, actually we're camping. Even though it's summer, Daniel looks at the floor, mourning our fate.</p> <p>Like most towns in Iceland, Husavik has its own campsite, but rather than snuggle in with the masses, we've opted to find a spot near the cliffs just north of town, in the vague hope of seeing more whales from the shore. I'm not sure my old scoutmaster would approve, but Iceland's laws are such that we can camp anywhere. Or almost anywhere: we must seek the permission of any farmer whose land we plan to camp on, and wild camping in national parks is forbidden.</p> <p>However, with no one to tell us otherwise in Husavik, we set up where we please, clamber in and hold each other tight, the light from the still-bright sky filtered into a pallid green by our fragile canopy.</p> <p>With a population of just 320,000 \u2013 roughly the same as Leicester \u2013 Iceland can perhaps be forgiven for not having an extensive public transport network. The bus company, BSI, does run a comfortable, if infrequent, service, but having gone whale-watching in Husavik in the afternoon, we find it impossible to travel the 35 miles to Lake Myvatn, our next destination, the same day. We decide to hitchhike the following morning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396887633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348680806700/Jamie-Lafferty-hitches-a--001.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Lafferty hitches a ride\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Lafferty hitches a ride. Photograph: Katy Morrison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweeping generalisation though it may be, people seem nice more often in Iceland: among other cheery statistics, it has the lowest murder rate in Europe. Things rarely go wrong here \u2013 even the ordinarily timid Lonely Planet recommends hitchhiking. The fact that it eases the expense of travelling around this wonderful country is a not-inconsiderable bonus, too.</p> <p>Our thumbs haven't been out too long when the lovely Emilia stops. She has thick glasses, a big smile and an even bigger laugh. It's remarkable that she's stopped for us, not least because she's surely the only person in Iceland who speaks almost no English. Even so, she seems delighted to have us in her huge Saab estate, and is determined to try out every English word she knows. From these we gather that she works for the postal service \u2026 or is going to a postbox. The post is important in some way or another.</p> <p>Emilia leaves us on Route 1, the huge ring road that approximately follows Iceland's circumference like the M25, minus 99.9% of the traffic. We've been standing in the glaring, cool sunshine, swearing and cursing those who haven't stopped, for well over an hour by the time Eidur pulls up in his battered Toyota. We're so desperate for a lift that we don't even do a cursory check to see if he's obviously a psychopath before getting in. (Are there ears hanging where the furry dice should be? No? OK.)</p> <p>He races us towards Myvatn, past weird, treeless landscapes and volcanic vents that puff little plumes of gas into the crisp air. Then as we approach the lake, Eidur begins to talk, explaining that the fishing in the area is fantastic, but too expensive for him. He's friendly after all.</p> <p>My faith in him falters only when we ask to stop just outside our destination and he answers bluntly, \"No.\" We've seen a sheltered spot excellent for camping, but Eidur explains that the entire area around Lake Myvatn has been declared a bird sanctuary. People can camp here, but they have to do it in designated areas.</p> <p>We pay ISK1,000 (\u00a35) each to set up by the lake at the Hl\u00ed\u00f0 campsite and vow to get back to nature the next day. Other than the fee, which gets us hot water and access to a gas hob, we can't complain: the site overlooks the huge lake, and violently assembled lava fields, petrified mid-eruption. The sun hasn't set by the time we fall asleep, but it gets low enough to set the lake twinkling like an ocean of sequins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396887634\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348738271747/Spectacular-Svartifoss-on-001.jpg\" alt=\"Spectacular Svartifoss, one of the most popular sites in Vatnaj\u00f6kull national park\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spectacular Svartifoss, one of the most popular sites in Vatnaj\u00f6kull national park. Photograph: Katy Morrison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The next day a combination of bus and hitching with a pair of affable Germans (themselves former hitchhikers) gets us to the picturesque port of Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. We're now in Iceland's far east, where relatively few tourists venture. Just on the edge of town we spy a serene waterfall, so we decide to take a gamble and hike up to it with all our gear. The effort is rewarded when we find a small clearing just next to the tiny pool that catches the tumbling waters.</p> <p>Later in the week, half a dozen kind drivers help us to hitchhike and wild camp around Iceland's famous \"golden circle\", all the way back to Reykjavik. Along the way we take in the calamitously clumsy puffins at the astonishing J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n glacial lagoon, and hike through part of the Vatnaj\u00f6kull national park (camping in the designated areas) but nothing beats the combination of privacy and beauty outside Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur.</p> <p>From up here the clear skies allow us to see right across town and beyond to a great fjord, while surrounding pine trees hide our location from any villagers below. It is wild and it is precarious \u2013 it's exactly what we were after. Amid purple lupins and verdant ferns we make camp, my unimpeachable reef knots holding the guy ropes tight.<br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegaHeid\"><strong>Follow Jamie on Twitter @Megaheid<br></strong></a><br><em>\u2022 The trip was provided by Visit Iceland (</em><a href=\"http://www.visiticeland.com/\" title=\"\"><em>visiticeland.com</em></a><em>).
