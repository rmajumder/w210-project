  "<p>The monarchical system dictates that the citizens of Britain, Canada, Australia and many another Commonwealth country must pick their next head of state from a shortlist of one. Will the guarantee that the king will compensate for the privilege of belonging to this shrunken gene pool by keeping out of politics hold in the reign of Charles III? Or will we find that the promise of impartiality has gone?</p> <p>There was a time when establishment voices could answer these questions with ease. Only leftwing conspiracy theorists thought the House of Windsor wielded political power, they said. Its role was to delight tourists and credulous natives with its hatches, matches and dispatches. But it never interfered in politics, which was why we enjoyed stable government and civil peace, unlike those unfortunate continentals with their dangerous republics. Although the official line was not accurate \u2013 George VI and the late Queen Mother shamed themselves with their support for the Chamberlain government's appeasement of Nazism \u2013 it was accurate enough for propaganda purposes.</p> <p>The strange and bombastic figure of Charles Windsor is now making a nonsense of Britain's former certainties. Many and varied are the ways in which he deforms those around him. In the case of the law officers, he has turned the attorney general into a walking oxymoron.</p> <p>Last week, Dominic Grieve MP QC rushed to please His Royal Highness by intervening in the due process of law. He blocked a decision by the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber to allow the public to read about Prince Charles's attempts to influence politicians and civil servants. At first, Grieve pretended that the Britain we used to know was still here. \"Within a constitutional monarchy, where the sovereign is head of state but political power is exercised through a democratically elected government, the sovereign cannot be seen to favour one political party above another or to engage in political controversy.\" Which was fair enough. In a phrase that may return to haunt him, Grieve continued: \"Inherited monarchy could not be preserved\" if the sovereign abandoned political neutrality. And that ought to be true too.</p> <p>If what he said were true now, however, there would be no difficulty in publishing Prince Charles's letters. They would be so dull \u2013 so filled with formal greetings and polite nothings \u2013 they would weary even the most obsessive collector of royal trivia. But without pausing for breath, or showing any embarrassment at the contradiction in his reasoning, the attorney general made it plain that Prince Charles's letters were anything but boring. They contained his \"deeply held personal views and beliefs\", he said. Included were \"particularly frank\" remarks about public affairs, which would make politicians unwilling to \"engage\" with him in future.</p> <p>If you think Grieve makes Prince Charles sound like a lobbyist seeking special treatment for his favoured causes, you would be right. Allowing the public to see the letters of a prince it pays for and must accept as its next head of state without a democratic vote would, the attorney decided, \"potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality\". One second, the law officer says the royals must be neutral. The next, he admits that Britain's next monarch is not neutral and the state must censor to prevent the public learning this uncomfortable fact.</p> <p>The tribunal Grieve overruled was more honest. Reading the judgment of Mr Justice Walker and his colleagues, one senses their mounting shock at how the prince has broken the conventions that kept the British state functioning. The tribunal did not order the release of genuinely private correspondence. On the contrary, it wanted the public to know only about the prince's lobbying. In this, he is as tireless as the British Bankers' Association or Unison. The prince considered himself entitled to use his access to ministers in order to \"drive forward charities and promote views\", the judges explained. They accepted that constitutional convention allows the heir to the throne to meet politicians and understand the workings of the state as part of his preparation to be king. But the prince was engaged in a \"massive extension\" of lobbying that went far beyond precedent and convention. It was a fundamental \"point of principle\" that lobbying by the heir to the throne \"cannot have constitutional status\", the tribunal concluded. Therefore, his future subjects should know what interests and causes the prince was pursuing in private.</p> <p>My <em>Guardian</em> colleague Rob Evans asked officials to release the records. Tellingly, however, the tribunal was so concerned that on its own initiative, and without any prompting from the press, it decided to collect everything that was publicly known about the prince's political meddling. <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/evans-v-IC-ukut_AAC_.pdf\" title=\"\">Now we have it all in one place</a>. The rantings about architecture, which meant that by the early 1990s the <em>Telegraph</em> was complaining that the prince had an effective veto on new projects; the reactionary attacks on the Human Rights Act, which forced a Labour lord chancellor to tell him: \"I do not see how discouraging people from enforcing their rights could result in a more responsible society\"; the ultra-reactionary embrace of every variety of quackery and crankiness that led to his campaigns against foods that might feed the hungry and medicines that might heal the sick; and the babbling mysticism that produced his declaration that humanity took a wrong turn when Galileo showed that the Earth went round the sun.</p> <p>I could go on, but when we have before us a prince who has not come to terms with the Renaissance, let alone the Enlightenment, the point is surely made. The danger in every hereditary system is that the nepotistic principle will eventually throw up a man wholly unsuited for the role tradition assigns him. For Britain's constitutional monarchy, Charles Windsor is that man. When Jonathan Dimbleby interviewed him on bended knee in the 1990s, and in more recent interviews with <em>Vanity Fair</em>, Charles stated that he does not intend to abide by the convention that he should stay out of politics. If his parents wanted him to rise above politics when he became king \"that's their bad luck\".</p> <p>It is not republicans who should worry about his coronation \u2013 as I have said before, we can't wait \u2013 but monarchists. One day, maybe soon, they will have to explain to an embarrassed British public and a mocking world why they went to such lengths to censor the unavoidable truth that nine out of 10 people you pass in the street would make a better constitutional monarch than HRH, Prince of Wales.</p>",

  "<p>Some people just march to the beat of a&nbsp;different drummer. David Longstreth, benign dictator of Brooklyn art darlings Dirty Projectors, is in thrall to&nbsp;one who sounds as if they have six arms \u2013 a kind of Hindu deity trying to play to a sticking click track.</p> <p>Longstreth and his six-strong band are spooling out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4GIxwYQB3w\" title=\"\">See What She Seeing</a>, a love song from their latest album, July's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/08/dirty-projectors-swing-magellan-review\" title=\"\"><em>Swing Lo Magellan</em></a>, to a sold-out crowd. It's regulated, more or less, by one thin swish from the drummer, plus the sound of knucklebones falling&nbsp;down wooden stairs, the wayward wooze of Longstreth's own vocal melody and some drum pad patterns. Nevertheless, there are girls at the sides of the audience, dancing \u2013 some to the swish, some to the singing,&nbsp; some even to the knucklebones. Everyone else is riveted to the spot.</p> <p>Seven albums old, Dirty Projectors are brimming with these fiendish trigonometric grooves and much else besides to furrow the brow of even the most cerebral music lover. They are heroes to the kind of people for whom tricksy jazzers Radiohead are just bland arena rock.</p> <p>Longstreth's guitar lines shimmer, most often, from the heat of West Africa; you can tell he heard Talking Heads at a formative age. But Longstreth is on a mission to sound like&nbsp;nothing else around, daring people&nbsp;to keep up. Frequently the Projectors' three astounding female&nbsp;vocalists will sing harmonies that start out like early church music,&nbsp;slide into calculated atonality (as on Wittenberg&nbsp;IV) and end up as girl-group R&amp;B. That they do so while&nbsp;playing guitar (Amber Coffman), keyboards (Olga Bell) and drum pads&nbsp;(Haley Dekle) is just another reason to gawp, open-mouthed, at Dirty Projectors' prowess.&nbsp;They really&nbsp;are amazing.</p> <p>Hilariously, <em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>, from which tonight's set is largely drawn, is billed as Dirty Projectors' most accessible album. The recently released 20-minute long-form <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vncbG-QJlng&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">video</a> that accompanies it, however, retains the band's signature \"whuh?\" factor, one formed over roughly a decade. <em>Bitte Orca</em>, their 2009 effort, hauled the Projectors into&nbsp;the spotlight, after years of blog buzz celebrating Longstreth's high-concept&nbsp;projects.</p> <p>The most entertaining of these warm-ups was 2007's <em>Rise Above</em>, in which the Projectors on duty at the time reimagined punk band Black Flag's <em>Damaged \u2013</em> from memory. Needless to say, the DPs embroidered&nbsp;wildly on the original songs, creating <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biLrX4YPmAk\" title=\"\">chamber pop chorales</a> where before there were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fsbvo5GVK10\" title=\"\">brutalist shoutalongs</a>. Subsequent stints with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YML_-zi_Dc\" title=\"\">David Byrne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mountwittenbergorca.com/\" title=\"\">Bj\u00f6rk</a> confirmed the Projectors as prime movers in the Brooklyn art-rock renaissance.</p> <p><em>Swing Lo Magellan</em>, though, adds songs about basic things such as love and fear to Longstreth's canon of wilful density. There are tunes that even cleave close to convention. They open tonight with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESuURUKAf-4\" title=\"\">title track</a>, a gentle lope that imagines the Portuguese explorer setting off into the unknown.</p> <p>At times it's as though Longstreth is trying to be superficial for sport. If there's a brave shampoo company out there in need of an advert soundtrack, it needs look no further than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0LQVwpTqPM\" title=\"\">The Socialites</a> \u2013 sung by the long-tressed Coffman \u2013 which goes on and on about how lovely a girl's hair is.</p> <p>Showmanship isn't an entirely alien concept to Dirty Projectors. Longstreth's guitar solo on No Intention has the joyous stuff of rock piggery to it. But their live show remains a frustrating spectacle. Longstreth, as should be clear by now, is the sort of creative who doesn't suffer fools gladly. The album's promotional campaign was studded with interviews in which he just bristled, hating the repetitiveness of it all. He is not the type to privilege entertainment, or even showmanship, over the inspiration of awe.</p> <p>But music is by nature repetitive, and over the course of an hour and a half you long for a groove to settle. You&nbsp;want to love them as well as admire them, but it's like trying to hug a porcupine.</p> <p>The gig's die-for moments occur when the lights on stage come up and blaze brightly, in tandem with Coffman, Dekle and Bell's harmonies, if that's what we should call them. The&nbsp;vocals on Gun Has No Trigger and Useful Chamber aren't girly folk trills by any stretch. They blare, gloriously, like trumpets; the lights scorch your eyes as their voices oversaturate your ears.</p>",
  "<p>What an incisive, fervent beginning. Indhu Rubasingham takes over with panache at the Tricycle, bowing to the theatre's politically engaged tradition but giving it a sharp new turn.</p> <p>During Nicolas Kent's 28-year reign the Tricycle's glory was its tremendous tribunal dramas: transparently acted revelatory documentaries. <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/current-programme-pages/theatre/theatre-programme-main/red-velvet/\" title=\"\"><strong>Red Velvet</strong></a>, based on the life of the African American actor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/oct/07/red-velvet-tricycle-lester-chakrabarti-rubasingham-interview\" title=\"\">Ira Aldridge</a>, also puts prejudice \u2013 racial and sexual \u2013 on trial, but it does so with imaginative flourishes, and extends its inquiry beyond the obviously political. Lolita Chakrabarti's play has a towering central performance from Adrian Lester. Rubasingham's production glows.</p> <p>Aldridge's story is compelling and dismaying. Taking over as Othello when Edmund Kean keeled over on the stage of Covent Garden in 1833, he was subjected to stinking racism by semi-evolved critics \u2013 \"his features, though African, are considerably humanised\" \u2013 and to sidling contempt by those who claimed that casting him as the Moor was like casting a fat man as Falstaff: the transformative powers of acting were being denied. He was withdrawn from the play. He went on to tour the world but never acted again in London.</p> <p>Chakrabarti's fresh and sparky, if sometimes sketchy play, with its spine of historical fact and its imaginary limbs, uses the green room and the stage to light up the globe. As offstage protests about the abolition of slavery mount, one actor eschews sugar on political grounds, while in the background a Jamaican maid sits waiting to be bossed. A very funny scene shows one actor convulsed by the difficulty of announcing to his colleagues that the unseen new lead is \u2013 actually \u2013 black. As Aldridge struggles to bring reality to stage encounters, he is enveloped in an extraordinary tableau of 19th-century gestural theatre: hands shade eyes and cup ears; arms wave in the air like multiple tarantulas.</p> <p>In Tom Piper's design, smoke drifts across a beautiful gilt proscenium arch and looped red velvet curtains; Oliver Fenwick's rosy lighting encloses and intensifies the action. There is a virtuoso performance from Rachel Finnegan, making her professional debut as, alternately, an eager Polish journo, a slightly stiff wife and an awkward ingenue. There is unwavering magnificence from Lester. Eager, strong and reverberating as a young man, he thickens and halts in disappointed maturity. Finally, bent and cross, he prepares to play King Lear \u2013 by whiting up. Next year Lester will take on Othello at the National. That will be unmissable.</p> <p>\"To act it is to kill it,\" Samuel Beckett said of his 1956 radio play <a href=\"http://www.jermynstreettheatre.co.uk/whatson.html\" title=\"\"><strong>All That Fall</strong></a>. He did not want it put on stage, but this is not the first time his wish has been thwarted on a technicality \u2013 and no one who has a ticket for Trevor Nunn's already sold-out production is going to regret the disobedience.</p> <p>This is little-known but prime Beckett. On the plot of a woman (\"church-going, rheumatic and childless\") making a laborious journey to meet her blind husband is hung a disquisition on the melancholy of life \u2013 what is unforgettably called its \"shrouding\" \u2013 and thoughts on the slipperiness of language. This must be the only play that contains both a reference to Grimm's law and the idea that a character might eavesdrop on his own speech.</p> <p>To meet the restrictions imposed by the Beckett estate, the drama is staged as if a radio play were being recorded: microphones hang from the ceiling; the cast read from scripts; there is minimal movement. You would not want more. The language is rich, waxing as it speaks of waning. Beckett's sound effects populate the stage with the rural Ireland of his childhood (several characters have names based on people he knew in his youth): there is crowing, dragging, mooing, sucking, ringing, baaing, parping.</p> <p>In a strong cast Michael Gambon and Eileen Atkins, last seen on stage together in another train-based drama (Yasmina Reza's <em>The Unexpected Man</em>) 14 years ago, are so commanding and intricate that they deliver a wealth of action in a tiny area. Gambon brings a baleful spleneticism, that wounded beast quality in which he specialises, to the part of the husband who may have a terrible secret to unleash. Atkins, the linchpin of the play, shows the mighty miniaturism that has made her one of the most important actors of the past 50 years. She can turn a line by a flick of an eyelid, set up a ripple of irony by a slackening of her jaw; every line is given a doleful clarity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398067597\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350668537350/all-that-fall-jermyn-010.jpg\" alt=\"all that fall jermyn\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Gambon and Eileen Atkins in All That Fall: \u2018commanding and intricate\u2019.  Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The switch from audio to visual entails some loss. The sound effects become more illustrative than informative. Some radio wryness \u2013 what is it to feature a blind man in a medium that no one sees? \u2013 is diminished. Nunn's showmanship occasionally gets the better of him, not least with a bad cut-out car. Yet anyone interested in acting and speech will want to see this. It must surely find a life beyond the enterprising little Jermyn.</p> <p>It is more intriguing than satisfying to watch Sean Holmes's revival of the seldom-seen <a href=\"http://www.lyric.co.uk/whats-on/production/desire-under-the-elms/\" title=\"\"><strong>Desire Under the Elms</strong></a>. Eugene O'Neill's 1924 play is intermittently powerful but often awkward and overblown, as if a sad solo voice were hollering out the Ring Cycle. In transplanting the Phaedra myth \u2013 man falls for mother-in-law and all hell breaks loose \u2013 it swerves from the hokey to the plangent, from the terrifying to the ridiculous, and ends on a note of true sadness. Holmes's production matches these shifts: sometimes rapt and sometimes ironic it shows both meltdown and hoedown, with bendy hats, big beards, much yelping in unison and tragic disintegration. Ian MacNeil's design features one of those small-scale houses that he has used to startling effect in <em>An Inspector Calls</em> and, more recently, <em>A Doll's House</em>. This one, more wendy house than farmhouse, is less appropriate: the little rooms \u2013 on a different scale to the play's sonorous language \u2013 that slip around the stage to the sound of a slide guitar are far too spick and span.</p> <p>Finbar Lynch brings a fine, weary-voiced gravity to bear on the part of the growling paterfamilias: he looks and sounds like someone who has preaching in his bones, though a large part of his dialogue is taken up with growling. Still, the revelation is Denise Gough. She has been arresting before \u2013 as a prostitute in <em>The Painter</em>, and earlier this year as a gangling, disruptive nanny in <em>Our New Girl</em>. Now she spreads her wings as a fatal attraction: wheedling, sassy, desperate, true. She has a light touch and a big future.</p>",
  "<p>It is two years this month since my mother died, which may seem a gloomy way to start a column called the Happy Eater but it really isn't. Of course there is loss. But with time, memory brings a certain sweetness, too; if you live a life at the table and had my mother, well then, there are more than enough cues for good memories. She was the one who taught me how to eat. Not so much in the functional sense, although there was that; we have to learn our table skills somewhere. It lay more in enthusiasm. Both my parents had endured childhoods of little rather than plenty and they were determined to banish all of that from their own kids' lives. A full table was not merely a mark of appetite. It was a victory.</p> <p>There was, when we were growing up, a simple rule in our house, one that now operates in mine: you cannot say you don't like something unless you have tried it. This came in handy when the naughtiness of adolescence came my way \u2013 I was only trying to find out whether I liked it \u2013 but as a kid it opened the doorway to all manner of fun. It was my mum who showed me how to eat my first oyster, grinning from ear to ear as the accessories piled up around us: the frame for the tray of ice, the tiny flat two-pronged fork, the muslin-wrapped lemon, the shallot vinegar and Tabasco. Dress it as you will, she said. Check it's been released from its sticking place on the shell with the fork then, whoosh, down the hatch in one. Chew if you like, but not too much. Try it with a sip of this Sancerre. Sniff it. Smells a bit like cat's wee doesn't it. But doesn't it work well with the oyster. Yes, mother, it does.</p> <p>She adored the theatre and any food which came with a bit of that was OK with her; even better, if it required strict instructions. She loved steak tartare, but needed to be asked how piquant she wanted it, and would brighten further if the final mixing of the egg yolk into the chopped beef happened tableside. Although she wasn't especially fond of snails in their butter-slicked shells, she understood why I loved them, and took pleasure in showing me how to hold the tongs, wrist loose, grip just so. A few years ago I lost a bet with her; the winnings were lunch at the Fat Duck on me. I wasn't sure she would like it. For years she had been a regular amid the red velvet plush and certainties of Rules, the oldest restaurant in London with its brass trim and menu of game; when the Wolseley opened and proved itself reliable at the Mitteleuropean schtick she quickly embraced it. They did a good steak tartare there. As did the Ivy, though Sheekey's was the place for oysters.</p> <p>So what would she make of Heston Blumenthal's exuberant modernist fancies? I had no idea. But if the Fat Duck is anything it is pure theatre: the moment the waiter bathed the foamed green tea palate cleanser in liquid nitrogen, the vapours rolling out across the table, she was sold. Not that she was overly impressed by the gloss and shine of that world. True luxury didn't need spin, she said. One night a few years ago my wife and I met my parents for dinner. On the menu my mother spotted \"lobster and chips\". She nodded slowly, in recognition. \"Now that,\" she said, \"is class.\" We both ordered it and sat, side by side, bibs in place, the emptied shells piling up around us as we worked. We were happy. My mother was right.</p>",
  "<p>Hidden away on the bookshelf belonging to our young chef of the year, among the glossy works on the food of Alain Ducasse and Gordon Ramsay, is one volume which is very much older than all the others. It was given to Adam Smith by his grandmother when he first enrolled on a cookery course at college. It was given to her by her own mother \u2013 Smith's great-grandmother \u2013 who in turn had received it in 1927, when she first became the owner of an oven. \"It's full of old English dishes like rabbit stew and boiled tongue and brisket,\" Smith says. \"That's where I got the inspiration for the salt beef dish that's now on the menu.\"</p> <p>The story tells you an awful lot about Smith who, at just 24, is a senior sous chef at the Ritz Hotel in London. It means he runs the pass at the hotel's flagship restaurant, one of the last bastions of grand classical French cooking in the capital.</p> <p>Other young cooks may be attempting to make a name for themselves by running pop-ups offering deluxe burgers, or joints serving pimped-up southern fried chicken. Smith, meanwhile, is more interested in food with a bit of lineage, like his great-grandmother's salt beef, which is served as a starter with smoked celeriac, slow-cooked egg yolk and truffle. \"Some people think the word classical is a negative,\" he says. \"But if a flavour combination is 100 years old it's got to have something going for it.\"</p> <p>Smith, a solid chap with the serious demeanour of a man used to working 16-hour shifts without seeing daylight, started at the Ritz just days before his 17th birthday. He had been recommended to executive chef John Williams by his college tutor, along with a couple of fellow pupils. The others were quickly gone; Smith stayed. \"Adam's a very special young lad,\" Williams says. \"He's very serious about his job and very balanced. He's probably the best I've had working under me in my 37-year career.\"</p> <p>No surprise then that he recently won the Roux scholarship, the cooking competition run by the family behind Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn. \"You could just see he was a true professional,\" says Michel Roux Jnr, one of the competition's judges. \"And his food was perfect.\" The Michelin-starred chef Simon Hulstone, of the Elephant in Torquay, who nominated Smith for the OFM award after he worked with him in Britain's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/13/bocuse-lyon-cooking-chefs-contest\" title=\"\">Bocuse D'Or cooking competition team</a>, agrees. \"God, but he can cook,\" he says. \"He does have a very classical background but he also uses a&#xa0;lot of modern techniques.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397913086\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/17/121017adamsmithYCotY-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/17/121017adamsmithYCotY-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/17/121017adamsmithYCotY_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/17/121017adamsmithYCotY_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121017adamsmithYCotY/121017adamsmithYCotY.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Despite the vintage cookbook given to him by his grandmother, Smith says he didn't have a foodie background. He grew up on a&#xa0;council estate in Birmingham and his dad worked in the car industry. \"I wanted some cash in my school holidays so I blagged a job as a pot washer in a pub kitchen when I was 12,\" he says. \"At first it was a bit uncomfortable but quickly I became a part of the team.\" He decided the kitchen was a place that suited him, and went from there to the college cookery courses. \"But I was just itching to get to work.\" He leapt at the chance to join the Ritz where he started on the larder as the lowliest of the low and simply slogged his way up. Now he's the one training the young recruits.</p> <p>Asked to pick one dish from the Ritz restaurant menu which sums up what he likes cooking he points to a venison wellington, with foie gras, truffles, a rich jus and smoked parsnips. \"The execution and presentation are very modern,\" he says, \"but it's also a very classical dish.\"</p> <p>So what of the future? Just after we spoke he was going to Paris to work in the kitchens of Michelin three-star chef Yannick All\u00e9no at Le Meurice, as part of his<a href=\"http://www.rouxscholarship.co.uk/index.php\" title=\" Roux scholarship\"> Roux scholarship</a> prize. And after that? \"At some point I'd like to do my own thing, ideally a country house hotel with a limited number of rooms.\" But media stardom doesn't appeal. Refreshingly, he just wants to cook. \"I like being in my own world,\" he says, \"on this side of the restaurant door,\" indicating the hotel kitchens. Adam Smith has found the thing he loves. He's found where he belongs. And he's staying there.</p> <p><em>The Ritz London, 150 Piccadilly, London W1J 9BR; 020 7493 8181; </em><a href=\"http://www.theritzlondon.com/\" title=\"theritzlondon.com\"><em>theritzlondon.com</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Dover, turbot and Dory, a trilogy of deliciousness,\" Nigel grins as he shows off the fish he has bought in Brixham market that morning. It is still only 8am and Mitch Tonks and I are on our way to breakfast on Tonks's vote for the \"best fish you will ever eat\". But first we have to buy it. Luckily, Nigel does much of the dealing for Tonks's <a href=\"http://www.seahorserestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"Seahorse restaurant \">Seahorse restaurant </a>in neighbouring Dartmouth and he is pleased with this morning's market haul.</p> <p>\"A good bit of fish, all yours, Tonksy,\" he laughs (most everyone in south Devon is given an added honorific \"y\" on their name), as he lifts the lids on boxes of shining bass. Tonks has lately converted to the superiority of these larger fish, 5kg to 6kg each, pulled from local waters, scales gleaming as they catch the late summer light. We admire exquisite mossy, mottled turbot, to be served later in the Seahorse with hollandaise. \"Every time we get turbot we put on hollandaise,\" says Tonks. \"A bit on your fish, a bit in a sauceboat, a little bit piquant.\" Perfect pink squid will be \"grilled over the fire\" in the restaurant this evening, but for now we have our eyes on breakfast. Tonks picks out a couple to add to the John Dory that is being filleted for us.</p> <p>A box of brilliant green samphire from Brittany catches his interest and he adds it to his order. As we are leaving, we spy another box. Beautiful plaice, sweet, firm and fat, is also swiftly filleted for us. Our destination is the market's Fishermen's Mission, where our \"catch\" will be cooked on the plancha, and where for a celebration day, the Seahorse team may \"cut a 10kg turbot\".</p> <p>It is true, as Mitch Tonks says, that the Fishermen's Mission food is as good as any fish breakfast you will ever eat \u2013 simply cooked, freshly plucked from the sea, served piping hot with tea, surrounded by fishermen and their families (unusual this, as many are notoriously indifferent to eating their catch). But Tonks is being modest. According to the 2013 <em>Good Food Guide</em>, the Seahorse he runs with his best friend and fellow cook Mat Prowse is the best seafood place in the UK. But, more importantly, it is also OFM readers' choice for your restaurant of the year.</p> <p>While we share our breakfast squid, Tonks tells me about his relationship with Prowse and the perfect little restaurant they run together on the south Devon coast. \"Matty and I have been best friends since '98,\" he says. \"We are right arm and left arm, he is my closest friend in the world, a lovely cook, we are lucky in that we know what each other is thinking when it comes to food.\"</p> <p>Before they lost control of their Fish Works mini-empire (the company grew too fast), Tonks and Prowse daydreamed about one day opening a little place by the sea, \"though maybe not quite yet\". Then Tonks heard of an old pizza site becoming available on the quay at Dartmouth where he holidayed as a child and instinctively knew this was it (typically, Prowse took a little more persuading before moving south with his wife and four children).</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397911378\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/17/121017Seahorse-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/17/121017Seahorse-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121017Seahorse/121017Seahorse.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/17/121017Seahorse_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/17/121017Seahorse_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>On walking into the Seahorse, you are struck by a timeless, effortless quality: beautifully lit, classic seafood prints, although there is also a Tracey Emin. The glassed-off kitchen looks for all the world like a fish tank. This openness, where customers can see the cooks and vice versa, is important. \"I always watch for the first forkful of food if I can,\" says Tonks. \"As soon as you see the first smile, you know that table is OK.\"</p> <p>The menu is a seafood lover's tour of Europe's great fish dishes. There's an \"antipasti\" of creamy bacalao. Starters include a crisp fry of cuttlefish and a striking octopus carpaccio (in winter, the octopus will be served in a stew with waxy potatoes). Mains include smoky red mullet from the bay.</p> <p>It is the kind of great fish restaurant you'd hope to find (but likely wouldn't) in France, Spain or Italy, and easy to see why in 2009 the <em>Times</em>'s critic Giles Coren said he'd been served \"the best meal I have had all year\".</p> <p>Partly, of course, this is because of cleverly cooked, spanking fresh fish, but it's also because Tonks and Prowse are old-school restaurateurs, where hospitality is as important as the food. \"We have 40 covers and 11 staff in a small seaside restaurant,\" says Tonks. \"We are sometimes over-generous with drinks, we make our own limoncello and give it away, we'll run a boat service with calvados for when the ferry has closed. It is everything to us that our customers feel special.</p> <p>\"We worry the life out of our team, every day,\" he smiles. \"And when we heard about the award, all those days polishing the silver, washing the steps, were suddenly worthwhile.\"</p> <p>Giant herring gulls are circling, screaming overhead. Satisfied, we pay our \u00a32.50 to the Fishermen's Mission (don't tell everyone or you'll ruin it), and step out into the Brixham sun. All around us, Britain's biggest fishing port is busy. Fish, clams, scallops, crab are being prepared and packed for London, France, Italy, Spain, but the very best is heading just a few miles west to a small quayside place in Dartmouth. <em>The Seahorse, 5 South Embankment, Dartmouth TQ6 9BH; 01803 835 147; </em><a href=\"http://www.seahorserestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"seahorserestaurant.co.uk\"><em>seahorserestaurant.co.uk</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond has accused Labour of forging a destructive alliance with the \"Lord Snooties\" of the Tory party to undermine the welfare system as he seeks to galvanise his party for a difficult, two-year campaign to win independence.</p> <p>In a combative speech at the Scottish National party conference in Perth on Saturday, Salmond said that both Labour and the Tories had become allies in a \"death-grip programme\" to roll back the social and political gains of devolution.</p> <p>He claimed that only independence could protect and build on those gains, which had seen Scotland introduce free care for the elderly, free prescriptions and free university places \u2013 policies now being threatened by the Tories and Labour.</p> <p>In one of a series of quips at the expense of chancellor George Osborne, who on Friday was chastised for refusing to pay for a first-class train ticket, Salmond said: \"Westminster would put this first-class nation in the second-class carriages. No more second best for Scotland.\"</p> <p>The first minister, in a comparatively sober message to party activists, began his speech by conceding that the independence campaign faced a challenge in convincing a majority of Scots to support leaving the UK. He said their task was to convert support for greater devolution into support for independence.</p> <p>\"What we strive for as the government of a devolved Scotland, we can achieve as the government of an independent Scotland,\" he said. \"With devolution, day after day, year after year, we can take small steps forward, when what Scotland needs is bigger, bolder strides. It is time for Scotland to move up a gear.\"</p> <p>Earlier last week, as Salmond signed a historic deal with David Cameron in Edinburgh to hold an independence referendum in late 2014, a series of opinion polls disclosed that support for independence has slumped to about 30%, with opposition growing to 58%.</p> <p>He attempted to reposition the debate about independence by staking out a claim for the votes of the majority of Scots who support greater devolution instead of independence, who would vote to increase the Scottish parliament's powers while remaining in the UK.</p> <p>Salmond said the independence movement had to persuade those voters that leaving the UK would deliver those greater powers, while defending devolution and Scotland's social democratic traditions against attacks from the pro-UK parties.</p> <p>Several times in his address, he sought to redefine the independence referendum as simply one step on a longer journey. \"We seek independence for a reason. It is not for me. It is not for this party. It is for new opportunity for every person in Scotland watching today. Independence is about family and future. It is for a more equal Scotland, the opportunity to change our nation for good,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier Salmond's opponents in the pro-UK Better Together campaign had released their own polling data, gathered by YouGov, which they said showed a \"lack of confidence\" among supporters of independence.</p> <p>The poll found that although 31% of Scots supported independence \u2013 a figure which is very close to three other negative polls on independence last week, only 16% of voters \"strongly supported\" independence. The remainder \"tend to support\" it. By contrast, 37% of the 56% of voters who opposed independence \"strongly\" opposed it.</p> <p>Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said Salmond was talking \"nonsense\" by claiming Scotland would \"at a stroke be better off with independence when he knows it would push costs up\".</p> <p>Under Salmond's plans, an independent Scotland would allow the Bank of England to control its interest rates and monetary policy, while failing to explain how free personal care and a council tax freeze could be funded as costs escalate in future.</p> <p>\"This is a man who believes in cheap slogans but won't fund the policy behind them,\" she said. \"Alex Salmond won't end the nonsense because he can't be straight with the Scottish people.\"</p>",
  "<p>A last-minute legal challenge has dealt a fresh blow to the government's increasingly troubled cull of badgers in England, the <em>Observer</em> has learned.</p> <p>The Badger Trust's lawyers have served <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2012/oct/22/badger-trust-letter-halt-cull\">a 16-page legal letter</a> on Natural England, the government agency licensing the culling, which could halt the cull. \"The costs of the cull are soaring out of control, with little benefit in sight for farmers and major risks posed for members of the public in the cull areas,\" said Gwendolen Morgan, the trust's solicitor at Bindmans LLP. \"It is time for the government to reconsider.\"</p> <p>The delayed cull now appears at serious risk of being abandoned, for this year at least. On Thursday it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that the number of badgers in the cull areas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\">was up to twice initial estimates</a>, presenting a much greater challenge to farmers already said to be deeply concerned by rising costs and complications.</p> <p>Environment secretary Owen Paterson and farming minister David Heath added to the confusion by cancelling a series of media interviews. Whitehall sources compared the chaotic situation to <em>The Thick of It</em>. One said: \"Paterson and No 10 have had to persuade the National Farmers' Union to continue with the cull to avoid another U-turn.\"</p> <p>Ministers argue that the badger cull is an essential part of efforts to curb rising tuberculosis infections in cattle, which saw 26,000 cattle slaughtered in 2011 at a cost to taxpayers of \u00a390m.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the National Farmers' Union both insisted yesterday that the badger cull would proceed as soon as possible.</p> <p>On Friday, NFU president Peter Kendall <a href=\"http://www.farmersguardian.com/nfu-committed-to-badger-cull-despite-badger-number-concerns/50655.article\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a> the difficulties facing the cull: \"We are working bloody hard to make sure this is deliverable. The latest numbers are making this more challenging.\"</p> <p>The new legal letter is an \"urgent pre-action protocol letter\", which gives NE a final chance to address the trust's concerns before the latter seeks a judicial review \u2013 and an injunction, if needed \u2014 to halt the cull. The letter has effectively put a temporary stop on the cull.</p> <p>\"We have now had information which reveals a number of serious flaws in the licensing process,\" writes Morgan. \"We have advised our clients that the licences granted are unlawful.\"</p> <p>The Trust argues that the public's legal right to safety is put at risk by the fact that no barriers or warnings will be posted around the cull areas, meaning people using publicly accessible land could walk into the shooting area.</p> <p>A Natural England spokesman for said: \"We are considering the letter and will respond in due course.\"He confirmed the final licence conditions had yet to be met by the cullers but could be fulfilled at any time, meaning badgers could begin to be killed immediately.As winter approaches, time is fast running out for the cull to begin because badgers lie low in their setts in the cold weather. Farmers must kill at least 70% of all the badgers over six weeks because otherwise escaping badgers spread TB further and increase infections.</p> <p>Previous legal action by the Badger Trust halted a planned cull in Wales.</p> <p>The Trust also argues that the spiralling costs of the cull mean NE has a duty to carry out a new cost impact assessment.</p> <p>On Friday, it was <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121018/text/121018w0001.htm#12101855001267\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that the government had to spend \u00a3850,000 surveying badger numbers after the data supplied by landowners was found to be inadequate. The government's initial assessment already showed that the cull will cost more than it saves. The Trust is also concerned that the method of killing the badgers allowed in the policy is being changed.</p> <p>The cull was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">described</a> as \"mindless\" by one of the 32 eminent scientists who wrote to the Observer last week, demanding its cancellation. The issue has driven the largest animal rights protest since fox hunting was banned in 2004.</p> <p>More than 150,000 people signed a Downing Street website petition and won a six-hour parliamentary debate next Thursday, the first such in the Commons. The government will have to vote down a motion to halt the cull.</p>",
  "<p>Tuesday's football match in Krusevac should have been a regular game. Serbians were more preoccupied with another match, in the Macedonian capital Skopje, where Serbia needed to win to stay on track for World Cup qualification. The Under-21 match against England was the sideshow.</p> <p>The town of Krusevac was chosen to host the match by the Serbian football association, the FSS. It knew the game would sell out, not because there was much enthusiasm in the rest of Serbia for the match, but because there is so little else to do in Krusevac.</p> <p>Except for the local football team \u2013 owned by the son of the controversial tycoon Miroslav Miskovic \u2013 there is nothing much in the town: a few bars, two companies and lot of unemployed people.</p> <p>If the events of the last week are surprising, that is why. Krusevac is not known to host football hooligans or any group of extremists. If it is known at all, for most Serbs, it is as a town you pass on the road to the ski resort at Kopaonik.</p> <p>There was another reason for the football authorities not to expect trouble. Extremist fans in Serbia historically have had little interest in the national team \u2013 unlike in Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia or Montenegro. Instead they have gravitated to the Belgrade clubs \u2013 Red Star and Partizan.</p> <p>However, what happened on Tuesday has left both teams facing disciplinary action from Fifa, the sport's international governing body. England's black players were subjected to racist abuse during the game, and the midfielder Danny Rose was also targeted with monkey chants after he was sent off at the final whistle for kicking the ball into the crowd.</p> <p>Missiles were thrown at the players and violent scenes erupted after the match, with members of the Serbian team and coaching staff allegedly assaulting their English counterparts, including the assistant manager, Steve Wigley, and the goalkeeping coach, Martin Thomas.</p> <p>At the root of the problem are the contradictions in Serbian society, faced as it is with the demands of EU membership which have demonstrated, once again, that Serbia's institutions still do not understand the meaning and importance of adopting international standards.</p> <p>Here in Serbia, people like to think that we are unique in every way. We have our own culture, history and way of life. We have our sense of importance in world history. Nikola Tesla pioneered the use of alternating current in electricity and thus helped to create the 20th century as we know it.</p> <p>Since the overthrow of our strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, the Butcher of the Balkans, in October 2000, we have stood at the entrance of the EU, asking ourselves what we need to do as a society to be part of a political grouping that we feel we belong to both geographically and culturally.</p> <p>We've been taught by our leaders that the EU is something which belongs to us. That it is waiting for us and that it will make available billions of euros.</p> <p>And from the beginning of that process, we have been told that to join the club we need to implement new ways of thinking and understanding.</p> <p>We have been told: yes, we understand the importance of your history but you must try to cultivate your institutions and organise the life of your people; adjust your priorities to EU standards.</p> <p>We have been told too we must confront our recent past: reconcile with our enemies from the region, arrest warlords, promote tolerance and understanding, and open institutions to marginalised groups and ethnic minorities.</p> <p>We have to fight corruption and organised crime, implement civil control over the army and state security agencies, and try those involved in war crimes in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.</p> <p>Football \u2013 and attitudes associated with football \u2013 cannot be exempted from the issues confronting us.</p> <p>The only kind of support that the FSS cares about is the sort that is delivered in a thundering voice with continuous singing and chanting, because in that kind of atmosphere our team seems to have one more player on the pitch, and victory for the nation is secured.</p> <p>That has meant a wide acceptance that we should do everything we can to win, even if it means intimidating and infuriating the opposing team with monkey chants \u2013 rationalised as acceptable because \"this is only a football game\".</p> <p>It is precisely this that saw ordinary supporters \u2013 the normal men in Krusevac who went to the stadium with their children like fans everywhere in Europe \u2013 become \"extremist\" supporters. Because that is what has come to be regarded as normal.</p> <p>The reality is that our institutions have never really wanted to confront the root causes of hooliganism and violence at sporting events, because extremist fans with nationalist attitudes became institutionalised in Serbian society in the 1990s.</p> <p>The Delije \u2013 or \"heroes\" \u2013 the Red Star \"ultras\", were infamously co-opted under the command of Arkan, the former head of the supporters' club, into the paramilitary Tigers who carried out war crimes in Bosnia, including ethnic cleansing, at the behest of nationalist politicians and officials.</p> <p>After the wars from the breakup of Yugoslavia were over, they became part of organised crime groups. Today they are a reservoir for all far-right organisations and political parties. Hooligan groups were involved in violence on the streets of Belgrade in 2004 when the mosque was set on fire. They were also at the forefront of the burning of the US embassy in Belgrade in 2008, when Kosovo declared its independence.</p> <p>It was members of these groups who in 2010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/11/gay-pride-serbia-progress\" title=\"\">attacked the police who had tried to secure Belgrade's gay pride march</a>.</p> <p>But there is a second key issue. If our political institutions have not tried to deal with the phenomenon of football hooliganism, nor have they been able to confront the racism associated with it. Politicians and institutions do not condemn racism \u2013 and the related violence \u2013 because people will not applaud that. Condemning racism is not regarded as a popular position.</p> <p>In part that is because \u2013 with so few immigrants in Serbia \u2013 racism is not seen as a social problem.</p> <p>When there are initiatives by politicians that mention racism at sporting events, they have tended to be ineffective at changing the general attitude.</p> <p>It is an attitude that, perhaps, explains why last week's events have been seen in a different way in Serbia to outside. Many Serbs might consider the supporters' behaviour in Krusevac as \"provocation\" but cannot see it as \"racist\".</p> <p>It is a cultural xenophobia rooted in our recent history whose narrative says: we were forced to defend ourselves. We did not start it. We were drawn into a quarrel we did not want from the very beginning. Stop bullying us and you'll see that we are good and civilised people. But don't even try to mess with our pride.</p> <p>It is how the young men who live for our major football clubs see themselves, as knights and keepers of Serbia's holy values \u2013 the Orthodox church, the land of Kosovo and Serbian pride.</p> <p>How then to solve these issues? What is required, perhaps, is expertise from outside, from European countries like the UK which have been successful in countering racism in sport, to help us to change attitudes in different social groups, from primary schools to universities.</p> <p>We've seen elsewhere that it has been possible to change the view of sports fans on the issue of racism.</p> <p>But Serbia is fragile. What it needs is help. Not a new round of isolation.</p> <p><em>Slobodan Georgiev is a journalist working for the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network in Belgrade </em></p>",
  "<p>Just how thick is Nick Griffin? Is it even measurable? Or is he just so desperate for publicity for his ailing party that he'd do anything to grub up a few headlines, bar perhaps roller-skate past Westminster naked?</p> <p>The BNP leader tweeted the home address (partial address, he says) of the gay couple <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20000954\" title=\"\">Michael Black and John Morgan</a>, who won damages against the Christian owners of a B&amp;B who'd refused them a room. In the tweets, encouraging his followers to demonstrate outside Black and Morgan's home, Griffin said he wanted to bring them \"a bit of drama\".</p> <p>The police are now investigating whether Griffin's tweets were illegal. For his part, Griffin says that \"drama\" referred to the gay couple's involvement in amateur dramatics. But of course \u2013 a fondness for the work of Alan Ayckbourn goes hand in hand with a desire to see a mob of baying \"patriots\" appear at your door. Then there was Griffin's baffling sign-off: \"Say No to heterophobia!\"</p> <p>Does Griffin really live in a dark parallel universe where heterophobia needs to hear the word \"No\"? Where straight-bashing is on the rise \u2013 innocent heterosexual men leaving pubs, to be confronted by hordes of pissed-up Marys in Kylie T-shirts swinging baseball bats, crying: \"You women-fancying perverts are going to pay!\"? On Planet Griffin, are straight couples campaigning for the right to marry, straight parents frowned upon everywhere save for a few trendy London boroughs?</p> <p>Moreover, are schoolchildren thoughtlessly taunting each other with slang such as: \"That's just straight\"? Are some of these children committing suicide rather than facing coming out as \"non-gay\"? Is there is a culture in film and TV for there to be a token straight, who spouts straight cliches and affects straight mannerisms and has little else to do but be an amusing straight best friend for the lead gay characters to bounce off?</p> <p>Many apologies for the myriad cliches tumbling over each other back there. The point I'm trying to make is that, considering all the evidence or, indeed, lack of, it seems highly unlikely that heterophobia exists in any entrenched, meaningful or malign way.</p> <p>Not that I'm denying its existence. It appears that a (very) tiny minority of gay people self-define as heterophobic, because they're so sickened by straight society and its treatment of them. Eminem referenced <a href=\"http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/criminal.html\" title=\"\">heterophobia </a>in a lyric (Criminal). <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heterophobia-Harassment-Feminism-American-Intellectual/dp/0847689883\" title=\"\">At least one book has been written about it</a>. An Australian MP used the term in his campaign against same sex unions. But heterophobia as a looming social evil that requires scrutiny, legislation and an anguished cry of \"Just say no!\"? Nah, I'm not buying it.</p> <p>The gay couple's court win was always a no-brainer. A person's sexuality should have as little to do with hiring a room at a B&amp;B as it does with buying a doughnut at a bakery, or a meal at a restaurant. If the B&amp;B owners Susanne and Mike Wilkinson are so appalled by the implications of the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007, then perhaps they should reconsider their future in the hospitality industry.</p> <p>As for Griffin, I suppose he got the attention he so desperately craved (including this). What we seem to have here is a prime example of the anti-PC back-flip scam. This is where a quite reasonable argument against prejudice is crudely reversed, and then run with, to occasionally hilarious, though, more frequently, desperately boring effect. Thus with homophobia, it's: \"You're criticising me for what I believe, so that makes you (ta-da!) heterophobic!\" Similarly, racism: \"Yeah, well, you're hostile to my views, so that makes you (ta-da!) racist to white people.\" It's tiring, it's pathetic, but, slowly, surely, everyone is cottoning on. So, sorry Mr Griffin, the next time you want to generate headlines, it might be easier to go and fetch your roller-skates.</p> <h2>Oh, I say. This rapping lark's a bit oikish, isn't it? </h2> <p>One presumes that everyone has viewed the video of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2012/oct/19/eton-gangnam-style-lingo-explained\" title=\"\">Eton boys</a> rapping and throwing shapes, Gangnam style, in their tails. A bit of harmless tomfoolery that verges on the moving. Especially when they wail about how insecure they sometimes feel. (Ultra-posh boys finding it difficult to talk to girls \u2013 who knew?) In the event, it's touching to see boys \"dad-dancing\" in their teens.</p> <p>Bless their toff hearts for putting themselves out there, seemingly with no thought for any future political ambitions.</p> <p>Sadly, however, it must be noted that this whole thing exposes the Eton-fruggers as being (deep breath) somewhat common. All that bragging about consuming Mo\u00ebt and camembert \u2013 isn't it all a bit squeezed-middle wish-fulfilment? I'm sure their parents have brought them up to namecheck much posher stuff than that \u2013 it must have been a dagger to Mater and Pater's hearts that the Harvey Nicks food hall wasn't mentioned even once.</p> <p>So, an amusing viral sensation, but something of a tragic own goal for Eton. You don't pay its fees for boys to use the same cultural references as oiks from the local comp. I predict a surge in interest in Rugby and Harrow.</p> <h2>Tagg, you impulsive old redneck, you</h2> <p>Tagg Romney has said that he wanted to rush the stage and \"take a swing\" at Barack Obama, for his insinuations about his father Mitt's integrity during their latest US presidential debate. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-election/9617247/Tagg-Romney-wanted-to-take-swing-at-Obama.html\" title=\"\">Tagg</a> (short for Taggart) says that the thing that stopped him \u2013 the only thing, mind \u2013 was the presence of secret service officers surrounding Obama. If they hadn't been there, Tagg seems to be implying, Obama would have been \"for it\", good and proper.</p> <p>Well, some might say, young Tagg is hardly a credit to his illustrious background with such dockers' vernacular as \"taking a swing\". Was Tagg dragged up? some might wonder.</p> <p>But to them, I say, can't a young lad, with passion in his soul, stand up for his old man, even to the point of threatening his opponent with adolescent violence. Perhaps with a cry of \"Put your dukes up, Obama\", as the impetuous hothead hurdles over seats to uphold the family honour. It might not be right, but it's wrong in a good way. A bit like <em>Godfather II,</em> only with mom's apple pie for tea. More importantly, it's eminently understandable in a callow youth.</p> <p>To which some \u2013 in fact, let's hope all \u2013 might reply: \"What are you talking about, you misinformed, platitude-spewing hack? The weirdly named proto-meathead Tagg is a 42-year-old married millionaire father of six. He's also one of his father's chief advisers and should know better than to talk openly about wanting to duff up his father's opponent in a radio interview.\" To which I reply: \"You're absolutely right, sit down and shut up, Tagg, you embarrassingly privileged, emotionally incontinent redneck.\" As a sidebar: Mitt? Tagg? If they want a decent chance at power, this family really must sort their names out.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later</p>",
  "<p>Exactly 20 years ago, Kris Engskov, the head of Starbucks in the UK, was one of Bill Clinton's most trusted lieutenants on the campaign trail that took both men to the Oval Office \u2013 Clinton as president, and his fellow Arkansas native as his most loyal aide.</p> <p>One of the key points for the Clinton campaign team then was the charge that President George Bush Sr was soft on taxing big business. Clinton bragged that, given the chance, he could collect an additional \u00a345bn in tax from foreign multinationals in just four years.</p> <p>This very week in 1992, his campaign started a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-23/news/mn-620_1_foreign-corporations\" title=\"\">blitz of 30-second TV adverts</a>. Viewers were told: \"This is the $825bn question. That's how much foreign corporations operating in the US took in one year. But 72% of them didn't pay a dime in taxes. Not one dime \u2026\"</p> <p>While he never quite clawed back \u00a345bn, many felt Clinton put his finger on an important issue. Yet two decades on, US senator Carl Levin could still claim recently that multinationals \"engage in shams and gimmicks to avoid paying the taxes they owe\". And that was the charge levelled at Starbucks UK last week, which became the latest target of fury, following Amazon and Google, for paying derisory levels of tax in the UK.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-britain-starbucks-tax-idUSBRE89E0EX20121015\" title=\"\">Reuters investigation</a> uncovered apparent discrepancies between what Starbucks was telling US investors on the one hand and what it was declaring to HM Revenue &amp; Customs on the other.</p> <p>By a curious coincidence Starbucks and Britain's home-grown competitor, Costa Coffee, achieved similar sales last year \u2013 \u00a3398m and \u00a3377m respectively. The cost of achieving these sales, however, was \u00a3319m at Starbucks, more than three times the cost recorded by Costa. As a consequence, Costa's accounts show a tax charge of \u00a315m, while no tax is charged against Starbucks' loss-making UK division.</p> <p>That gap is in part explained by the US firm sourcing roasted coffee from a sister company in the Netherlands, and a consequent requirement to allocate some profits from the UK back to Amsterdam. Costa, meanwhile, operates a roastery in south London.</p> <p>More unsettling, however, is the payment of almost \u00a326m in \"royalties and licence fees\" by Starbucks UK in 2011 to other parts of the group. Engskov has <a href=\"http://starbucks.co.uk/blog/starbucks-commitment-to-the-uk/1240\" title=\"\">defended this </a>by pointing out that royalties are levied at the same percentage of revenues everywhere Starbucks operates in the world. Significantly, however, he does not say whether these payments are made back to Seattle or to a low-tax haven.</p> <p>Royalties are not unusual:&#xa0;such payments are also levied on McDonald's UK and Walmart-owned Asda by their parent companies. What sets them apart from Starbucks, however, is that they remain big UK tax contributors after the payments are made.</p> <p>By contrast, Engskov looks to be struggling to make the case that Starbucks UK is serious about building profits, or that its royalty and licensing arrangements are directed to that goal. Pre-tax charges on the business have been a significant reason that the exchequer has been able to collect just \u00a38.3m since Starbucks came to the UK in 1998, despite sales of more than \u00a33bn in that period.</p> <p>On Friday, Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz spoke for the first time about the allegations, when cornered \u2013 again by Reuters \u2013 at the opening of the group's first store in India. In placatory mood, he said: \"We will absolutely comply with any government inquiry with transparency and respect.\" As clear a signal as any, surely, that he would turn up to give an account to a parliamentary committee if asked.</p> <p>Surely it would be churlish now for MPs not to take him at his word, and demand a clear explanation from Starbucks and the other multinationals that, at first glance at least, appear to be gaming Britain's tax system?</p> <h2>An alliance with the Kremlin? Be careful what you wish for, BP</h2> <p>The future's bright, the future's Igor Sechin: that could be the motto for BP's latest adventure in Russia. The details are still being thrashed out, but BP is set to sell its 50% holding in TNK-BP, Russia's third largest oil producer, to Rosneft. It will receive a pile of cash ($10bn-$15bn) plus a 10%-20% stake in Rosneft \u2013 the national oil champion and a company led by Sechin, ally of President Putin.</p> <p>The appeal of Sechin and Rosneft is easy to understand: they are powerful. Sechin has been the Kremlin guiding hand shaping Russia's energy industry in recent years. Rosneft, if it ends up swallowing 100% of TNK-BP, will control half the country's oil output and be the world's largest producer.</p> <p>By contrast, the TNK-BP joint venture has descended into instability in the past four years. The oligarchs at AAR, owners of the other 50% of the company, have been prickly partners. There have been rows over strategy and dividends, and BP chief Bob Dudley, when he was the firm's man in Moscow, was obliged to flee Russia for a time in 2008.</p> <p>So, you might think, saying goodbye to AAR and embracing Rosneft is entirely sensible. What's not to like?</p> <p>Here's the drawback. TNK-BP, for all the strife, has been a wonderful investment for BP. The UK company invested $8bn in 2003 and has harvested $19bn in dividends, thanks in part to upgrades of management and infrastructure. By contrast, Rosneft is seen as bureaucratic, inefficient and lacking commercial nous. The Kremlin owns 75% of the shares and has seen their value flatline for half a decade.</p> <p>The hope, naturally, is that an alliance with BP marks the moment when Rosneft becomes serious about operational efficiencies. But, if it were that easy, the company would be further down the track already.</p> <p>In reality, BP probably has no choice but to run with Rosneft and tie up a amount of capital in an investment it cannot easily exit. But it's a gamble and the true odds on long-term success are unclear. That's Russia, where the truism that oil is really about politics applies in spades.</p> <h2>Knight errant</h2> <p>After spending the entire financial crisis serving as the public face of the most hated industry in Britain \u2013 the banks \u2013 you might think Angela Knight would have sought out a job as the spokeswoman for fluffy kittens, say, or sunshine.</p> <p>Instead, the ex-Tory MP and staunch defender of free markets popped up last week in her latest role, as chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Energy UK</a>, the body set up to boost the image of another group of unloveable profiteers \u2014 the Big Six energy suppliers. With their byzantine tariff structures and useless call centres, the energy firms give even the banks a run for their money. And David Cameron's populist pledge to force them to put customers on cheaper deals exposed the fact that even the Conservatives think this is a market that's failing its consumers.</p> <p>As Knight defended the actions of the banks at the height of the crisis, when their bosses were nowhere to be seen, it was almost possible to feel sorry for a woman who had joined the British Bankers' Association in early 2007, before the scale of malpractice became clear. But this time around, she knows exactly what she's walking into. Either Knight is a masochist, or she's one of the few people who believe that the utilities \u2013 and the banks \u2013 are great British business champions. Either way, she's a brave woman.</p>",
  "<p>The Wizard of Oz, Greg Coffey, has clicked his heels together and said there's no place like home. He is bowing out of the London hedge fund world, retiring to his native Australia at the ripe old age of 41.</p> <p>One of the city's best-known traders, the slick-haired investor who famously left his employer, GLG Partners, in 2008 after turning down a \u00a3156m \"golden handcuffs\" offer to stay, is the latest superstar hedge fund manager to leave the industry this year.</p> <p>Rumours have circulated that he has fallen out with the founder of his current employer, Louis Bacon of Moore Capital, but the true explanation may be that after riding high during the boom years, like some of his fellow superstar traders, he's decided to bow out at the top. A \u00a3430m fortune probably helped his decision, but it has also been a tough few years for the married father-of-three, who was once named the second sexiest hedge fund manager in the world.</p> <p>He has gone from generating around \u00a3200m of GLG's performance fees in 2007, capping an impressive annual return of 22% since 2004 (and ultimately leading to the massive golden handshake offer) to underperforming at Moore Capital, with two smaller emerging-market funds losing 16% and 2.3% respectively.</p> <p>So could Coffey's departure mark the end of the big-name trader? Jacob Schmidt, head of analysts Schmidt Research Partners, thinks so. \"I think we have reached the end of the trend of the last 10 to 12 years of relatively easy money. Up to 2008, we had a fantastic run in the hedge fund business, but since then it has become much more difficult. The guys like Coffey who have had an easy run are thinking: 'Why do I need this?' That's why they are leaving.\"</p> <p>Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, agrees. He says: \"Investment is like fashion. One moment it's all flashy, the next it's not. They are all fallible and when they start to think they can walk on water, that's usually when it all goes wrong.\"</p> <p>The best \"hedgies\" achieved exceptional returns in the build-up to the financial crash in 2008. They weren't alone in that: it was easy to make money in the boom years. However, what set the superstar traders apart was their ability to create the myth that they were infallible, tempting investors to put them in charge of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Dampier explains: \"The cult of celebrity in hedge fund managers came about because investors wanted to hang the decisions all on one person. The ones that tended to flaunt it started believing their own legend, which worked for a time, but won't work now.\"</p> <p>And although Coffey tended to shy away from the spotlight, he wasn't afraid of spending his vast wealth. He owned homes across the world, including a west London mansion, a handful of Scottish islands and an estate on the Isle of Jura.</p> <p>The 12,000-acre Ardfin estate is said to offer superb views across the Irish Sea and on a clear day it is said you can see Northern Ireland. Not that Coffey would know: according to locals he has only visited twice since snapping it up for \u00a33.5m in 2010. Nevertheless, he has still managed to incur the wrath of islanders by closing the estate's previously public gardens and attempting to build a nine-hole golf course and shooting range.</p> <p>But for Coffey it seems it was best to leave now, before his lacklustre run began to inflict more serious damage on Moore Capital, which he joined following a chance meeting with Bacon in the Mayfair car park they shared.</p> <p>Others who have suffered recently include Fidelity star Anthony Bolton, who was humbled last year after his new China fund fell 28% in six months, and Bill Miller, once the most famous investment manager in the US, who retired after an awful performance over the past few years. John Paulson, who became the subject of the book <em>The Greatest Trade Ever</em> after staking billions of dollars on the collapse of the US sub-prime market, has also had an embarrassing few months after betting on a recovery in the eurozone.</p> <p>Chris Rokos, 41, co-founder of Brevan Howard Asset Management, announced his retirement in August to \"pursue other interests\", and last month Driss Ben-Brahim, 46, former star at Goldman Sachs and one of the best-paid hedgies in London, left Man Group's GLG Atlas Macro fund.</p> <p>Even Arki Busson \u2013 celebrity trader and father to children with supermodel Elle Macpherson and actor Uma Thurman (Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson was born in July) \u2013 has been on the receiving end of negative headlines.</p> <p>One theory for the decline of the superstar trader is the rise of the analytical nerd and computerised algorithmic trading. Schmidt says: \"The superstars are confronted with a changing market. The punting around is not working. You now need to be either a traditional long-term stock picker, a very short-term person working on algorithms, or a combination of both. There is no future for guys like Coffey.</p> <p>\"Ten, 15, 20 years ago you had an advantage with getting information before other people, but the internet ended that. I think the next superstars are the ones who combine gut feeling with proper analysis, really understanding the mid-term trends rather than short-term mindsets.\"</p> <p>Coffey's short-term approach was perhaps most evident when he went on holiday. He would ask technicians at the office to ship trading terminals to his hotel so he could keep on top of his investments. Perhaps such a ferocious work ethic explains why he could retire at 41. But no matter how hard he worked, electronic dealing, taking just microseconds, would have the edge.</p> <p>Clearly, there are some teething problems with algorithmic trading \u2013 Man Group's system has been heavily slated and the one-day \"Flash Crash\" of 2010, in which the Dow Jones fell and rose by 1,000 points in a matter of minutes, was caused by computers getting a little over-excited. Nonetheless, some believe investment houses now prefer mathematicians to buccaneers.</p> <p>Novelist Robert Harris, whose book <em>The Fear Index</em> tells the story of a fictional hedge fund algorithm that gets out of control, said in a recent interview: \"They don't hire anyone to work who has less than a PhD in the natural sciences or mathematics and that weren't peer-reviewed in the top 15%. They don't even want someone to come and work for them who's got a degree in economics. It's too soft.\"</p> <p>The use of algorithms has become so popular it now accounts for 75% of all trades on US stock markets, with the average stock held for just 22 seconds.</p> <p>Nonetheless, some are prepared to speak up for the ever-dependable long-term trader. Dampier cites Invesco Perpetual's Neil Woodford as a manager with staying power. He says: \"He is in it for the long term and acts with confidence, not cockiness. I don't see him as flashy and flaunting it, and that's why he has the respect of the industry and has worked in it for so long.\"</p> <p>Assets in hedge funds have increased recently and are now above pre-2008 levels, at around \u00a32 trillion for the first time. But it seems the type of client is becoming more cautious: managers running pensions, council funds and university bursaries, not looking for a quick return but a more long-term approach. Instead of a flashy, charismatic trader following his hunches, they want security.</p> <p>That could be another reason why the superstar era is drawing to a close. As Schmidt says: \"Investors want less 'rock star' and more rock-solid institutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sam Mendes has proper English credentials. He grew up amid the spires and meadows of Oxford, where cricket was his passion. Taking a first in English at Cambridge, he then spent time in the provincial city of Chichester, learning how to handle the theatrical types who strut across British stages.</p> <p>Yet Mendes, who has been hailed since <em>American Beauty</em> in 1999 as a leading Hollywood film-maker, has taken a long time to come home. Now after five films, each fairly hardboiled takes on life across the Atlantic, he is trumpeting his return to British cinema by directing the latest instalment in the most quintessentially English franchise of them all: James Bond.</p> <p>It is a twist that amuses his star and friend, Daniel Craig, who had a hand in making it happen. \"Sam had this stratospheric start to his career and made these great films, but he had never made a movie at home,\" he told the <em>Observer </em>this weekend. \"And he is such a cinephile, so it is extraordinary that the first British film he has made is James Bond, which is about as British as it can be.\"</p> <p>Craig was looking for someone to help him steer his third portrayal of the most famous spy in the world. \"I met Sam at a party and I had had a few drinks. I told him what I wanted to do in the next film, to get back to the humour and the lightness and the sophistication, because I wanted to sound him out for the job.\"</p> <p>Mendes has also joked about his lengthy \"apprenticeship\" in the United States, before he was ready for Bond. After his Academy Award for directing <em>American Beauty</em> at the age of 34 came his gangster tale, <em>Road to Perdition</em>, then the war story <em>Jarhead</em> and the sterile suburbia of <em>Revolutionary Road</em>, before his smart-talking travelogue, <em>Away We Go</em>. Mendes's choice of a Bond movie seemed strange after these intelligent tales but, as a succession of critics line up to give <em>Skyfall</em> a glowing five stars, it appears to have paid off.</p> <p>\"We knew we had it, to be honest. Sam and I could tell as we were making it,\" said Craig. \"Of course, it comes from the writing on the page in the script too, and from never, ever forgetting it is a Bond film. Sam hasn't directed Ibsen here, after all, although he could do that very well too.\"</p> <p>The world will make its judgment when the film is released on Friday, although Craig confirms Mendes has still been editing footage over the last fortnight. It is a visually arresting and unexpectedly emotional spectacle, but audiences will also see a sly paean to the craft of acting.</p> <p>\"Sam comes from a theatre background, so I knew he would speak the language of actors,\" said Naomie Harris, the British actress who plays the MI6 field agent Eve.</p> <p>\"I knew he would know how to direct us. It is surprising how many film directors don't know how to do that.\"</p> <p>Harris, 36, believes Mendes's intense focus on the dynamic of relationships binds all his film work together. \"He sees that if you get that right, then everything else follows. Even in Bond, you can get lost in all the action without that. All the people around Bond have to be as credible as possible, then the chemistry makes it more exciting.\"</p> <p>After the Chichester Festival Theatre, Mendes directed Dame Judi Dench in <em>The Cherry Orchard</em> in the West End when he was only 24, then went on to run the Donmar Warehouse. Dench now plays a central role in <em>Skyfall</em>, in her seventh outing as \"M\". She carries the weight of the story \u2013 and its message, too.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of subtext in this film, not just the mother theme, which is fairly obvious,\" says Craig, \"but the idea of coming home too, and of dealing with your past; coming home to this dark place. It's a story with many levels, but it is quite a deliberately simple, strong plot. We did a lot of work on that. Sam wanted it to be clear.\"</p> <p>Watching one of the film's previews last week was another Dame for whom the story is particularly pertinent: Stella Rimington, the first woman to lead MI5 and at least half the inspiration for Dench's character. \"It made me rather sad actually,\" she said of the film. \"I kept hoping it wasn't going to end like that.\"</p> <p>Star acting turns come from Javier Bardem and the 76-year-old Albert Finney. According to Craig, the cast came to Mendes because of his reputation. \"Sam is so bloody-minded about getting what he wants, and he understands how to get it. On the set of <em>Road to Perdition</em> I remember him coming up to Paul Newman and just saying quietly 'Do it better,' into his ear. Newman just shrugged and said 'OK'.\"</p> <p>Jude Law shares Craig's memories from <em>Road to Perdition</em>: \"It was a very smooth operation, but the script allowed for quite a bit of interpretation and Sam relished letting my imagination go. I visited the Donmar under Sam regularly and his diversity of style was inspiring. Somehow everything he touched became relevant.\"</p> <p>Harris was slightly unnerved by Mendes's willingness to use her ideas. \"He is a total collaborator. I just wish I had thought of a few more ideas to offer. My mother is a scriptwriter, so I am always very respectful of the script. But you were free to experiment,\" she said.</p> <p>Craig said he was allowed to improvise a bit with some funny lines, but that Mendes was careful to rein him in when he overstepped the mark. \"We didn't want it to be disrespectful to Bond. We were clear about that.\"</p> <p>Harris, who has appeared in the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>films and starred on television in the BBC drama <em>Small Island</em>, was picked out by Mendes when he saw her perform at London's National Theatre in Danny Boyle's acclaimed <em>Frankenstein</em>. \"He called Danny and asked him what I was like to work with,\" she said this weekend.</p> <p>\"I did three auditions and they told me there was a good chance I would get it. He told me that they wanted a modern Bond girl, someone who could go toe-to-toe with Bond.\"</p> <p>She describes Mendes's work on set as \"detailed and specific\". \"He is good at sussing you out as a person and he uses that. It sounds a bit manipulative, but it isn't. It is just a skill.\"</p> <p>His confident manner, which Mendes has described as a product of \"the Oxbridge machine\", was comforting. \"He must have been nervous, but all you saw was a smile. I have not seen the film yet, so I don't know what he has done tonally, but he was clearly having a ball. One day I asked him whether he was always this happy. He said, yes, and it was because he is a Bond fan.\"</p> <p>Back in 2002, when the film director went into collaboration with Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks, Mendes said he would be going back to his roots in Britain \"soon\". In fact, it took a decade, one failed marriage to Kate Winslet and the sort of populist project that no one would have predicted to lure him home.</p> <p>In the runup to the <em>Skyfall </em>premiere, Mendes, who is now in a relationship with Sir Peter Hall's daughter Rebecca, has talked enthusiastically of the challenge of making \"a big, glamorous escapist movie that still deals with the world we are living in\".</p> <p>Mendes's Bond film aims high, expressing a faltering but beguiling British patriotism. And he has even hinted that he might make another Bond film, since Craig is due to play the part at least twice more.</p> <p>For now, the director must prepare his first West End musical since a revival of <em>Company</em> at the Donmar in 1995. It is a fresh version of <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, opening in the summer, made with the blessing of Roald Dahl's estate and with Douglas Hodge in the role of Willy Wonka.</p>",
  "<p>Two sorts of peas don't always fit in the same pod. And, almost invariably, this means regional and national papers can't flourish within a single management structure.</p> <p>That (diminuendo) is a problem for Gannett's Newsquest and Johnston Press, ever since they bought Scotland's two nationals, the <em>Herald</em> and the <em>Scotsman</em>, and found they needed to be much more than pumped-up local dailies. That's a problem for Northcliffe, the <em>Daily Mail's </em>regional collection, ever since it failed to sell while the price was more or less right. And, as for Trinity Mirror, just ask yourself how things have gone since 1999, when Trinity bought the <em>Mirror</em> nationals and bathed in the triumph of becoming Britain's biggest newspaper company, some 240 papers strong?</p> <p>Contraction, distraction, acute shareholder dissatisfaction: so exit Sly Bailey, CEO for a decade.

Fox thinks that integration \u2013 including website development \u2013 is the path of the future. He doesn't believe local papers need to be local.</p> <p>Well, experience would say just the opposite. Human experience would say that a media giant run from Canary Wharf would grow fatally deaf on the outlying streets where its readers live. Advertising experience would say that local jobs and local store ads are the staple diet of survival in print and on the web: and that you can't orchestrate them from Canada Square, or invent some kind of command and control system that makes one digital strategy cover all bases. And journalists' experience would confirm that their roles and their focus \u2013 national, local, one looking across the country, one exploring communities \u2013 are crucially different.</p> <p>But hey!

  "<p>Whenever I go to the houses of parliament these days, I make sure that I leave my penknife behind, because it is bound to be seized by the security people. But until last week, when I was on the way to hear the celebrated American economist Paul Krugman and others debate the wisdom of current austerity policies, I had not realised that the ban on potentially offensive weapons also applies to small padlocks of the sort one uses to safeguard one's clothes in the lockers of changing rooms.</p> <p>When I inquired as to why they were seizing my padlock, I was told that it was for fear that one might chain oneself to the railings. When I replied that this was not my intention \u2013 and, anyway, that it was perfectly obvious that I was not in possession of a chain \u2013 the answer was that that was the policy.</p> <p>When I told this story to my old friend and colleague Adam Raphael, now joint editor of the <em>Good Hotel Guide</em>, he wickedly suggested that perhaps the powers that be were worried that protesters would take a leaf of out the book of the suffragettes of old, and chain themselves to the railings in protest against George Osborne's austerity programme.</p> <p>At all events, the security people were perfectly polite, and I proceeded to committee room 14 for the debate between Professor Krugman and Jonathan Portes (director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) on the one hand, and Stephen King and Bridget Rosewell, respectively group chief economist at HSBC and chair of the consultancy Volterra Partners, on the other.</p> <p>But before we go into the debate, let us dwell briefly on the background.</p> <p>As the Office for Budgetary Responsibility and the governor of the Bank of England have recently reminded us, the present depression is not the consequence of the government's austerity programme. The objection to Osborne's austerity policy \u2013 a position shared by Krugman, Portes, your correspondent and many others \u2013 is that it is the austerity programme that is <em>keeping</em> the economy depressed, the depression having been caused principally by the financial crisis but aggravated by the impact of much higher prices for oil and other commodities in recent years.</p> <p>Moreover, in the case of the British economy, there is the added erosion of purchasing power as a result of the devaluation of the pound, while the general world crisis has limited the extent to which British exporters could take advantage of the improvement in price competitiveness provided by the devaluation.</p> <p>Now, the position of King and Rosewell is essentially that, in the absence of the deficit reduction programme, the financial markets would lose confidence in Britain and interest rates on government debt would rise sharply. The inference is that it is only because the chancellor is cutting the deficit, or trying to, at a time of depression that interest rates are not much higher. The corollary is that such a rise in interest rates would not only aggravate the cost of servicing the national debt, but would also inhibit a recovery.</p> <p>By contrast, Krugman and Portes argue that it is the depression that keeps interest rates low. Krugman and another ally, Professor Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/07/02/fiscal-contractions-to-reduce-deficits-can-only-slow-down-the-recovery-richard-layard-explains-the-manifesto-for-economic-sense/\" title=\"\">wrote in an accompanying paper</a>: \"Despite exceptionally high deficits, interest rates today are unprecedentedly low in all major countries where there is a normally functioning central bank \u2026 [and] the central bank can always, if needed, fund the deficit, leaving the bond market unaffected.\"</p> <p>King and Rosewell try to scare us with the point that \"taking public and private debt together\", debt in the UK is 250% of GDP. Of this, the public sector component is 80%.</p> <p>Frankly, this is not especially high by historical standards. And, as Krugman and Layard point out, \"the conditions for crisis were created by excessive <em>private sector</em> borrowing and lending, including by over-leveraged banks. The collapse of this bubble led to massive falls in output and thus in tax revenue. So the large government deficits we see today are a consequence of the crisis, not its cause.\" (My italics.)</p> <p>Thus to add the public and private sector figures together is pushing things a bit, because the rise in the public sector debt has been necessary to offset the deleterious effects of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Now, as Krugman says, \"I am all in favour of cutting deficits eventually\". But the crisis of deleveraging means that those in the private sector with excessive debts are cutting back \u2013 and so, in the atmosphere of panic-driven austerity, are the people who don't have excessive debts. \"The tragedy is that each player is trying to do what makes sense, but this is collectively disastrous. This is why we have governments: to serve as a stabilising&#xa0;force.\"</p> <p>To balance the economy \u2013 which, at times like this, takes priority over balancing the budget \u2013 governments, as Krugman says, \"must spend more when the private sector spends less\". At the very least, they should not join in the cutbacks.</p> <p>After all, most of us value our freedom, and don't want to have to chain ourselves to the parliamentary railings in protest against the austerity programme.</p>",
  "<p>The police have been going through a rough patch recently. First they were implicated in the phone-hacking scandal \u2013 though they managed to escape most of the blame when we collectively came to the surprising conclusion that it was more serious for tabloid journalists to neglect the public interest than officers of the crown. But while they deflected a lot of that responsibility, their attempts to deflect it over Hillsborough have been catastrophically counterproductive. And as senior officers have been caught dining with Murdochs or maligning the dead, officers on the ground have been getting shot and called plebs. Or not called plebs, depending on who you believe.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Police Federation's attempts to extract retribution for the disputed p-word, in the form of Andrew Mitchell's sacking, have been roundly slagged off by former Labour minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-mullin\" title=\"\">Chris Mullin</a>, who last week described the organisation as \"a bully\", \"a bunch of headbangers\" and \"a mighty vested interest that has seen off just about all attempts to reform the least reformed part of the public service\". He didn't call them plebs though. Then again, some police have&#xa0;taken to wearing \"PC Pleb and Proud\" sweatshirts, so perhaps the insult has lost its sting? Maybe they'll soon be sporting \"Sergeant Headbanger Will See You Now\" riot shields or stab vests with the slogan \"You Needn't Try Stabbing <em>This</em> Mighty Vested Interest\".</p> <p>Another accessory which the Police&#xa0;Federation advocates is the Taser. In June it wrote to the prime minister asking for the number of Tasers to be trebled so that every frontline officer could have one. \"They need to have the proper equipment to do the job,\" says Paul Davis, secretary of the Federation's operational policing subcommittee. And officers certainly seem to be getting a lot of use out of them. Just last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/17/police-taser-blind-man-stick\" title=\"\">a policeman Tasered an elderly blind man</a> as part of an operation to check whether his white stick was a samurai sword. It wasn't.</p> <p>Of course, anyone might get rattled by a semi-paralysed blind man slowly tapping his way with a stick towards you. Apart from anything else, it's so spooky. Those are the high-pressure moments when you need the training to kick in. According to guidelines, officers are permitted to use Tasers when they \"would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/ or the subject\" and this moment is surely eerie enough to qualify. The whole event would barely be worthy of note if it weren't for the fact that they shot him in the back. But then the gentleman is quite old and has suffered two strokes in the last few years \u2013 so the comparatively slow rate&#xa0;at which he was fleeing was probably taken as provocation.</p> <p>Incidentally, if you do get Tasered by the police, it's advisable to watch your language. As Boris Johnson has pointed out, it's now an offence to swear at a police officer. So, should you incur a public-spirited 50,000-volt warning shot \u2013 perhaps for brandishing your pension book in an aggressive manner or because a young PC has mistaken your tartan shopping trolley for a piece of field artillery \u2013 don't accidentally shout \"Oh fuck!\" or you might get sent to prison. Keep it to a \"Dash it all, that smarts, constable!\" and be on your way. As soon as you can stand.</p> <p>In the case of Colin Farmer, the suspected samurai, the police have apologised and Chief Superintendent Stuart Williams said: \"We have launched an urgent investigation to understand what lessons can be learned.\" That response demonstrates everything that's wrong with large organisations. In terms of dereliction of duty, I think it's worse than Tasering a blind pensioner. What possible good can this \"investigation\" do? We know what happened. A police officer, who Colin Farmer described as \"an absolute thug with a licence to carry a dangerous weapon\", made a brutal and stupid mistake. How can an investigation illuminate the situation further? Will DNA analysis of the stick reveal that it's a sword after all?</p> <p>All of which feels like an inopportune context for Keith Bristow, the director general of the new <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/nca/\" title=\"\">National Crime Agency</a>, to request more police powers. He's trying to influence the new communications data bill so that he'll be able to scour Skype and social media networks for wrongdoers. But he's quick to allay the fears of those who call the bill a \"snoopers' charter\": \"I value my privacy, I don't want to be snooped upon,\" he explains. \"That's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about criminals who run organised crime gangs that import drugs\u2026 We're talking about predatory paedophiles, we're talking about dangerous people.\"</p> <p>Oh, well that's OK then! He's only going to be snooping on criminals. Personally I don't think that's enough \u2013 I think criminals should be arrested and charged, not just snooped on. But just as long as the NCA won't accidentally be snooping on anyone who's not definitely a criminal, I can't see the harm in it.</p> <p>In an ideal world, Keith Bristow would be wasting his breath. When a state law-enforcement agency says \"We need more powers\", it should carry as little weight as when I say (as I have spent much of the last couple of weeks saying) \"I want you to read my book\". Not because either statement is insincere: all writers genuinely want people to read their books and all law-enforcement agencies really believe they need more powers. But, when they say that, they should be completely ignored. Not criticised, not accommodated, just disregarded.</p> <p>The sincerity is beguiling but it's meaningless. \"Help us to do our jobs better,\" the police implore. \"We can see the good we could do if you let us.\" They almost certainly can. But they can't see what it would cost society in lost freedoms. They can't know the consequences of potentially irreversible authoritarian steps.</p> <p>It's a frightening state of affairs. Those who know most about law enforcement \u2013 those who actually do it \u2013 are the least qualified to advise on what its rights, powers and funding should be. We have to ignore their cries and trust our instincts. We have to balance our fears of the indefinable, nebulous worlds of crime and terrorism, with the fact that, if we put Tasers in our public servants' hands, at some point they'll use them on us.</p> <p><em>David Mitchell's autobiography, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/tvandradio/9780007351725/david-mitchell-back-story\" title=\"\"><em>Back Story</em></a><em> (HarperCollins), is out now</em></p>",

Not by the actual drug-taking, which is fascinating, if we're honest, but the horrible, alpha male, if-you're-not-with-me-you're-agin-me bullying. Armstrong, with his cancer-survivor determination, his relentless desire to win, his piercing, scary, psycho eyes, was an intimidator par excellence. In 1999 he made the entire Tour de France field \u2013 that's <em>every</em> single cyclist, including those on other teams \u2013 turn against the French cyclist Christophe Bassons when Bassons, who never took performance-enhancing drugs, denounced doping. In 2004 he tried to do the same to doper-turned-clean-rider Filippo Simeoni. Just last year Armstrong told Tyler Hamilton, once his team-mate and fellow drug-hoover, now the author of a tell-all book, that he would make Hamilton's life \"a living hell\".</p> <p>In <strong>Peddlers</strong>, 5Live's two-hour documentary about drug-taking in cycling, Mark \"Chappers\" Chapman interviewed Hamilton at his home in Aspen, Colorado. Chappers, as ever, was excellent \u2013 he combines his love of sport with warmth and intelligence \u2013 and Hamilton came across well. Cycling fans will have heard much of what he said already, but it was still shocking and was backed up by interviews with the cyclist Matt DeCanio and Emma O'Reilly, a soigneur for US Postal, Armstrong's team.</p> <p>O'Reilly was forced to smuggle drugs for Armstrong's use between Spain and France (she didn't ask, but thinks it was cortisone). She was an interesting interviewee: a bubbly, upbeat character who deliberately kept all the drug-taking \"in the periphery\" so that she didn't have to deal with it directly. When she confessed to David Walsh, a <em>Sunday Times</em> journalist, she was intimidated; Armstrong called her a prostitute and alcoholic.</p> <p>Cyclist David Millar, a man who goes up in my estimation almost daily, came on to the programme about 10 minutes from the end and kept his frustration in check. For Millar, and for cycling, drug-taking is a really old story: everyone knew it was happening, but things have changed. Now the sport is, as he put it, \"at the vanguard of the anti-doping movement\". Bradley Wiggins, a clean cyclist, won the Tour de France this year. Millar won a stage and some of us cried when he did.</p> <p>But despite Millar's efforts it's Lance who is the story. It wasn't only Armstrong who was doping, but it was Armstrong who was winning the most often, Armstrong who was the star. And now, though the story involves others, though it's actually an old tale, it's still all about Armstrong. He remains&#xa0;cycling's bullyboy; he dominates even today.</p> <p>Oh well. Shall we find our entertainment elsewhere? Let's go goth, as Radio 4 has over the past few days, with new versions of <em>Dracula</em>, ideas that the moon shining into Mary Shelley's bedroom may have inspired her to write <em>Frankenstein, </em>and other spooky stuff. Including Reece Shearsmith's <strong>Scream Queens</strong>, on Monday, a rollicking half-hour in which Shearsmith met several of his childhood heroines/nightmares \u2013 female actors who appeared in horror films. They were fine, in that bland, fruity way that all actors are; it was Shearsmith who was exceptional. Crammed full of knowledge, with a voice that never stops entertaining, he kept you listening when, actually, the scream queens palled. \"You had me bellowing in fear!\" he told one, which made me bellow, too.</p> <p>And I enjoyed <strong>Hallucination</strong>: <strong>Through the Doors of Perception</strong>, a quietly scientific programme about what hallucination actually is. When it's not induced by mental illness or drug-taking, when it's what some call \"healthy hallucination\", there can be many causes: epilepsy, fever, loss of vision through macular disease. It can be an indicator of Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, though, many people don't tell anyone, not even their partners, about their visions. There's too much stigma.</p> <p>It seems strange to think that in the past, seeing things meant you had a direct line to God. You were praised, even worshipped, for it. But as science explains what once seemed miraculous, we are confronted by the truth and we judge. Don't we, Lance?</p>",
  "<p>An <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/seeking-privacy-in-a-networked-age/\" title=\"\">article in the <em>New York Times</em></a> caught my eye. In it, Nick Bilton, a <em>NYT</em> columnist, recounts a recent dinner party that he hosted, in the middle of which his phone beeped with a text message. \"Hey, I see you're having people over,\" it read. \"OK if I stop by?\" What puzzled Mr Bilton was how this person knew he was having a dinner party.</p> <p>Then he looked at his guests. \"Over the course of the three-hour dinner,\" the poor sap eventually discovered, \"my friends posted seven photos on Path, sent six Twitter messages (five with photos), six photos on Instagram and two people checked in on Foursquare. When I added up the collective follower counts of the people in the room, my little dinner party was potentially viewed by more people than watch <em>The Late Show</em> on CBS: over three million.\" (Two of his guests have large numbers of followers on Twitter.) And, to add insult to (self-inflicted) injury, a few days later he telephoned someone in a work-related call, only to be told by the other person \u2013 who has never crossed his threshold \u2013 how much he \"just loved\" the lamps hanging above the Bilton kitchen table.</p> <p>Welcome to our socially networked world. One of the most puzzling things about it is why normally sane, well-adjusted, intelligent people lose not only their judgment but also their marbles when confronted with the opportunities for exposure offered by Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Path, Instagram et al. As I wrote that, my Twitterstream updated. \"I'm at Leicester Square underground station (London),\" tweeted one of the (normally sane, well-adjusted, etc) people whom I follow. Then I checked with Foursquare, a service to which this person subscribes. \"xxx checked in at Leicester Square London underground station,\" it burbled, before excitedly adding that xxx had earned seven \"points\" for managing to find a major tube station. Three of these points were for \"First time at Leicester Square London underground station\", and four were for \"First Tourist Information Center!\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\" title=\"\">Foursquare</a>, in case you haven't come across it, is possibly the daftest application of GPS technology yet devised. It's a mobile application that allows registered users to \"check in\" at a particular location. Checkers-in are rewarded with \"points\" and sometimes \"badges\". (I am not making this up.) Check-in requires active user selection and points are awarded at check-in. Subscribers can also opt to have their checking-in achievements automatically posted to Twitter or Facebook.</p> <p>But wait, there's more! If you've checked in to a location on more occasions than anyone else over the past 60 days, then you are crowned \"mayor\" of that location. But of course some other rotter can depose you by checking in even more frantically and no doubt even as I write there are epic tussles going on for the mayorship of, say, Tooting Bec underground station, or the third litter bin on the left at the exit from Waterloo station.</p> <p>If this business of points, badges and mayorships reminds you of the collection games that five-year-olds play with picture cards, Pok\u00e9mon accessories and other gewgaws, then you're right on the money. The thing is, though, that, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foursquare\" title=\"\">according to Wikipedia,</a> the Foursquare game is currently being played by 20 million adults, which makes one wonder if perhaps the time has come to rethink the whole business of universal adult franchise. Should anyone this idiotic have the vote?</p> <p>But actually Foursquare is simply the looniest extreme of this mania for self-revelation. In pondering Nick Bilton's story about his inadvertently broadcasted dinner party, I was suddenly reminded of Erving Goffman's great book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0140135715/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0140135715&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meme11-21\" title=\"\"><em>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</em></a>, which first appeared in 1959 and which I read as a student in the late 1960s. In it, Goffman uses a theatrical metaphor to interpret social interactions between people. In everyday life, he argues, we are all actors, each of us playing a variety of roles. The audience consists of the other people with whom we interact. And, as in the theatre, we operate in two zones \u2013 one when we are, as it were, on stage, and the other when the curtain is down and we can revert to being ourselves \u2013 ie discard the role or identity we assume when in the presence of others.</p> <p>Goffman's analysis was entirely predicated on the face-to-face encounters of social life as it used to be in a pre-internet age. In those days, it really was possible to go backstage, as it were: to discard one's public face and be oneself. It still is, but now you have to switch off your phone and resist the egotistical temptations of social networking and location-based services. And, hey! \u2013 if you do that, then maybe people will start inviting you to dinner again.</p>",

With minimal fuss and the kind of travel budget that wouldn't get Brian Cox past the credit sequence, Professor Al-Khalili turned the establishment of the laws of thermodynamics into a captivating scientific tale.</p> <p>The first law, as you may recall, holds that energy is not created or destroyed \u2013 it just changes form. And the second and infinitely more pessimistic law maintains that energy tends to disperse, from physical unity towards fragmented chaos. Which is to say that the universe is slowly coming apart and one day all that is left will be an endless nothing.</p> <p>Before there was time to run a hot bath in which to slit your wrists, Al-Khalili enthusiastically reminded us that although the underlying cosmic trend is towards increasing entropy, or irreversible decay, we on earth are currently enjoying a \"brief, beautiful creative moment\".</p> <p>That may be a consoling thought but, one must ask, has the professor never seen <strong>Me and Mrs Jones</strong>? If this crummy yummy mummy sitcom doesn't in itself herald the end of the universe, it does make you question what 14bn years of cosmic existence has achieved.</p> <p>After the desperate opener, the humane hope was that, contrary to the second law of thermodynamics, things could only get better. But the second episode proved that hope to be vainer than Simon Cowell.</p> <p>Character may not always be destiny in real life, but it is in real comedy. And like far too many British comedies, <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em>, a school gate farce, has no characters. Instead it has \"types\": the hapless single mother, the neighbourhood busybody, the humourless Nordic sex bomb.</p> <p>To watch Sarah Alexander as Mrs Jones work herself into a mirthless fluster is to long to see Wendy Craig in a rerun of Carla Lane's 70s sitcom <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/butterflies/\" title=\"\"><em>Butterflies</em></a>, a&#xa0;yearning I have never previously felt in danger of experiencing. Yet say&#xa0;what&#xa0;you will about Craig's Ria, she&#xa0;was drawn from an active imagination rather than an exhausted comic trope.</p> <p>The stock ciphers in <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em> possess no animating truth and therefore inspire no sympathy \u2013 the paradox of comedy being that you have to feel for people before you can laugh at them. Whatever pity was mustered went on the actors, whose lines were so limp that it seemed like a cruel and unusual punishment to leave them dangling without the protection of a laughter track.</p> <p>In historical terms, the demise of the laughter track must be hailed as a positive development in British sitcom. For is there not something creepily controlling about being prompted to laugh? Apart from anything else, it denies us the basic human right of&#xa0;spontaneity.</p> <p>But with the sort of sitcoms that British television churns out with mystifying regularity, the laughter track performs a vital practical role. It provides the only sign that these shows are comedies. Take that away and you're left with an extreme version of Brechtian alienation, only without the intellectual kudos.</p> <p>When, for example, Inca the Nordic sex bomb said: \"I am Swedish\", you could detect immediately afterwards a ghostly appeal to a notional sense of humour \u2013 the empty beat where the laughter was supposed to go. Call it the&#xa0;silence of comic entropy, this was the haunted sound of a joke that had not just died but decomposed into absolute nothingness.</p> <p>The same sound was heard again in <strong>Hebburn</strong>, a new situation comedy that is really a location comedy. Although presented in an affectionate guise, the basic idea is that they're a bit dim in the&#xa0;north east. It starred Chris Ramsey&#xa0;and a highly cuffable haircut as Jack, a journalist returning to his hometown with his new wife, Sarah (Kimberley Nixon).</p> <p>Hebburn, Jack told Sarah, is \"where dreams come to die\". That's not a bad proposition, comedy-wise, but unfortunately, <em>Hebburn</em> turned out on closer inspection to be the place where jokes go to die.</p> <p>The one about Sarah's Jewishness sending the locals into a state of anxious cultural confusion took a particularly long and painful time to expire. It started with Jack's mum (Gina McKee) cutting holes in sandwich baps to serve them as bagels,&#xa0;and went on from there without going anywhere.</p> <p>As Jack's father, Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) was a curiously detached presence, as though he had decided to keep very quiet in the conviction that no one would notice it was him. No doubt this was admirable self-restraint, but how much more entertaining things would have been if he had turned to his screen wife McKee during the bagel saga and in his biggest <em>Big Night Out</em> accent shouted: \"You wouldn't let it lie!\"</p> <p>Thank cosmic order for <strong>Fresh Meat</strong>, almost an hour of laugh-out-loud comic astuteness that single-handedly restored faith in the British ability to be funny. Written by <em>Peep Show</em> combo, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, who are truly enjoying a beautiful creative moment, it's a student comedy neatly pitched between <em>Peep Show</em> and <em>The Inbetweeners</em>, and is arguably better than both.</p> <p>Now in its second series, the show works on a multitude of levels. Each character is fully realised and integral to the set-up, the plots are loose but satisfyingly coherent, and the caustically absurd yet uncannily authentic dialogue succeeds in defining&#xa0;its own inspirationally demented&#xa0;world.</p> <p>In Howard (Greg McHugh), the paranoid Scot, and JP (Jack Whitehall), the smug public schoolboy,&#xa0;the show boasts two of the finest comic creations&#xa0;to come along in years. Whereas the contrast&#xa0;between Sabine, the plain-speaking Dutchwoman (Jelka van Houten), and <em>Me and Mrs Jones</em>'s Inca says everything that needs to be known about the difference between fresh and&#xa0;stale.</p> <p>In last week's second episode, JP had mumps and, advised that he risked infertility, he rashly chose to store his sperm in the student house's shared freezer ice cube tray. Meanwhile the newly arrived Sabine was still getting to grips with the haphazard communal workings of the kitchen.</p> <p>You might have thought you'd know how or, more precisely, where this particular climax was going to finish. The mark of the best comedy, however, is that it subverts the obvious&#xa0;even while playing it for all it's&#xa0;worth. In the end the payoff was hard to swallow, but only because it&#xa0;left me spluttering so violently with&#xa0;laughter.</p>",
  "<p>With the American electoral race making for ever more dramatic television, it's fitting that the silver screen should turn once again toward presidents for its drama. Last week Roger Michell's <em>Hyde Park on Hudson</em> took its UK bow at the BFI London film festival, with Bill Murray impressing with his portrayal of a womanising yet&#xa0;altruistic Franklin D Roosevelt. In the coming months we shall see Daniel Day-Lewis take the eponymous role in Steven Spielberg's <em>Lincoln</em>, which is already being tipped as a serious awards contender. In the meantime, on DVD, we have an altogether more frivolous take on America's leaders in Timur Bekmambetov's <strong>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter </strong>(2012, Fox, 15), in which Benjamin Walker plays the 16th president as an avenging angel who hates bloodsuckers almost as much as he hates slavery.</p> <p>Adapted from a novel by mash-up king Seth Grahame-Smith (author of the bestselling <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> <em>and</em> <em>Zombies</em>), this rather one-note romp rewrites the history of the civil war as a battle between good and evil in which rich, southern, white Americans are literally sucking the life out of those whom they view as little more than livestock. It's an interesting idea, one that should be more chillingly effective than it is, the central metaphor too often getting lost amid Bekmambetov's trademark fiery CGI visuals.</p> <p>Still, there are some dark chuckles to be had from the sight of a man with distinctive hair and hat arrangement swinging around an axe like Thor with his super-powered hammer. For all its flaws this is never as dull as <em>Jonah Hex</em>, as incoherent as <em>Night Watch</em> or as plain rubbish as <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>.

At times you can barely hear the dialogue over the sound of the contractual wranglings and focus-group box-tickings that have produced this soulless spreadsheet of a movie. Considering its non-narrative source, it's perhaps unsurprising that there should be no story to speak of. Instead we get a series of disconnected \"vignettes\" (the natural birth, the C-section, the miscarriage) all played out over a pappy jukebox soundtrack by stunningly photogenic (and universally well-to-do) Hollywood names who mug, wince and grin like people giving birth to very large paychecks.</p> <p>Just as having babies in real life leaves one smelling of sick for a year, the stench of cynicism is hard to dispel as the movie peddles its well-worn gags (pregnancy is hard and makes you want to wee and punch your partner in the face) over and over again.

Solid B-movie fare, then, enlivened by an A-list cast but occasionally undercut by C-grade hysterics.</p> <p>There's a good idea, too (or at least the setting for a good idea), at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chernobyl-Diaries-DVD-Jesse-McCartney/dp/B0086VHY54/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350472709&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\"><strong>Chernobyl Diaries</strong></a> (2012, StudioCanal, 15), another shaky-cam shocker from writer/producer Oren Peli, the creator of <em>Paranormal Activity</em>.

Set in a Lebanese village where the peaceful coexistence of Christians and Muslims is threatened by news of violence in the outside world, this tragicomic fable sees mothers and wives struggling to keep a fragile peace while their menfolk lock horns in increasingly self-destructive displays of bravado. As before, Labaki threads music and movement through the narrative script, preventing the drama from becoming merely didactic, always engaging the heart as well as the head. Vibrant performances and sturdy location photography ground the action in the firm, fertile soil of reality.</p>",
  "<p>If Mario Testino, who jetted into Los Angeles from London barely 12 hours earlier, would rather be some place else, such as his gorgeous 1933 Spanish-style hacienda in the Hollywood hills, he doesn't betray it. From the moment the world's busiest fashion and portrait photographer bounds into the hotel he is all grace and charm. When we photograph him, he is at once the master of ceremonies. It's as if he can't help treating the shoot as if he was the one behind the camera. Which, of course, is where he spends much of his waking life. \"I work 14 hours a day, every day,\" he says. \"I&nbsp;work most Saturdays and most Sundays.\"</p> <p>If you're imprudent enough to suggest that his nonstop schedule sounds like hell, Testino will cut you short. \"It's not,\" he protests. \"It's amazing; I adore it. It's exciting. Every day a&nbsp;new city, new people, new <em>everything</em>. I&nbsp;can't get enough of it.\" Does he never feel the impulse to idle away a day in his slippers and pyjamas? Apparently not. \"I spend, maximum, four or five days in a place at a time, except for my holidays,\" he says. \"You know that most photographers die on a shoot? Helmut Newton died on assignment. [Irving] Penn too. [Richard] Avedon was still working when he died. We don't retire. We just carry on.\"</p> <p>At 57, the world's most prolific magazine photographer is just getting started. It's only 15 years, after all, since his career exploded in the wake of his 1997 <em>Vanity Fair</em> shoot with Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2010 he shot the engagement photos of Wills and Kate, and it's entirely conceivable that, should the time come, he'll photograph <em>their</em> children's engagement portraits. Or how about Kate Moss as a grandmother? By Testino's estimate, he's shot the supermodel several thousand times. What does he find so appealing about her? \"She's fun, generous, she has taste, she's beautiful,\" he says. \"I&nbsp;don't know what it is we have, because I'm so much older than her, and she's rock'n'roll, but if we're in the same room we'll be sitting next to each other within five minutes.\"</p> <p>Moss also happens to be the poster girl for In Your Face, a major new exhibition of Testino's work that runs at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts until 3 February. It is billed as a retrospective, but don't for a minute let that fool you into thinking Testino is slowing down. \"My favourite words are possibilities, opportunities and curiosity,\" he says. \"I think if you are curious you create opportunities, and then if you open the doors, you create possibilities. People close doors all the time, but I look at some pictures I take today and think they are so much better than pictures I took 10 years ago because I&nbsp;haven't stopped growing, and I&nbsp;don't ever want to stop growing.\"</p> <p>Growing up as one of six children in a&nbsp;middle-class family in Peru, Testino had a fearless independence that set him apart from the crowd. His fashion sense, in particular, marked him out as a threat. \"They screamed at me in the street: 'Faggot,'\" he recalls. \"All my allowance went on taxi fares. I couldn't take public transport the way I&nbsp;dressed \u2013 imagine David Bowie walking in Rome. Well, I wasn't David Bowie, but the way I looked to them was quite flamboyant.\" He says arriving in London in 1977, as a&nbsp;22-year-old, was a revelation. \"South America was not really that open \u2013 you had to fit in, and I&nbsp;didn't fit in. I was different \u2013 my tastes, my point of view \u2013 were a bit weird, and I found in Britain a&nbsp;sense of calm, that I could just be.\"</p> <p>The 1970s \u2013 \"a prolonged downpour with a&nbsp;single burst of sunshine\", as Andrew O'Hagan memorably described it \u2013 was not a&nbsp;propitious time to be in England, but Testino loved it from the day he arrived. \"England gave me a&nbsp;chance,\" he says. \"It's a very individual country where people have a personal style; they don't all follow a trend. The subtlety and wit of England is incredible, and they are very creative.\"</p> <p>In London Testino dyed his hair pink and moved into an apartment in an abandoned hospital just off the Strand. He and his friends threw parties dressed as doctors and nurses, and the occasional emergency-ward patient. Freed from the conventions of Peru, Testino flourished. By the time he decided to pick up a camera in 1980 he had already established himself at the centre of a group of gregarious friends whose social life he documented in candid snapshots rich in spontaneity and gesture. While his personal work reflected his easy wit and charm, however, his professional portraits tended towards the formal compositions of the English photographers he most admired: Cecil Beaton, Diana Cooper, Norman Parkinson.</p> <p>Only in the mid-90s, galvanised by then editor of French <em>Vogue</em>, Carine Roitfeld, did Testino realise he was impersonating a&nbsp;style that didn't become him. \"I was so in awe of everybody in the fashion business in England that I listened to them a lot, and not enough to myself,\" he says. \"At the end of the day you have to be you. You can't be anybody else. If you speak loudly and people tell you to speak quietly, you can do it for a little bit, but loud people are loud, and people who are not, are not.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397968685\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/About/General/2012/10/18/1350562821199/Mario-Testino-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Testino\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographer Mario Testino. Photograph: Charles Eshelman/FilmMagic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Eshelman/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exuberance clearly becomes him. Hamish Bowles, international editor at large for <em>Vogue</em>, met Testino in the early 80s and recalls a trip to Seville to shoot a&nbsp;story for <em>Harpers &amp; Queen</em>, where Bowles was then fashion and style director. Although they had no budget for locations, Testino directed their driver to take them to the richest neighbourhood in the city. \"Mario leapt out at the very chicest, richest-looking house of all and, while I squirmed in embarrassment on the back seat, proceeded to chat up the owner, who was tending flowers in the front garden.\" The upshot was that Testino and Bowles were soon the toast of Seville. \"Dinners were thrown for us hither and yon,\" recalls Bowles. \"We shot in the most ravishing, utterly private houses in the city. The pictures, dripping with atmosphere and attitude, were a wild success.\"</p> <p>Sixteen years separate Testino's first royal portrait and his now-famous session with Princess Diana for <em>Vanity Fair, </em>shot shortly before her death in 1997, and the circumstances between those two shoots is a study in contrasts and reflects the ambition that propelled him to the front ranks of portrait photography. In 1981 Testino had the serendipity to find the perfect perch from which to photograph the route of the wedding of Charles and Diana. \"I was sitting on top of a mailbox in the street, part of the masses, looking at this procession of carriages, and I took a picture of the Queen Mother in her carriage with Prince Edward,\" he recalls. \"She looked like she saw me and knew me \u2013 she looked straight into the camera.\"</p> <p>That portrait, as well as those of Princess Diana \u2013 \"We died laughing,\" he recalls of the celebrated shoot \u2013 are included in a separate exhibition at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, discreetly set apart from the broader body of Testino's work with its combustible mix of sex and celebrity. Testino has too much respect for the monarchy (and too much savvy) to hang a&nbsp;portrait of William and Kate next to a&nbsp;mooning Brazilian. In his non-magazine work, in particular, there is a lot of flesh, a lot of sensual bodies in close proximity. The jacket of his first book, <em>Any Objections</em>, published in 1998, shows a broad panorama of male sunbathers lounging with each other on Rio's Ipanema beach. Shots inside get more intimate: Naomi Campbell, dress hoisted around her waist, and Kate Moss, pants around her ankles, sitting on toilets opposite each other; three handsome young men lolling naked in bed; a young man in Tangiers failing to conceal his arousal.</p> <p>\"I never notice a difference between photographing a man and a woman; for me, it's just somebody,\" says Testino. \"I've never wanted to call myself any sexuality, because I hate the idea of taking freedom away from you, and I&nbsp;think we all can be everything. I understand that at moments you have to define it, but my sexuality has been so wide and open, and that's what's influenced my way of working. I think it's given me freedom, my sexuality.\"</p> <p>His openness is also, perhaps, at the root of his chameleon-like ability to move through different societies without arousing suspicion. He remembers visiting New York as a&nbsp;13-year-old and brazenly introducing himself to a&nbsp;table of strangers in a restaurant. \"My mum was, like: 'How can you do that? How can you just talk to anybody?' I think from then on my mother understood that I was meant for the world, in a way. She was very generous because she <em>allowed</em> me to be <em>me</em>; she didn't try to make me fit into her agenda, as most parents in Peru did back then.\"</p> <p>Testino's mother also warned him when he moved to London that he'd never feel 100% English or 100% Peruvian, though his endless roaming has turned him into a consummate cosmopolitan, at ease in almost any city. \"I get laughed at by my English friends because they sometimes say I know more about the subtleties of England than they do, and I celebrate it a&nbsp;lot,\" he says. \"As much as&nbsp;I am into the new and the cutting edge and the underground, I'm also very much into&nbsp;tradition. Just because you like Italian food it&nbsp;doesn't mean you abandon Chinese food,&nbsp;French food or Japanese food. I&nbsp;like everything.\"</p> <p>Nor does he apparently tire of coming back for seconds and thirds. While shooting Keira Knightley for the cover of an upcoming issue of <em>Allure</em>, the pair worked out they'd shot together at least 10 times \u2013 unusual for an actor, since they only shoot when they have a&nbsp;project to promote.</p> <p>\"Anna Wintour is another,\" says Testino. \"Every year I go to photograph her for the Met Ball \u2013 her, her kids.\" He tells a story of being summoned to shoot a passport photo of Wintour and her first child, which seems a&nbsp;tad unnecessary, yet also perfect. His persistence in shooting Gisele B\u00fcndchen is widely credited with elevating her to supermodel status. \"Nobody liked her, nobody wanted her,\" he says. \"I had to fight to get her into my stories because nobody thought she was right \u2013 too <em>this</em>, too <em>that</em>, the nose, the breasts, the waist. But I&nbsp;believe in being obsessed, in getting obsessed.\"</p> <p>Although Testino has shot many women, from Madonna to Lady Gaga, he regrets not having the opportunity to shoot more men. \"I never photographed Sean Penn,\" he says ruefully, and then frowns. \"Actually I&nbsp;did. At a&nbsp;party. It's a&nbsp;great picture \u2013 he's lighting a&nbsp;cigarette for Naomi [Campbell]. For a while they used to say that I&nbsp;document men better than women, but there's no business in men, so I&nbsp;started to photograph women like crazy.\"</p> <p>Lately the photographer has found himself drawn back to his native Peru, where his mother recently celebrated her 90th birthday. \"It's a&nbsp;funny thing, how we start in one place and we end up some place else,\" he says. \"But&nbsp;now I'm being pulled back to my country \u2013 it's my duty, almost.\" Last July he launched a&nbsp;new arts foundation, Asociaci\u00f3n Mario Testino, or Mate, that houses a&nbsp;large collection of his photography as well as the work of other Peruvian artists.</p> <p>\"I find Peru incredibly happening at the moment and I think I have a role there,\" he says. \"I think the problem with my generation is that we didn't have communication \u2013 nothing we have today to access the world existed back then. It made people closed-minded, and today it's like being anywhere else in the world.\"</p> <p>Oddly for a photographer whose work is now in the collections of major museums and galleries, Testino claims to be unconcerned with legacy. \"I compare life to a party, and when it's over, its over,\" he says. \"I didn't feel I&nbsp;needed children, either. People feel they need children because they're leaving something behind. I don't need to leave anything behind. The only thing that concerns me is the now.\"</p> <p>He is a man who will soon be on his way to another country, another shoot, another day.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My mother loved opera.</strong> When I was a child she took us to see <em>Medea</em> in Central Park. When Medea kills her kids left right and centre. I thought: \"Ma, what are you trying to tell us here?\"</p> <p><strong>I survived the abuse I grew up around thanks to my heritage. </strong>I come from a&#xa0;line of great Sicilian women, and their mentality is to endure and push through to the other side.</p> <p><strong>My sister and I used to play at mass.</strong> I'd be the faithful parishioner and she was always the priest.

Of course, if they really were serving Necco candy a lot more kids would have gone to communion.</p> <p><strong>\"Free love\" was a crock of shit.</strong> If you were a woman and you didn't put out you were frigid; if you did put out you were a whore. You didn't really have control over your own sexuality \u2013 when you were in the bedroom it was a negotiation.</p> <p><strong>Men and women are different. </strong>I don't think men grow a brain until 26 or even 30. Girls mature a lot quicker.</p> <p><strong>I wanted \"Girls Just Want To Have Fun\" to be a feminist anthem. </strong>It was written by a guy, but my producer said: \"Think about what it could mean.\" In my head I saw my mother's face, I saw my grandmother's face, and I thought: \"OK, I'm going to make an anthem for every woman of every colour to make sure they know they can have a free spirit and a heart that thinks.\"</p> <p><strong>Fame doesn't redeem you.</strong> It takes a long time to get there, and when you're finally there you realise you still have authority figures telling you what to do.</p> <p><strong>Bob Dylan told me he didn't like chicks in bands. </strong>I think some male rock stars were scared of me at the time; they saw me as this scary, unhinged woman.

  "<p>When you go to Paris you visit the Louvre, of&#xa0;course; you'll check out the Gaud\u00ed in Barcelona, if only by gazing up at its improbable exterior; people visiting Cornwall always make their weary hosts drive them to the seaside Tate. But how often do we actually go round&#xa0;the major \"sights\" as a tourist would in our own home towns? In London if you've got children to educate or amuse you'll maybe get them down to Greenwich by river, or take them to the wetlands centre in Barnes, but many of us can go from one year's end to the next without seeing half the things a keen overseas visitor would see in a fortnight. We'll usually go when there's something new \u2013 an exhibition at the V&amp;A or an event at St&#xa0;Paul's \u2013 but there's no compulsion to&#xa0;go and gaze in a general way.</p> <p>Yet it can be done: I met my young and keen next-door neighbours coming down the road with an unlikely collection of souvenirs, including an enormous bush from some farmer's market: \"We've had a weekend holiday at home!\" they said happily \u2013 not the same, I gathered, as that&#xa0;odd term \"staycation\", which tends just to mean trying&#xa0;to keep warm on&#xa0;a&#xa0;British beach&#xa0;rather&#xa0;than trying to keep cool in the Mediterranean. But it made me think: why have I&#xa0;never crossed the Thames in that foot tunnel or seen the aquarium in the old GLC building? Must try harder.</p>",
  "<p>During my years as a temporary New Yorker, it was my honour to befriend \u2013 and meet regularly for lunch \u2013 a Welshman who is among those rare people to qualify for that devalued and over-used term \"genius\": John Cale, known most commonly as the bass and viola player for the Velvet Underground, which is a shame, for he is the composer of so much more and better music since.</p> <p>We met usually on Fridays, when his touring schedule and my deadlines permitted, at an excellent trattoria called Bar Pitti on the corner of 6th Avenue and Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. Our conversations were a delight, as exhausting as they were relaxing because the subject matter hurtled between politics (Blair and Bush were at war), music, the random pointlessness of existence, weird nooks and crannies of history, literature and our daughters.</p> <p>Some of Cale's favourite subjects \u2013 digital technology and espionage \u2013 left me bewildered. And I never knew he was interested in the obscurities of haute cuisine; there was no need to acknowledge such an issue in Bar Pitti, which was proof that nothing beats simple food \u2013<em> cucina casalinga</em> (literally \"housewives' cooking\") \u2013 done well. He would nibble at salted spinach while I enjoyed farfalle ai funghi porcini. After decades of rock'n'roll excess, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwzaifhSw2c\" title=\"\">Venus in Furs</a>, illness and injectable adventures, he was, and remains, a remarkably fit, teetotal 70-year-old. Crucially, however, he would attack the panna cotta smothered in chocolate sauce with as much relish as I did.</p> <p>When he uprooted, 3,000 miles west to LA, and I moved the same distance in the opposite direction to London, we determined to remain in touch. We usually meet at Daunt Books on Holland Park Avenue, exchange gifts to read, then walk and talk in the park. And when we ate, it was invariably at Wagamama, to accommodate his need for soya and carrot juice. I drank Asian beer and found it hard to taste the food \u2013 so we found a compromise to suit us both: fantastic Lebanese mezze at a place called Al-Waha on Westbourne Grove. There was one especially memorable lunch there, for which Cale arrived with his manager Nita and daughter Eden, having just received his OBE from Prince Charles \u2013 he still wore the suit, and hair he had dyed pink for the occasion.</p> <p>But now, for this article, Cale wants to try something more elaborate. Over in London to promote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/27/john-cale-popandrock\" title=\"his new album Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood\">his new album <em>Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood</em></a>, he opts for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/27/jay-rayner-dinner-heston-blumenthal\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>, Heston Blumenthal's restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge.</p> <p>For me, this is like boarding a space craft to some very weird planet. We sit by the window overlooking Hyde Park, and as ever we seem to continue the conversation we were having last time. \"They've created an economy in&#xa0;America where people get rich in a certain way,\" he reflects. \"It's a&#xa0;new kind of money with a new kind of power.\"</p> <p>I get the impression, looking at our fellow diners and the businessmen drinking champagne in little corners with ladies to whom they may not be married, that we are the only people in here having this conversation.</p> <p>The menu is made up of Olde Englishe dishes, with dates of their original debuts. Cale starts with nettle porridge (dating from 1660) made of \"roast cod palate\" which, the waiter explains, is a \"cod's tongue cooked very slowly from the inside\". Cale loves it. \"This is delicious,\" he affirms, while I get to learn how big cods' tongues are \u2013 it includes their throats, and this one, the waiter says, has been cooked for 72 hours at 56 degrees.</p> <p>As a vegetarian, I pose a difficulty, and start with a cold broth of lamb, without the lamb, and Cale is riveted by the fact that an egg floating about in it had been poached for several hours. He tells me about all this: it's called cryogenic or sous-vide cooking. He describes one machine which enables the chefs to \"control the temperature of the water \u2013 a big thing with dials on it\" while nitrogen is used to freeze.</p> <p>I try to work out why Cale never talked about any of this before, and why he is so passionate about it now: this is test-tube cooking, the opposite of <em>cucina casalinga</em> in Bar Pitti. It may be because he loves gadgets that work well, and more important, because he approves of people who know what they are doing and do it well. Cale loves competence, and expertise.</p> <p><strong>While waiting for our main courses, </strong>we also discuss the new album, which is compelling and typically innovative. Cale likes silly jokes \u2013 he sends them constantly by email \u2013 and understands how they reflect the absurdity of life,&#xa0;which is why this record has a silly title.</p> <p>He also remains strongly attached to his roots and childhood in South Wales. On such occasions as the premiere of an epic orchestration of his 1973 album<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jun/23/popandrock.shopping1\" title=\" Paris 1919\"> <em>Paris 1919</em></a> in Cardiff, or launching a UK tour in Wrexham, the crowds have loved his Welsh greetings \u2013 a man once leaned over me in the front row during a gig at the Cardiff Coal Exchange and affirmed at high, drunken volume: \"He's ours.\"</p> <p>And Cale loves experimentation with sound \u2013 this is his quintessence, and in this he can never stay still.</p> <p>So on this new album we have a convergence of all these themes: surreal humour, connection to childhood and a soundscape that winds through thickets of lyricism to what Cale rightly calls, \"the soundtrack to a claustrophobic film\". Some of it is, he says, \"about the trauma of childhood\", the music full of mood swings but with \"moments of shelter\", as he puts it.</p> <p>Perhaps that is why he likes this experimentation with food \u2013 it is technological.</p> <p>His roast turbot now arrives. First cooked circa 1830, it is served with \"cockle ketchup\" and Cale gives the waiter quite a hard time over his account of how the dish was discovered by \"some of the British emperors who went to Malaysia and saw the recipe\" \u2013 which emperor? When and how did he or they go?</p> <p>I have rice and flesh, with saffron but without the calf tail specified on the menu, which makes it a risotto alla milanese \u2013 which is almost as good as some of the un-cryogenically cooked versions I've eaten in Milan, and better than many.</p> <p>At the end, something special happens. In the best tradition of his diet-busting panna cotta in New York, Cale insists on a dessert \u2013 something he had never done at Wagamama. And thank God he did, for along came a portion of brown bread ice cream and the recommended tipsy cake, pineapple-flavoured, roasted on a spit with apple juice and caramel, and doused in Marsala wine. \"Non-ghee,\" Cale adds, \"clarified butter\" \u2013 then he gave up: \"It's basically just a heavy dose of sugar.\"</p> <p>It was also succulent, sweet and so good that Cale asked for another portion to go. He's spent too long in America \u2013 it was against the rules.</p> <p>I suddenly remembered an uncle of my mother's in North Wales, who was Calvinist and avidly teetotal, but who always loved a second helping of potent sherry trifle with sabbath-day lunch after chapel. Maybe that was what Cale liked so much about tipsy cake, as he suddenly decides it is time to leave, springs out of his seat and walks out past the sheepishly secretive champagne-sipping couples.</p> <p>Outside, by One Hyde Park, with its Ferrari showroom on the ground floor, we meet Cale's manager and the album promotion team. Had we had a good lunch? \"Delicious, very good,\" says the satisfied musician, \"did you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, thanks,\" replies the girl from the record label, \"we went to the Lebanese.\"</p> <p><em>Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood is out now on Double Six/Domino Records</em></p>",
  "<p>The video clip on YouTube already has the feel of a history lesson. It has taken on the atmosphere of a fateful moment, a before and after, like the signing of the Yalta treaty, or a Moonie wedding. The moment of the launch of Facebook as a $100bn public company seemed to show the myth of the American Dream in real time, visual proof that something \u2013 potentially the world's most valuable entity \u2013 had been made out of nothing, a simple idea in the head of a Harvard undergraduate. Half a year on, it looks as much an ending as a beginning.</p> <p>You can see a lot of that story in the film clip, on faces gathered outside Facebook's headquarters at Hacker Square in Menlo Park, California, on 18 May 2012. Our digital age has acclimatised us to extreme numbers, the winner-takes-all lottery of wealth distribution, but rarely have we seen such a group of people instantaneously enriched beyond their imagination.

One second they can count their wealth in five or six zeroes, the next in eight or nine or 10. As the clip rolls and Mark Zuckerberg signs his name on a transparent Nasdaq screen, signalling that Facebook is open for trading, an&#xa0;excitement passes through the crowd. On the TechCrunch website there is a ticker running, a reckoning of instant plutocracy: \"Ted Ullyot, general counsel, $234,181,060. Mike Schroepfer, VP of engineering, $340,141,012. Mark Zuckerberg, $20,305,226,592\u2026\" How do the&#xa0;people attached to these numbers look? They look happy, fit to burst.</p> <p>That happiness, at that moment, extended far beyond Hacker Square. It extended to all the investors large and small who believed. Zuckerberg, 28, had long demanded faith in Facebook. And all his believers knew the story \u2013 they had all seen the movie, and most importantly they felt the insistent pulse the social network had generated in their own lives. On the clip after Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, presents Zuckerberg, \"your visionary, your leader\", with a commemorative hoodie, the world's favourite boy wonder, makes a little speech reaffirming that faith. \"Here's the thing,\" he says in his slightly disconnected way, \"our mission isn't to be a public company. Our mission is to make the world more open and connected\u2026 All of you out there have built the largest community in the world.\" Not surprisingly, as he speaks his colleagues have the moon-faced look of disciples at the Sermon on the Mount captured in medieval stained glass. They have been through a lot together; some, those crowded most closely around Zuckerberg, have been believers in his miracles from the start. Their rewards have come sooner than heaven.</p> <p>All of the night before, news networks have accessed all areas on the Facebook campus to capture the atmosphere before the big sell-off. The Facebook workers, or hackers, as they prefer, have duly performed like children on Christmas Eve. They have given up on sleep and engaged in the ultimate \"hackathon\", playing roller hockey in the square, watching movies, camping out on sofas and doing bits of programming for the site, ordering in Chinese and pizza, recreating once again the essential exportable spirit of their organisation: faces illuminated into the early hours by laptop screens, buzzing on energy drinks, silently instant messaging across the room, making the world ever more connected before our very eyes.</p> <p>They have not been thinking about performance cars and stupidly early retirement; they have been thinking, as ever, about enhanced user experiences and ever-cooler interfaces. Still, they are aware that for days and weeks the valuation of their company has been the subject of mass speculation. The wisdom of a Silicon Valley crowdsourced poll has produced an aggregate of the expected value of Facebook come the end of the first day of trading. The figure that has been collectively arrived at is $135.1bn\u2013 a single-day rise that represents more than a gain of one-third of the opening offer price of $38 per share. The investment bankers handling the offering, Morgan Stanley, have surely been conservative in their thinking, the crowdsourced feeling goes; they wouldn't want to risk their credibility on an inflated valuation.</p> <p>There is much talk of a \"pop\" on the news networks: \"Do you think we will see a pop?\" \"How big a pop do you think there will be?\" The pop in question refers to the explosive growth as the stock hits the market, like a kernel of corn reacting to a hot pan. For those few cynics among the faithful \u2013 who perhaps have a working knowledge of Charles Mackay's 1841 volume <em>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</em>, or who at least had, as they like to say, \"drilled down into the figures\" and placed their bets accordingly \u2013 that pop was also, you guess, the sound of bubbles bursting.</p> <p>Nearly six months on, those doubters with their sober analysis or contrarian instincts, who gambled against Facebook stock from the beginning, have been counting their winnings. Daniel Niles, who runs the AlphaOne Capital Partners, made millions of dollars for his investors by \"shorting\" Facebook the moment it opened for trading at $42 a share. Shorting involves borrowing quantities of shares and selling them at the high price, waiting for the price to fall, then buying other cheaper shares to return to the lender and pocketing the difference. Niles explained his analysis as follows: \"If you looked at Facebook, the good news was you had a very public comparable company with a lot of the same issues and good things going on, which is Google. To some extent, it was like two houses on the same block\u2026 But you look at Google, and investors were valuing it at roughly six times annual revenues; and you look at Facebook, and despite it growing [only] twice as fast as Google, they valued it at about 24 times revenue\u2026 To me, this looked like a recipe for disaster, and that's why we shorted at the open.\" Another such investor, representing a major fund, described his decision with slightly less mathematical nuance: \"My mother asked me to get Facebook shares and she has never been interested in IPOs [initial public offerings] before. A cab driver asked me about the IPO, too. That's when you want to short it.\"</p> <p>On the first day of trading, markets reported that the share price had been propped up by Morgan Stanley, the bank that had acted as the lead underwriter in the sale on Facebook's behalf. What had looked like a&#xa0;major coup for the bank's Silicon Valley investment chief Michael Grimes quickly became a headache. In an attempt to defend the $38 opening price some observers suggested the bank may have spent a billion dollars buying back stock, though Morgan Stanley will not comment on the issue.</p> <p>A few even among the closest circle of Facebook believers were perhaps not quite as faithful as they at first seemed. Peter Thiel, the canny founder of PayPal, who had invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, cashed in a&#xa0;thousand times that on the first day of trading. On the right side of things, as ever, Goldman Sachs, which had bought a $500m share in the company last November, sold about another billion dollars straightaway, as did Zuckerberg, in what turned out to be nice wedding gift to himself when he tied the knot with his long-term girlfriend Priscilla Chan in a surprise ceremony the day after flotation.</p> <p>Even by the time Zuckerberg and Chan were on honeymoon in Rome a postmortem on the IPO and share price, which had by then fallen almost $10, was underway. It was already being talked of as the most disastrous IPO in history; and the first lawsuits had been filed. Facebook spokespeople united with Morgan Stanley in suggesting that technical glitches on the Nasdaq system, which delayed the start of trading by 45 minutes and saw investors struggle to get confirmation of trades, had damaged confidence. Major fund managers laid the blame with the decision, in the week before the IPO, to increase the number of shares being sold by 25% and to raise the asking price from a range between $28 and $35 to one between $34 and $38. A $100bn valuation had a convenient headline ring to it.</p> <p>At the same time a hardening rumour persisted that those closest to the deal were party to more information than regular small-time investors. By 23 May, shareholders had filed five lawsuits against Facebook in New York and California. That number quickly swelled to around 40. On 1&#xa0;June, three small Facebook shareholders \u2013 David Goldberg, Kevin Hyms and Garrett Garrison, who had invested retirement funds and lifetime savings \u2013 filed a class action suit against Zuckerberg and his company. Court records detailing their case argue that Facebook had been less than forthcoming about the fact that in the weeks leading up to flotation there had been a downgraded forecast of revenue, which had caused some analysts, even those at Morgan Stanley, to revise down confidence in the company \u2013 information only allegedly shared with major investors. Facebook and its underwriters strongly refute these allegations. The case, which will be heard on behalf of perhaps thousands of IPO believers, mums and taxi drivers among them, will also draw on evidence from the Securities and Exchange Commission about Facebook's apparent reluctance to release some key data \u2013 notably the way it counted mobile users, and the revenue it generated from them \u2013 even when pressed to do so. Facebook will argue that it displayed no such equivocation and that such exchanges were a&#xa0;normal part of such a process.</p> <p>Andrew Goldenberg, one of the attorneys representing Goldberg, Hyms and Garrison, described how the three men came to his office \"confused and frustrated and angry\u2026 They are not sophisticated investors,\" he said. \"They thought they were buying into a company that had a promising future.\" Nearly 200 others followed that trio and are now part of the claim. \"They all tell the same story,\" Goldenberg said. \"They feel cheated. You are talking about an unprecedented loss after five months for this kind of high-profile IPO. Hype drove it, and that is fine. But you can't do that on the basis of incomplete information. They feel it is another example of the citizen being taken advantage of by these banks and big corporations.\"</p> <p>Where money has been lost on such a scale, conspiracies abound, but two key reasons for the freefall of the stock price, which quickly lost half of its value, seem to have existed in plain sight. The first was the timing of an announcement by General Motors, which the day before the IPO made the decision to pull all advertising from Facebook, suggesting that, having looked hard at its numbers, it had no clear evidence that advertising on the site was effective. The second, perhaps more fundamental, explanation for the market's pessimism lay in the rhetoric of Mark Zuckerberg.</p> <p>Zuckerberg had never been convinced he should take his company public, though regulatory changes made it inevitable. He worried about shareholders who wanted Facebook's first thought to be its bottom line rather than its product. And he feared a loss of control. To this end, he had created two classes of shares, which guaranteed that he would have 57% voting control of Facebook with only a 28% financial stake. His anxieties were realised almost immediately.</p> <p>Zuckerberg was used to updating users of his site, but not so practised at reassuring investors. Before the IPO he affirmed what he repeated at the moment of the sale: that he did not see himself primarily as a man in charge of a multibillion-dollar business but rather as a man on a mission to teach the world to poke in perfect harmony. Fundholders are not traditionally seduced by missionaries.</p> <p>Over the summer Zuckerberg was strangely silent, as if adjusting to his new realities: married life and problems at the office. He had perhaps the first premonitions of what all prodigies discover: that he, too, would have to grow up. In his first call with major investors at the end of July, he pursued a line about the Facebook model that \"the best type of advertising is a message from a friend\". This had sounded reasonable enough when he had uttered it to interviewers and journalists over the years, and it seemed to chime with popular psychology about tipping points \u2013 but was it really true? And if so, where did it leave companies like General Motors, which were spending a small fortune on creating consistent messages about their products that were measurable in terms of sales?</p> <p>Over the few years since its inception, Facebook had been somewhat cavalier about its revenue strategies, making the seductive argument that once it had a critical mass of users, money would surely follow. Google had solved the intractable problem of how to monetise its audience by having advertisers bid for keywords, selling sponsored links and charging for each time a user clicked on them. Facebook's advertising model was always more intangible, based largely on precisely targeted display adverts and the vaunted \"engagement\" of the user, who typically spends an hour a day on the site. In a widely quoted figure, Google made $88 from each of its users, Facebook only $15. Moreover, Google's model worked potentially equally well on mobile formats as on desktops. Facebook had been slow to see the shift to mobile, and that apparent anxiety over releasing user data which angered the likes of Hyms, Goldberg and Garrison suggested they were still troubled by the problem of how to make effective use of display advertising on a&#xa0;screen no bigger than a playing card.</p> <p>Zuckerberg's first public appearance was on a technology platform in September \u2013 he talked 10 to the dozen for 20 minutes about the new realities of his business. His message had changed somewhat in the months since the YouTube clip. There was a little less emphasis on the incontrovertible value of pursuing an open and connected world and a little more on the prospect of specific plans for generating increased advertising revenue from \"monetising eyeballs\". Zuckerberg admitted the company's previous strategy for mobile (he pronounced the word to rhyme with \"no bull\") had been wrong. But without too many specifics, he was confident Facebook could eventually make more money per user on mobile phones than on desktops. He was also in the bizarre position, having lately made a&#xa0;good many of his staff wealthy beyond reason, of having to face questions about office morale and employee retention. He talked soberly of incentive packages and share schemes, and hoped that his people would stay with him: \"It is not the first up and down we have had.\"</p> <p>One of the things Facebook has added to the culture in the few years of its existence has been a redefinition of some of the most common elements of our language. It has, according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, changed our understanding of the words \"like\" and \"friend\", not to mention \"poke\". It&#xa0;is, Zuckerberg hinted, about to tamper with the dictionary entry for \"want\" in the same way. Users will be able to have the product they want at the click of a mouse.</p> <p>The shifting of linguistic usage extends pointedly to the purpose of the company itself. As David Kirkpatrick, Facebook's authorised biographer, notes, one characteristic of the first eight years was a tendency for Zuckerberg and his inner circle to sit around late at night and try to establish exactly what business they were in. These reported conversations are remarkable, in a way, for their lack of clarity. Early on Zuckerberg liked to refer to his creation as \"a directory of people\" in these discussions (arguably not the most marketable of propositions); Sean Parker, the maverick first president of the company, used to suggest Facebook was \"a device you carried around and pointed at people and it would tell you all about them\". Later Zuckerberg resolved that it was a product \"to help people understand the world around them\".</p> <p>If that was its higher purpose, however, the business Facebook has been in from the start is&#xa0;disclosure. Its products are its users and their friends, who willingly supply personal data about themselves and their habits and tastes on a scale previously unimaginable. Its clients are corporations which can exploit that information to understand an individual's desires and to sell them things based on that knowledge. Facebook's data bank can in this way do empirically what Don Draper of <em>Mad Men</em> did instinctively \u2013 it will reveal its users' moment-by-moment wants, conscious and subconscious, and attempt to satisfy them.</p> <p>Zuckerberg's genius has been to find a way to not only track and store all of that data but also to make it accountable to an identifiable individual, all in the process of \"sharing\". Facebook rightly makes great capital of its uniquely \"granular\" privacy tools while whispering all the time about the liberating virtues of total transparency and openness. In this it shares a philosophy with its great rival, Google. As Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, once observed of the implicit contract of internet usage: \"If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\"</p> <p>Given that its product is its community, you would have thought that Facebook's announcement earlier this month that it had signed up its one-billionth user might have sparked a rally in its share price. In fact that announcement produced not a blip in the markets, which maintained stubbornly that Facebook was worth less than half what it had been on 18 May. To celebrate the remarkable statistic that one in six people on the planet was now a Facebook user, Zuckerberg noted on his home page another new definition of what his company had become. \"We belong to a rich tradition of people making things that bring us together,\" he wrote. \"We honour the humanity of the people we serve. We honour the everyday things people have always made to bring us together: chairs, doorbells, airplanes, bridges, games.\"</p> <p>This curious list, which sounded like it had been conceived after one too many hackathons, re-emerged a few days later as Facebook's first-ever piece of brand advertising. A&#xa0;commercial to be released in 13 key territories visualised Zuckerberg's extended simile: Facebook was like a chair, because people connect with each&#xa0;other when they sit together. That kind of thing.</p> <p>On message boards and blog posts the advert also appeared to suggest a&#xa0;quality that Facebook had never previously communicated and which is arguably the last thing an advert really needs: desperation. The ad was the work of Wieden + Kennedy, which is credited with the \"Just do it\" branding for Nike, but you can't help feeling its sentiment was Zuckerberg's own. The CEO likes to talk in mantras, and the one he has been repeating for a few years now is the apparently neat idea that \"Facebook is a utility\". This then was his somewhat clunky attempt to show that Facebook's \"place on earth\" was now a fixture; it is literally part of the furniture.</p> <p>Is that true? Certainly for millions of its avid and addicted updaters it may sometimes seem that Facebook has become as fundamental to their lives as electricity. Existence without Facebook may be social suicide in those quarters, but could it really be said to have become a&#xa0;necessity? Zuckerberg, seldom shy of ambition, is placing his faith in the idea that it is, or that one day soon it will be. The share price depends on it. He wants us to believe his company will be not one communication platform among many, but will pretty much make up a&#xa0;global network itself. Zuckerberg has, until very recently, an enviable track record of being right in such hunches. And undoubtedly there is an argument that given both its reach and its financial muscle Facebook is here for good and that things can only get better. It may still be that the YouTube clip will be played to future generations in history lessons as the moment when the means by which they most naturally engaged was first formally valued by the world \u2013 and that after a summer of discontent its growth never let up. Or it may just look like the best of times for the social network, and that nothing of&#xa0;the future was ever quite so sunny.</p>",
  "<p>It's only page 10 of Beth Ditto's slim but gripping memoir and we're already eating squirrels. Three luckless rodents are shot by Ditto's stoned cousin Dean, who skins them, guts them, fries them up and devours them in a fit of the munchies. He leaves the clearing-up to Ditto, who has just had her first suck on a bong made out of a Coke can.</p> <p>All this was normal in Ditto's native semi-rural Arkansas in the early 90s. \"My dad liked to boil a squirrel head and suck the brains out the nose,\" Ditto expands. \"Smaller than a chicken, bigger than a rat. I hadn't eaten squirrel since I was a kid,\" she confides, \"and it would take more than stoner munchies to get me to snack on it again.\"</p> <p>Anyone au fait with the rise of Beth Ditto and her gay-positive punk band, Gossip (formerly the Gossip), will recall that formative squirrel-eating was, in the early years, a big part of Ditto's extraordinary USP. After six years underground, Gossip tore up 2006 with a dancefloor anthem, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opWBRRCTDXg\" title=\"\">Standing in the Way of Control</a>, which started out as a protest against the Bush government's stance on gay marriage and quickly became the soundtrack for Channel 4 teen drama <a href=\"(http://www.e4.com/video/x5MeAzj6l4qNPYQeiQdzs/play.e4\" title=\"\"><em>Skins</em></a>, before becoming inescapable.</p> <p>In the process, Ditto \u2013 soul-voiced, plus-sized, outspoken, glam \u2013 went from being the charismatic front-woman of a cult band to being feted as a mainstream icon; the indie version of becoming a princess. Her deprived Arkansas childhood was a significant part of the coal-to-diamonds myth: times were hard, protein was protein.</p> <p>In her new life, though, she partied with Kate Moss; appeared naked on magazine covers, in a glorious effort to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beth_Ditto_Love_Mag.jpg\" title=\"\">counteract body fascism</a>; and even became an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/whatwouldbethdittodo\" title=\"\">agony aunt</a> for the <em>Guardian</em>, a role that suited her down to the ground.</p> <p>Ditto had been trying to solve the problems of her ailing aunt Jannie, her troubled mother, and her vulnerable younger siblings and cousins before her move, after high school, to the more simpatico climes of the Pacific north west. There, thanks to the vibrant punk subculture \u2013 one rife with feminist leanings \u2013 that spawned Kurt Cobain, gay alterna-misfits could not only feel at home: they were almost 10 a penny.</p> <p>The squirrels are just the half of it, though. A year ago, some of the bait trailing this autobiography was the promise of <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/gossip/55464\" title=\"\">graphic sexual revelations</a> \u2013 or at least, those were the quotes that got reported. Nonetheless, Ditto hinted at passages about going down on girls; stuff that would make squirrels blanch.</p> <p>Actually, Ditto's adult sex life is dealt with primly, when at all. The prurient should know there's no cunnilingus here, and move along. Other omissions are more puzzling. We end the book thinking Ditto's still going out with her long-time transgendered partner, Freddie, when in fact she is engaged to marry her former assistant Kristin Ogata next year. A sterner co-writer (she had help from San Francisco poet Michelle Tea) or a firmer editor might have helped with the confusing leaps about in time, too.</p> <p>No, the shocks lie elsewhere. \"I started begging Anthony to knock me up,\" writes Ditto, of her high-school boyfriend (she hadn't quite come out yet). As much as Ditto felt a misfit in Judsonia, Arkansas \u2013 Christian, poor, isolated \u2013 there was a part of her that craved babies, and would have preferred not to burn in hell. Anthony, to his credit, refused; possibly the one instance in which any man in this book acquits himself with anything like decency. The other exception is Nathan Howdeshell (also known as Brace Paine), Gossip's guitarist, and Ditto's buddy since high school, one of a crowd of slightly older misfits who instructed Ditto in what little counterculture Judsonia allowed in.</p> <p>A different book review might reveal the full horror of Ditto's ferociously dysfunctional childhood, and its repercussions. Suffice to say, it makes <em>The Jeremy Kyle Show</em> look like <em>Waybuloo</em>. But the right to tell that story is Ditto's, and is included in the book price.</p> <p>Of all the music autobiographies published this autumn, this one is, probably, the lightest on music. There's little exegesis of Gossip's many excellent albums, only one of which is famous. But you don't miss it, because Ditto's own trials and tribulations \u2013 told largely in her own voice \u2013 are so riveting. And it is surely the only rock memoir to use the word \"hornswoggled\" \u2013 another good reason to just get past the squirrel thing, and appreciate the real meat here.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price \u00a322,995</strong><br><strong>MPG 61.4</strong><br><strong>Top speed 126mph</strong></p> <p><em>Dear Martin, I've just got divorced and I'm in the market for a new car. I want something with great looks, that's cheap to run and that won't let me down. Any ideas? Rachel, by email</em></p> <p>Sometimes writing about cars can feel like being a relationship counsellor. We're in search of excitement, happiness, dependability, sexiness\u2026 All I'd have to do is replace the word \"car\" with \"partner\".</p> <p>Anyway, if you are back in the automotive dating game \u2013 maybe you have suffered a domestic write-off and you're looking for a new ride \u2013 you'll be amazed how things have moved on.</p> <p>Take this latest family SUV from Mazda. Most new cars have a certain amount of carry-over from existing models within the range \u2013 baggage, if you like. The chassis may already feature on another car in the line-up, the interior may have been sourced from the group's parts bin. But this Mazda is all new. Untainted. Not only have the engine, transmission, chassis, bodyshell and styling never been seen before, but the thinking behind the drive train is groundbreaking, too.</p> <p>On the rear of the CX-5 you'll see a&#xa0;small badge that says: \"SkyActiv\". The CX-5 is the very first Mazda to carry the badge and in future all the Japanese maker's vehicles will feature SkyActiv technology. It amounts to a mission statement. While other manufacturers chase their tails creating futuristic hybrid and electric engines, Mazda's engineers have decided that there's still plenty of life left in the ICU (not intensive care unit, but internal combustion unit). You might say, that Mazda has rescued the ICU from the ICU! Ha\u2026 where were we? Oh, yes, so Mazda decided it was going to concentrate on improving existing technology and make its engines more efficient, its bodies lighter, and ensure its gearboxes were friction free.</p> <p>It's easy to make these sugared promises, but Mazda seems to have delivered with its CX-5. Two engines are on offer: a&#xa0;2-litre petrol and a&#xa0;2.2-litre diesel. The former boasts the highest compression ratio ever seen in a road car \u2013 this ensures that emissions are driven down, power output is pushed up and the minimum fuel possible is burned. The diesel, which I tested, is a real charmer \u2013 smooth, strong, quiet and responsive (we're back to dating).</p> <p>So much for the drive, what about the looks? The CX-5 is the first to feature what the company calls its \"Kodo\" design theme or \"soul in motion\". Not sure quite what that means, but it is handsome enough as far as family SUVs go and it has a pleasantly feline set to its chops. Inside it's remarkably spacious, with plenty of leg and head room in the back, plus an enormous boot. Handily, the parcel shelf can be stored under the floor \u2013 which is a lot better than losing it in the shed.</p> <p>So, if your relationship wish list features direct and focused steering, good grip and reasonable body control, along with a slick gear change as well as the ability to cope with a&#xa0;long run with the minimum of fuss, it might be worth spending a day test driving a Mazda CX-5.</p> <h2>Can women save money on insurance?<br></h2> <p>With less than three months until the EU gender ruling comes into force, women across the UK are preparing for the inevitable increase in their insurance premiums when they next come to renew. While the average car insurance policy for a young woman aged 17-25 currently stands at \u00a31,959, the EU ruling could mean an increase of up to 25% in quotes for women, according to The Association of British Insurers. <a href=\"http://autosaint.co.uk\" title=\"\">Autosaint</a>, the car insurance provider for young drivers, has released its top five tips on how young females can save once the prices rise:</p> <p><strong>1. Renew early:</strong> If your insurance is due within a couple of months after the gender ruling, it may be worth considering cancelling your existing insurance to renew before 21 December 2012 to receive the \"gender discount\". Weigh up your options carefully: you could lose your no-claims discount and incur cancellation charges, so be certain the discount is worthwhile.</p> <p><strong>2. Choose your car wisely:</strong> Choose a car with a small engine and don't buy an old banger - cars valued at under \u00a31,000 will be likely to increase your premium, not reduce it. After all, they are probably more likely to have a fault.</p> <p><strong>3. Occupation can make a difference:</strong> Occupations in female-dominated industries can help reduce premiums. For example, hairdressers and beauticians will have lower quotes than mechanics or electricians, as females are typically expected to be safer drivers. In addition, keep things simple. If you're a hairdresser, state it. Don't overcomplicate forms by calling yourself a creative hair manager. This can confuse insurance systems, causing them to default to occupations (such as manager) which may incur higher premiums.</p> <p><strong>4. Be honest about mileage </strong>If you only drive 5,000 miles per year, but state 20,000 on your insurance documents, this will significantly increase the amount you pay. Calculate how far you travel each week and work out your realistic mileage.</p> <p><strong>5. Telematics</strong> Telematics policies, which base premiums on how safely you drive, can reduce premiums by as much as 70%, compared to standard quotes. These policies include having a telematics box, installed in the policyholder's car, which will measure harsh braking activity, fast acceleration or if the driver is breaking the speed limit \u2013 all factors which will increase the premium on a quarterly basis. Drivers who continue to drive safely will benefit from the cheapest premiums.</p> <p>Email Martin at <a href=\"http://martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/martinlove\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/martinlove</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>",
  "<p>Despite the cult that later developed around her, Mary the mother of Jesus doesn't get a very good showing in the gospels. Jesus tells stories and parables about fathers but not mothers. There's a widow. There's a little advice to Martha about the value of housework. But mothers? No. Mary might have been the sacred womb that carried him but he's not that interested in her afterwards.</p> <p>In the Gospel of Matthew we're told that Jesus's mother and brothers come to see him preaching and want to speak to him: \"Someone told him, 'Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.' He replied to him, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?' Pointing to his disciples, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers'.\" Not the behaviour of a good Jewish son. At the wedding at Cana, where Jesus pulls his water-to-wine party trick, when Mary tries to talk to him Jesus replies brusquely: \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\". Maybe they'd never really got on.</p> <p>The tradition is, of course, that she knew his divinity from the start, and she remains still a potent figure in Christian myth and worship, but tradition is not text. When we go back to the gospels we find an irritable, not loving, relationship.</p> <p>Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn bravely takes this textual truth as his starting point for a gentle, thoughtful reimagining of Mary's own experience of her life in his new novella, <em>The Testament of Mary</em>. His Mary suspects her son is \"out of his mind\", just as the Gospel of Mark tells us Jesus's family did. She finds him frightening and distant. Though T\u00f3ib\u00edn mostly follows the Gospel stories faithfully, the gaps in Mary's narrative give him room to explore. His Mary is too fearful to stay at the foot of the cross when her life might be in danger; by the end of her life she's dabbling in idol-worship, having given up on the God she used to pray to.</p> <p>The novel doesn't challenge Jesus's miracles but does present them as disquieting as much as glorious. The raising of Lazarus is given the beautiful, dark, muted edge with which a pre-Enlightenment mind would have experienced it. Yes, it happened. No, it's not clear that it was a good idea \u2013 like the returned corpse in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey's_Paw\" title=\"\">The Monkey's Paw</a>, the dead do often come back wrong: \"Slowly, the figure dirtied with clay and covered in graveclothes wound around him began with great uncertainty to move \u2026 like some strange new creature jerking and wriggling towards life.\" Later we're told: \"Lazarus, it was clear to me, was dying. If he had come back to life it was merely to say a last farewell to it. He recognised none of us, barely appeared able to lift the glass of water to his lips as he was handed small pieces of soaked bread by his sisters.\"</p> <p>And no, even raising someone from the dead doesn't seem to be definitive proof of Jesus's divinity, either to Mary or to her friends. Of course not; in a culture where miracles are common, they also become commonplace. As post-Enlightenment readers, we can look at the raising of a single man \u2013 only one man seems a bit mean if he was the actual son of God \u2013 and think about comas, sickness that looks like death, the danger of premature burial in a desert culture where people are interred on the same day they die. T\u00f3ib\u00edn elegantly allows the space both for doubt and for belief.</p> <p>The lowering presence of the disciples in Mary's story is particularly effective. They hover in the background of the book, pressing Mary to tell them the stories they want to hear, the ones that prove that this interesting, charismatic teacher and healer was something far more than that. By the end of her life she's afraid of them, knowing that it'll be easier for them to say what they want about Jesus once she's dead.</p> <p>Since there are people who love to find reasons to take offence, <em>The Testament of Mary</em> might prove offensive for some. But, in fact, in places the book is almost too faithful to the Gospel text. T\u00f3ib\u00edn accepts without question, for example, the rather unlikely story that the temple priests were sufficiently influential among a general public who regularly rioted against them that they could force the crowd to call for Barabbas not Jesus during Pilate's version of \"Judea's Got (Criminal) Talent\": first prize pardon, second prize crucifixion. It's far more likely that, once he'd arrived in Jerusalem, a big city extremely accustomed to wandering preachers, Jesus just wasn't as popular as he'd been out in the sticks.</p> <p>Such minor quibbles aside, though, <em>The Testament of Mary</em> is an important and persuasive book: T\u00f3ib\u00edn's weary Mary, sceptical and grudging, reads as far more true and real than the saintly perpetual virgin of legend. And T\u00f3ib\u00edn is a wonderful writer: as ever, his lyrical and moving prose is the real miracle.</p> <p><em>Naomi Alderman's most recent novel is </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780670919901/the-liars-gospel\" title=\"\"><em>The Liars' Gospel</em></a><em> (Viking)</em></p>",
  "<p>The sound of distant gunfire disturbed the early-morning peace of&#xa0;a sunlit valley brilliant with tropical colours. A young woman with long brown hair was blocking the fern-shaded path. She was dressed in camouflage and holding a machine gun. The acronym on her lapels identified her as a member of the Farc, Colombia's most notorious&#xa0;guerrilla army. She was telling us to stop. She'd had orders from the sub-commander.</p> <p>I was on my way back to the Andean town of San Agust\u00edn, together with a friend from Bogot\u00e1, Julio, and a local guide who had led us to the remote moorland source of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena. The source was the culmination of a journey I had been planning for years \u2013 to travel the whole length of a river emblematic for me of all that was darkly alluring about South America. But it was only during the journey's final stage that I&#xa0;had had any true sense of danger.</p> <p>The past three days had been ones of near-constant fear. The ride on horseback along a&#xa0;steep and slippery jungle path had been scary enough, but it was the discovery soon after heading into the mountains that the Farc were around us that had made the tension almost unbearable. Only the night before, a group of heavily armed guerrillas had emerged from complete darkness to surprise us at the isolated farm where we had been staying. An erratically behaved man called Marlon had subjected us to a&#xa0;chaotic sociopolitical discourse, after which the guerrillas had all left, to our relief.</p> <p>But with the sound of that early-morning gunfire, my worst fears were returning. I&#xa0;was worried we had been caught up in a crossfire with the Colombian army, or else that the guerrillas had heard in the intervening hours that I&#xa0;was not an innocent tourist but rather a writer with contacts in the Colombian government. Jenny, the woman guerrilla detaining us, whom I&#xa0;identified as Marlon's girlfriend, could give us no idea of what was happening. We tried engaging her in conversation. As with most of her companions, she could have been&#xa0;little more than 18, but she revealed she had already been with the Farc for more than 13 years. She was probably one of its many members who had been stolen from their families.</p> <p>The sub-commander finally arrived, excusing himself for being late on the grounds that he had been&#xa0;practising his shooting. After some pleasantries, he outlined the Farc's plans for building a visitors' centre, for widening and improving the path we were on, and for making the area generally more enticing for tourists. Then he asked a question that enhanced yet more the unreality of the encounter. He wondered if I&#xa0;spoke any English. When I admitted to a reasonable knowledge of the language, he seemed delighted.</p> <p>\"Normally,\" he said, \"every Farc division has its English speaker, but&#xa0;we're without one at present. We&#xa0;need someone to translate a&#xa0;small&#xa0;text for us. Would you be able to help?\"</p> <p>\"Of course,\" I replied, flattered by having been mistaken for a Spaniard, and almost pleased to be of some help. Though I'd had serious doubts about ever returning home, the guerrillas had been unfailingly polite and friendly in their dealings with us.</p> <p>I glanced at the four-page leaflet that the sub-commander took out of the pocket of his bullet-carrying waistcoat. It was an assembly manual for a gun's laser sight. \"My technical English isn't so great,\" I confessed, \"and this is American English, which I find particularly difficult.\" Perhaps because of my fear, the morally questionable nature of what I had been asked to do had still not dawned on me. \"Don't worry,\" reassured the sub-commander, \"we'll show you how a gun works and help you with the more specialist terms.\"</p> <p>As we were led off to an improvised hut commanding extensive views over the beautiful valley, the absurdity of the situation we had landed ourselves in mixed with the fear. I was almost repressing a giggle on sitting down at an outdoor table to embark on what Julio called \"our homework\".</p> <p>Julio proposed that he would write down my translation, while Jenny gave me the correct technical terms for the different parts of the machine gun she was carrying. I&#xa0;began the task as a true professional, searching for eloquent and fluent Spanish for the clumsy and stilted English. Fortunately I soon realised I didn't have a clue what the pamphlet was about.</p> <p>Jenny thought it might help if she unpacked the actual laser sight, so she did, as if she were a child who had been handed a&#xa0;new toy. Too impatient to wait until I&#xa0;had worked out the instructions, she attempted hamfistedly to put together its various parts and then attach it to the gun. A wave of paternal tenderness came over me as I watched her, followed by a tense irritation as she started dropping the tiny and doubtless irreplaceable components on the ground. \"Please be careful,\" I&#xa0;admonished. \"If we lose any piece we might as well throw the whole thing away.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398055687\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/17/1350479847961/graffiti-001.jpg\" alt=\"graffiti\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Jacobs with Farc graffiti near where he was asked to help the guerrillas. Photograph: Christian Escobar Mora</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Escobar Mora</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually we started making progress, despite occasional visits from smiling woman friends of Jenny&#xa0;who wanted to talk to us. Was&#xa0;Spain covered in jungle? What food did we eat there? I was being given a&#xa0;recipe for a sweet made from sugar cane and bull's penis when a&#xa0;sweating Marlon appeared, bringing a note of chilling seriousness to the occasion. \"Personally,\" he muttered, inspecting the half-assembled laser sight, \"I&#xa0;prefer to kill people at close range, when I can see their faces. But&#xa0;the beauty of this gadget is that you can shoot accurately at 150m, and in the dark.\"</p> <p>From that moment on, all I could think about was how to leave the area as quickly as possible. \"The homework's finished,\" announced Julio after I had sped through the manual's final two pages without bothering to check what I was dictating. The sub-commander thanked us greatly, while I apologised for possible inaccuracies. He hoped we would come and see them all again one day, \"if you don't mind putting up with our humble tents constructed out of branches and leaves\". We thanked him for such a&#xa0;tempting invitation, and then set off again down the mountain.</p> <p>\"We've saved our consciences,\" whispered Julio once we were out of the guerrillas' sight. He explained that he had made small changes to my translation that had rendered an already garbled text completely useless. Thankfully he had seen what, in my fear, I had put aside. His conscience had prevented him from assisting people who had caused so much suffering and terror in Colombia, who were involved in drug-trafficking, who abducted children. For the next few days I&#xa0;would continue mulling over these implications, until after our return to Bogot\u00e1, news came from the area that would make me view the whole incident in yet another light.</p> <p>We were told by our guide that the&#xa0;army had stepped in and had most likely killed all the guerrillas we had met. I could not get out of my head the image of Jenny fumbling with a laser sight and then dying in the interests of a cause so confused that it had come to embrace, of all&#xa0;things, the promotion of tourism. All&#xa0;feelings about the rights and wrongs of translating for the Farc&#xa0;gave way to something else: an&#xa0;overwhelming sense of pity.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847084071\" title=\"\">The Robber of Memories: a&#xa0;River Journey Through Colombia</a> by Michael Jacobs is published by Granta Books on 1 November at \u00a316.99.

  "<p>Labour will tomorrow demand emergency legislation to compel serving and retired police officers to appear before the Hillsborough inquiry amid doubts that it lacks the necessary power to fully investigate the cover-up into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans.</p> <p>During a special House of Commons debate on the 1989 disaster, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will offer to work with the government to ensure that vital witnesses \u2013 including police whose original statements were changed \u2013 can be summoned to what is being billed as the biggest-ever inquiry into police malpractice.</p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said recently that it would conduct a wide-ranging investigation into allegations of police misconduct raised by the Hillsborough independent panel report published last month. It will consider new evidence unearthed by the 395-page report and 450,000 supporting documents. It will be able to recommend criminal charges or disciplinary action against the individuals concerned.</p> <p>The independent panel found that none of the emergency services had effectively mobilised a major incident plan and disclosed that 41 of the victims could have survived had the response been better.</p> <p>It also highlighted how police statements made by officers at the time had been doctored as a part of a systematic cover-up by the authorities that aimed to deflect blame on to Liverpool fans.</p> <p>Last week the government also opened the way for fresh inquests when attorney general Dominic Grieve announced he would apply to the High Court to have the original verdicts of accidental death overturned. The families are pressing for charges of manslaughter against those whose mistakes contributed to the deaths.</p> <p>While the families have welcomed the belated reopening of inquiries, there is concern, however, that the IPCC's remit and powers still leave it unable to compel serving police officers to attend interviews if they are not suspected themselves of criminality or misconduct. It also cannot compel former police officers to give evidence at all. The IPCC has said such limits on its power \"seriously undermine public confidence in IPCC investigations\".</p> <p>\"The inquest will be immensely important,\" Cooper said. \"But we also need a comprehensive and criminal investigation into the cover-up. And I am concerned that much more still needs to be done to strengthen the inquiry arrangements.</p> <p>\"The inquiry will need to get to the bottom of why so many police statements were altered. Yet although the IPCC can pursue officers it believes have committed crimes, it doesn't have the powers to compel serving or former officers to be interviewed as witnesses. Nor can it compel civilians to give evidence. Everything possible should be done now to remove these obstacles to justice for the Hillsborough families. We can't let further inquiries drag on for years because they didn't have the powers or resources to get results.\"</p> <p>It has also emerged that retired police officers are not liable for any misconduct sanction, raising concerns that former officers involved in any cover-up over Hillsborough will escape all justice.</p> <p>In written evidence recently submitted to the home affairs select committee, the IPCC raised concerns about its inability to summon officers who are not under suspicion of criminal activity. In such cases, its investigators can only seek information through written questions to officers via their solicitors or other representatives.</p> <p>The IPCC said: \"Not only can this seriously undermine public confidence \u2026 it can also impact on the overall effectiveness and timeliness of investigations. Relying on the written submission and response of questions is generally a much longer and less satisfactory process than conducting a face to face interview, particularly when investigators need to follow-up answers provided by officers.</p> <p>\"The commission believes that all public servants \u2013 including police officers \u2013 should be accountable for their actions. \"Where a fatal or serious incident following police contact occurs, the public are right to expect that those officers directly involved, or those who witnessed the incident, should be required to provide a detailed account to the body charged with investigating the matter.</p> <p>\"It is anomalous that regulations require a police officer to attend an IPCC interview if misconduct is alleged (which could include, for example, a speeding offence or an allegation of discriminatory treatment), but not if he or she is involved in or witnesses a death or serious injury.\"</p>",

  "<p>The disappearance of <a href=\"http://www.beck.com/\" title=\"\">Beck Hansen </a>must look, on the face of it, a typical case of the trendsetter who lost his cultural capital. Beck was the quintessential postmodern 90s pop star, who transitioned nicely into the noughties with more confessional albums such as 2002's <em>Sea Change</em>. But since his last official release in 2008, <em>Modern Guilt</em>, it seemed as though Beck had graciously absented himself from the chart fray, his time as a frontline artist up.</p> <p>The story behind the scenes is a more intriguing one \u2013 of covert but frenzied artistic activity. Beck has followed a trajectory akin to that of his British contemporary Damon Albarn, becoming a busy producer-enabler whose many and varied spinning plates are testament to how creativity doesn't always work to the industry's album-tour cycle. Beck's projects have included Charlotte Gainsbourg's <em>IRM</em> LP, which he co-wrote, and collaborations <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/46693-listen-beck-raps-with-childish-gambino/\" title=\"\">with the rapper Childish Gambino</a>. It was to Beck's house that Bat for Lashes went to thrash out her new album, while even country singer Dwight Yoakam has <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/planned_obsolescence/a\" title=\"\">sought his aid</a>. But he's been happiest, you intuit, mucking about; gathering disparate artists to cover landmark albums in a day, posting the results on his website \u2013 check out Songs of Leonard Cohen, <a href=\"http://www.beck.com/recordclub/index.php/category/leonard-cohen-songs-of-leonard-cohen\" title=\"\">done on wheezing synths with Devendra Banhart</a>.</p> <p>Beck's latest endeavour is a double remix album of Philip Glass tracks, curated in honour of Glass's 75th birthday year. The veteran modern composer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/philip-glass-and-beck-discuss-collaborating-on-rework.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">approached Beck</a>, who chased, cajoled, troubleshot and edited this compilation, with the aid of producer Hector Castillo. Beck's own contribution, <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/dunvagenmusic/nyc-73-78\" title=\"\">NYC: 73-78</a>, opens CD2 of this engaging, accessible Glassfest. Clocking in at 20 minutes, the roving medley splices together segments from disparate Glass works, an act of elegant Beckish sampladelia that somehow never loses cogency.</p> <p>As a composer-curator two-hander, <em>Rework </em>is an inspired meeting of minds, proof that there is life after grinding out long-players. Hansen is a synthesizer fetishist, and Glass's rippling compositions have inspired electronic artists across the pop spectrum. For his part, Glass sees the \"battle\" between highbrow classical and contemporary electronic music as essentially over. This accessible, tr\u00e8s cool compilation collapses modal composition and chillwave; techno and modernist analogue menace.</p> <p>There are cameos here, not from huge names but from cutting-edge artists (Beck knows a surprising number of Icelandic post-ambient laptop composers) whose own styles bring a sympatico evolutionary spin to Glass's works. The headline work is by former Battles man <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thdvGC76_Pc\" title=\"\">Tyondai Braxton</a>, who recently performed with the London Sinfonietta. His remix of Rubric, a cut from 1982's <em>Glassworks</em>, is heavy on bass and skittering beats. It holds fast to the original, but with the grappling hooks of 2012. Elsewhere, Hamburg's Pantha du Prince does <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=162305132&amp;m=162311149\" title=\"\">deeply dancefloor things</a> to 1973's Mad Rush (Organ Version), while woozy chillwave pioneer Memory Tapes applies a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=162305132&amp;m=162310884\" title=\"\">technoid shimmer</a> to Floe '87. Most surprising of all, perhaps, former Matador recording artiste Cornelius \u2013 often pigeonholed as the Japanese Beck \u2013 plays the Opening to <em>Glassworks</em>, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&amp;t=1&amp;islist=false&amp;id=162305132&amp;m=162310884\" title=\"\">totally straight, on the piano</a>.</p> <p>There is, of course, a <em>Rework </em>smartphone app, one that allows you and your device to reimagine the works yourself. They're calling it Glass Machine; you might call auto-Glass. And, next, there's the prospect of a new Beck album in December. True to current form it's anything but orthodox: the 20 tracks of <em>Song Reader </em>are to be <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/47436-beck-announces-details-of-his-song-reader/\" title=\"\">released only as sheet music</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, in this space, I broke the law. Technically, I could be prosecuted. Technically, my only hope is that Rowan Atkinson can get the law changed before a gloved hand knocks at my door.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/14/victoria-coren-lucy-liu-sherlock-holmes\" title=\"\">My column about <em>Elementary</em></a> was one of the most-read articles on the Comment Is Free website for days. What an accolade, the casual observer might think. After all, we live in a serious world. Some girl's unenthusiasm for a TV series in which Sherlock Holmes is a New York junkie and Doctor Watson is a sexy lady from <em>Charlie's Angels</em> is not a serious matter. If thousands of web-surfers are poring over that column, what a tremendously entertaining piece it must be.</p> <p>But no. It was not my creative writing that fascinated people, but my racism. And as a little sweetener, like sprinkles on an ice cream, my sexism. Ideologically, I am the new Bernard Manning. (Unfortunately, the resemblance doesn't end there.)</p> <p>Many of the messages I've since received on Twitter have been accompanied by the hashtags #racist and #sexist and, in one charming case, #youdumbbitch. This is why I read with particular interest about Rowan Atkinson's launch of the <a href=\"http://reformsection5.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform Section 5</a> campaign, to repeal that part of the Public Order Act that makes it a crime to use \"abusive or insulting\" words within earshot (or eyeshot) of anyone likely to be offended by them. I would quite like this section to be reformed, in time for me to swerve jail.</p> <p>The sexism charge was nuanced; some believe that Lucy Liu's casting as \"Doctor Joan Watson\" is a positive step for women in Hollywood; I do not, and those who disagree think I must therefore be a misogynist. Fine; give me a couple of hours round a pub table and I'll have that debate with pleasure.</p> <p>But the racism charge was based on the following two paragraphs, which appeared about halfway through my column:</p> <p>\"Lucy Liu [told] the <em>Times</em>, 'It was a very big deal for me to play an Asian-American in <em>Charlie's Angels</em>; Watson's ethnicity is also a big deal', as if someone had bet her \u00a3100 that she couldn't cause at least three Conan Doyle fans to suffer a pulmonary embolism.</p> <p>\"Personally, I'd like to press Liu's face into a bowl of cold pea soup for that statement. It's not just her failure to distinguish between creating a new character and mangling a beloved old one (Tread softly! You tread on my dreams!), but the triumphant tone over such an appalling and offensive racial change. Let me be clear: I rather like the idea of an Asian Watson, but <em>American?</em> God save us all.\"</p> <p>Now, I think it's fairly obvious that this is a silly joke about Americans, as imagined by a tweedy old fan of Victorian literature. It is not a difficult joke to spot. It's a standard structure: set up an expectation based on one half of a sentence (or, in this case, word), then say something based on the other half. As in: \"My boyfriend's got a dog. I'm revolted by the hairiness and the smell. But I like his dog.\"</p> <p>My furious online correspondents, however, reacted as though the last two sentences simply weren't there, managing somehow to take those lines as a statement of anti-Asian feeling. If I were more famous, the <em>Daily Mail</em> would have reported the complaints under the headline \"COREN IN RACE ROW\" and I would have been marked down forever as that woman who used to host a quiz show until her hatred of Asians was revealed and she was forced into hiding forever.</p> <p>As it is, I will be remembered as a racist only by those too daft to get my silly joke, and those who saw the damning internet blogs that failed to quote exactly what I'd said.</p> <p>Nevertheless, those people were genuinely offended. Some may be quite stupid (\"How can you defend the BBC's male-dominated, all-white <em>Sherlock</em>?\" asked one angry lady, the answer to which is so obvious that I couldn't be bothered to type it) \u2013 but I deliberately allowed readers to believe for two seconds that I was about to make an anti-Asian statement, in the full knowledge that some people <em>are</em> stupid and that even so familiar and simple a comic U-turn might be too much for them. Technically, and illegally, I invited offence.</p> <p>Last week, a caller to the Jeremy Vine show on Radio 2 said that Andrew Mitchell should be jailed for swearing at the police because \"there is too little respect for them\".</p> <p>As someone who remembers from childhood the timid, furtive voices of east European cousins on the phone \u2013 those few who had survived the concentration camps \u2013 who dared not speak freely from behind the Iron Curtain because they feared being tapped and followed, I am <em>extremely</em> offended by the suggestion that my own beautiful British society should become a police state, in which rudeness to these authority figures is punished by incarceration. But do I think the caller should be jailed for offending me? No, I think there should be no such thing as a speech crime. However foul a thing you want to say, you can say it freely as far as I'm concerned. And I'm including the skinheads who shouted \"Yid\" at me during my grandfather's funeral.</p> <p>Yet, even if you believe that offensive remarks should be proscribed by law, what about remarks that are <em>misunderstood </em>as offensive? It's nigh impossible to speak without any risk of misinterpretation, especially when mobs are out there looking to be outraged.</p> <p>You don't have to support the campaign to reform Section 5. But one day, your teasing dig in a colleague's leaving card will be taken the wrong way; or your mobile phone comment will be misheard by passers-by in a crowded street; and then they will come for you.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Yvonne Roberts</strong> It's been a very interesting week for feminism. Netmums has announced that feminism is dead and pronounced the last rites. But at the same time we've had the coverage of the Jimmy Savile revelations and a very strong feminist voice saying that this is an institutional problem, not just the behaviour of one individual. So feminism, is it alive or is it dead? Fiona?</p> <p><strong>Fiona Ranford</strong> The news from Netmums isn't surprising. We're all well aware that there's been stigma attached to feminism for many years, making it seem like it's something that is done and dusted, and actually what we're seeing across the UK is a huge rise in the number of women \u2013 and men \u2013 taking part in feminist activism. So we've seen a doubling in the number of local feminist activist groups in the past couple of years. We've seen a thousand people come to UK Feminista's national conference, which sold out. We've also got a huge lobby of parliament this week, where hundreds of women and men from across the UK will be coming together to demand that feminism is put at the heart of British politics and many of them will be doing feminist activism for the first time. So it's clear that the feminist movement is growing.</p> <p><strong>Rehana Azam</strong> I don't think feminism is dead. As a trade union officer active in the workplace, I've seen the gender pay gap growing significantly over the past decade. So I think there's a very real need for [feminism] in the workplaces, for us to fight for equality.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But if equal pay is such an issue, why are so many women saying \"We don't need feminism any more. Everything's OK\"?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I don't think feminism is dead. It depends what your interpretation of feminism is. My interpretation is all about having the freedom to choose. I don't think if you asked some of my members in the workplaces, are they the ones who are choosing the rates of pay they are on, which, compared to those of men, are less? I think the answer would be no, they aren't.</p> <p><strong>Melissa Kite</strong> I sincerely hope feminism is alive. If younger women are rejecting it or saying it's irrelevant, it's only because the women who've gone before them have won so many battles that they now can't see what the problem is. But I think the problem now is much more subtle than it used to be, and sexism \u2013 if you like, chauvinism \u2013 is not as obvious; it doesn't hit you over the head, maybe. It's very insidious, very subtle, the ways that women might still be kept down. There are still women in this country of different cultures who do not have the rights that I have, for example. And I think there is a very difficult problem nowadays of equality and women's rights coming up against other cultural so-called rights, religious rights. And these two agendas bash up against each other and women are stuck in the middle of things like forced marriage, female circumcision, women not being able to get a divorce because their husband has divorced them in a religious sense, in a Sharia sense.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Rehana, you actually had first-hand experience, didn't you, of a forced marriage?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> Yes, at the age of 17, and unfortunately I didn't get the right to choose at that stage. But I'm pleased to say that I managed to challenge my family and I'm now on the other side because of some of the westernised environments that I've had the opportunity to be part of.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But is feminism too white, too posh, too middle-class, too obsessed with how many women are in the boardroom? Should it not argue much more strenuously, for example, about the impact of austerity hitting women much, much harder at the moment than it's hitting men?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> Obviously we've seen slashing of services that women crucially rely on, and their benefits, and a very disproportionate loss of jobs for women. I think that shows that gender inequality is clearly quite overt.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> So where's the anger?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Well, indeed. Nowadays younger women are saying, \"Well, we don't want a sisterhood\" because they're all right, Jack. But if a sisterhood means anything, it's women standing together. So feminism shouldn't mean something strident, it should mean women standing together. It doesn't matter what culture you're from, I want to stand with you to give you the rights or freedoms and advantages that I'm enjoying.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Rehana, you've talked about choice but a lot of women would say \"it's my choice to go pole dancing\", \"it's my choice to have cosmetic surgery\", \"it's my choice to wear a pinny and cook cupcakes\". And then you have a lot of highly qualified women who are now saying they want to be at home full time. And that will obviously have an impact on their husbands. Because if you've got one person at home full time you're actually inhibiting the choices of the other person who has to go back to the traditional role of full-time breadwinner. So is choice a seductive word that can actually be quite toxic?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> I think that we need to switch attention away from the individual choices that women are making and turn attention on to the institutions that are restricting those choices \u2013 for example, the media that is pumping out images of women that define how women think about their bodies and force them to shape their lives around beauty norms. We need to focus on what institutions are doing rather than just talking about individual women.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Just on this question of what women look like, in the Netmums survey women are saying that they no longer believe that being feminine or looking glamorous is a barrier to being taken seriously. Well, I would say that misses the point. I would say that now you have to be taken seriously and you have to be glamorous and feminine. It's almost like the notion of what a woman is, it's become bigger and bigger until you have to be absolutely everything. And this speaks to what a woman is in the home as well. So yes, we have choice. We can have children, we can work. But actually what's happened in practice is that we're having to do all of it. And that's no good for men, because they are becoming emasculated.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> Challenging stereotypes \u2013 that is still a very big issue, isn't it? The Women in Work Commission in 2006 did quite a lot of research into stereotype and gender segregation, occupation segregation and the big issue around that was careers advice. It was almost like girls were put in a particular direction because they...</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Air hostess, secretary, nurse.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> ...We've got to start developing aspirations. If you look at the current key workplace issues, the gender pay gap which is widening, the austerity measures which mean public sector workers are being made redundant \u2013 predominantly women, part-time women who can't get the flexibility so they have to go part time. So it goes back to the point that you were making, Fiona, about institutions having to take responsibility. In the 1990s, around the Macpherson report, there was institutionalised racism and a lot of discussion and debate around that. But institutionalised sexism is something that we have almost acknowledged, but the BBC, the Savile stuff that's coming out, it's institutionalised sexism, it's institutions that have to take responsibility.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Do women still in many instances feel like visitors in a male world?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Yes, I'm sure. I became a political journalist 10 years ago and when I joined the lobby you could count on one hand the number of female political journalists. It's very different today.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But joining the system isn't the same as changing it.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> You have a critical mass and it's transformed, I think, beyond recognition. It is not male-dominated any more and therefore the way women, the way political correspondents, report has changed because there are lots of women doing it and we do things slightly differently. There's more emphasis on how politicians feel about decisions, it's much more emotive. The feminisation of society.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> In a way, feelings and emotions is a very stereotypical view of what women's interests are. Inevitably women are the fluffy part of a newspaper, on the whole.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Yes, we need different types of women in the media, but the celebrity obsessed culture, it's all about Kim Kardashian and all the rest of it, and women are becoming caught up in this. There is no expectation on what men look like \u2013 still. It is all about what women look like.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Fiona, in some ways men are in a similar position that women were in the 1960s, they are beginning to realise that they have other choices apart from just being a breadwinner; men are much more involved in their children. They're being forced to face unemployment, which means they have to find another identity. Should that be a stronger part of the feminist agenda?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> Feminism has always been about building a society that is better for everyone, and that includes men. And I think, yes, there's a lot of men who are getting involved in the feminist movement because they're realising A, that it's a huge task we have on our hands and we need all hands on deck; and B, it affects them deeply. Men are affected by pornography, for example from, I think, the average age for boys seeing pornography being 11. Pornography is often violent and degrading to women and that's how a lot of young boys are getting their ideas around who women are and what sex is like. It's really important that we tackle that, because that's really impoverishing for women and men.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> You have to look at it from a global perspective. I've been fortunate. I've been to Haiti and I've seen first-hand how women are oppressed in the 21st century in the workplaces. I met a group of fantastic women in Sierra Leone at the first ever women's labour conference that they managed to organise after a decade of absolutely awful stuff, and those women said: \"The only people who are going to be in charge of our destiny is us.\" The point that Melissa was making about the sisterhood is absolutely right. Because along the way we've moved in to different groups' internal discussion about right, left and centre and all the rest of it, rather than globally trying to eradicate injustice and have dignity.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> How wide is the political spectrum here?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Centre-right, I'd describe myself.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I'm leftwing.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> So where do you differ?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> I differ more about lumping everything on the shoulders of government and organisations. I believe in more individual responsibility, what I can do personally, for example, to mentor or support any woman I come across. I got on because older women in media gave me moral support and encouragement. That meant the world to me. Men have been doing this for each other since time began \u2013 the clubbable aspect of the old boys' network.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Where change has really happened is when women have taken direct action, where they've actually defied the stereotypes.</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> I think that's definitely a key tactic; it has had huge successes in the past in winning women the vote and now it's still playing a key role. So we saw women lying down outside parliament to try to block the chancellor's budget. They wanted to demonstrate how crucial it was that this agenda doesn't happen because it's fundamentally taking women backwards.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Women have taxation without representation. That hasn't changed. There are very few women still in positions of power.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But then it goes back to the whole institutional problem. If you look at the front benches in terms of how many women influence and make decisions, there are very few. So although we've made strides, we just haven't come far enough. I agree with Melissa: we've all got an individual responsibility but we also have a collective responsibility and it's this that's going to really mobilise that change. And if we take direct action, then so be it, because it's high time, isn't it? I have responsibility for the National Health Service, services are being fragmented every single day. The British public need to wake up and understand what's happening to their NHS and we've got to challenge that. Predominantly, women are going to be the ones looking after the children, the elderly parents, and we're going to need those services. And I think this is where collective action is going to be really important.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> It took a Labour government to do a lot on equality, and I will always give it credit for that. But this issue of marches and being radical and strident \u2013 I'm aware that women chained themselves to railings, and thank goodness they did and I'm grateful to them. But when you do that now you do get a lot of scorn from men. And so, in terms of turning people off, it's a very difficult balance.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But isn't that inevitably the role of feminism, or any political activity, that it's not really working unless somebody's feeling appalled by it?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Or do you bring this change in by proving that women in the workplace are a massive asset?</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> That's not changing the system, that's keeping the system going.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> If I can just come in on equal pay audits: what it means is if, as a woman in a workplace, you feel that you are doing exactly the same work as a male counterpart, you should have the ability to challenge that.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> You've got to counter that by saying that if you burden employers with so much \u2013 very well-meaning \u2013 legislation designed to boost women, you are going to end up with some employers saying \"I'm not going to employ a woman\" because it's too much trouble. I'm sorry, but that is the reality.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But with the greatest respect, Melissa, the whole point of equal pay audits is to get equality.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> But it's so hard to say what is exactly the same job, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> There's plenty of measures through an evaluation where you can identify whether there is that parity.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> I'm not sure I would use legislation. I'm more cautious about what red tape you burden employers with in order to achieve very good ends or what you leave up to the individual woman to fight her corner herself. I wouldn't want legislation that impeded my ability to go into a company \u2026 an employer was thinking if I take on another woman you know there's going to be all sorts of problems.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But unless you've got the tools available to challenge it yourself, you'd be in a situation where it doesn't change and we're never going to address the gender pay gap.</p> <p><strong>FR </strong>I don't think that we can just imagine that feminism's going to come, that gender equality is going to come about on its own through a few policy makers behind closed doors. I think real political change happens through mass movements, always has.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> In the 1960s there was a very simple four goals for feminism, including 24-hour childcare, abortion rights, equal pay. Are there goals that you would put at the top of the list now?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Equal rights for all women in our society, regardless of culture and religion.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> And a second?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Choice.</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> The feminism movement is hugely diverse: people are calling for different things, but ultimately what they are all calling for is gender equality.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I do strongly fundamentally believe in choice. If you've got choice, you can develop the equality.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Hooray. Thank you very much. That was great.</p>",
  "<p>Directed by a stylish Hong Kong veteran, who was born in Vietnam and educated in the States, this opulent martial arts film (a remake of a 1966 classic) is set in the Ming dynasty where two groups of eunuchs are competing for control of the court. There's too much talk and the complex plot is far from clear with two separate strands, one the search for a fleeing pregnant concubine, the other about competing gangs pursuing a treasure buried in a maze in a desert much given to violent sandstorms.

  "<p>What is it like to be one of the approximately 12,000 recruits from ethnic minorities currently serving in the British military? That was the question photographer Kit Oates wanted to address when, earlier this year, he embarked on a project to take portraits of members of the British army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force from minority backgrounds. \"I was interested in recruits who might not have been born here, or whose parents weren't, but who have decided to serve in the armed forces in this country. I thought it was an interesting area in a year when so much has been happening in Great Britain; I wanted to highlight another facet of our multicultural society.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/\" title=\"\">Ministry of Defence</a> was initially slow to provide access, but Oates believes his request was strengthened by recent reports that ethnic minorities are poorly represented in the British military \u2013 making up about 7% of the armed forces, with particularly low numbers in the navy and the RAF. \"The British army needs to reflect British society,\" defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said in June. \"This is clearly a challenge now; to recruit from the ethnic minorities within British society in proportions that reflect that society.\"</p> <p>Having finally secured access, Oates captured these portraits over four days between April and June, travelling to bases in London, Kent and Portsmouth to photograph people from a wide variety of backgrounds, with roots in India, Malaysia, Kenya and the Caribbean. Diversity may be an issue in the armed services, but Oates's study suggests that ethnic background creates little or no restriction within them; his subjects range from chefs and privates to captains and squadron leaders.</p> <p>But why aren't more people from ethnic minorities signing up? When I put it to recruiting officer Andy Rahaman that discrimination and racial abuse might still be a concern for potential recruits, he was quick to dismiss the idea. \"It's a thing of the past. The military have worked very hard to stamp it out. Thirty years ago it was perhaps more prevalent, but not now.\"</p> <p>Oates's subjects have been photographed against the subdued backdrops of English military bases but their faces reveal a worldliness, a sense, even among those in their early 20s, that they have witnessed a great deal. For recent recruits such as army chef Stevan Marston, Afghanistan provided a daunting introduction to foreign service. More seasoned servicemen such as Conrad Walker have been all over the world \u2013 Jordan, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Haiti and the Falklands \u2013 and not always to wage war.</p> <p>\"The classic image is of white British squaddies running around with guns, but there is more to the army,\" says Oates. \"They do a lot of other things as well.\" One soldier recalls bringing an immunisation programme to a remote part of Kenya; Walker helped build playgrounds for orphans in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>For Rahaman, recruiting from ethnic minorities is important beyond reflecting the multicultural makeup of British society: it can positively affect the way the military is perceived, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan. \"We've got guys who speak Urdu and Farsi as their first tongue and that's certainly an advantage. You can break down barriers a lot faster than a white guy who only speaks English. It makes life far easier.\"</p> <p>Ten portraits have been taken so far and Oates hopes to extend the series for an exhibition. In the meantime, the 25-year-old, who grew up in Shropshire and studied photography at the University of Westminster, is putting the finishing touches to a series about Tanzanian biker gangs.</p> <p><em>For more Kit Oates projects, go to </em><a href=\"http://www.kitoates.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>kitoates.co.uk</em></a></p>",
  "<p>How much ambiguity can a novel sustain while still keeping a firm hold on the reader's attention? How much apparently crucial information can be withheld before the reader begins to feel manipulated or, worse, overlooked? These questions may not have been on Stig Saeterbakken's mind when he was writing <em>Self-Control</em>, but they were certainly on mine when I was reading it. And the answer to both \u2013 if the extent to which I found the novel compelling is anything to go by \u2013 seems to be a surprisingly large amount.</p> <p>If these questions suggest that <em>Self-Control</em> might be an exercise in Ian McEwan-style narrative misdirection, nothing could be further from the truth. Saeterbakken, a Norwegian novelist who killed himself earlier this year, is not that kind of writer. It's not so much that nothing happens in the novel, it's that the things that do happen never threaten to build towards anything like a plot. What tension there is, and what propulsion you feel as a reader, are negative energies: they come from the suppression of information.</p> <p>In the opening pages, the middle-aged narrator Andreas Felt meets with his adult daughter Marit for the first time in years. Their relationship is damaged in some way, but we never get a clear idea of why this might be. Perhaps out of a need to fill conversational dead air, Andreas tells his daughter that he and her mother are planning to get a divorce. There are no obvious or direct repercussions from this apparent lie, but it sets the tone for the remainder of a novel in which almost every conversation is some sort of confrontation, and in which the narrator is constantly on the verge of some drastic gesture or futile outburst.</p> <p>He gives his despised boss \u2013 an officious minor potentate straight from Kafka central casting \u2013 a foul-mouthed dressing-down, but nothing much comes of it. He endures a stultifying dinner with his wife Helene and two old friends he can barely stand; then, in bed that night, he punches Helene in the hip and gets away with it by pretending to have done so in his sleep. Something is happening, we feel; the consequences of some unseen despair are at work. He seems preoccupied with an ongoing news story about a missing teenage girl, and we suspect some personal trauma may be causing this preoccupation. But Andreas's reticence is pervasive, and his narrative is resolutely devoid of any sense of past or future. Only in the novel's closing lines are we given an idea of what this trauma might be, and there is an immediate compulsion to go back and reread this brief book.</p> <p>Saeterbakken's writing is unyieldingly intense and sometimes dismally funny. The prose, in Sean Kinsella's English translation, is direct and starkly unlyrical, if weakened occasionally by cliche. The dyspeptic spirit of Thomas Bernhard is a tangible presence, most obviously in the frequent use of italics, but also in the way in which the narrative seems to rise towards a cumulative comedy before diving deeper into blackness. At one point, Andreas considers a colleague of his whose wife was killed in a house fire, and he tells us of his uncertainty as to whether he feels compassion or envy: \"It was hard to get away from the fact that there was something enticing about it, losing your wife and everything you owned in a flash, no matter how dreadful it was ... to be visited by some great sorrow on which to concentrate your emotions instead of continuing to torment yourself with thousands of small ones. Scorched from the surface of the earth as if they'd never been...\" Andreas's narrative is filled with \u2013 or, rather, drained by \u2013 these ellipses, and at first they seem an irritating stylistic affectation. But you soon begin to feel as though you should be peering into them for traces of vanished significance, as though they were tiny abysses, plunging from the surface of this strange and troubling novel down to whatever unspeakable void is at its centre.</p>",
  "<p>Khamis Gaddafi, youngest son of the former Libyan dictator, has allegedly been killed during fighting in the town of Bani Walid, a year to the day that rebel forces killed his father, Muammar.</p> <p>A short statement from the Libyan national congress spokesman, Omar Hamdan, said the 28-year-old was killed \"in battle\" but gave no further details. His body was apparently found after a day of heavy fighting between the town's pro-Gaddafi garrison and militias allied to the Libyan government. Government forces reported 13 dead and 121 wounded, amid a fourth day of bitter clashes for control of the town.</p> <p>Khamis's alleged killing prompted wild celebrations in Misrata, Libya's third city, which was besieged for six months by his 32nd Brigade, blamed for an orgy of murder, rape and torture.</p> <p>Khamis, who has been reported dead several times before, was known as one of the most hardline of Gaddafi's sons: after studying in a Russian military academy, he formed the 32nd Brigade as a special unit to be at the service of his father.</p> <p>Reports said his body was being brought to Misrata, in a repeat of last October when his father's body was put on public display before being buried at a secret site. Khamis has been wrongly reported dead several times.</p> <p>For many Misratans, the unconfirmed death of their chief tormentor was a cause for both celebration and torment. Former militiaman Muhsen al-Gubbi, who battled with Khamis's forces in the city last year, said: \"I want to cry. I am still waiting to see his body, I want to make sure he is dead.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day another leading member of Gaddafi's administration, former spokesman and foreign minister Moussa Ibrahim, was captured as he tried to flee north of Bani Walid. But further confusion emerged after an audio clip posted on Facebook purporting to be the voice of Moussa Ibrahim denied his capture. There was no independent verification of the authenticity or timing of the post.</p> <p>Khamis never married, and was regarded as on the side of his older brother Moatasen, forming the \"muscle\" of the Gaddafi family, in contrast to Saif Al Islam, now in jail in Libya on war crimes charges, who until last year's revolution portrayed himself as a political reformer.</p> <p>The presence of two such senior figures from the old order appears to confirm assertions by Libyan officials that Bani Walid had become a safe haven for former Gaddafi officials. \"A lot of people who supported Gaddafi are hiding now in Bani Walid, we have a list of names,\" said Libyan army spokesman Mohammed El Gandus.</p> <p>The rest of Muammar Gaddafi's clan is scattered. Wife Safiya is in Algeria, with eldest son Muhammad, fifth son Hannibal and their only daughter by birth, Aisha. Saadi Gaddafi has sought refuge in Niger, which refused bids to extradite him, while Saif is in custody. The whereabouts of the Colonel's adopted daughter, Hana, is unknown.</p>",

CCTV cameras track the movements of the outside world. The narrow windows \u2013 some of them barred \u2013 are smudged with dirt and thick with double-glazed glass. In order to visit, you must enter through a succession of automatically locking doors and walk through an airport-style security gate. You must leave your mobile phone in a specially provided locker and hand over your passport in return for an ID tag and a panic alarm. Two members of staff, wearing plastic clogs that squeak across the linoleum, escort you through the corridors.</p> <p>In the visitors' room, Bergwall sits straight-backed on a small red chair, dim light glinting off rectangular-framed spectacles, his feet planted slightly apart in grey socks and Velcro-strapped sandals. He has been a patient in S\u00e4ter hospital since 1991 and although he is 62, the flesh on his hands is still pink and unworn, the result, one imagines, of a lack of exposure to sunlight. His hair \u2013 what is left of it \u2013 is white.</p> <p>Occasionally, he leans forward to take a pouch of chewing tobacco from a blue tin on the low table in front of him which he slips underneath his top lip. He smiles more than you might expect, each time displaying a line of small, yellow teeth pushed back like a fence falling in on itself. When he laughs, his shoulders shudder gently in his blue sweatshirt. The overall impression is that of a kindly, slightly shy older man who is eager to please. Does he believe he is criminally insane? Bergwall looks at me, smiles, and then shakes his head. \"No.\" What will he do if he ever gets out of here? \"I'll just walk straight ahead and keep going.\"</p> <p>Until relatively recently, Sture Bergwall was Sweden's most notorious serial killer. He had confessed to more than 30 murders and been convicted of eight. He called himself Thomas Quick. Assuming this sinister alter ego, he claimed during a succession of therapy sessions at S\u00e4ter over the years that he had maimed, raped and eaten the remains of his victims, the youngest of whom was a nine-year-old girl whose body has never been found.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398047412\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/19/1350647988965/Swedish-victims-Gry-Storv-001.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish victims: Gry Storvik\" width=\"140\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gry Storvik, 23.

Charges were waived this September</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the 1990s, Thomas Quick confessed to one unsolved murder after another, becoming, in the words of the father of one of his alleged victims, \"a ghost who ran through Scandinavia killing more than 30 people\". The sadistic murderer was a media sensation and his bespectacled face stared out from front pages and television screens. The newspapers called him \"the cannibal\". Thomas Quick became Sweden's very own Hannibal Lecter.</p> <p>But then, in 2001, he stopped co-operating with the police. He withdrew from public view and changed his name back to the one he was born with. In 2008, Hannes R\u00e5stam, one of Sweden's most respected documentary-makers, became intrigued. He visited the former Thomas Quick, now known as Sture Bergwall, at S\u00e4ter, trawled through the 50,000 pages of court documents, therapy notes and police interrogations and came to the startling conclusion that there was not a single shred of technical evidence for any of Bergwall's convictions. There were no DNA traces, no murder weapons, no eyewitnesses \u2013 nothing apart from his confessions, many of which had been given when he was under the influence of narcotic-strength drugs. Confronted with R\u00e5stam's discoveries, Bergwall admitted the unthinkable. He said he had fabricated the entire&#xa0;story.</p> <p>The book recounting this extraordinary tale has just been posthumously published in Sweden \u2013 R\u00e5stam died aged 56 from cancer of the pancreas and the liver in January, the day after the manuscript was finished. In <a href=\"http://www.salomonssonagency.se/php/book.php?lang=en&amp;bookid=204\" title=\"\"><em>Thomas Quick: The Making of a Serial Killer</em></a>, R\u00e5stam unpicks in painstaking detail the way in which the deeply troubled Quick was able to gain key information surrounding each case from psychiatrists, police officers and lawyers, before cobbling together the rambling and confused testimonies into a coherent narrative that could stand up in court.</p> <p>Jenny K\u00fcttim, who was R\u00e5stam's researcher for three years on the story, was appalled by what they found. \"The worst part is that because of people not doing their job, there are a lot of killers out there who never got caught or faced justice,\" she says.</p> <p>In a country that has become synonymous with the dogged fictional detectives of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/mar/22/henning-mankell-wallander-troubled-man\" title=\"\">Henning Mankell </a>and Scandinavian TV drama, the book has prompted a public outcry and a judicial scandal. Bergwall has now been acquitted of five of the eight murders. Two outstanding cases \u2013 one for the murder of 15-year-old Charles Zelmanovits, one for the double killing of a Dutch couple on a camping trip \u2013 have been submitted for review. Bergwall's lawyer, Thomas Olsson, expects the verdicts will be quashed and he will then start fighting for his client's release from the psychiatric hospital in which he has been incarcerated for more than 20 years. According to Olsson, the strange case of the serial killer who never was \"raises serious questions about the entire legal system\".</p> <p>But why would a man confess to such sadistic and violent crimes if he was truly innocent? Back in the visitors' room at S\u00e4ter, Sture Bergwall tries to explain. \"It was about belonging to something,\" he says, speaking in Swedish through a translator. His voice is quiet but insistent and his thoughts are intelligently expressed. I am the first British journalist he has ever spoken to. But it wasn't too hard to get hold of him \u2013 although he entered S\u00e4ter before the widespread use of the internet or mobile phones, he now has his own Twitter account.</p> <p>\"I was a very lonely person when it all started,\" he continues. \"I was in a place with violent criminals and I noticed that the worse or more violent or serious the crime, the more interest someone got from the psychiatric personnel. I also wanted to belong to that group, to be an interesting person in here.\"</p> <p>Bergwall had always wanted to meld in. He was a teenage misfit. He grew up in a small town in rural Sweden, one of seven siblings raised according to strict Pentecostal beliefs. He describes himself as a \"creative and ambitious\" child, interested in theatre and writing. At 14, he realised he was gay. Ashamed by his sexuality, he hid it from his deeply religious parents. He started experimenting with drugs \u2013 amphetamine was his favourite \u2013 and, at the age of 19, was accused of molesting adolescent boys. Later, he tried to stab a former lover. In 1990, he robbed a local bank dressed in a Santa Claus outfit to feed his addiction. The clerk recognised him. He was incarcerated in S\u00e4ter hospital for psychiatric treatment. Not a stable individual, then, but not a serial killer \u2013 at least, not yet.</p> <p>As a young man, Bergwall had always hankered after being taken seriously and treated as an intelligent person. For a while, he wanted to be a doctor and read up on psychoanalysis. In S\u00e4ter, he began to realise he could use this knowledge to get the attention and acceptance he craved. \"What would you say,\" he asked his therapist one day in 1992, \"if I had done something really bad?\"</p> <p>\"That created a reaction, an interest,\" Bergwall says now. \"I said: 'Maybe I murdered someone' and once I'd said that, there was no going back.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398047413\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/19/1350649717743/Swedish-victims-Charles-Z-001.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish victims: Charles Zelmanovits\" width=\"140\" height=\"190\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charles Zelmanovits, 15.

Quick was sentenced in 1994 via a confession, with no forensic evidence</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first \"murder\" Thomas Quick confessed to was that of Johan Asplund, the victim of one of the greatest criminal mysteries in Swedish history. Johan was an 11-year-old boy who went to school one day in November 1980 and disappeared. His body has never been found. During a series of therapy sessions and, later, in police interviews, Quick said he had picked Johan up outside school and lured him into his car before taking him to a wooded area and raping him. Quick claimed he had panicked and strangled the boy, subsequently burying Johan's dismembered body parts so that no one could find them.</p> <p>But despite forensic technicians searching the locations described by Quick, no remains were ever found. In fact, it took nine years for prosecutors to cobble together a case against Quick \u2013 he was finally convicted of Johan's murder in 2001. By that time, Quick had already been found guilty of seven other killings. Yet, oddly for a serial killer, there was no obvious modus operandi: Quick killed children and adults, he raped men and women, he used an array of weapons and committed murders in various parts of Sweden and Norway.</p> <p>In 1996, he confessed to the murder of nine-year-old Therese Johannessen in Norway eight years previously. Quick initially said the girl was blonde and lived in a rural village, despite the fact that she had dark brown hair and lived in a tower block in a heavily urbanised area.</p> <p>\"He got zero right,\" Bergwall's lawyer, Thomas Olsson, tells me later in the car on the way back from S\u00e4ter. \"He described a totally different situation in all aspects but instead of accepting that, they went on with 15 new interviews.\"</p> <p>Olsson, who was brought in to represent Sture Bergwall after he retracted his confessions, has a reputation for taking on difficult cases. With his swept-back hair, bristled face and chain-smoking habit, he is precisely the kind of person one can imagine playing the role of a campaigning Scandinavian lawyer in a film. He drives too fast in a car strewn with empty coffee cups. Although he isn't religious, his wife has insisted he hang a string of rosary beads from his rear-view mirror as a reminder to slow down.</p> <p>Does Olsson believe Bergwall is dangerous? He snorts. \"No! Not at all.\" Does he like him? \"I don't like people too much in general,\" he says after a pause. \"But, of course, if you spend so much time with a client, you always see the person behind the headlines. It all starts with a little boy under a Christmas tree, playing with toys and it ends up very tragic. Somewhere along the line, everyone is a victim.\"</p> <p>After \"confessing\" to the murder of Therese Johannessen, Quick was driven to Norway. The TV cameras followed his every move. He was rapidly becoming one of the most famous men in Scandinavia and revelled in the attention. When Quick claimed he had thrown Therese's body parts in a nearby lake, the Norwegian authorities spent seven weeks' draining it. They found nothing. When a 0.5mm \"bone fragment\" was discovered in adjoining woodland, it later turned out to be a charred piece of wood. Despite this, Quick was convicted.</p> <p>Even more curiously, he appeared to have a cast-iron alibi for some of his crimes. Although he confessed to killing a teenage boy in 1964 at the age of 14, it turned out that several witnesses could remember seeing him at holy communion with his non-identical twin sister, some 250 miles away. In fact, there was a photograph showing him there. When he claimed responsibility for the killing of a 23-year-old woman in Norway in 1985, he said he had sex with her despite his stated sexual preference for men. The police had found traces of sperm but a subsequent DNA analysis ruled out the possibility that it belonged to Thomas Quick. And yet the courts once again found him guilty \"beyond all reasonable doubt\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398047414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/19/1350648795059/Swedish-victim-Yenon-Levi-001.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish victim: Yenon Levi\" width=\"140\" height=\"190\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yenon Levi, 24.

Charges were waived in 2010</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Defenders of the verdicts pointed out that, in interview, Quick had revealed telling pieces of information from each of the crimes that only the killer would know. Still today, there are those who robustly defend the police investigations, including supreme court judge G\u00f6ran Lambertz, who conducted a week-long review of the Quick case in 2006 in his previous role as attorney general and found it all to be above board.</p> <p>\"There is no DNA nor fingerprints and [the evidence] is not as strong as it could be,\" says Lambertz when we meet. \"What there is is everything he [Quick] said back then that sort of fits in. He gave a lot of facts about two murders in particular [Johannessen and Zelmanovits] that fit so well with what actually happened and what kind of children these two were.\"</p> <p>But according to Bergwall, a lot of the information was already in the public domain: early on in his confessional spree, he still had regular leaves of absence from the hospital.</p> <p>\"I'd go to the Royal Library in Stockholm on day release and read up on old cases on the newspaper microfiches,\" he explains. Bergwall noted down the telling details in contemporaneous reports \u2013 the positioning of the body, the specifics of the landscape, the victim's clothing \u2013 which he would later \"reveal\" in therapy as Thomas Quick. His therapist (who saw him for a minimum of three 90-minute sessions each week) would praise him for his bravery in digging deep into his remembered past. The police would be thrilled at the emergence of a credible suspect for a previously unsolvable crime. On at least two occasions, Quick was flown by private jet to take part in reconstructions at murder sites. All the time, Quick was basking in the reflected glory, like a praised child.</p> <p>\"I didn't need to do much to tell the stories,\" he says. \"Usually a single newspaper article would be enough. The rest of the information always came during the interrogations from the police, therapists or different people on the investigations team. I knew I just had to listen to pay attention.\"</p> <p>In all of his therapy sessions and the ensuing police reconstructions, Bergwall was heavily drugged on a cocktail of benzodiazepines. Medical records show he was being given tablets every couple of hours \u2013 often up to 20mg of diazepam, enough to knock some people out cold. A high dosage given to those with poor impulse control can lead to a release of inhibitions and could explain why Bergwall was able to invent such a grotesque litany of cannibalism, rape and murder. At the time, he remembers being fascinated by depictions of fictional serial killers \u2013 astonishingly, he was able to borrow a copy of Bret Easton Ellis's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/horror/9780330536301/american-psycho\" title=\"\"><em>American Psycho</em></a> from the hospital library.</p> <p>\"The drugs were very important,\" says Bergwall. \"I had free access to them and I relied on them to get me into a condition where I could tell stories and make them up.\"</p> <p>What effect did the drugs have on him?</p> <p>\"A lot happened inside of me. I'd get high, I'd get a kick and then I'd have lots of fantasies. My imagination would run wild. In one sense, they gave me a lot of creativity. It was like a vicious circle. The more I told, the more attention I got from the therapists and the police and the memory experts and that meant I also got more drugs.\"</p> <p>There was a clique of people around Quick, variously described by those I talk to as being akin to \"a cult\", \"a travelling circus\" and \"a religious sect that did not welcome dissenting beliefs\". The same police officer, therapist, prosecuting and defence lawyer dealt with each of his confessions through the years. Even the same sniffer dog, Zampo, was used to trawl each \"murder\" site.</p> <p>\"During the course of the investigation, Quick mentioned at least 24 different places in Sweden and Norway where he had committed murders, handled dead bodies or left body parts,\" says Leyla&#xa0;Belle Drake, who was Hannes R\u00e5stam's literary agent. \"Zampo marked for human remains 45 times at those 24 locations. Not a single trace of blood or body parts was ever found. The dog is just as bad as the rest of them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398047415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/19/1350648658601/Swedish-victims-Trine-Jen-001.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish victims: Trine Jensen\" width=\"140\" height=\"190\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trine Jensen, 17.

It was only through repeated therapy sessions with trusted confidants and the administration of calming drugs that the real narrative could emerge.</p> <p>For Jenny K\u00fcttim, this is one of the most scandalous elements of the whole strange affair.</p> <p>\"He was a mental patient in a mental hospital in S\u00e4ter,\" says K\u00fcttim, her restrained anger almost tangible. \"He was the only one who didn't have a job. The other people around him were the ones who were meant to be saying 'No, we don't believe you.' In that sense, you cannot blame Sture Bergwall, because a lot of people around him should have said no. At the same time, he's also to blame because he's hurt a lot of people by telling these stories.\"</p> <p>Prime among those were the victims' loved ones, who had their grief exposed in public, their hopes raised by a fantasist and then dashed by professional incompetence. Bj\u00f6rn Asplund is one of them: the father of the missing 11-year-old boy who was the subject of Quick's first confession. Asplund, 65, lives on a houseboat called Viking, tied to a permanent mooring on Lake M\u00e4laren in central Stockholm. Inside, a coffee pot boils on the stove in a galley kitchen and the boat rocks gently from side to side with each exhalation of the tide. On the wall above the dining table where we sit hangs a black and white photograph of Johan: a smiling boy with a pudding-bowl haircut.</p> <p>\"He was very popular in school, just a great kid,\" says Asplund. \"His dream was to become a farmer.\" Asplund and his ex-wife, Anna-Clara (the couple divorced when Johan was three years old), were told in 1993 that a mental patient they had never met had confessed to the abduction and murder of their son. From the beginning, neither of them believed it.</p> <p>\"Not for many reasons,\" says Asplund, who works for a mental health charity. \"In almost all cases where the child is the victim, it is someone who has a close relation to the child who is the perpetrator.\"</p> <p>Thomas Quick was unknown to them. In fact, the Asplunds were convinced they knew who did it: an ex-partner of Anna-Clara who wanted to seek revenge for the break-up of their relationship. There was enough circumstantial evidence against this suspect for the Asplunds to pursue a private prosecution against him. The ex-partner was sentenced to two years in prison for kidnapping but freed on appeal a year later. Bj\u00f6rn Asplund, however, remains convinced of this man's guilt.</p> <p>\"It made me angry when Thomas Quick confessed because, from that point, I realised that the whole case was closed against the ex-partner,\" he says. That it then took seven long years for Quick to frame a coherent sequence of events only confirmed the couple's suspicions: \"For every sober person in this country, it must have been obvious that this guy was not trustworthy.\"</p> <p>During the investigation, Asplund believes it was obvious that Quick was getting his information from the police. \"We found out that everything we would tell them would come out a few weeks later in his therapy sessions,\" he says.</p> <p>As an example, he points to the fact that Johan had a distinguishing birthmark on his right buttock that only his parents knew about. In early interviews, Quick claimed only that Johan had some vague marks or scars on the front of his stomach, possibly from surgery. The police asked the Asplunds if Johan had any such scars. For a while, they refused to be specific because of their suspicions that the information would make its way back to Quick.</p> <p>\"Then they threatened to take Anna-Clara to court for protecting a murderer,\" Asplund recalls. \"So she drew a picture of the birthmark.\"</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Quick \"remembered\" the mark in therapy. Indeed, for every murder he confessed to, Quick was subjected to an average of 10-15 police interviews. When he claimed he had killed an Israeli backpacker, Yenon Levi, in the Dalarna woods in 1988, Quick was asked repeatedly what murder weapon he had used. In interviews, he mentioned a camping axe, a spade and a carjack among other items before finally alighting on the \"right\" object: a wooden club. In court, Quick's indecisiveness was glossed over: it was stated simply that he had correctly identified the murder weapon.</p> <p>For the victims' families, the prolonged nature of each investigation was extremely distressing. Asplund, whose life had already been shattered once by his son's disappearance, was forced yet again to dredge up painful memories and then to listen to Quick's horrific testimony in court. Quick claimed he ate Johan's fingers; that he cut off the child's head and kicked it like a football.</p> <p>Asplund looks away, takes a drag of his roll-up cigarette. \"Sitting there listening to that, even if you knew it wasn't true \u2026\" he says. \"It was an awful situation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398047416\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/19/1350649191459/Swedish-victims-001.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish victims\" width=\"220\" height=\"92\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janni and Marinus Stegehuis, 34, 39.

He answers with another question: \"What can you do about it? I don't think being angry will help me. Whatever happens, you have to focus on the future and go forward. You have to make the decision about whether you want to live or not. And if the choice is to live, you have to live your full life. You can't spend it sitting in the corner, thinking about what&#xa0;happened.\"</p> <p>Back in S\u00e4ter hospital, I ask Sture whether he thought about the impact his confessions might be having on the victims' families.</p> <p>\"Yes. I did think of them, but I didn't. In a way, I was ruthless, but that was also one of the effects of the benzo [benzodiazepine]. It meant I could ignore any compassion.\"</p> <p>Did he know he was lying? \"This is the most difficult part to explain. There was an awareness that it was lies. At the same time, I was living in this role as Thomas Quick and in this role, I could forget that awareness. During the Thomas Quick years, I tried to hang myself. I banged my head against the wall until it bled. In the nights, I would wake up screaming 'No!' [this was noted in the hospital's medical records]. In the middle of the nights, there was an awareness that it was all make believe and then when I woke up, I got a dose of benzo and I could forget it and push it aside.\"</p> <p>In 2001, a new clinical director at S\u00e4ter reviewed Quick's medical records. He was shocked to discover the dosage and Quick's supply of drugs quickly dwindled. Once he stopped taking them, he stopped confessing. Instead, he announced to journalists that he would no longer co-operate with the police and withdrew from public view. He then kept his silence for seven years until Hannes R\u00e5stam tracked him down.</p> <p>\"Hannes was a very intense person with an ability to really listen to other people and also to share,\" says Bergwall, for the first time showing some small hint of emotion. \"I remember the third time we met, Hannes had seen the videotapes of the police reconstructions and he said: 'I can see you're high on drugs.' It was the first time that I remember thinking: 'Something's going to happen.' I felt: 'Yes! Something's going to change' and I was ready to confess.</p> <p>\"It was so liberating to finally tell the truth and to know that I didn't have anything to fear since it was the truth.\"</p> <p>Not everyone believes Sture Bergwall is the victim of one of the grossest miscarriages of justice in recent times. There are those who point out that he has a track record of lying convincingly and manipulating people. I am aware, throughout my conversation with him, that Bergwall is skilled at being able to mirror back what someone most wants to hear.</p> <p>Judge G\u00f6ran Lambertz cautions against \"rushing to conclusions\". He believes that in the pile of false details Bergwall gave to police, there might still be&#xa0;some elements of truth. This position has made&#xa0;him deeply unpopular in certain parts of Swedish society, especially with those \u2013 like Thomas Olsson and Jenny K\u00fcttim \u2013 who are campaigning for Bergwall's release.</p> <p>\"A lot of people have made their careers on the Thomas Quick case,\" says K\u00fcttim. \"So today they have a lot to lose.\"</p> <p>Lambertz is dismissive when I put this to him. \"Oh yes, I'm a hated man,\" he says blithely. \"I think Sture Bergwall is fooling us now, that's what I think. I don't think he's harmless. He may be a nice old man, I don't know, but the psychiatrists up there say he is still dangerous.\"</p> <p>And what if Bergwall is acquitted of all these murders by the courts? Will Lambertz still be sceptical? Will he apologise for conducting a review six years ago into the Quick case which found no fault with the police investigation?</p> <p>\"It could be right [to acquit him], it could be all wrong. It could be somewhere in the middle, I don't know. But if you ask me what I think, I would think it is more wrong than right.\"</p> <p>In S\u00e4ter, our time is coming to a close. Bergwall&#xa0;rises and waits patiently to be taken back to his ward upstairs by the two members of staff. When he has gone, what strikes me most about him is his absence of personality. He leaves no strong impression. It is perfectly possible, of course, that after 21 years of incarceration and drug addiction, he no longer has much of an idea of who he is.</p> <p>Outside, standing in the cold grey afternoon and looking up to the first floor of the hospital building, I see Bergwall at the window. He smiles, gives a small wave and then the serial killer who never was is led away. All that is left behind is the light reflected on the glass and the shadows where, a moment ago, he stood.</p>",
  "<p>England began their build-up to next year's European Championship finals with what was a disappointing draw after leading by two goals, though France were the better side for long periods and were worthy of extending their unbeaten run against the English to 12 games and 38 years.</p> <p>Before and after the Arsenal left-back Steph Houghton and the Everton midfielder Jill Scott had scored within five minutes of each other late in the first half, the home side were in control.</p> <p>But it took until the final 20 minutes \u2013 and largely due to poor play at the back by Hope Powell's team \u2013 that France drew level through two goals by the midfielder Marie Laure Delie.</p> <p>England were on the back foot throughout the opening half-hour against a French side who began the game with supreme confidence after winning all of their Euro 2013 qualifiers and having claimed victory in each of their previous 12 home games.</p> <p>As the French pressed for an opening goal, the England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley made a couple of routine saves but was then thankful to watch the striker Eug\u00e9nie le Sommer's 11th minute shot flash just wide.</p> <p>Bardsley then made a fine save from the right-back Corine Franco before, in the 28th minute, the right-back Alex Scott had to clear Sommer's eight-yard shot off the line. The game changed dramatically in the 34th minute, however, when the France goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi collected a yellow card for handling the ball outside her penalty area. From the resulting free-kick Houghton drilled her shot into the far corner.</p> <p>France had not conceded a goal in their previous six home games but, five minutes after Houghton's strike, partner Jill Scott doubled the England lead with a looping header from the left-winger Rachel Yankey's cross.</p> <p>Bardsley was finally beaten in disappointing fashion on the hour, the keeper reacting a fraction slowly to the substitute Toni Duggan's underhit back pass. Delie was able to prise the ball away from the keeper to shoot into the empty net.</p> <p>And another giveaway goal brought the equaliser, the substitute goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain getting herself stranded 12 yards off her line. Delie was on hand to lob home her second goal of the evening.</p> <p>The England coach, Hope Powell, said: \"We were better in the second half than the first, but we gave them two goals and in that respect it was disappointing. But we didn't lose the game. There were more positives than negatives.\"</p> <p>As England were beginning their Euro 2013 preparations, Scotland, who finished runners-up to France in their qualifying group, remain hopeful of being a second UK nation at the finals after a 1-1 draw at Hampden Park in the first leg of their play-off tie against Spain.</p> <p>The Arsenal midfielder Kim Little put the Scots ahead from the penalty spot but Spain equalised through the Chelsea striker Adriana, who then missed a spot-kick to leave the tie all-square going into Wednesday's second leg.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLcSFEsPMI0\" title=\"\">The video</a> is helpfully called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLcSFEsPMI0&amp;feature=plcp\" title=\"\">\"Danny Rose is lying to whom?\"</a> and, true, anyone clicking on the Serbian football association's website to watch it may find it difficult to understand what all the fuss is about. Which is what happens, funnily enough, when the people in control of editing obediently decide not to include the most damning footage.</p> <p>It is clever \u2013 not as clever as they think but enough to pull some people in undoubtedly. The blurb reads: \"Danny Rose said: 'Every time I touched the ball, they were doing the monkey chanting'. As you can see in this video, there was no unsportsmanlike cheering or insulting players on racial grounds.\" The video lasts six minutes and shows various clips of Rose with possession of the ball. A few whistles can be heard but nothing sinister.</p> <p>You get the drift.</p> <p>As for what happens towards the end of the match, we will have to join the dots ourselves because the point at which everything starts to get really moody is, coincidentally, the precise moment when the video stops. Nothing that follows the 76th minute makes the cut. No monkey chants, none of that loud, aggressive, ooh-oohing that provided the soundtrack for England Under-21s' match in Krusevac and, inconveniently for the host nation, is now all over the internet. Nothing to see here is the message, nothing but a \"sports atmosphere, full of respecting fair-play spirit\".</p> <p>Nobody is fooled and the Football Association has every justification to stick a black marker pen through Serbia's name when it comes to deciding its friends and future opponents. Even ignoring the racism from the stands, England's goalkeeper, Jack Butland, collected enough stones from his goalmouth to feel like Matthias in <em>Life of Brian</em>. England have never been back to Madrid <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/nov/17/minutebyminute.sport\" title=\"\">since the friendly against Spain in 2004</a> but, if anything, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6ySz8Cakg&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">what happened in the Stadion Mladost</a> was even more&#xa0;spiteful.</p> <p>Serbia are repeat offenders and the denials, including these crass attempts to discredit Rose, simply create the perception they would prefer screw-you defiance and feigned hardship than accept what is blindingly obvious. The Lance Armstrong tactic, if you like, or the John Terry one in football terms.</p> <p>It reeks and, plainly, Serbia deserve a higher than usual form of punishment but remember, too, this is Uefa we are talking about, where the thinking is so jumbled that Porto were fined \u20ac20,000 because of the abuse their supporters directed at Mario Balotelli in last season's Europa League, whereas Manchester City were ordered to pay \u20ac30,000 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/11/manchester-city-fined-porto-racism\" title=\"\">for being 30 seconds late out</a> of the tunnel for another match. It is a nonsense and who, seriously, would back Uefa's control and disciplinary body to get it right when it meets on 22&#xa0;November?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is barely nobody even if, at the same time, scepticism has to be balanced by the sense that English football, for all the outrage, is not exactly in a great position&#xa0;to lecture anybody right now. Yes, Uefa's punishments rank somewhere between absurd and abysmal but at least the organisation makes them public and fronts it up. Chelsea, in stark contrast, will not even disclose how much they have fined Terry after following up the&#xa0;player's apology (an apology of sorts, anyway, given that it did not mention Anton Ferdinand once) by confirming they have taken their own disciplinary action.</p> <p>It was club policy, they said, to do these things behind the scenes. Which is true, loosely speaking, but still pretty flimsy bearing in mind the hypocrisies at play here. A football club cannot seriously talk of a \"zero-tolerance\" policy towards discrimination but then, more or less, turn a blind eye when it is one of their own. Or maybe they can.</p> <p>Terry, we know, has kept the club captaincy. The Professional Footballers' Association would have to be approached if the fine went beyond two weeks' wages but has heard nothing. In other words, zero-tolerance in Terry's case means, at most, a fortnight's salary. \"He has put a little bit of a cloud over the image of the club,\" was pretty much as far as the manager, Roberto Di Matteo, was willing to tiptoe. Try a storm that Thor himself might have summoned.</p> <p>The whole thing is deeply unsatisfactory but Chelsea are not alone when it comes to double standards. A mentality seems to exist whereby clubs and indeed many supporters are quite happy to back the anti-racism campaigns, wear the Kick It Out badges, stick up the posters, tut&#xa0;disapprovingly about the stories from eastern Europe and say all the right things until, of course, that awkward moment when it actually involves their own.</p> <p>It is a hive-mind culture, first with Luis Su\u00e1rez, now with Terry, accompanied by the blinding club loyalties that compel so many people to attack, like zombies, anybody who dares to question or, heaven forbid, criticise.</p> <p>Just recall what happened to Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out, after he had the temerity to question Liverpool's handling of the Su\u00e1rez case. Ouseley, you see, is on the board of the Manchester United Foundation and that meant, despite the fact that he is a Millwall supporter, the 67-year-old was automatically depicted as the enemy for many Liverpool supporters. Ouseley estimates he received around 300 emails threatening damage on him, containing racist slurs and other insults \u2013 though nothing, strangely, when it was his evidence that sank Rio Ferdinand in the United defender's \"choc-ice\" case.</p> <p>Where we can be grateful, clearly, is that the scenes in the Mladost would never happen in England now. All the same, let's not be too pleased with ourselves when there are black players openly talking about boycotting Kick It Out and the PFA because they perceive them as weak and unsupportive.</p> <p>Last weekend an Oldham Athletic player, Lee Croft, was accused of calling one of Sheffield United's ballboys the N-word. Though Croft denies it, the boy in question, aged 14, was visibly upset. Two Shrewsbury players, Marvin Morgan and Jermaine Grandison, complained of being racially abused at Hartlepool last month. Marvin Sordell of Bolton Wanderers did likewise after a game at Millwall two weekends ago. For speaking out, a mocked-up photograph was sent to his Facebook account showing a gun pointing towards the 21-year-old and blood splattered across his face and shirt. Grammar uncorrected, the message was: \"dont fuck with the millwall\". Patrice Evra, Su\u00e1rez's victim, is now booed routinely at Anfield. Anton Ferdinand has received death threats and a bullet in the post. And on and on. He doesn't want the publicity, but I also know of one ex-England international who is taking his coaching badges abroad because he doesn't think there are opportunities for black managers in his own country.</p> <p>The authorities need to be stronger \u2013 however it is dressed up, the FA's four-match ban for Terry is pitiful \u2013 and a conversation with Uefa's head of communications, David Farrelly, did at least encourage the sense that behind the scenes the relevant people are aware of how the organisation is perceived. He said Uefa is actually putting an awful lot of money, time and effort into promoting anti\u2011racism campaigns, with 227 different events taking place as part of the two\u2011week Football Against Racism in Europe action programme.</p> <p>That is all very good but sooner or later a team, or a player, will walk off the pitch and the impression Uefa gives is that the punishment for the victim would be greater than for the offender. Think back to Michel Platini's response when asked about the prospect of Balotelli doing just this in Euro 2012. His reply was a belter. \"It's a yellow card,\" Uefa's president pointed out.</p> <p>Then consider Uefa's own media coverage of what happened in Krusevac, the Pravda-style operation to airbrush out anything bad for business and what it says about how the organisation works. \"The only negative for England was that Rose saw red for a second yellow card after the final whistle,\" the match report on Uefa's website stated, in the final sentence of 300-plus words. There were no details of what had led to it or what followed. Serbia had been backed by a \"fervent\" crowd. That is one word for it.</p> <p>The problem for Uefa is that it talks a good game but the credibility of its disciplinary processes has been damaged to the point it is now seen as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. The last time Serbian supporters racially abused England players, in the European Under-21 Championship in 2007, the initial fine was \u20ac24,000. What was largely unreported at the time was that Uefa appealed against the judgment of its own organisation, arguing it was too lenient. The appeal was successful and the fine was subsequently increased \u2013 by \u20ac6,500.</p> <p>Which pretty much says it all.</p>",
  "<p>The sight of empty grandstands shivering as bare, scaffolding sentinels at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/14/sebastian-vettel-wins-korea-gp-f1\" title=\"\">last week's Korean Grand Prix</a> in Yeongam was a reminder for Formula One of the harsh economic realities facing the sport as a whole.</p> <p>Financial restraints have also played an important part in racing terms this season, in the number of pay drivers on track and, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/16/felipe-massa-ferrari-new-contract\" title=\"\">with all the leading drives now decided</a>, is key to how the final seats will be allocated. While the term pay drive is still bandied about, its meaning is no longer clear. The problem with such terminology is that it conjures up a bygone age.</p> <p>Niki Lauda took out a bank loan to fund his first drives and went on to win three titles but it is certainly not the great Austrian that comes to mind when the term is used. In recent years, Jean-Denis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz, who stumped up to Larousse in the mid-90s and was six seconds off the pace, would certainly do so. As would Ricardo Rosset, who with Tyrell in 1998 was famous for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC3iGSGMJ8c\" title=\"\">such a shocker in qualifying at Monaco</a> that <em>Autosport</em> reported his mechanics changed the name on his scooter from \"Rosset\" to: \"tosseR\".</p> <p>The reality now is that the modern generation of drivers would simply not be on the grid were they not of a certain standard. Williams's two drivers bring income to the team. Pastor Maldonado, who won in Spain this year, and Bruno Senna (both are yet to be re-signed) are typical of the new breed meeting demands on the track, according to the team's chief executive, Toto Wolff. \"The classic pay driver was one who was clearly underperforming but had a big budget,\" he said. \"There are no drivers who are clearly underperforming. Most have either won championships before, or races, there is no one who is a waste of time.</p> <p>\"You simply can't afford to put a complete loser in the car who is two seconds off the pace because it is going to hit you hard in the long term.\"</p> <p>By which he means the commercial long-term. Almost all the teams that are funded through sponsorship have faced new challenges raising money, especially since tobacco advertising was banned. Wolff said: \"We are getting more creative in terms of what we are offering to our partners. It's not straightforward \u2013 put a sticker on the car and buy 20 paddock club tickets \u2013 that's not working anymore.\"</p> <p>The search for new income streams has come when drivers rising up the racing ranks have also changed. They are certainly more acquainted with the relationship between money and racing. \"The sport has changed in the junior categories,\" said Wolff. \"If you want to do a proper go-kart season you spend about \u20ac100,000 to \u20ac200,000; Formula Renault is something like \u20ac300,000 to \u20ac400,000; GP3, \u20ac600,000; then there is GP2 which is nearer to \u20ac2m than \u20ac1.5m. So the drivers that are knocking on the door of F1 have been used to raising money to find partners for sponsorship.\"</p> <p>Many drivers, then, are coming to the sport already supplied with backers as an imperative of just getting close to F1. But as attractive as this may be, it is not the deciding factor. If the money is there, teams want to employ the drivers who have that extra two-tenths of pace. Sauber, for example, <a href=\"http://www.formula1.com/results/team/\" title=\"\">now just 20 points behind Mercedes in the constructors' championship</a>, will be hedging their bets on a replacement for Sergio P\u00e9rez. If they pass the German squad the extra revenue would ease their need to hire a driver with backing. No wonder they are waiting, for teams in their position these are now crucial financial decisions.</p> <p>\"It would be foolish not to look at the economic background of a driver. Having said that, priority No1 is performance,\" said Wolff. \"I wouldn't like to compromise on performance, because you lose the money at the end by losing partners and losing constructors' money.\"</p> <p>Performance then is still key but now the commercial complexities are so blurred, simple catch-all descriptions like pay drives no longer suffice. Santander followed Fernando Alonso to Ferrari for example, he is no pay driver but his value is clear. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/28/mclaren-sergio-perez-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">Then there is McLaren signing</a> P\u00e9rez, an \"income stream\" at Sauber of undoubted raw talent, but who McLaren will now pay a reported \u00a320m for a multi-year deal. Yet it is also hard not to imagine the attractive new sponsorship possibilities and markets that having a non-British driver will offer, nor that, behind the scenes, the team have not already done some deal with the Mexican telecommunications group, Telmex, that were bankrolling him.</p> <p>It is an emotive issue, fans simply want to see the best drivers. Caterham received a lot of stick when looking to take Vitaly Petrov over Jarno Trulli for 2012, yet when both ran the same car early in the year, their times were nearly identical. Petrov also brought backing, so was the obvious choice and over the season his race-pace has been almost on a par with non pay driver Heikki Kovalainen, while further Russian sponsors have since come onboard. Caterham fans have been placated and it made a good decision for the team, especially in the long-term financial sense. A choice that reflects the modern reality within F1, a reality no longer well-served by the throwaway simplicity of a dated phrase.</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing unusual about a married couple from Sydney celebrating their second wedding anniversary with a trip to Bangkok. But it seems safe to assume that Gavin and Kasey Badger will become the first to do so by refereeing a rugby league international together, when they combine to take charge of the unlikely-sounding fixture between Thailand and the Philippines on Sunday.</p> <p>Gavin has been established for a while as one of the leading officials in the National Rugby League, earning him the sort of opprobrium in Sydney and Brisbane with which Premier League officials are wearily familiar. Badger's was already an interesting tale, as he is the only NRL full-time referee with an indigenous background, having grown up in the tough Redfern area to the south of Sydney's Central Station. But by marrying Kasey, a rising referee who is already the most successful female official in Australian rugby league history, he lifted the story to an irresistible level.</p> <p>Kasey, who grew up in the western suburb of Parramatta, is 15 years Gavin's junior at 25 but they will referee as equals when the national teams of Thailand and Philippines make their debuts at the Royal Police Stadium. \"It's exactly the same two-referee system that we've been operating in the NRL for the last few years,\" Gavin Badger said. \"There's no number one and number two. We'll just swap and change throughout the game.\"</p> <p>\"The big difference is we won't have the same technology for communication that they have in the NRL,\" Kasey added. \"I guess that's where being husband and wife might come in handy. We know each other pretty well. If he does something I think is wrong, he'll be able to tell by the way I glare at him.\"</p> <p>Kasey Badger reports that the brutal world of the NRL has yet to experience a Keys and Gray moment. \"I haven't had any issues,\" she said, having made her debut in the developmental Toyota Cup competition earlier this year in a match at Manly, of all places. \"That's not to say I haven't taken any criticism, obviously. But that pretty much goes with being a referee.\"</p> <p>Gavin insists loyally that his spouse has the ability and authority to referee at the highest level \u2013 NRL matches and who knows, perhaps even in the State of Origin cauldron between Queensland and New South Wales. \"I might be a bit biased but I've got no doubts,\" he said. \"I know better than anyone how much she puts into her refereeing.\"</p> <p>The next step must surely be a reality television programme, in the Badger Sydney sett. \"We don't just talk about rugby league,\" laughed Kasey. \"But sometimes there will be disagreements about decisions if we're sat at home watching a match. More than anything we're rugby league fans.\" Those winter nights must just fly by.</p> <p>\"That's what gave us the idea of refereeing together,\" Gavin said. \"I'm an old school friend of Andrew Charles,&#xa0;who's trying to get rugby league going here in Thailand, and when he asked me to referee this game, Kasey was always going to come but she was just going to be a touch judge. Then we got talking about the fact that we've had two referees in the NRL this year, and it just seemed like a great opportunity for me and Kasey to referee together, which will be an interesting experience for us and an interesting story for the game.\"</p> <p>There is a serious side to the fixture \u2013 the NRL, buoyed by a huge new television deal with Channel Nine, is keen to reach into new markets, as it battles the growing domestic threat of Australian Rules. Manly and Canberra are expected to take their first-round fixture to China early next year. Perhaps the Badgers will celebrate their third wedding anniversary in Beijing.</p>",
  "<p>Not since John Major's \"Back To Basics\" call rebounded so spectacularly on Conservative politicians in 1993 and 1994 has the Tory party been the object of such ridicule. The images that emerged this weekend of chancellor George Osborne slumped back in a first-class train seat, next to a female aide, as they chortled over a film on their laptop, were unfortunate enough. There was not a red box in sight on the images from the 15.11 from Wilmslow to Euston, as the man trying to steer the economy out of recession headed back from his Cheshire constituency on a Friday afternoon. It was just eight days since David Cameron had delivered a stirring call to the nation to stick with the Tories through the tough times. The prime minister, defensive about his background and claims that he is out of touch with ordinary folk, had insisted he was not in politics \"to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it\".</p> <p>Unbeknown to Osborne as he headed south, however, was that details of his journey were spreading like wildfire on Twitter. A televison journalist on the train had seen the chancellor plonking himself down in first class while in possession of a standard-class ticket.</p> <p>Accounts differ of how Osborne was subsequently obliged to pay \u00a3189.90 for two upgrades. Talk of a frosty exchange with a train manager was denied by the Treasury. But what is beyond doubt is that the chancellor did not want to move to the busy standard-class area so had to pay up. The Twitter hashtags multiplied within minutes; #getgeorgeintostandard, #firstgate, #plebgate2 #segregate #weareallinfirstclasstogether being just a few. By late afternoon the <em>Sun</em> newspaper had already decided on its front-page headline for the morning \u2013 The Great Train Snobbery.</p> <p>On the same day another cabinet minister had been on a different journey to meet the prime minister at Chequers. As Osborne went south, chief whip Andrew Mitchell drove north-west out of London to the PM's Buckinghamshire country residence. Mitchell wanted to tell Cameron that, after four weeks at the centre of a storm known in Westminster as \"Plebgate\", he was quitting the cabinet. Mitchell had admitted swearing at the police after they refused him access through Downing Street's main gate on his bike, but he had denied officers' reports that he had also called them \"plebs\" and \"morons\".</p> <p>Many in his own party disagreed with Cameron and said Mitchell should resign for being so rude. After taking extensive soundings in the party last week, Mitchell decided to do just that. Members of his own staff in the whips' office had threatened to quit if he didn't. Having lost his battle to hang on to his keeper of discipline, Cameron's authority was weakened. Suddenly, two stories about the Tories and privilege merged into one to become one great disaster of a Saturday press for David Cameron.</p> <p>At his party conference in Birmingham, the prime minister had appeared to have steadied the Tory ship. Six months of U-turns, internal unrest and falling poll ratings after Osborne's disastrous March budget \u2013 which unleashed rows over pasty taxes, charity taxes, granny taxes and the end of the 50p tax rate \u2013 seemed to have been halted. After Labour's Ed Miliband claimed the One Nation mantle for Labour, Cameron had responded with passion, arguing that the Tories were the ones taking the hard decisions on the deficit, which Labour refused even to address.</p> <p>But within two days of MPs returning to the Commons, all the good work had been undone. Mitchell appeared looking drawn and thin at prime minister's questions, where he was taunted by Miliband for behaviour that the Labour leader said would have landed a less privileged individual in prison. But then the personality politics was overtaken by policy chaos. Cameron, under pressure over rising fuel bills, apparently jumped the gun by announcing that ministers would soon legislate to order energy companies to put customers on the lowest tariffs. No one in government except Cameron knew anything about the plan and soon it showed. The next day John Hayes, the new energy minister, obfuscated at the dispatch box. Energy secretary Ed Davey avoided answering questions about the Cameron idea as officials frantically considered how to draft the new policy into the forthcoming Energy Bill.</p> <p>At the start of this year, Labour's charge that the Tories were \"out of touch\" had sounded rather obvious and predictable. But since then, with Osborne's ill-judged cut in the 50p tax rate always there as evidence, issues of class have combined with questions of competence to make the charge resonate more strongly. The energy fiasco, as with Osborne on the train, allowed Labour to repeat its line that the Tories running the country are not just out of touch but not fully on the case.</p> <p>Michael Brown, the former Tory MP and friend of Andrew Mitchell, blamed the No 10 machine.\"It is utterly hopeless,\" he said. \"The prime minister goes to the dispatch box on Wednesday and says we are all going to get the cheapest tariff for gas and electricity. So, great. But the next day the energy minister appears and he doesn't know anything about the announcement because he is only the energy minister. It is make it up as you go along time.\"</p> <p>On Friday evening, Tory MPs were texting each other asking if what was going on in their party was real. \"People were just asking 'what are these guys leading our party on?'\" said one.</p> <p>Another young woman MP said: \"We are getting to the point where it will be impossible to change the perception of this party. The reshuffle was a chance to bring in people with normal backgrounds but it didn't happen, which is a real shame.\"</p> <p>Some of the party's most senior donors are \u2013 according to senior sources \u2013 getting increasingly restless and impatient at the way in which the Tories seem unable to escape the elitist caricature.</p> <p>The Tory communications machine was livelier than usual on Saturday, pumping out the message that it was time to focus on issues that matter to the country. \"Unemployment is down, the deficit is down, hospital waiting lists are down, the number of people in work is up.\" As our poll today shows, the Tories are not in meltdown and they are still preferred, albeit by just 1%, to run the economy, over Labour. But Miliband's party is narrowing the gap on the crucial issue of economic competence and the Labour leader's personal ratings are improving.</p> <p>On 23 October, the shadow cabinet will hold an \"away day\" at which it will flesh out the idea of One Nation Labour. There will also be a presentation from the shadow cabinet office minister Michael Dugher on the \"character and conduct\" of Cameron's government. Labour aims to contrast the serious Miliband with what it calls the \"languid, arrogant and increasingly incompetent\" Cameron team. Strategists say the issue of competence is key. \"People won't mind too much if you are posh, or even if you are a bit arrogant with it. But if you are posh, arrogant and incompetent it is a different matter,\" said a senior source.</p> <p>On Saturday, the <em>Daily Mail's</em> front page railed at the Tories for believing themselves born to rule: \"Who the Hell do They Think They Are?\" it asked. When your friends start buying the arguments of your opponents, it is time to sit up and worry.</p>",
  "<p>The death toll from a rare form on fungal meningitis linked to contaminated steroid shots prepared by a Massachusetts pharmacy has now risen to 23, health officials said Saturday.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted in its latest update that a further two additional patients are now known to have been given the fatal injection. It also increased the total number of reported cases to 284.</p> <p>Some 16 states have now been affected by the widening health scare, thought caused by batches of infected medications shipped out by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) \u2013 a pharmacy compounder near Boston that could face criminal charges over the outbreak.</p> <p>On Thursday it was confirmed that a fungal contaminate found in a sealed vial of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate at the company matched that blamed for the 20-plus deaths.</p> <p>All the victims had all received steroid shots made by the NECC, mostly to treat back pain. As many as 14,000 people received injections derived from batches mixed at the pharmacy.</p> <p>Earlier this week, federal agents from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raided NECC's premises in the Boston suburb of Framingham.</p> <p>Accompanied by local police officers, the raid came amid growing concerns that other medications sent out by the company may be contaminated, a concern that could drastically escalate the national health scare.</p> <p>The pharmacy compounder has a checkered history of violating health and safety standards, having been cited on numerous occasions by the FDA prior to the latest outbreak.</p> <p>As well as the prospect of potential criminal action, the company is already the subject of numerous civil lawsuits by those affected by the meningitis outbreak. It is thought that at least 10 different complainants have now lodged legal documents suing the NECC.</p>",
  "<p>If Exeter wondered at half-time what all the fuss was about regarding the Heineken Cup, having taken a 12-10 lead, the first 12 minutes of the second half told them in the most explicit terms.</p> <p>Exeter had experienced a narrow defeat at the holders Leinster the previous week, while Clermont Auvergne lost to the Irish province in last season's semi-final.</p> <p>The Chiefs are appearing in the Heineken Cup for the first time. When Clermont made their bow in the tournament at the end of the 1990s, Exeter had taken a first, tentative step towards becoming fully professional. They paced their rise from relative obscurity and now more than hold their own in the Premiership but Clermont, with their pedigree and experience in Europe, marked a step too far.</p> <p>The Chiefs were worth their lead, four Gareth Steenson penalties punishing Clermont's preference for conceding penalties rather than quick possession at the breakdown. Exeter attacked from deep from the outset, the quick feet of Luke Arscott, Ian Whitten and Jason Shoemark regularly taking them past the first point of the defence.</p> <p>With the scrum-half Haydn Thomas quick to exploit a hint of a gap around the fringes, the visitors at times looked ponderous and cumbersome, as if they had overdosed on the England football squad's sleeping tablets.</p> <p>Clermont found themselves squeezed in the scrum and outmanoeuvred at the breakdown but they stayed in touch because of Exeter's principal weakness in the opening half: the lineout. The Chiefs were defending a six-point lead and their own line on 14 minutes and when Whitten forced Napolioni Nalaga into touch just short of the home line, the danger should have passed. Instead, Jamie Cudmore deflected Simon Alcott's throw and Nalaga joined in the driving maul to score the game's opening try.</p> <p>Exeter were never more dangerous than when Clermont were taking restarts from the halfway line, running the ball out of their own 22 and invariably making ground but they never camped in opposition territory. They indulged in skirmishes rather than a siege, sniping around the fringes without striking a blow at the heart.</p> <p>The crowd dared to hope when two penalties from Steenson in six minutes put Exeter 12-7 ahead, but the match turned five minutes before the interval when Clermont drove a lineout and Damien Chouly's neat offload to Wesley Fofana saw the centre reach the Exeter 22. When the home No8 Richard Baxter prevented the ball being moved quickly from the subsequent ruck in an offside position, he was sent to the sin bin and Parra duly converted the penalty into points.</p> <p>The game was markedly different when Baxter returned to the field, although Clermont were only one point ahead thanks to Parra's second penalty. It was as if the Top 14 club's players had received cold water in the face during the interval, playing with a pace, intensity and control they had lacked in the first half.</p> <p>Now it was Exeter who struggled to get hold of the ball. When they did, their attacks from deep were not just snuffed out but Clermont forced turnovers, two of which led to their second and third tries.</p> <p>There was an element of fortune about the first: Whitten lost control of the ball in the tackle and Fofana exploited space down the blind-side to run 45 metres to score but he put his right foot on the touchline after a lunging tackle by Tom Johnson and smiled when the referee awarded the try rather than consult the video official.</p> <p>There was no disputing the third try which again came after Exeter had lost possession. The flanker Julien Bonnaire just kept his feet in play as he finished off a move on the right wing and he had personified the transition in his side: so confrontational and direct that Exeter found themselves playing a game they were not used to.</p> <p>The Chiefs kept trying; Arscott should have made more of two counterattacks but Clermont's three tries in the final nine minutes, through Sitiveni Sivivatu, Fofana and Nalaga, came when Exeter, because of injuries, had a centre at scrum-half, a back rower in the midfield and a prop at flanker. Worcester next weekend will be very different.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron was battling to shore up his authority on two fronts as it emerged that a revolt by young Tory MPs forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"Andrew Mitchell resigns following allegations he called police 'plebs'\">the resignation of Andrew Mitchell</a>, and party grandees \u2013 led by Lord Tebbit \u2013 broke cover to question the government's competence.</p> <p>With Downing Street still reeling from the decision by Mitchell to quit on Friday, after Cameron spent four weeks defending him, sources said a lack of support from the 2010 intake of Tory MPs finally persuaded him he had insufficient authority left.</p> <p>News of the \"youth revolt\" is a serious threat to Cameron's authority, suggesting that dozens of MPs who were overlooked in the recent reshuffle are now prepared to rebel rather than be loyal in the hope of eventual preferment.</p> <p>Sources said that when Mitchell toured the Commons tea rooms on Wednesday and Thursday, he was taken aback by the opposition to him staying put, despite Cameron's support.</p> <p>The news comes as the former Tory chairman Norman Tebbit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/20/david-cameron-andrew-mitchell-crisis\">tears into Cameron and the coalition</a>, saying its problems stem not from too many \"toffs\" but a lack of basic competence.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer,</em> Tebbit says: \"This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it. It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher's day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"The abiding sin of the government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable to manage its affairs competently.\"</p> <p>Mitchell quit over claims that he called police officers \"plebs\" and \"morons\" \u2013 something he strongly denies. He has admitted that he swore at police when they barred him from taking his bike through the main Downing Street gate.</p> <p>The resignation, coupled with claims that the chancellor, George Osborne, sat in a first-class train seat with a standard-class ticket, followed a week of confusion over energy policy. The events earned the Tory party fiercely critical headlines on Saturday, even in normally supportive papers such as the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands that Tebbit's concerns are shared by a growing number of senior Tory donors who believed Mitchell should have been sacked earlier. Sources said some of the largest contributors to the party are also questioning whether Cameron has the clarity of purpose to lead the coalition.</p> <p>In a scathing critique Tebbit says Cameron needs to find leadership skills and impose \"some managerial discipline not just on his colleagues but on himself. Had Mr Miliband concentrated his fire on a long list of muddles from the proposed sale of our national forests to the BAE and energy policy muddles of recent days it would have been far worse.\"</p> <p>A new Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll, conducted before the Mitchell resignation and Osborne rail fare furore, puts Labour on 40%, nine points ahead of the Tories on 31%. The Lib Dems are on 9%, just behind Ukip on 10%. Despite Labour's lead, the Tories still have a slight edge on the economy. When asked who they would trust most to run the economy, 30% said the Tories and 29% Labour.</p> <p>On Saturday Downing Street tried to hit back, insisting it was time to trumpet the government's achievements in cutting the deficit, unemployment and NHS waiting lists and increasing the number of people in work. On Monday Cameron will make a major speech on crime. His new \"tough but intelligent\" approach will signal the end of his infamous \"hug a hoodie\" image on law and order.</p> <p>Tory MPs and ministers said they were becoming exasperated about policy failings, particularly after the PM appeared to announce a new policy on energy prices of which the Department of Energy and Climate Change had been unaware.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was on Saturday among dozens of speakers at a TUC-organised march in London against austerity. Other rallies took place in Glasgow and Belfast.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Andrew Mitchell may finally have resigned. But the culture of two nations runs right across this government. They cut taxes for millionaires. And they raise taxes for ordinary families. They leave young people out of work while the bonuses at the banks carry on. They even have a chancellor of the exchequer who tries to travel first-class on a standard-class ticket. It's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else: everybody like you who plays their part and does the right thing. The trouble with this government is that while they are think they are born to rule, it turns out they are not very good at it.\"</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, said Miliband was leading Labour back \"to the days of Michael Foot\".</p> <p>\"The world has changed. Britain is in a global race. That's why we're dealing with our debts, getting people back to work and keeping mortgage rates low.</p> <p>\"Ed Miliband and his union paymasters are turning a blind eye to all that. By marching with them, Ed Miliband proved he still stands for more spending, more borrowing and more debt.</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Di Matteo praised his Chelsea players for not being distracted by the John Terry affair after the Premier League leaders underlined their title credentials by comprehensively beating Tottenham.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/20/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-premier-league\" title=\"\">Chelsea's 4-2 win at White Hart Lane</a> led to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas predicting they could sustain an authentic title challenge. \"This kind of form is what we saw last year with Man City,\" the Spurs manager said of his former club. \"They have gone to Arsenal and won, they have come here and won. These are difficult places to play in this league but at the moment they are at the top of their game.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo said it was \"too early\" to consider whether Chelsea could hold off the two Manchester clubs but the manager said his players deserved credit for such an emphatic performance in their first match since Terry started his four-match ban. \"It [the Terry issue] has been going on for a long time and we have just tried to focus on what is our priority, the football aspect. We haven't been distracted and just focused on the football. We have done that well.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo went on to back the club's decision not to strip Terry of the captaincy after the Football Association ruling that the former England captain had racially abused Anton Ferdinand. The club have decided to fine Terry instead and the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, said it was \"by far\" the largest punishment a player from Stamford Bridge had ever received.</p> <p>\"John will continue to be captain of the club,\" Buck said. \"We have taken disciplinary action and we think it is firm disciplinary action and appropriate for the circumstances.\"</p> <p>Chelsea's club charter states they have a \"zero tolerance\" policy for anyone found guilty of discrimination and Buck had to fend off the suggestion that the club had been too soft on their player.</p> <p>\"We have kept it mind first of all that a court of criminal law found him not guilty,\" he said. \"Of course we also note the FA decision and we certainly respect that decision. We've kept these factors in mind, we've consulted with the owner Mr [Roman] Abramovich.</p> <p>\"This is not a decision we've taken lightly. It's not a decision we took in a half-hour meeting. We discussed it over a long period of time and we think we've taken appropriate disciplinary action.\"</p> <p>The club's chief executive, Ron Gourlay, said Terry's long service should also be taken into account. \"What you've got to take into consideration as well is John's played over 550 times for the club. He's captained the side over 400 times, he's led the club and the team tremendously well during these games.</p> <p>\"We believe this was an error of judgment, it was out of character for John. He did fall below the high standards we expect. The language used on the day, whatever the context, was wrong. We've come down on John very, very heavily.</p> <p>\"We are not sweeping this under the carpet. We have had to deal with this for the last 12 months. John let himself down, he let the club down, the words were inappropriate that he used.\"</p> <p>Di Matteo said: \"The board made a decision and I respect the board's decision. I would have respected the decision because I had an input and we had discussions but ultimately they decide.\"</p>",
  "<p>People used to wonder whether Theresa May was tough enough to be home secretary. But in the week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19922026\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> buckled and bowed out and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> was caught travelling with the wrong train ticket, May's reputation has risen to new heights. As the Tories struggle to escape being seen as a bunch of arrogant public school boys who imagine they can insult police officers and ticket inspectors with impunity, May's political persona suddenly looks very attractive.</p> <p>In place of a swaggering born-to-rule contempt for lesser mortals, the home secretary has shown a steely determination to defend a Briton of humble origins, namely the computer hacker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/gary-mckinnon-feels-set-free\" title=\"\">Gary McKinnon</a>, whom she saved from being extradited to the United States. The Americans are furious about this. They take a dim view of McKinnon's activities, which included hacking into a large number of their military computers, and they were confident that May was going to hand him over. Perhaps they should have studied more carefully an earlier episode in May's career, when she first showed her willingness to defy powerful interests.</p> <p>On that previous occasion, May's target was her own party. In her speech as Tory chairman to the party conference held in Bournemouth in the autumn of 2002, she told Conservatives: \"Twice we went to the country unchanged, unrepentant, just plain unattractive. And twice we got slaughtered. Soldiering on to the next election without radical, fundamental change is simply not an option.\" She urged the Tories to face the fact that they were seen as \"the nasty party\" and to commit themselves to looking like 21st-century Britain instead of hankering after \"some mythical place called Middle England\" and descending into \"Punch and Judy politics\", \"glib moralising\" and \"hypocritical finger-wagging\".</p> <p>This speech caused enormous and lasting resentment. Even today there are Tories who \"can never forgive her for that nonsense\", as one of them put it to me. May stood accused of having \"done a Gerald Ratner\": of having rubbished her own brand. But she came through this storm of criticism \u2013 and another following serious problems with border control last Autumn \u2013 without buckling and today it is Mitchell and Osborne, not May, who are accused of damaging the Tory brand. How Ed Miliband delighted, during prime minister's questions last Wednesday, in pointing out that Mitchell, after abusing a police officer at the Downing Street gates, went off to dine at the Carlton Club, an institution redolent of traditional conservatism.</p> <p>May would be most unlikely to have done either of these things. Although determined to reform the police, she does not go around swearing at individual officers and she is certainly not a fan of the Carlton Club. As party chairman, she refused to take up the honorary membership of the club that was offered to her. More recently, the website <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home </a>asked, as one of a series of short questions designed to reveal what kind of Tory she is, whether she would prefer to go for a night out at \"the Carlton Club or Stringfellows\"?</p> <p>The home secretary replied: \"Oh come on! I've got, I've got [laughter] objections to Stringfellows as the minister for women and equalities [at that time another of her ministerial responsibilities] and I'm afraid the Carlton Club, hmm. My night out would be with my husband, wherever he chose to take me.\"</p> <p>This refusal to allow herself to be pigeonholed is characteristic. In the same interview, she was asked which book she would prefer to read \u2013 Edmund Burke's <em>Reflections on the Revolution in France</em> or Louise Bagshawe's <em>Desire</em>: a choice between one of the greatest works of conservatism and a piece of chick-lit by a woman who has since changed her name to Louise Mensch. May just replied: \"I wouldn't read either of them, sorry.\"</p> <p>Many people have testified that lunch or dinner with May can be a sadly unrewarding experience. \"It was hard to get a word out of her,\" one Tory said. She does not gossip or leak or betray any desire to discuss political ideas. A Tory woman said of May: \"She's not at all unpleasant. She's just not cosy.\" When this woman described herself as \"a good friend\" of May's, another Tory woman retorted: \"Yes, but would you discuss having your legs waxed with her?\"</p> <p>In a recent interview, which was adorned with photographs of her as a child, so was presumably meant to reveal more about her, May said: \"I am a practising member of the Church of England, a vicar's daughter.\" Her father, the Reverend Hubert Brasier, was killed in a car accident just after May left university, but again, she vouchsafes no details, a reticence that would not be shown by most politicians.</p> <p>May was born in 1956 and educated at Holton Park girls' grammar school, at Wheatley in Oxfordshire, which became Wheatley Park comprehensive school in her last year. She read geography at Oxford, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/benazir-bhutto\" title=\"\">Benazir Bhutto </a>(a future prime minister of Pakistan, assassinated in 2007) introduced May to her future husband, Philip May: \"I hate to say this, but it was at an Oxford University Conservative Association disco\u2026 this is wild stuff. He was a good debater and Benazir had got to know him through that.\"</p> <p>After leaving Oxford, May worked for a time at the Bank of England. She became a councillor in south London and fought two parliamentary seats before winning Maidenhead in 1997. All this sounds rather humdrum, but at Westminster her ability to run things was soon recognised. In 1999, she became the first of the 1997 intake to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.</p> <p>But although respected by Tory party managers as a safe pair of hands, and one of the few competent women in the parliamentary party, it cannot be said she possessed the linguistic gifts to make a wider reputation in opposition. Nor did she seem anxious to cultivate a broad range of contacts. Unlike many politicians, she does not spend her time trying to be loved or building a power base. On many evenings, she could be seen having dinner with her husband, who is a banker. They have been married for 32 years and have no children.</p> <p>It was perhaps to avert the danger of being regarded as unbearably dull that May began to wear exceptionally smart shoes. But although her footwear gave journalists something to write about, it also suggested to ignorant observers that May might be a rather empty-headed person, who cared only about amassing a large collection of shoes.</p> <p>This prejudice has been dispelled by her tenure since 2010 of the Home Office. The department is a perilous one, which many politicians have left under a cloud. May has thrived there. As David Ruffley, a Tory who, like May was first elected in 1997 and who knows the Home Office from having worked there before that as Ken Clarke's special adviser, put it: \"She has developed a reputation for being a very tough operator and an incredibly successful Whitehall warrior. She has not only got Home Office civil servants to bow to her will, but has fought her corner incredibly effectively against other cabinet ministers such as Vince Cable.\"</p> <p>May has pressed forward with two main projects: curbing immigration and reforming the police. It is not yet possible to say whether she will achieve either objective, but on her own back-benches she is respected for making a good start. On the police front, her appointment of Tom Winsor to produce a rigorous review of pay and conditions, and then to serve as the first non-policeman ever to be made chief inspector of constabulary, is confirmation that she is serious. The police have not so far been able to get up a campaign against her as they did against some of her predecessors and against Mitchell.</p> <p>The job of home secretary involves a number of dangerous decisions in which it is necessary to cut through a tangle of political and legal considerations in order to achieve clarity. This is what May did in the case of McKinnon. She was rewarded with praise from all sides of the House, with the notable exception of her predecessor as home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9618928/Alan-Johnson-Home-Secretary-Theresa-May-took-the-easy-way-out.html\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson</a>, who declared in a subsequent article: \"The US was entitled to request and expect extradition. Theresa May has not reached a brave decision, she's taken the easy way out.\"</p> <p>Naturally, there is speculation that May, despite or even because of her opacity, might one day be the new, more classless face the Tory party needs. Could she follow Angela Merkel, another undemonstrative daughter of a clergyman, and become her country's leader? I admit I would find this astonishing: May has the necessary toughness , but I do not see that she has the oratorical gifts. But I should at once add that it is easy to make the error of underestimating May.</p>",
  "<p>The defending champions arrived with concerns about their form, their tryless home win over Exeter in the first round having launched their campaign for a third consecutive title in anything but the grand manner. They left west Wales with the spoils from round two, but with brows still slightly creased. This was a job satisfactorily executed, with the sweet accompaniment of more pool points but without the beat that goes with Ireland's finest at their all-consuming best.</p> <p>That it was won by prosaic means was revealed by the choice of Mike Ross as man of the match. The tighthead prop was a worthy recipient, having led the assault at the scrummage at the moment when the game might have been about to turn the way of the Scarlets. That Leinster were way below their imperious form of last season was shown when Gareth Maule stood up his opposite number \u2013 Brian O'Driscoll no less \u2013 and left him in his wake for a solo try.</p> <p>Rhys Priestland converted from the touchline and the score stood at 14-10 in favour of the visitors but with the home team on the verge of launching one of those comebacks that give them a sort of irresistibility of their own. Instead, the Leinster scrum surged and Jonathan Sexton kicked the third of his four penalties. A few minutes later he landed his last, similarly awarded at a scrum against a hastily retreating pack. Sexton was the kicker but it was Ross and the heavyweights who had come to the rescue.</p> <p>Sexton had had a little golden moment of his own earlier, dropping a goal from near the halfway line after collecting a sliced clearance by Liam Williams. With a tally of 15 points, he could claim to have had an impact on the game but his performance was a mixture, a stew of good and bad, to complement that of his opposite number, Rhys Priestland.</p> <p>Both missed relatively simple shots on goal \u2013 three apiece \u2013 and both committed errors immediately after sunnier moments. In Sexton's case, this meant he followed his drop goal with a sitter missed and a kick out on the full. In Priestland's, his touchline conversion of Maule's try was followed by a dropped catch and a 22 restart despatched into touch without bouncing.</p> <p>Priestland could say that he was on the receiving end of a choppier supply line. The confidence and potency of the Scarlets in attack depend on how many times they can work the ball into the hands of George North on the right wing. The answer was very few and when he did come off the touchline at the end of the first half in search of the ball, he lost control of it on the first occasion and was held up on the second, with Leinster being awarded the put-in at the scrum.</p> <p>A sign of the confidence of Leinster in attack was how often they were prepared to kick towards North. If the chase was good, the catcher would have no chance to build up a head of steam. They kicked frequently and North was contained. The very best crossfield kick from Sexton saw the Scarlets' talisman backpedalling and unable to stop Isa Nacewa from catching and touching down. If North was exposed at the end of the move it was not his fault, the real damage having been done by the Leinster forwards with a commanding drive from a lineout.</p> <p>This try came a few minutes after Leinster were awarded a penalty, mere seconds after the start, Rob McCusker going off his feet at the first ruck. Sexton landed the simple kick, the most effective way to dampen the ardour of a frothing home side. A second penalty by Sexton after Gordon D'Arcy had engineered a turnover meant the defending champions were into double figures and had conceded nothing. The nearest they came to leaking points was when Priestland drove them back with a kick, and, from the lineout, the forwards drove before Scott Williams tried to thread a ball through from close range. North could not gather cleanly.</p> <p>In the second half, the game perked up, with Maule's try and the counter by the Leinster pack. The final scare for the victors came when Ian Madigan was sent to the sin bin for a challenge on Liam Williams in the air and they had to negotiate the last seven minutes of the match with 14 players. They did so comfortably enough, the final sign of a good side finishing a job without touching any heights. The Scarlets finished with Priestland overkicking a penalty punt to the corner, a sure sign of a side who have stumbled at the first two hurdles in Europe: crushed by Clermont and now shoved back by Leinster.</p> <p>The Scarlets are already also-rans, while their conquerors stride forward to their double-header in rounds three and four in December.</p>",
  "<p>At the end of a week in which an England match was postponed because no one in Warsaw could close a roof to prevent rain from flooding the national pitch, Nigel Adkins turned to a Polish stopper to plug Southampton's leaky defence. So Artur Boruc, the former Celtic goalkeeper signed as a free agent in late September, made his Premier League debut \u2013 but could not deter another deluge of goals. A slew of second-half errors means the Saints have now shipped an average of three goals per game this season.</p> <p>Continue like this and Southampton will be sunk from the Premier League. And Adkins could be cut adrift by his employers. By contrast, everything is going swimmingly for West Ham, who finished behind Southampton in last season's Championship but are currently looking far more at home in the top flight. That said, the first half here was sub-Championship standard, so much so that even Sam Allardyce admitted afterwards: \"I was surprised to win 4-1 after such a lacklustre first half.\"</p> <p>Boruc's first touch set the tone: a botched kick by the goalkeeper in the fifth minute presented the ball straight to Andy Carroll. The striker's instinct looked rusty, as he dithered before attempting a 20-yard shot that Jos\u00e9 Fonte blocked easily.</p> <p>Carroll was the focus of most of West Ham's early play, with the team's midfielders lofting the ball towards him from wide and deep, like golfers aiming for a green's flagpole from all over the fairway. Southampton coped well enough with the aerial bombardment but looked less comfortable trying to stop Matt Jarvis, whose trickery down the left was an intermittent irritant. One feint, dash and cross by the winger in the 15th minute resulted in Jos Hooiveld having to clear a James Tomkins header off the line.</p> <p>West Ham just about had the upper hand despite the decision by Adkins to deploy a five-man midfield, presumably in an effort to control possession.</p> <p>The closest Southampton came to bothering Jussi Jaaskelainen in the first half was when Jay Rodriguez took down a perceptive pass from Morgan Schneiderlin before stabbing wide from 18 yards. It was not a bad attempt but the miss inevitably prompted wondering as to whether Rickie Lambert would have done better \u2014 Adkins had left Southampton's top scorer on the bench, as he did at Manchester City on the first day of the season. The ploy did not work on that occasion and it did not work here.</p> <p>\"They've conceded a lot of goals and are struggling confidence-wise so I said that if we put pressure on them they will make mistakes,\" said Allardyce of his half-time team-talk. He was quickly proved right.</p> <p>Within a minute of the resumption the deadlock was broken in suitably scruffy fashion. Mark Noble clipped a 40-yard free-kick into the box; Fonte and James Collins challenged for it but neither connected and the ball bounced past Boruc and into the corner of the net. Southampton's prospects of a first clean sheet of the season were in tatters. So was their defence a minute later when the left-back Maya Yoshida was beaten to a breaking ball by Yossi Benayoun. The Israeli, making his second debut for the club following his summer transfer, scampered into the box before sliding low pass across the face of goal to Kevin Nolan, who tapped into the net.</p> <p>Southampton nearly allowed Nolan to inflict more damage in the 60th minute, when he got on the end of the quickly-taken freekick, only for his close-range effort to be blocked by Boruc. Two minutes later Southampton hit back in style. Rodriguez seemed to be attempting a shot when he slipped and spooned the ball to Adam Lallana, who swivelled near the penalty spot before shooting into the roof of the net.</p> <p>Lambert was introduced one minute later and almost made an immediate impact, curling a 20-yard free-kick just over. But then Southampton, just as they seemed to be working up a head of steam, blundered at the back again, Fonte handling the ball while jumping for it with Carroll. Noble sent Boruc the wrong way from the spot.</p> <p>Moments after replacing Carroll in the 81st minute, Modibo Ma\u00efga took advantage of more feeble defending by Southampton to wriggle into the box and fire into the corner of the net. \"We conceded very poor goals today,\" admitted Adkins.</p> <p>Asked how long he expects to be given to sort out this persistent problem, he replied: \"Honest answer? I don't know.\"</p>",

But on the cover of this week's <em>Grazia</em> she's not even name-checked as a real person.

Celebrity images wallpaper our world, so while I prefer it if the famous are, to some extent, hot, I also prefer it that hotness comes in a variety of formats.</p> <p>I'm not sure it's your place to pass judgment on the mental state of Lady Gaga, is it? We have no reason not to believe this development marks the conquering of her demons; either way, she's making a statement about weight, and the media fixation on weight, that can only be constructive as far as everyone watching her is concerned. She's also got form on stirring up bother, destabilising the status quo of the glamour industry, questioning prevailing diktats on what is beautiful. Why not her?</p> <p>Lena Dunham is, of course, a significant talent. (And thanks for the awards/ book deal run down, I'd somehow missed that in all my marvelling over the miracle of her un-honed thighs. Oh no. Hang on. I hadn't.) Dunham's appearance is only part of what makes her interesting. But pretending it's totally irrelevant is disingenuous. She's on telly, after all.

What about Mark Fast and his size 12 (gasp!) catwalk models? That was 2009. Where did that go? Nowhere. And what difference has it all made? There are tiny, over-hyped gains. And then you go shopping and you can't buy a size 16 in Reiss. They don't make them (Except for in \"three or four\" designs, they say. Generous.)</p> <p>But let's go on a bit more about Lena Dunham because at least we both agree on her greatness. <em>Girls</em> has been touted as this amazing turning point. Then you watch it and discover that every single other actor in it is a Hollywood-standard hottie.</p> <p><strong>PV </strong>It's beginning to sound like you don't want this to be the start of any significant change, Viv. I agree that, over the course of the last few years, the bigger-than-tiny bodies that have been trumpeted and lauded, turned out to be nothing more than well-proportioned, equally unrealistic, blink-and-you-miss-their-moment exceptions to the super skinny rule, but a) I'm not responsible for that, or the sizing policies of the high street; and b) I do think this time will be different. Part of what will make it different is celebrating it. Which is what I'm doing here.</p> <p>Maybe it's comforting to hang onto the Them against Us, Fatty versus Thinny perspective on the debate. But I'm bored of it. As bored of having my own thinness equated with a lack of credibility, authenticity and integrity, as you are of not being able to shop at Reiss \u2013 and Christina Hendricks is of having her cleavage monopolise all interview questions.</p> <p><strong>VG </strong>Oh, I'm tired, is all. (Maybe it's my weight? Kidding.) I truly hope you're right and this time really is different. Meanwhile I love a cheap weight gag as much as the next person. Especially if that person is the Lena Dunham who puts wisecracks in her ex-boyfriend's mouth about her being \"handsome\": \"You were never fat. You're, er, like a dumpling. Round. And soft.\" Ouch.</p> <p>Opposites and clashes and fights are only entertaining so far, it's true. But I think I'm more cynical than you because I feel this is about something bigger than this whole waif versus glamazon nonsense. As you suggest, we live in a world dominated by visuals and image. That is not the fault of the beautiful people. And I agree that they're not superficial by definition. Well, not all of them.</p> <p>But it is fast becoming the responsibility of all of us to figure out how to resist being driven by surface and appearance. If I had that one figured out, I would be more optimistic about the prospect of change. Maybe we should ban the internet. Or eyes. Meanwhile let us join hands across the divide and meet at Reiss. You can help me buy accessories.</p>",
  "<p>Mick McCarthy, Roy Keane and the usual suspects may have to look elsewhere for their return to management. The Bolton board were always inclined to give their job to Jimmy Phillips on a permanent basis and are unlikely to have had a change of heart after seeing the caretaker manager oversee a stirring fightback that overturned a two-goal deficit for a rousing win.</p> <p>For his first match in charge, Phillips boldly made three changes to the lineup used at Millwall before the international break, when a fifth defeat in the first 10 games resulted in Owen Coyle being sacked. Phillips was rewarded with the sort of sleeves-rolled performance that would have kept Coyle in charge.</p> <p>Informed sources at the club have indicated that long-term control of the team is on the plate for Phillips and Sammy Lee, and the caretaker signalled on Saturday night that both were up for the challenge. \"We're both ex-Bolton players and love it here,\" Phillips said. \"Do we want the job? We're certainly enjoying it.\"</p> <p>For the City manager, Derek McInnes, it was a disappointing way to end his first year in charge at Ashton Gate. He inherited a poor team, who were bottom of the Championship when he was appointed in October last year and did well to keep them up. He will deserve a medal if he does it again.</p> <p>After finishing 20th financial imperatives restricted him to shopping in the bargain basement in the summer. Typical of City's business was the replacement of David James with Tom Heaton, a goalkeeper who couldn't get in the Cardiff team last season.</p> <p>Phillips dropped Zat Knight, Keith Andrews and David Ngog in favour of Tyrone Mears, Martin Petrov and Benik Afobe, but had his game plan in the bin after 20 minutes, by which stage Bolton had conceded twice. City took the lead in the third minute when Albert Adomah's cross was deflected towards Steven Davies, who scored with a spectacular overhead kick that nestled inside Adam Bogdan's left-hand upright. The margin was doubled when Tim Ream brought down Martyn Woolford and Davies made short work of the penalty. Two more goals made it four in nine games for the 24-year-old striker, who had four years with Derby before joining for \u00a3750,000 during the close season.</p> <p>At this stage City were the better team, but after half an hour without managing a decent strike, Bolton were back in it when Chris Eagles, just outside the D in the inside-left channel, fired a free-kick low inside Heaton's left-hand post. Eagles, a forward of Premier League quality, has now scored six in 11 Championship appearances. Goals change games, as the sages are forever telling us, and at last the Trotters broke into a canter. \"That one coming before half-time was vital\", Phillips said.</p> <p>Lifted at an important time, Bolton hit their straps in the second half, when their top-tier experience came to the fore. Equality was therefore delayed until the 62nd minute, when an intuitive pass from Kevin Davies bisected the City centre-halves. Jay Spearing, the midfielder on loan from Liverpool, ran through and lifted the ball over Heaton with a deft expertise that had the hallmark of his Anfield pedigree.</p> <p>It was all Bolton and City could not contain them. Kevin Davies \"bought\" some unlikely free-kicks by backing into his marker to help maintain the momentum and Petrov, from distance, had Heaton at full stretch overhead. The winner was always coming and the turnaround was completed when Eagles, the man of the match, set up Petrov, and the winger burst through the middle to score with an emphatic shot on the run.</p>",
  "<p>The mark of true champions is to win through even in adversity, and 10-man Manchester City came from behind to stun West Bromwich Albion by taking all three points in stoppage time when most sides would have settled for one.</p> <p>Had Romelu Lukaku's finishing been a bit sharper City could easily have gone home with nothing, for the West Brom substitute missed three late chances in his nine minutes on the pitch, before Edin Dzeko plundered an unlikely winner after levelling the scores 11 minutes earlier. In a match when every substitution made a difference, City's changes combined successfully when Sergio Ag\u00fcero galloped down the right in the closing seconds before looking up and releasing Dzeko with a perfect pass for a perfect finish.</p> <p>\"It was a strange game but we don't feel as though we pinched the result,\" the City assistant, David Platt, said. \"A few things went against us in the match \u2013 going a man down and conceding a silly goal \u2013 but we stayed in control and I felt we deserved to win.\"</p> <p>The character of the game changed abruptly in first half when James Milner was dismissed for a professional foul with more than an hour to play. Moments earlier Mario Balotelli had picked up the afternoon's first booking for a retaliatory&#xa0;foul on Claudio Yacob but that was just par for the course. Milner's exit, shortly after he had found Balotelli with a magnificent crossfield pass to help set up a chance for Carlos Tevez, left City short-handed with their most volatile individual treading on eggshells.</p> <p>While Milner would dispute the term \"professional foul\" and claim he was going for the ball, he caught Shane Long instead and although the foul was 30 yards out, the Albion forward was denied a clear run on goal. Milner was desperately trying to retrieve Vincent Kompany's error after the City captain had been caught in possession attempting to dribble out of trouble on halfway, and a combination of Long's alertness and James Morrison's excellent pass simply left him with too much to do.</p> <p>A lively and open encounter became fractious after that, with Long, Yacob and Gabriel Tamas receiving yellow cards for the home side before the interval, and Tevez and Balotelli being fortunate not to join them. Not that Balotelli considered himself fortunate. He went over to make a point to the referee, Mark Clattenburg, on the half-time whistle, only to be cut off in his prime by Joe Hart, who wisely grabbed his arm and ushered him from the pitch.</p> <p>Although Roberto Mancini must have been tempted to make a change, Balotelli returned for the second half, and was soon combining with Tevez for the Argentinian to bring a fine save from Ben Foster. Tamas made the next save, the big defender bravely getting in the way of a goal-bound drive from Ga\u00ebl Clichy, before Balotelli missed the best chance the game had so far produced on the hour from a Tevez free-kick.</p> <p>Although not exactly giving Foster a workout, City were doing most of the attacking at that stage and making light of their numerical disadvantage. So it must have been dispiriting for the home side when Mancini finally brought off Balotelli for Ag\u00fcero, a striker the visitors were hoping to keep in reserve for Ajax on Wednesday. Steve Clarke made a substitution at the same time, however, and in a rare West Brom attack Peter Odemwingie's tame shot allowed Long to stroll between Kompany and Joleon Lescott and guide the ball expertly past Hart. Two can play at that game though, and when Mancini threw on Dzeko for the last 12 minutes the Bosnian too found almost immediate reward, getting his head to Tevez's floated free-kick to leave Foster punching fresh air in the manner of Hart in Poland.</p> <p>There were late chances for Micah Richards at one end and Lukaku at the other, before Ag\u00fcero broke from defence to make the game safe. The Argentinian does not always look up, but this time he did and once he saw Dzeko in space the game was up for a home side who would not have been flattered by a point, or even three, but ended up with none. \"We deserved something from the game,\" a disappointed but resigned Clarke said. \"Maybe we should have been more careful, we were chasing a win instead of settling for a point, but credit to City. They are champions for a reason.\"</p>",
  "<p>Brendan Rodgers cited faith in young talent as one of the reasons his Reading tenure ended in dismissal after 23 games. Three years and one transformation later, vindication arrived in front of the man who fired him, Royals' chairman John Madejski, as 17-year-old Raheem Sterling gave Liverpool their first home league win of the season.</p> <p>The Jamaican-born England prospect became the second-youngest goalscorer in Liverpool's history with a finish that bore the hallmarks of the youngest in his prime. Had Liverpool another Michael Owen in their ranks, the win would have been secure long before Brian McDermott's side stirred to generate a nervous finale.</p> <p>\"It has been a long time coming,\" said Rodgers. \"We should have had three points here long before now, but it was an excellent goal and a terrific performance, especially on the back of an international break. We created so many chances, we had 19 shots on goal, and we need to improve our finishing for sure. It is an on-going theme.\"</p> <p>The otherwise excellent Luis Su\u00e1rez, Nuri Sahin and substitute Jonjo Shelvey all squandered clear chances to add to Sterling's first competitive goal for Liverpool. Reading almost capitalised and the introduction of Jason Roberts, who refused to wear a Kick It Out campaign T-shirt before kick off as he had promised, unsettled the home defence. But Liverpool, for all their profligacy, were thoroughly deserving victors.</p> <p>Rodgers's team took control from the start. Reading offered nothing more than resistance initially and that was frequently stretched by the runs of Sterling and Suso, plus the imagination of Su\u00e1rez. \"We need to start games at three o'clock,\" said McDermott, still without a win since Reading's return to the Premier League. \"I said to the players at half-time that Liverpool had had the possession, but hadn't hurt us with their passing, only with a ball over the top. We needed to get on the front foot and we did that in the second half. I thought we were going to get a point.\"</p> <p>With Fabio Borini out for three months with a fractured foot and Andy Carroll resident at West Ham, where Rodgers appears inclined to leave him, even greater responsibility has fallen on Su\u00e1rez to provide the cutting edge that Liverpool often lack. But it needs to be shared throughout the side irrespective of problems in attack and, mercifully for Rodgers, Sterling was inclined to agree.</p> <p>The teenager and Glen Johnson were a constant threat down the left and, with better delivery and luck, Sterling could have scored or engineered the breakthrough long before it came. The Liverpool winger had one effort blocked by Shaun Cummings \u2013 and the better-placed Su\u00e1rez made his displeasure known \u2013 then hesitated too long over one break down the left and delivered another into the in-rushing Sahin, who blazed over.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez went close with an audacious chip and as the home crowd began to fear another trying afternoon, the Uruguay international unlocked the Reading rearguard with a first-time flick on of Andre Wisdom's long ball. The pass enabled Sterling to beat Cummings for pace and, taking the shot early, he finished expertly, across keeper Alex McCarthy and into the far bottom corner.</p> <p>Rodgers said: \"I am very pleased for him. That is a part of his game we have been working on in training and it was a wonderful finish. He is a terrific talent, with a good head on young shoulders.\"</p> <p>The reception for Sterling's goal was matched only by the crowd's amusing reaction to a free-kick awarded in favour of Su\u00e1rez. Initially there were ironic cheers as the referee, Roger East, punished Kaspars Gorkss's challenge, but they developed loudly, complete with standing ovation, for a rare call in Su\u00e1rez's favour. And it wasn't even a foul.</p> <p>Reading did not have an attempt on goal until the 41st minute, a woeful shot over by Mikele Leigertwood. Brad Jones was given a comfortable first Premier League start in Liverpool's goal in the absence of Jos\u00e9 Reina. The second half, however, provided a sterner test of the Australia international and substitute Gareth McCleary should have equalised, but shot straight at Jones's legs. Jobi McAnuff and Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9 also caused Liverpool problems, but Reading might have been caught out on the counter-attack. They were spared as Shelvey miscued horribly in front of goal and Su\u00e1rez wasted two good chances. \"He is not perfect,\" said Rodgers.</p>",
  "<p>The crisis in Lebanon following the assassination of Beirut's top police official appeared to be deepening as the prime minister, Najib Mikati, announced his cabinet would resign as soon as a caretaker national unity government could be formed.</p> <p>General Wissam al-Hassan was one of 10 people killed and more than 100 wounded on Friday after a car bomb exploded in a cramped middle-class Christian neighbourhood in central Beirut. The explosion rocked the Sassine Square area just after 3pm, leaving windows shattered and broken glass littering the streets.</p> <p>The killing of Hassan has followed months of rising tension as Lebanon has been drawn ever deeper into the conflict in neighbouring Syria \u2013 whose government has been blamed for the murder.</p> <p>Hassan was a key investigator for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), the international investigation into the 2005 assassination of former prime minister, Rafiq Hariri, and several other bombings that the Lebanese street has blamed on the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Tensions between the pro-Syrian government and an opposition that is openly backing the rebels in Syria's 18-month civil war have steadily risen over the past year and the death of Hassan, a Sunni, left supporters around the country calling for a national strike and retaliatory violence against the Shia militant group Hezbollah and its allies in the government. Hezbollah denied that it was behind the blast.</p> <p>Gangs of angry protesters took to the streets on Friday night, blocking roads, burning tyres and calling on the government to resign. As protesters demanded justice and revenge, Hezbollah and its allies began deploying their gunmen to the streets to protect Shia neighbourhoods from revenge attacks by infuriated Sunnis.</p> <p>Immediately after Hassan's assassination, the ruling coalition, led by Hezbollah, announced that it would block any attempt to transfer jurisdiction over the investigation into the car bombing to the STL, a move that prompted Mikati to announce that his cabinet would resign as soon as a caretaker national unity government could be formed. The dramatic announcement came after a security council meeting with President Michel Suleiman to determine the proper course forward the day after the worst bombing to strike Lebanon in the past five years.</p> <p>The Lebanese government had previously thrown its support behind the STL, but after it became clear that prosecutors planned to indict members of Hezbollah in the Hariri assassination, the group's allies in the cabinet took steps to limit co-operation with the tribunal. After the cabinet refused to discuss transferring the investigation into Hassan's murder to the STL, the prime minister made his announcement that he would resign as soon as a caretaker government could be formed.</p> <p>\"The request for a timeframe stems from a realisation that Lebanon is facing a plan to create strife,\" the prime minister said. \"This is a national issue and we are keen on preserving the nation. We do not want to leave Lebanon in a vacuum,\" he said after meeting the president.</p> <p>Hezbollah has described the STL as an Israeli project to sow discord between Lebanese factions already bitterly divided over support for the rebels battling for control of Syria. Hassan was considered one of the key backers of the tribunal and sources say he had recently turned over a considerable amount of evidence in the form of telecoms records to prosecutors, in a move widely criticised by Hezbollah and its allies.</p> <p>In announcing his eventual resignation, the prime minister also stated that he did not believe that Hassan had been acting in an irresponsible or politically biased manner. \"I have never felt that Hassan was aligned with any political camp,\" said the premier. \"I stress that the investigations must take their course until the truth is revealed.\"</p> <p>Hassan had recently uncovered an alleged plot by Syria's Lebanese allies to spread discord and instability throughout Lebanon with a wave of bombings and assassinations. Arrested in that plot was former minister Michel Samaha, who prosecutors allege had smuggled explosives into Lebanon from Syria to support the bombing campaign.</p> <p>The prime minister said it was obvious that Hassan's murder was tied to that case, as well as to other investigations into a series of political assassinations from 2005 to 2008.</p> <p>The killing comes as Lebanon is struggling over how to respond to the civil war and humanitarian crisis in Syria. Syrian rebels have taken to using Lebanon as a safe haven and as a jumping-off point for military operations against Syrian troops posted along the border. A close ally of the Syrian regime, Hezbollah is often said to be conducting military operations inside Syria to help dampen the rebellion, in which more than 30,000 people have been killed since it began in the spring of 2011.</p> <p>The assassination of Hassan prompted Lebanon's political opposition to place the blame for the killing squarely on Assad, who has had a poor relationship with Lebanon's Sunnis since Syria was accused of being behind the murder of the former prime minister.</p> <p>Following the car bomb and ensuing violent protests that erupted around the country, the streets of the capital were almost deserted as people stayed indoors in case of violence or further assassinations. In one incident, Lebanese army troops opened fire on a car that ran a roadblock in the Beqa'a Valley, wounding two people.</p> <p>Throughout Lebanon, security forces took steps to protect government buildings and maintain order. But in Sunni areas, security forces were scarce and a number of cars cruised the streets ordering Sunnis to call for the government's removal. Several Sunni militiamen could be seen carrying weapons on Friday night in a clear violation of Lebanese law.</p> <p>Lebanon appears to be destabilising as more than 100,000 Syrians fleeing violence in their country have taken refuge within the country.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.30am: It's the day of the leader's speech. I'm in the press room in the concert hall in Perth where Alex Salmond's, Scotland's first minister, will be addressing the SNP this afternoon.

Many delegates yesterday voiced their worries over this point. Nato membership would make it harder for an independent Scotland to rid itself of nuclear weapons, warned MSP Jamie Hepburn.</p> <p>German newspaper reports last month suggested that Nato had forced Germany to drop its aspiration to bring about the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from its soil. Would any negotiation on the point even be possible? The assumption that it would, some opponents believe, is simply \"policy by assertion\".

Today was their last hurrah, they will hang about for some time to come and we will hear the sporadic death rattle but nothing more.</p> <p>Many old timers in the hall and sprinkled around the country will have had tears in their eyes as they stood looking at the triumphant platform and they could not miss surely that the platform was smirking at them. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.44am: <strong>Fiona Hyslop</strong>, the Scottish culture secretary, is addressing the conference now. The party have released some extracts from her speech.

In its democratic intellect it does not just define us, it is constantly challenging and shaping and reshaping our perspective and ideas.</p> <p>Our artists need freedom, respect and support to do so unconditionally because it is in that atmosphere we will see our culture flourish still further.</p> <p>Conference in Scotland, we are seeing world class art, writing and performance being produced. Time and time again I am told from abroad we really value culture for what it is.</p> <p>I have worked hard to protect our cultural institutions and front line grants despite cuts that are too deep and too quick from Westminster. Where the Arts Council in England has seen cuts of 30% Scotland we have sought to protect culture.</p> <p>We believe in public subsidy of art and artists because we believe that self-expression of the nation needs self-expression of its peoples.

Because of a recognition of the importance of continuity and of mutual co-operation between nations and, in particular the nations of northern Europe NATO has been given a chance, a chance to prove itself as an organisation that can work in the interests of Scotland and of all its members.</p> <p>Be under no illusion that today was a significant day in the life of this party. As Kenny MacAskill put it we have moved from being a party of protest to a party of Government and today's debate exemplified that. Whatever the result had been the real winner today was party democracy and I believe that can be a real example to other political parties, both in Scotland and elsewhere and a sign to the people of Scotland of the kind of government that they should expect post-Independence.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.22am: The conference has just passed a motion on the NHS saying the SNP \"rejects all attempts to privatise any services provided by the NHS and congratulates the Scottish government on its commitment to keeping the Scottish NHS in the public sector, in contrast to the NHS in England.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.33am: <strong>Alyn Smith</strong> MEP has just opened a debate on the \"alternative economic model for Scotland that development trusts provide\".

An independent Scotland would have not truer friend than Wales, she said.</p> <p>She also pointed out that in Plaid the president, chair, chief executive and leader are all women. I don't think she was trying to have a go at the SNP, but yesterday there were complaints about how few women were speaking in the Nato debate. \"The membership of the SNP is overwhelmingly male\", James Mitchell, Lynn Bennie and Rob Johns concluded <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scottish-National-Party-Transition-Power/dp/0199580006\">in their study of the SNP published earlier this year.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.41pm: The cross-party campaign for a yes vote in the independence referendum is called Yes Scotland and it is being run by <strong>Blair Jenkins</strong>, a former head of news at STV and BBC Scotland who is not a member of the SNP, or any other party. He has just addressed the conference. It was an interesting speech, which included a very powerful argument for independence, although one that also undermined his separate argument about the yes campaign being beyond party politics. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jenkins said independence campaigners should invite people to consider whether they would vote for union with England if Scotland were already independent.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think if you stand back and look at it, a campaign being run now to persuade Scotland to join the union in my view would be an impossible campaign to run. Just imagine some of the leading propositions, the case that would be put to the Scottish people: your main parliament will move hundreds of miles away, and your MPs will be in a tiny minority; you will get a government you didn't vote for; all your oil and gas revenues will be handed over to the London Treasury. The biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in Western Europe will be build on the River Clyde, 30 miles from your largest city. You will be joining a country where the health and education services are rapidly being privatised.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that Yes Scotland represented \"a new kind of politics\" because it was non-partisan and non-ideological.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as Yes Scotland is concerned, all we ask of anyone is that you support the core principle, the core democratic principle, that the best people to make decisions about the future of Scotland and what is right for Scotland are the who of Scotland themselves \u2026 That is the only price of admission if you like \u2026 This is a cause that transcends political parties and, indeed, is a new kind of politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theoretically, then, Yes Scotland is open not just to the SNP, but to people who want an independent Scotland to be an nuclear-armed, low-tax, minimum-regulation state - ie, like Texas, with mountains. But Jenkins undermined this point with his argument about imagining people being asked to vote for union with England (see above) and his claim that independence would allow Scotland to become more equal (see below).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said independence would allow Scotland to create a more equal society.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>We know that under successive Labour and Conservatives government, the UK has become one of the most unfair and unequal societies in the western world. That didn't happen as an act of God, it was an act of policy \u2026</p> <p>I believe 2014 will be the year of yes and we will get the majority we are looking for. We are coming to a clear fork in the road, a choice of direction. Let's not be part of an increasingly unequal society, let's continue on the journey we have started.</p> <p>The vision of an independent Scotland that many of us have is of a country where all of us look out for one another, and where our sense of duty and responsibility to other people don't begin and end at our own front door.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that Scotland had a \"strong collective ethos\" and that \"we do look out for one another and we do value one another\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Yes Scotland was attracting support from people from most parties. </strong>The Green would play \"a substantial role\" in the campaign, he said. The new group, Labour for Independence, was \"a growing and significant group\" within the party. And some notable figures in the Liberal Democrat party, like Dame Judy Steel, were now in favour of independence.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said all parties in Scotland should set out their vision for the future of the country, whether or not they supported independence.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the no campaign had a \"profoundly pessimistic\" view of Scotland's future.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying rationale - the no narrative if you like - seems to be that the rest of the world, other countries in the world, and international institutions would adopt immediately an irrational and hostile view to an independent Scotland \u2026 I do not believe such a view has any rational or substantial basis at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said the no campaign would have difficulty attracting the support of 16 and 17-year-olds because they were opposed to under-18s getting the vote.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>You can imagine who the conversation would go: \"Hello, we're the no campaign. Remember us, we are the people who tried to stop you having a say in the future of your country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Yes Scotland's advisory board would ensure that the campaign represented all elements of Scottish life.</strong> The board is chaired by Dennis Canavan, the former Labour MP.<br><strong><br>\u2022 He said it was too early in the campaign to worry about the opinion polls.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that if every person in Scotland in favour of independence persuaded just one new person to vote yes, Yes Scotland would win.</strong></p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.45pm: It's not all good tempered at the SNP conference. My colleague Severin Carrell has sent me this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scottish ministers confronted an angry and at times abusive crowd of anti-wind farm campaigners outside Scottish National party conference in Perth, with little love lost by either side.</p> <p>The crowd of perhaps 150 to 200 anti-wind farm activists \u2013 many dressed in tweeds, Barbour-style coats and Wellington boots - booed and hissed the Scottish health secretary Alex Neil as he walked past, with some in the crowd throwing v-signs and shouting \"no more turbines\".</p> <p>Stewart Stephenson, the former Scottish environment minister, and a champion of renewable technology, was booed too as he walked alongside the demonstration. He responded by pursing his lips and blowing \u2013 in imitation of the wind.</p> <p>With a mocked-up coffin and protestors dressed as undertakers, one banner hung over the barrier featured Alex Salmond raising two fingers in a victory salute, with the slogan: \"Two fingers to Aberdeenshire's landscape from the great windbag\".</p> <p>Salmond's proposals for a significant expansion of onshore windfarms \u2013 he wants the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's domestic electricity needs to be met from renewable sources \u2013 have met intense, vociferous criticism in the Scottish shires, and from some land conservation groups. One placard said: \"Highland landscapes are unique: don't sacrifice them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/259620517714202625\">a picture from Twitter.</a></p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>1.20pm: Here's a lunchtime summary.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Blair Jenkins, the head of the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign, has told SNP delegates to ignore the polls and to have faith that they can win the independence referendum.</strong> \"It is far too early in the campaign to be looking at opinion polls,\" he said, in the wake of evidence showing that support for independence has fallen this year. \"I believe we have the evidence. I believe we have the arguments. I believe we have the vision and the momentum.\" Jenkins also said that, if you framed the argument in terms of a question about whether an independent Scotland would vote now for a union with England (ie, if you turned the question inside out), it was impossible to imagine Scots voting for the union.

He achieved the remarkable feat of being heckled and boo-ed during his contribution, something I've never heard before at an SNP conference. Why? Because the gist of what he had to say was that important decisions on weighty matters like defence needed to be taken by \"professionals\" like him and that effectively, we delegates were too wee and too stoopit to know what we were doing. He also managed to give the meeja their quote of the day: apparently, the policy we had on defence, which had served us very well as a party since 2002 was \"hopelessly naive and idealistic and showed that Scotland wasn't ready for the big league\" .

There is a steel about Roberto Di Matteo's side that was not always evident during his predecessor's reign and it meant an ordeal for the well-dressed man shaking his head and rubbing his hands through his hair in the home dugout. \"Andr\u00e9, Andr\u00e9, what's the score?\" the Chelsea fans sang, and the man in question looked at his shoes and pretended not to hear.</p> <p>His team had led 2-1 but there was only a 10-minute spell at the start of the second half when Tottenham Hotspur could be said to be the better team, scoring twice and threatening to condemn the Premier League leaders to their first defeat of a season.</p> <p>That apart, Chelsea played with confidence and the kind of durability that should serve them well in the title race. Juan Mata was prominently involved, scoring the two goals that turned a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead, then setting up the substitute Daniel Sturridge to complete the comeback in stoppage time.</p> <p>In defence, it is unlikely they would have been so vulnerable had John Terry not been starting his four-match ban. Yet their elusive, nimble attacking players provided a formidable test for Tottenham that, for the most part, the home team found beyond them. \"Creativity and individual brilliance,\" Villas-Boas said of his former team. \"Oscar, Mata, Eden Hazard \u2026 brilliant.\" Mata was one of the players he had brought to Stamford Bridge. As Di Matteo said: \"I've thanked him for that.\"</p> <p>The away side had been so comfortable after taking the lead through Gary Cahill's 18th-minute volley it was a jolt, to say the least, when William Gallas's glancing header two minutes after the break, possibly helped by his fingertips, was quickly followed by Jermain Defoe pouncing on Aaron Lennon's misdirected shot to score the 200th goal of his career.</p> <p>At that point Tottenham, unbeaten in a London derby at home since 2007, might have dared imagine a sixth successive win, but they would have been kidding themselves to think they deserved the lead. Chelsea never panicked or started to feel sorry for themselves. Instead they just set about re-establishing their superiority, producing some thrilling football in the process and taking advantage of the fact that their opponents were missing some of their more accomplished players.</p> <p>Villas-Boas could certainly cite mitigating circumstances given that Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, so impressive since arriving from Fulham, had joined Scott Parker on the injury list. Perhaps that would not mattered so much but for Gareth Bale having to speed away from White Hart Lane before kick-off because his partner had gone into labour. Deprived of Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Bale, it was not altogether surprising the home side came up so short at times.</p> <p>The second comeback of the match began in the 66th minute, Mata firing in a low, left-foot drive after Gallas's poor clearance from Oscar's cross. The Spaniard's second came three minutes later, turning Eden Hazard's pass beyond Brad Friedel at the end of a slick exchange that epitomised the difference between the two sides. By the time Mata dispossessed Kyle Walker and slipped in Sturridge to ensure a miserable day for Friedel on his return to the team, the visiting team might easily have lost count of the number of chances they had accumulated.</p> <p>The only downside from a Chelsea perspective was the carelessness at the start of the second half. The defending was particularly generous as Jan Vertonghen hooked Tom Huddlestone's free-kick across the six-yard box for Gallas to score. Villas-Boas could also reflect on several presentable opportunities to salvage something when the game was 3-2. For the most part, however, Cahill demonstrated why the absence of Terry need not be too significant.</p> <p>Gallas, in stark contrast, had a difficult afternoon, at fault to varying degrees for the first three Chelsea goals. Villas-Boas tried to protect his player \u2013 \"I don't agree,\" he said. \"I wouldn't blame anyone individually\" \u2013 but there were some straightforward errors. The Frenchman has been a great defender but in the worst moments here he looked like a champion boxer after one fight too many. Cahill's goal was another reminder of his uncommon ability to strike the ball on the volley \u2013 Di Matteo talked about the central defender routinely joining the club's front players in extra shooting practice \u2013 but it originated from Gallas's weak header out from Hazard's corner. Gallas had to wave an apologetic hand after Mata's first effort and, together with Walker, did not react quickly enough during the build-up to the third Chelsea goal. As for the fourth, Walker will wince when he sees the replays of how he lost the ball to Mata on the touchline. Mata squared and Sturridge tapped into an exposed net.</p> <p>It had been a stodgy Tottenham performance. Huddlestone's passing has regressed badly and his partnership with Sandro lacked mobility, inferior by some distance to Chelsea's two holding midfielders, Ramires and Mikel John Obi. Perhaps more worryingly for Villas-Boas, Clint Dempsey and Gylfi Sigurdsson are taking their time adapting. Early days, but Chelsea look like title contenders, just as Villas-Boas had planned but with a different manager in place.</p>",

  "<p>The future of Scotland Yard's pioneering anti-trafficking unit is uncertain less than a year after David Cameron promised to make Britain a \"world leader\" in the fight against people smuggling.</p> <p>Senior police sources have voiced fears that the Metropolitan police's flagship trafficking unit, the human exploitation and organised crime command (SCD9), may be forced to lose specialist officers due to budget constraints. Government figures last week showed the number being trafficked into the UK was rising. But immigration minister Mark Harper warned that the number of those being prosecuted was still \"not enough\".</p> <p>Campaigners say any attempt to downsize the specialist unit for tackling trafficking would undermine the Met's fight to stop organised trafficking syndicates operating in the UK.</p> <p>A Met source said: \"The reality is that no one knows what is going to be happening to the unit as from next April. The sort of refined modelling around the cuts, which we know are coming, has left staff numbers up in the air.\" Although the positions of up to three anti-trafficking officers are guaranteed for the next two years, following the granting of EU funding last month, financial shortfalls meant two jobs from the unit were lost last month with the rest of the officers in the trafficking unit undecided.</p> <p>Christine Beddoe, director of the anti-trafficking charity ECPAT UK, said: \"The trafficking team in the Met needs to be beefed up, it is clear we need more specialist officers tackling the crime.\"</p> <p>Cameron has said that trafficking is a coalition priority and several days ago the Home Office said \"more work than ever before is being carried out both in the UK and internationally to prosecute criminals and stop trafficking gangs in their tracks\". Yet in 2011 there were only eight convictions for human trafficking in the UK.</p> <p>Last year, SCD9 rescued 85 potential victims of trafficking during visits to scores of brothels. In addition, 60 women were referred to the unit from voluntary organisations, of whom 39 were confirmed as being trafficked. SCD9 was though given \u00a3600,000 to tackle the expected increase in trafficking during the London Olympics, but research is expected to say that few sex workers travelled to the capital because of the 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Anthony Steen, chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation, said that intensive policing levels were required to tackle the crime: \"Traffickers run far ahead of law enforcement agencies, using modern technology and sophisticated</p> <p>recruitment networks to avoid detection,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article was amended on 20 October 2012. The future of the unit is uncertain but decisions on its overall fate have yet to be made. This has been clarified in relevant places throughout the story and in the standfirst.</em></p>",

  "<p>With the economy continuing to flatline and the government struggling to control a growing national deficit, these are tough times for schools.</p> <p>Any hope that austerity measures introduced after the last election might soon be replaced by rising budgets in time for a return to the polls in 2015 now seems wildly optimistic.</p> <p>Most state schools in England have already had to make cuts following a three-year freeze in core budgets imposed in April 2011. Schools in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have also had to tighten their belts.</p> <p>Despite the introduction of the new pupil premium, due to rise to \u00a3900 per eligible child in April 2013, only schools in the most deprived areas of England will see real terms growth in budgets by the time the current funding settlement ends in March 2014. <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn121.pdf\">According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> (IFS), around two-thirds of primary schools and 80% of secondary schools will have experienced real-terms budget cuts over the three-year period. About half of primary and over 60% of secondary schools are likely to see real-terms decreases of 5% or more.</p> <p>Only schools with the highest proportion of disadvantaged pupils will be net gainers as a result of the pupil premium. The IFS calculates that just 3% of secondary and 10% of primary schools will see real-terms increases of 5% or more by 2014.</p> <p>This is a gloomy enough out-look but the long-term forecast is scarcely any better according to Tony Travers, director of LSE London, a research centre at the London School of Economics. \"Schools will be getting a zero real-terms increase in budgets for several years to come or, at the very best, an increase of 1% above inflation after 2014. It is way less than occurred during the period 2000 to 2010,\" he says.</p> <p>To make matters worse, schools will also have to fund a rise in staff salaries in September 2013 once the current two-year pay freeze ends. With little prospect of the government providing extra cash to fund the award schools will have to take some difficult decisions says Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association for School and College Leaders.<br>\"Admittedly the wage rise is a negligible 1% for each of the next two years but it will have an impact because 80% of a school's budget is spent on staffing costs. So it amounts to a 0.8% budget cut in real terms. Incrementally over two years it will be a cut of 1.6%.\"</p> <p>Such a cut could well mean job cuts in many schools next year. If that is not bad enough the government will start to introduce a new national funding formula next April that will be phased in over the next four years. The effect will be to create 'winners and losers' as budgets are recalculated using the new funding calculation. And with little prospect of above-inflation increases to smooth the transition it seems likely that many schools will lose out.</p> <p>\"You can never get away from the reality that at a time when there is no extra money any new formula leading to any new distribution of resources means there will be losers and gainers. It is an iron rule of politics that gainers bag the gains and the losers react,\" says Tony Travers.<br>In a bid to keep the losers happy the government has promised basic funding-per-pupil allocations will not be cut by more than 1.5% next year but affected schools could still face deeper cuts as a result of losing top-up funding for factors such as special needs or pupil mobility.</p> <p>This combination of low or zero budget increases and the new funding system raises a number of issues for school planners. Here are five to consider:</p> <h2><strong>Primary schools</strong></h2> <p>At present about 60% of primary schools in England receive higher age-weighted pupil unit (AWPU) funding for pupils in key stage 2 than in key stage 1. The other 40% receive either the same or higher funding for pupils in key stage 1. Under the new formula, all primary schools will receive the same AWPU irrespective of their pupils' age. The biggest impact will be in authorities where there are large numbers of separate infant and junior schools where there could be a significant shift in resources between schools, according to Kathryn James, the National Association of Head Teachers' director of policy.</p> <h2><strong>Special needs</strong></h2> <p>Special schools with surplus places face funding cuts as a result of a change in the way provision for 'high needs' pupils will be funded from April 2013. Special schools will receive \u00a310,000 per available place plus a top-up to cover the cost of every child enrolled, but will no longer receive funding to cover the full cost of any unfilled places.</p> <p>The change could mean some special schools losing a significant amount of funding because of sudden fluctuations in demand for places, raising the possibility of staff lay-offs, says the NAHT.</p> <p>Under the new system mainstream schools will have to fund special needs pupils from their own budgets unless the cost exceeds \u00a310,000. This could put some smaller schools under financial pressure, according to the IFS.</p> <h2><strong>Rural schools</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest threats of the new funding formula is to small schools in rural areas. These have higher fixed costs which make them vulnerable to pupil-led funding because of the small number of children on their registers.</p> <p>The government has tried to overcome this by allowing local authorities to distribute some of the budget as a lump sum, up to a limit of \u00a3200,000. But because local authorities have to pay all of their schools the same lump sum some claim the new funding formula is not flexible or generous enough to protect small schools. Cumbria County Council has warned up to 32 of its schools could face closure as a result of the new system.</p> <h2><strong>Disadvantaged pupils</strong></h2> <p>School budgets are currently weighted to allow extra funding for children from deprived backgrounds. This accounts for a substantial proportion of funding for schools in disadvantaged areas. Over time, however, this funding is likely to be replaced by the pupil premium and some schools could lose out as a result.</p> <p>The effect of the new formula and pupil premium could also see some redistribution of funds from secondary to primary schools. The IFS figures above show that the pupil premium has so far benefited a higher proportion of primary than secondary schools.</p> <h2><strong>Sixth forms</strong></h2> <p>Schools with sixth forms will no longer be able to subsidise post-16 studies from their general budgets. The change, which will put school sixth forms on a level footing with further education and sixth form colleges, is being phased in over several years to allow schools affected to adjust. Schools with sixth forms of fewer than 100 pupils will be particularly vulnerable and even schools with large sixth forms may have to consider axing less popular courses.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>New Hampshire is a <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/33000.html\">small state</a>, home to only 1.3 million of the nation's population of 311 million. It's 92.2% white non-Hispanic, compared with 63.4% for the nation as a whole. There is only one major network television affiliate in the state, WMUR. For want of a better phrase, it's almost nothing like the rest of America. And yet the \"live free or die\" state is turning into one of the must-watches on election day. </p> <p>Mitt Romney was behind in almost <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">every presidential poll</a> that was taken between the New Hampshire primary and mid-September. New Hampshire seemed to be falling back into a Democratic trend in presidential years that had developed over the past few cycles. It was the only state that flipped from the Republican column in 2000 to the Democratic one in 2004. Obama won the state by 9.6 points in 2008, greater than his national 7.3 point victory. But the Granite State had a trick up its sleeve.</p> <p>Romney has led in two polls conducted after the first presidential debate, tied President Obama in another and trailed in a fourth. Overall Romney has held a very slim average one-point edge in polls taken after the first debate with President Obama. </p> <p>Romney's new-found advantage is in some ways not surprising. Republicans romped in the 2010 midterm elections, winning both <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/01/AR2010110105177.html\">House seats</a> a Senate seat and control of both houses of <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2010/11/05/measuring-the-size-of-election-2010s-republican-sweep\">the state legislature</a>. Romney was also the governor in next door Massachusetts and he has a summer home in New Hampshire. He cruised to an easy 16-point win in the New Hampshire primary and he had been ahead in most polls against Obama before the primary. </p> <p>The sudden Romney rise confirms yet again that this is a state that likes to mess with everyone. It was this electorate that handed pollsters their <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/01/the-new-hampshi/\">greatest embarrassment</a> in arguably 60 years when Hillary Clinton defeated Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, despite all the polls saying otherwise. It's a state where the plurality (45%) of voters <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#NHP00p1\">self-identify</a> as independent, and Republicans and Democrat split fairly equally the other 55%. </p> <p>You might say, \"Who cares?\" New Hampshire only has four electoral votes. Yet these votes look like they could be quite consequential. A few days ago I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">mapped out a scenario</a> in which New Hampshire becomes a most important state. </p> <p>Let's say Romney takes Wisconsin along with Colorado, Florida and Virginia, while Obama captures Iowa, Nevada and Ohio. Then New Hampshire decides who will be president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398106749\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350680333288/New-Hampshire-map1-001.jpg\" alt=\"New Hampshire map1\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Hampshire map1 Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One other very possible map puts New Hampshire in the limelight as well. This time we'll give Romney Ohio along with Florida and Virginia, while Obama holds Colorado, Iowa, Nevada and Wisconsin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398106750\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350680392548/NH-map2-001.jpg\" alt=\"NH map2\" width=\"460\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">NH map2 Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both of these scenarios requires Romney to win states in which he is seemingly behind, such as Ohio or Wisconsin, which is why Obama remains an electoral-college favorite. Romney's apparent small lead in New Hampshire does help him, though. </p> <p>But New Hampshire's fun doesn't stop at the presidential race. New Hampshire and Vermont are the two remaining states that hold gubernatorial elections every two years. Democratic incumbent governor John Lynch is retiring. Democrat Maggie Hassan and Republican Ovide Lamontagne are facing off in what looks to be one of the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/governor/nh/new_hampshire_governor_lamontagne_vs_hassan-2804.html\">tightest gubernatorial races</a> in the nation. </p> <p>The same polls that have Romney with an average one-point lead give Lamontagne a 0.8-point edge. Rasmussen has Obama and Lamontagne winning, while Public Policy Polling has Romney and Hassan ahead. It's really that tight. </p> <p>My guess is that the same party is going to win both the gubernatorial and presidential race in New Hampshire. The last time there was both a close <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=33&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=0\">gubernatorial</a> and <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2004&amp;fips=33&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">presidential</a> race in the Granite State was 2004. In that year, George Bush and Republican gubernatorial nominee Craig Benson both got 48.87% of the vote, while the vote difference between John Kerry and Democrat John Lynch was 211 out of nearly 700,000 votes cast. </p> <p>New Hampshire's electoral fun doesn't stop in the statewide races, though. Both House of Representative races are rematches of 2010 and are too close to call. </p> <p>New Hampshire 1, the more conservative of the two districts, features incumbent Republican Frank Guinta and former representative Carol Shea-Porter. The Rothenberg Political Report <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house\">rates the race</a> as \"toss-up/tilt Republican\". Guinta has faced <a href=\"http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/frank-guinta\">allegations of corruption</a>, while Shea-Porter is probably <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/ratings/house\">too liberal</a> for the district. </p> <p>New Hampshire 2, located in the more rural western part of the state, has incumbent Republican Charlie Bass against Democrat Annie Kuster. The Rothenberg Political Report has the race as \"toss-up/title Democratic\". The moderate Bass will find it tough to survive in a district that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index\">leans Democratic</a>, although Kuster's <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/blogentry/357471/kuster-takes-trackers-camera-says-shell-call-her-opponent?SESS051895268be42074681f2d2bc31d9ece=google\">campaign-trail conduct</a> has probably taken up more press than she would like. </p> <p>Any combination of House winners seem possible. Democrats could win both seats, Republicans could win both seats, Guinta could win but see Bass lose, or Shea-Porter could win with Kuster losing. </p> <p>All told, New Hampshire is a tricky state and nothing really surprises me. When you combine the presidential, gubernatorial and congressional races, I'm not sure there is more exciting state for elections this year. And I didn't even mention that no one really knows who wins either house of the state legislature, either.</p>",
  "<p>When American magazine journalist Yael Kohen went looking for a book on the history of female comedians, she was stunned to discover that almost nothing had been written on the subject.</p> <p>\"There were some academic works and I found one book that was not in print any more. [Female comics] had been overlooked. Their contributions were still overshadowed,\" Kohen said.</p> <p>So Kohen, a contributing editor for <em>Marie Claire</em>, put together a remarkable history of women in comedy, telling their story from the brave pioneers of the 1950s, such as ground-breaking standup Phyllis Diller, to modern, A-list Hollywood power-players like Kristen Wiig.</p> <p>The book, <em>We Killed: The Rise of Women in Comedy</em>, features scores of first-person interviews, clips from contemporary reviews and excerpts from stories on a huge roster of female comics, their male contemporaries and the people that they inspired or knew them. It paints a picture of a long battle fought by women to break into the comic arena. After all, it was only in 2007 that Christopher Hitchens notoriously used the pages of <em>Vanity Fair</em> to write an essay headlined \"Why Women Aren't Funny\". That sort of attitude infuriates women working in comedy today.</p> <p>\"No women ever said that women were not funny, because all women do is get together and laugh. I can't believe this conversation still exists, yet it does,\" said Judy Carter, a standup comic and motivational speaker.</p> <p>It is a sentiment echoed by another American standup, Gaby Dunn. \"It is just tiresome. It is like a misdirection. For every moment that we are talking about female comedians as women and whether they are funny or about their clothes and looks, then we are not focusing on their actual comedy,\" she said.</p> <p>Yet as <em>We Killed</em> shows, fighting that prejudice has been there from the beginning. The book begins by looking at Diller, whose appearance on the standup scene in the late 1950s in New York comedy clubs was nothing short of revolutionary.</p> <p>\"Here was a woman complaining about a husband rather than a husband complaining about the woman or the mother-in-law. I think that was the big switch. We have a life too, and it's fun and it's funny and we can make fun of ourselves and you, but from our side of the fence and not from yours,\" says comedy writer Gene Perret in the book.</p> <p>But Diller's act still reflected the social mores of her day. Her trademark lines often lampooned her spouse or herself, setting her comedy firmly within the domestic sphere. She also disguised her sexual appeal so that people would not focus on her sex. \"I had to dress so that they couldn't see any figure because I wanted to make jokes,\" Kohen quotes Diller as saying.</p> <p>The book goes on to the tell the story of the female comics who emerged in the 1960s, such as Joan Rivers, who also made a name for herself with self-deprecation. Yet Rivers also put raunchy material in her act. \"I was talking about having an affair with a married professor, and that wasn't a thing a nice Jewish girl talked about \u2026 I was talking about my gay friend, Mr Phyllis, and you just didn't talk about that,\" she told Kohen.</p> <p>That helped to pave the way for more political and feminist comics to emerge, such as Lily Tomlin in the late 1960s. Then in the 1970s women comics burst onto television \u2013 not in the role of wives and mothers, but as independent women, such as in the <em>Mary Tyler Moore Show</em>. Not that it was easy. Kohen reveals how the actress and producer Marlo Thomas once gave a top ABC executive a copy of the classic 60s feminist tract by Betty Friedan, <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>. \"He read it and kind of became convinced,\" Thomas says in the book.</p> <p>By the 80s, comics such as Elayne Boosler were doing edgier material (\"The Vatican is against surrogate mothers. Good thing they didn't have that rule when Jesus was born.\") They were also starting to become more powerful \u2013 <em>Late Night with David Letterman</em> had a female lead writer. By the 90s, comedians such as Roseanne Barr and Ellen DeGeneres had mainstream hit shows led by feisty, powerful women.</p> <p>Alternative comics such as Janeane Garofalo and Margaret Cho were major standup names and Whoopi Goldberg had gone from standup to being a wildly popular movie star. Yet still it was not easy. Carter remembered taking part in a standup comedy act that was being videoed by Paramount. She was introduced by a man with the remark: \"Now here is something different. Our next comic has tits!\"</p> <p>Now, women comics have never seemed more powerful or more present. Wiig's film <em>Bridesmaids</em> was one of the most successful films of 2011. Comedians such as Amy Poehler, Sarah Silverman, Lena Dunham and Chelsea Handler have become major figures in the cultural landscape.</p> <p>However, they also represent a wide variety of styles: from the raunch of Handler to the self-conscious angst of Dunham to the cutting satire of Silverman. \"It is an evolution. What we see now are more and more women, and so we get a greater diversity of things that they are talking about,\" said Kohen.</p>",
  "<p>A wealthy Vietnamese woman sits at a roadside cafe and prepares a dish for her own consumption. She is grinding up rhino horn. After a few minutes, water is added and she drinks the mixture out of a shot glass as a cure for her kidney stones. The woman paid several thousand US dollars for the piece of horn. The rhino died.</p> <p>The image is one of a series taken by <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/photo.do?photo=2898&amp;category=58&amp;group=3\" title=\"\">South African photographer Brent Stirton, who won an award at the 2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition</a>, which opened at the Natural History Museum London on Friday. Entitled \"Deadly Medicine: Rhinos\", the six photographs in his award-winning portfolio depict the impact of poaching on the world, from game rangers in action to end users of rhino horn who believe it to be a medicine.</p> <p>Poaching has become a major part of organised global crime and so well organised that it threatens to wipe out some of the world's five remaining species of rhinos. Two of them, the Javan and the Sumatran, have been reduced to populations of only a few dozen each. Populations of the other three \u2013 black, white and one-horned rhinos \u2013 are also threatened.</p> <p>\"The illegal trade in wildlife is now the third largest criminal industry in the world and rhino poaching plays a key role,\" Stirton told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\"It is driven by the growing affluence in Asian countries, particularly Vietnam and China, where people have believed for centuries that rhino horn can cure many illnesses, including cancer. The belief is part of their culture and deep rooted, and therefore very difficult to dislodge.\"</p> <p>The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is now in its 48th year and has earned a reputation for its superb images that glorify nature. However, new categories have been introduced in recent years to allow photographers to feature more uncomfortable truths about humanity's impact on the planet. One winner last year captured the devastating effect of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on wildlife, for example. This year's exhibition includes a chilling account of the plight of rhinos. Driven by soaring prices for rhino horn, the number of animals slaughtered has soared.</p> <p>In 2007 only 13 rhinos were killed by poachers; last year that figure rose to 448 \u2013 more than in any previous year. This year a total of 455 have been slaughtered so far, it was revealed last week by the government of South Africa, where 90% of all rhinos live. Most of these animals \u2013 272 of the 455 \u2013 were killed in the country's Kruger National Park and were white rhinos, the least threatened species. It is believed there are around 20,000 left in the wild.</p> <p>Stirton visited parks across South Africa to take his images, which include one of a vet's assistant holding up the horn of a tranquillised white rhino from a game farm outside Klerksdorp. Its horns have been removed to save it from poachers. \"Cutting off a horn can be an effective way of making a rhino safe from hunters,\" said Richard Sabin, a wildlife expert at the Natural History Museum. \"The animal no longer has value. On the other hand, a horn has only to grow back a few centimetres before it becomes lucrative enough to make it worthwhile for a poacher to go back and kill a rhino. That is a reflection of the enormous prices that rhino horn can now command.\"</p> <p>However, it is the image of the Vietnamese woman drinking rhino horn liquor that provides the most striking image in Stirton's portfolio. Her enjoyment at her task contrasts vividly with the blood shed to obtain that piece of horn. Getting the picture took considerable ingenuity.</p> <p>\"I posed as a Canadian who was trying to set up his own illegal market in my home country,\" said Stirton. \"I persuaded the dealer, who is in the background, to let me see someone preparing it so that I would know what to do to set up my own market when I got back to Canada. She is grinding the horn in a dish specially made for the purpose. It has a rhino symbol on the side and has a rough base on which to grind the horn into powder. After a few minutes, water was added and she swallowed it. The woman told me she took it daily for her general health. The interesting thing is that rhino horn is an illegal substance in Vietnam. But both the woman and her dealer had no fear of the police and happily ground the rhino horn in full view of the street. The dealer told me he paid $1,500 a month to the right people so he could sell rhino horn with impunity.\"</p> <p>The rising slaughter of the world's endangered rhinos is particularly ironic given the makeup of their horns, added Sabin. \"Their horns are made of keratin. That is the stuff from which hair, fingernails and toenails are made. In other words, chewing your own fingernails would do you as much as good as taking powdered rhino horn, and at least that would avoid the slaughter of rhinos.\"</p> <p><em>The Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year is at the Natural History Museum until 3 March 2013, before embarking on a global tour. </em></p>",
  "<p>As Republican challenger Mitt Romney addressed a throng of supporters in the Virginian town of Leesburg last week, he started to rattle through a list of campaign promises. \"When I become president\" he began. Then he paused and regarded the crowd for a moment before repeating the first word with extra emphasis. \"<em>When</em> I become president, we are finally going to cut spending,\" he said, to shouts of approval.</p> <p>It would have fallen flat just a few weeks ago. The former Massachusetts governor's campaign was emerging from a disastrous summer. It was firmly behind in the polls, had been savaged by an efficient Democrat attack machine and been hit by the release of a secret videotape revealing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/obama-campaign-fresh-attack-romney\" title=\"\">Romney dismissing 47% of Americans </a>as dependent on government. Many observers, including some panicking Republicans, were writing him off as a rightwing version of Michael Dukakis, another former Massachusetts governor, who was soundly beaten by George Bush in 1988.</p> <p>But that was then. In Leesburg, Romney appeared relaxed and confident, cracking jokes and launching attacks against President Barack Obama's economic record. He turned on the charm, too. \"There is so much about this country I love,\" he gushed, before reciting a litany of inspiring anecdotes collected from his many months on the campaign trail. \"We are going to win Virginia, you know that? We are going to win,\" he said.</p> <p>He has grounds for optimism. After Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate \u2013 and Romney's solid, warm showing \u2013 the 2012 election has upended itself. For two weeks a flood of polls has detailed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\" title=\"\">a surge in Romney's support</a>. A Gallup tracking survey has him seven points in the lead nationally, beating Obama by 52% to 45%. In the key battlegrounds of Virginia and Florida, Romney is back in the game. He is closing the gap in Wisconsin, which many had seen as out of reach. Even in Pennsylvania, which no one had seen as up for grabs, one recent poll had him ahead. In North Carolina, which narrowly went for Obama in 2008, Romney's team is now so confident of victory that it has started moving out staff and redeploying them to Ohio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398115699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/21/1350780966864/US-key-election-battlegro-001.jpg\" alt=\"US key election battlegrounds\" width=\"460\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US key election battlegrounds. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Romney campaign, which all summer seemed on the defensive, is suddenly aggressively on the attack. It is hammering away at the issue of Obama's economic record, ignoring signs of a gradual recovery and instead repeatedly referring to high unemployment, millions of people on food stamps and growing poverty. It is a message that strikes a chord with many people still suffering from the impact of the recession.</p> <p>Certainly in the Leesburg crowd no one was talking about good times being ahead. \"He was a governor of a Democratic state and if he was able to get things done there, then he could get things done anywhere. He should be able to make things happen on a national scale,\" said Diane Senyitko, 52, whose construction business has been hit hard for more than five years of economic turmoil.</p> <p>\"Obama already had his chance. If he was going to bring about a recovery, it would have happened already,\" she said. Indeed, Senyitko is now campaigning for Romney, knocking on doors all over Leesburg and trying to win people over. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm that I did not see before. I don't even think it will be neck and neck at the end. It will be a big win,\" she said.</p> <p>That is probably unlikely. Obama is still \u2013 when all the polls are taken into consideration \u2013 likely to be narrowly ahead. But the race has certainly shifted and the prospect of a Romney win has gone from a poor joke to a perfectly realistic prospect. \"The chances that Romney will win have gotten a lot better,\" said Professor Kevin Leicht, a political expert at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Now stories of internal dissent within the Romney camp have been replaced with accounts of a \"happy warrior\" candidate, comfortable at the end of an almost six-year quest to get to the White House. Party bigwigs \u2013 once critical of his campaign \u2013 have lined up loyally behind him. So have evangelical leaders, who privately remain sceptical because he is a Mormon. Media critics have fallen silent. Even Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's old guru, has been speculating enthusiastically on Romney's chances of winning the White House back for a party that in 2008 was seen as headed for a lengthy period in the wilderness. Already some have begun to speculate on what that would mean for America and the rest of the world. \"He will run this country like the chief executive of a large corporation,\" said Steven Mitchell, a Republican pollster and founder of Mitchell Research.</p> <p>What you think of that prospect depends on your politics. Liberals would see such a thing as a return to the worst excesses from before the recession. Romney has pledged to deregulate Wall Street again and lower corporate taxes. He preaches the sort of \"trickle down\" economics of the 1980s that Ronald Reagan did, glorifying the wealthy and seeing tax breaks for them as having a broader economic benefit.</p> <p>He wants to scrap Obama's healthcare reforms and take an axe to every part of government, except the military. Liberals fear all this will make America even more unequal, risk another financial meltdown and hurt the lowest levels of society for whom federal help is vital.</p> <p>They also worry Romney will be beholden to the desires of the broader Republican party, especially in Congress, which, stuffed with Tea Party zealots and social conservatives, is far more rightwing than his presidential campaign. They worry the party will force Romney to extremes on everything from monetary policy to abortion, immigration and gay rights. \"They have already influenced Romney in unfavourable ways. The prospects of going back to a pre-2008 environment are very real,\" said Leicht, referring to the extreme stances Romney adopted in order to win his party's nomination.</p> <p>Republicans, obviously, see it differently. They see Romney as unshackling business, sparking broader economic growth and cutting out unnecessary spending that will reduce the deficit. They see Romney rescuing America from the fate of Greece and other heavily indebted European nations. \"There will be a sea change from the current administration. People will invest in things again,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>It might not be so easy, though. As Obama has found, America's system of government appears designed to end in deadlock. Republican intransigence stymied much of Obama's own domestic agenda. There is little reason to think Romney will fare any better if Democrats still control either part of Congress. Even with \"Obamacare\", Romney might not actually be able to fulfil his party's dreams by scrapping it altogether. \"You can't just repeal it and not replace it with anything,\" said Leicht. Indeed much of Obamacare was based on Romney's own health reforms in Massachusetts. Such \"flip flops\" have long marked his political career and that makes predicting a Romney first term especially difficult: it has never been clear what his core beliefs are. \"In the short term it is going to be hard for him to do very much at all. America's problems are actually too big for either candidate to solve easily,\" Leicht said.</p> <p>Of course there is still a long way to go. Though the Obama campaign has been rocked by the sudden upturn in Romney's fortunes, it remains on top of the race overall. Aside from Gallup, other polls have Obama narrowly ahead or statistically tied at a national level. More important are surveys coming out of the swing states which show Obama still ahead, especially in the midwestern heartland of Ohio.</p> <p>Among all the battlegrounds, it is Ohio that is most important. No Republican has ever won the White House without also winning Ohio and Obama is still solidly ahead there. Obama's operation in the state is huge and well-funded. Both Obama and the first lady have been regular visitors: his entire re-election campaign was launched in the state capital of Columbus. Bill Clinton has been touring the state. Even Bruce Springsteen has been deployed there. If Romney's advance can be stopped in Ohio, the main Democratic campaign argument runs, then it will be halted everywhere. But, essentially, the race for the Oval Office is now on a knife edge.</p> <p>Only a few milestones remain, chief of which is Monday night's third and final debate in Florida. Yet, with its topic of foreign policy, that is unlikely to prove too much of a game-changer given that the electorate's overriding concern is jobs and the economy. \"Honestly, put a gun to my head right now and ask me to pick a winner? I just don't know,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>But in Leesburg they think they do. Around 8,000 people gathered to hear Romney speak in a park, enjoying the last warm days of autumn. After so much time campaigning and wooing the different camps of his party, Romney appeared to have finally stitched it all together behind him.</p> <p>Take local IT specialist Matthew Russell, 49. He had begun supporting pizza magnate Herman Cain during the party's bitter nomination race, then favoured former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"Romney was my last choice,\" he confessed. But he was OK with things now, because Romney was offering the one thing that really does unite the party: he might beat Obama. \"If the election was held tomorrow, then I think it would be Obama to win, but if the momentum keeps up this way then I think Romney will eke it out in November,\" he said.</p> <p>If Romney does win, it will not have been pretty. The 2012 election has seen Obama launch one of the most negative campaigns in recent memory claiming Romney is a heartless plutocrat who wants to take America back to the post civil war era satirised by Mark Twain as the Gilded Age. In response, Romney has painted Obama as a dangerous pseudo-socialist taking America on the path to ruin. But if, come 6 November, it is Romney who emerges victorious then neither he nor anyone else in his party will care. In Leesburg, Romney ended his speech with a rousing call to arms. \"We are taking back America,\" he told the crowd. \"America is coming back, we are going to have a real recovery.\"</p> <p>Watching the speech was estate agent Kim Levy, 38. She has been ignoring the polls in favour of a less scientific study of support. The local 7-11 convenience stores have been running a promotion whereby cups of soda feature a picture of Romney or Obama. \"All the Romney cups are gone and all the Obama ones are still there, except maybe one. It's like that at all the 7-11s in Leesburg. All of them,\" she said with undisguised glee.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago, Seigo Kawaguchi, a high school gym teacher, stayed sitting at a school graduation ceremony when the Japanese national anthem was played. He was not the only one: most other teachers did too, as did more than 150 students and their parents. Most, to be honest, probably sat out of boredom. But some, including Kawaguchi, felt they couldn't ever stand for a song associated with Japan's military past.</p> <p>It was an innocuous event, but within two weeks the incident was reported in a rightwing newspaper and the school was bombarded with calls telling the teachers to \"go back to North Korea\". Kawaguchi was given a written warning, and as a result was inadvertently pushed to the forefront of one of Japan's longest-running and most bizarre legal rows.</p> <p>Since 2003, more than 500 teachers have been disciplined for refusing to stand and sing Kimigayo \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29FFHC2D12Q\" title=\"\">a solemn song</a> about Japan's emperor, which calls for his reign to last \"8,000 generations \u2026 until the pebbles grow into boulders lush with moss\". Standing for it at ceremonies is a requirement in both Tokyo and Osaka.</p> <p>Some teachers have just been given warnings; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/07/worlddispatch.japan\" title=\"\">others effectively sacked</a>. Appeals have <a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120117005934.htm\" title=\"\">reached the country's supreme court twice</a>, but new cases keep coming. On Thursday morning Kawaguchi went to a high court in Osaka to try and get his warning overturned, saying the requirement restricts his freedom of thought. He lost. He'll now take his challenge to the supreme court.</p> <p>The issue may seem minor, but the fact that teachers are being asked to stand and sing an anthem at all is a worrying sign of Japan's continued conservatism and desire to please nationalists. There are few other developed countries that have regulations requiring people to stand and sing, and none others that actually enforce the requirement like Japan does.</p> <p>In Russia, some schools require daily singing from pupils, others don't. Even the US \u2013 that most patriotic of countries \u2013 does not discipline people failing to stand for the anthem. Its \"flag code\" says people \"should\" stand when the anthem's played, hand on heart, facing the flag. But you are free to not bother \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/mitt-romneys-misfire-on-the-national-anthem/2012/02/05/gIQA5NLKsQ_blog.html\" title=\"\">unless of course you're running for office</a>.</p> <p>It seems a somewhat basic requirement of any country that respects free speech to not force an anthem on someone; to realise these are historical songs that can either be taken by individuals as a vital source of inspiration or a joke. Should France force anyone from an immigrant background to sing the Marseillaise with its chorus calling on soldiers to water the fields with \"impure blood\"? Should the UK government be forcing schoolchildren to sing God Save the Queen?</p> <p>Unfortunately, it does not seem as though Japan is going to come to that realisation anytime soon. If anything, things are only going to get worse, and largely due to the rise of Osaka's mayor Toru Hashimoto. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader\" title=\"\">young turk of Japanese politics</a>, who leads the Japan Restoration Association party, is expected to win a large number of seats at this year's elections, and he's one of the strongest advocates of forcing people to stand and sing. Last autumn, he supported a bill introduced in Osaka that would allow schools to sack teachers if they refused to stand three times. He's even endorsed headmasters watching teachers' lips to check if they're singing.</p> <p>Hashimoto's policies are ultimately aimed at restoring Japan to a world economic force. But culturally, how is stifling individualism and forcing people to sing a sad, one-minute-long tune going to achieve that? It's hardly the fresh break Japan needs. Hashimoto's office would not comment on Kawaguchi's case when contacted, but simply said the mayor endorses regulations \"designed to encourage respect for the traditions and culture of Japan\". I thought a tradition of Japanese people was they were highly respectful of others' views, but I guess I'm wrong.</p>",
  "<p>The Lincolnshire couple <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/18/couple-kenyan-village-cannabis-factory\" title=\"\">jailed this week for three years for growing and selling cannabis</a> used much of the profits to pay for medical treatment for people in a Kenyan village. They bought a computer for an eye hospital, paid for life-saving operations for people suffering from gangrene and helped pay the school fees for local children. The judge who sentenced them at Lincoln crown court told Michael Foster, 62, and Susan Cooper, 63, that: \"I am sure you were doing good things in Kenya with your drugs money, whether that was to appease your consciences, I can only speculate.\"</p> <p>We can also only speculate what the point might be of jailing them rather than recommending them for an EU farming subsidy, but the case serves as a reminder that not all law-breakers are necessarily just in it for themselves.</p> <p>In their brilliant comedy skit, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnLqLHWDg5E\" title=\"\">The 2,000-year-old Man</a>, Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner imagined a man of that age being interviewed about all the famous historical characters, from Jesus to Joan of Arc, whom he had met during his long life. (Do get the CD if you have never heard it.) When asked whether Robin Hood had indeed robbed the rich to give to the poor, the 2,000-year-old Man replies: \"He stole from everyone and kept everything.\"</p> <p>Certainly law-breakers who use their ill-gotten gains to do good may be few and far between. As criminologist Dick Hobbs remarked in his book, Doing the Business, the only Robin Hoods in east London nowadays are pubs.</p> <p>But some thieves have certainly been motivated by a desire to redistribute wealth. Peter Scott, the so-called king of the cat burglars, now in his 80s and living on a council estate just round the corner from the Guardian, wrote in his memoir, Gentleman Thief, that he felt he had been \"sent by God to take back some of the wealth that the outrageously rich had taken from the rest of us\". Much of the many millions he stole over the years, in the shape of artworks and diamonds, was given away, albeit not always to the deserving poor, and he always concentrated on the very wealthy or, as he put it \"the real meaty jugular vein of society\".</p> <p>Others who have fallen foul of the drugs laws have also helped out with good works in Africa. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/leaf-fielding\" title=\"\">Leaf Fielding</a>, one of those jailed in the wake of Operation Julie in 1978 for being part of the biggest LSD distribution crew in Britain, came out of prison and helped to set up an orphanage in Malawi.</p> <p>As Fielding makes clear in his book, To Live Outside the Law, many of the Operation Julie team were actually very idealistic about the benefits of acid. And our most famous cannabis dealer, Howard Marks, always a generous soul, could have been found at the Bloomsbury Theatre earlier this year doing a charity gig for the very worthy Beyond Food Foundation.</p> <p>Many high-profile criminals gave heartily to charity, but not always for noblest of motives. The Krays, for instance, gave \u00a3100 to the Aberfan disaster fund in 1966, the equivalent of \u00a33,000 today. Their biographer, John Pearson, remarked at the time that this donation came to light, long after their deaths, that \"the Krays were renowned for their clever manipulation of public opinion and largesse in the media spotlight. However, it's worth pointing out that this was the biggest cash donation the twins ever made and the only one to a charity outside London.\"</p> <p>Around the world there have been law-breakers who used their money for good causes. Phoolan Devi, the subject of 1994 film Bandit Queen, was the most notorious woman robber in India, but she had a reputation for aiming at the rich end of society because of her rage at the caste system.</p> <p>She later became a member of parliament speaking on behalf of the poor and dispossessed and was shot dead in 2001.</p> <p>The ancient folk song, The Lincolnshire Poacher, celebrated the activities of another lawbreaker more than 200 years ago. Maybe someone should get working on a Lincolnshire Cannabis Farmers song right now.</p>",
  "<p>At least 26 students have been killed and 19 injured in a bus crash in south-west Iran, according to state media.</p> <p>The driver lost control of the bus while driving at high speed in wet weather, senior police official Colonel Mohammad Reza Mehmandar told state radio.</p> <p>The accident took place on the Izeh-Lordegan road, about 310 miles (500km) south-west of Tehran.</p> <p>Iran has one of the world's worst road safety records, with more than 400,000 accidents and about 20,000 deaths on its roads every year.</p> <p>The high death tolls are blamed on high speed, unsafe vehicles, widespread disregard of traffic laws and poor emergency services.</p>",
  "<p>Moustafa Zoubi trained his battered Kalashnikov on a large storm water pipe, his gun barrel darting between the shadow at its entrance and a frantic commotion on the ridge above. Fighters were scrambling in every direction, shouting commands and barking orders for reinforcements into their mobile phones. One radio call in particular was repeatedly shouted: \"Call sign one.\"</p> <p>Some of the frantic men nearby took cover behind a grass berm, looking towards an area past a twisted and smouldering convoy of cars and trucks for the source of the incoming gunfire. Others made for nearby buildings. All the time, gungho men in war-ravaged trucks were arriving, tyres squealing on the hot black bitumen as they neared the maelstrom on the outskirts of the Libyan city of Sirte.</p> <p>The recent arrivals were turning up with news urgently passed on to them in phone calls from their colleagues as far away as Misrata and Tripoli. The man they had all been hunting was cowering in the foul-smelling hole in front of them.</p> <p>Captives from the firefight still raging around them had given up their boss, the new arrivals were told. He had nowhere left to run.</p> <p>Zoubi's heart seemed to pound through his chest as he focused his Kalashnikov and every bit of concentration he could summon on the shadow in front of him. The gunfire crackling in the distance no longer mattered. Along with everyone else, he was focused solely on the momentous drama that was about to play out.</p> <p>A hand tentatively emerged from the drainpipe. Seconds later another slowly appeared from the shadow into the midday light. One hand briefly dropped to the ground, and the men outside responded with screamed orders. \"Keep coming,\" someone said. Someone else fired into the air.</p> <p>A man's head appeared from the gloom \u2013 sporting a signature black curly mass of hair.</p> <p>The rebels surged forward and grabbed the man by the arms, pulling him clear of the pipe and hauling him to his feet. One pulled his hair back, forcing his face to lurch violently towards the sunlight.</p> <p>\"Muammar! Muammar!\" one of the rebels screamed.</p> <p>\"What's this?\" asked one of modern history's most infamous tyrants. \"What's this, my sons? What are you doing?\"</p> <p>Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, wearing matching tan pants and shirt, by now soaked in blood, stopped briefly and looked around, seemingly bewildered. He had little more than a few seconds to take in his surroundings before being grabbed by each arm and wrenched away from his final, ignominious refuge.</p> <p>The self-anointed Godfather of Libya, King of Kings of Africa, and Leader Who Lived in All Libyans' Hearts, looked unsteady on his feet as he was led away, his hair unkempt, wild and partly matted in his own blood, and his legs trembling with each step.</p> <p>A mob grew around Gaddafi as he was frog-marched through the sand. While he was being taken towards a group of rebel trucks, one fighter crouched in the dirt behind the frightened captive and sodomised him with a bayonet.</p> <p>\"<em>Haram alaikum</em>!\" screamed Gaddafi, his voice hoarse and his eyes darting wildly. Loosely translated: \"It's a sin what you are doing!\"</p> <p>Blood from the vanquished leader's various wounds was now caking his shirt. Blows rained down on him. Every one of his captors seemed to want a piece of the hobbled tyrant. Things were slipping fast out of control.</p> <p>Rebels from everywhere were converging on this industrial area outside Sirte, a city that had become associated with his rule. The rebels held their telephones forward like candles, filming every move of the increasingly desperate and terrified 69-year-old. Gaddafi was thrown on to the front of a white car bonnet, his bloodsoaked head locked between the knees of a militiaman from nearby Misrata.</p> <p>He slipped off the bonnet, his ravaged body unable to cope with the constant battering. The militiaman hauled him back up.</p> <p>Around this time, someone filmed the gruesome shot of what seemed to be a mortally wounded Gaddafi, an image that would quickly be broadcast worldwide.</p> <p>From this point, none of the dozens who were recording the scene seemed able to hold their mobile phones steady. Torn between wanting to watch things unfold with their own eyes and recording for posterity the momentous scenes playing out on what would be a famous day \u2013 20 October 2011 \u2013 the men surrounding Gaddafi all seemed to choose the former.</p> <p>Adam Zawbi, a 20-year-old Misrata fighter, saw what happened next. \"I had just got there,\" he said. \"We got a call that Gaddafi was captured and we went straight to the area. There were lots of guys shouting and Gaddafi was in the centre of the road. I saw the gun. I saw the hand holding it and I heard it fire.\"</p> <p>\"I know who did it,\" he later said, as we drove between the central Libyan coastal city of Zlitan and his home city of Misrata. \"I know his first name anyway.\" I got the impression that the young medic, by then a veteran of eight grinding months of frontline warfare, knew a lot more than he was letting on.</p>",
  "<p>The school I work at is a great school. There is fantastic teaching and learning going on and we have all raised our game. My teaching is better than it has ever been. We are accountable for the success of our students as we have never been before and this can only be a good thing. However, it is a job not my life.</p> <p>The day begins. In case you might enjoy gradually waking up, taking some quiet time for yourself, thinking about the day to come or, who knows, possibly even talking to and enjoying the company of your colleagues before the daily morning meeting starts, a rolling PowerPoint is displayed for us all to read as a starter activity. Every teacher recognises this as the way to control disillusioned students: occupy their every minute in case they take a breath, look around and realise the pointlessness of it all.</p> <p>You teach your lessons and let your head be filled with what it should be. The subject you love so much that you knew a job teaching it would be fantastic; the energy and humour of young people, those lovely light bulb moments when something clicks, the unpredictability of it all, a kid thinking they can't do something and then succeeding and the brilliant questions or observations that make your heart sing.</p> <p>You go to the staffroom looking forward to a chat and a good laugh with some of the great staff you are lucky to work with. Here you will find lists of looked after students, lists of FSM (free school meals) students, lists of students who are not making progress in maths, lists of students who are not making enough progress in English and, hell, even lists of looked after free school meals students who have the audacity to not be making enough progress in maths and English. Some teachers struggle to even recognise who these students are it is so long since they have attended school. You daren't look up above seat height. I feel like a police officer being pursued by a never ending ID parade.</p> <p>And then you go to a meeting. Meetings are controlled by the minute. Bloated agendas groan with weight. Interjections are waved away and questions have to be asked after the meeting has ended. Heartbeats quicken. Blood pressure rises. People inwardly and, sometimes, outwardly weep. You tune out and desperately try to catch on to the coat tails of the day's successes. They seem like a distant dream.</p> <p>You open your emails. People send you Twitter links in case you find yourself at a loss as what to do that coming evening other than possibly talking to your own family.</p> <p>Even the toilet isn't safe. Teaching tips, newsletters and development plans are stuck to the inside door of each cubicle. Visiting teachers from other schools express incredulity and send each other in to have a look and laugh at it but none of us dare challenge it.

That's pretty much the question of the night. I'm convinced it is: the Giants offense has seen overmatched and I have no faith in Barry Zito, despite all the wacky memes. Look for Lance Lynn to improve with this, his second start after working out of the bullpen during the NLDS, and for the Cardinals offense to continue to be relentless. So, yeah, let's say Cardinals 7 - Giants 3.</p> <p>What are your thoughts? Do the Cardinals advance to the World Series tonight? Do the Giants hold them off, like a desperate horror movie character shoving furniture against a door trying to keep a zombie invasion at bay?

Stay tuned tomorrow to find out!\" Unfortunately for San Francisco fans, with the seemingly unstoppable St. Louis Cardinals taking a 3-1 series lead on the increasingly punchless Giants, it seems unlikely that their team will be making a daring Batman-esque escape.</p> <p>If the Giants are going to make a comeback they're going to have to win three straight games. The good news for them is that the next two games of the NLCS would be at home in AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. Of course, surviving long enough to make it NLCS Game 6 on Sunday is the trick, a trick that won't be easier to pull off with Barry Zito on the mound.</p> <p>Perhaps I'm being unfair here, after all, the the last potential elimination game that Barry Zito started for the Giants turned out alright for them (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/10/san-francisco-giants-cincinnati-reds-nlds-game-four-live2\">although less so for the Cincinnati Reds</a>). In fact, the Giants have had a decent amount of success winning games that Zito has started, despite the fact that the <a href=\"http://network.yardbarker.com/mlb/article_external/does_barry_zito_have_the_worst_pitching_contract_ever/11186458\">Man With The Laughable Contract</a> hasn't magically transformed himself into anything other than a League Average Starter. Keep in mind that this is the guy whose Giants career has been so disappointing that he's been <a href=\"http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/10/07/giants-leave-barry-zito-jose-guillen-off-postseason-roster/\">left off playoff rosters</a> and was retroactively scrubbed out of the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2011/09/more_moneyball_same_problems.html\">\"Moneyball\" movie adaptation</a>.</p> <p>(Fun fact: Giants fans certainly have a sense of whimsy about it, I suppose it comes from that whole San Francisco vibe-y thing: there's a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RALLYZITO&amp;src=tren\">#RALLYZITO </a>Twitter campaign to get Giants fans to change their icons image to Barry Zito to get some sort of mojo going. Well, I guess it couldn't hurt.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, the St. Louis Cardinals will trot out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/st-louis-cardinals-san-francisco-giants-nlcs-game-1-live\">NLCS Game 1 </a>starter Lance Lynn for what could be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/19/st-louis-cardinals-san-francisco-giants-nlcs\">the game that clinches their second straight World Series appearance</a>. They have three chances to get one win, but they can't allow themselves to think that: After all, these Giants needed to win three straight games in their NLDS. If the Cardinals start to turn their attention to the Detroit Tigers (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/18/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-live-alcs-game-4?newsfeed=true\">who defeated the New York Yankees in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series yesterday</a>) before they make the last out of the NLCS, well, they could be in trouble. They need to think of this as their Game 7.</p> <p>This may be your last time to contribute to a NLCS liveblog, so you should take advantage. Send us your questions, comments and predictions!
