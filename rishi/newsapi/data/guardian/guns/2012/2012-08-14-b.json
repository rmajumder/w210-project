  "<p><strong>Juan Mata and Javi Martinez are the only two players picked for the Spain World Cup 2012, Euro 2012 and London 2012 Olympic squads,\" </strong>begins Michiel Jongsma.<strong> \"If they manage to win the tournament, will they become the first to be champions (never mind reigning champions) in all three tournaments?\"</strong></p> <p>It didn't happen for Mata, Mart\u00ednez and co \u2013 and it would have been a unique treble \u2013 but a few players have been reigning Olympic and world champions or reigning Olympic and continental champions, and a handful in the men and women's games have held all three (though not at the same time).</p> <p>Uruguay's Jos\u00e9 Andrade, Peregrino Anselmo, H\u00e9ctor Castro, Pedro Cea, Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez, \u00c1lvaro Gestido, \u00c1ngel Melogno, Jos\u00e9 Nasazzi, Pedro Petrone, H\u00e9ctor Scarone, Domingo Tejera, Santos Urdinar\u00e1n all won gold at the 1928 Olympics then the inaugural World Cup in 1930. Castro, Nasazzi and Fern\u00e1ndez was also part of the 1935 South American championship-winning squad, but by that time Italy were World Cup holders.</p> <p>Lev Yashin, Anatoli Maslenkin, Igor Netto and Valentin Ivanov of the Soviet Union all won gold at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, then followed it up with victory in the European championships 1960, while Pierre Wome, Samuel Eto'o, Geremi, Patrick M'Boma and Lauren were reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions when they won gold at the 2000 Games in Sydney.</p> <p>In the women's game Briana Scurry, Cindy Parlow, Carla Overbeck, Tiffany Roberts, Brandi Chastain, Shannon MacMillan, Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, Joy Fawcett, Tisha Venturini and Tiffeny Milbrett were all part of the all-conquering USA squad of the late 1990s that won gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, then followed it up with victory in the women's World Cup in 1999.</p> <p>Three women have completed the holy trinity of Olympic, European and World titles, although they did not hold all three at the same time. Norway's Hege Riise, Bente Nordby and Gro Espeseth won the 1993 European Championship, the World Cup in 1995 and were still around to pick up a gold in Sydney in 2000.</p> <h2>NOT YOU AGAIN</h2> <p><strong>\"Italy face England on Wednesday, having been knocked out of Euro 2012 by the Azzurri less than two months ago,\" </strong>writes Andy Morris. <strong>\"Is this the first time England will face their major-tournament nemesis in their very next fixture?</strong></p> <p>In short, yes. The closest England have ever previously been to this unlikely double-header was in 1958 when Walter Winterbottom's team were beaten by the USSR at the World Cup in Sweden on 17 June then took a modicum of revenge against the Soviets on 22 October of the same year with a Johnny Haynes-inspired 5-0 win at Wembley. A Home Championship match against Northern Ireland, though, was the filling in that sandwich on 4 October.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale, it is 12 years and counting since Romania dumped England out of Euro 2000 with victory in Charleroi \u2026</p> <h2>ATVIDABERGS FF: FEMINIST ICONS?</h2> <p><strong>\"Having just read about the heroic deeds of Swedish side \u00c5tvidabergs FF during the early 1970s (with two Swedish league titles in '72 and '73, a victory over Chelsea in the 1971-72 Cup Winners' Cup and a near-victory over Bayern Munich in the 1973-74 European Cup), </strong><a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7c/Atvidabergs_FF.png\" title=\"\"><strong>I saw that their crest has a venus symbol in it</strong></a><strong>,\" </strong>writes Lemmy Vachousek. <strong>\"What is the history behind this crest?

Burtenshaw claimed afterwards that he was simply celebrating the fact that the game hadn't gone to a replay.</p> <p>That excuse lost what little credence it had when, a few months later, he presided over Arsenal's 6-2 battering of Benfica. Burtenshaw's performance was so bad that he was mobbed by Benfica players, who tried to beat the crap out of him \u2013 a task that would clearly have taken a fairly long time. He'd had a chance to brush up on his self-defence skills a few years earlier, mind. When Aston Villa beat Millwall 2-1 in October 1967, the Den crowd were so incensed they stormed the pitch and surrounded Burtenshaw. He had to be carried from the pitch after being knocked unconscious.</p> <p>The German referee Wolf-Dieter Ahlenfelder, by contrast, was knocked sideways by a few pre-match liveners. \"It was November 8 1975 when, in the Bundesliga, Werder Bremen played against Hannover 96,\" scene-sets Eberhard Spohd. \"The referee Ahlenfelder surprised everyone with some seriously strange decisions \u2013 including blowing for half-time after 29 minutes. A linesman indicated his mistake and Ahlenfelder played 16 minutes' added time. Then, during the half-time interval, he stuck his tongue out at a photographer, and Bremen's president B\u00f6hmert said: 'For this show we could have charged a higher entrance fee.' Ahlenfelder of course denied drinking alcohol, but later he admitted that he had 'several Maltesers' (a schnaps) before the match. And to make things really clear to the layman, he said: 'We are men \u2013 we don't drink Fanta'.\"</p> <p>But they've got nothing on the cunning of one inventive Italian official, as our very own James Richardson explains. \"In a Napoli-Salernitana local derby in 1945, a referee named Stampacchia lost control of the match and faced a pitch invasion from a large a hostile crowd,\" he writes. \"At this, Signore Stampacchia wisely pretended to have been shot. A large and concerned crowd gathered around the fallen official's tragically supine form \u2013 at which point, tempers having cooled nicely, Stampacchia got back up and continued the game.\"</p> <p><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\"Sheffield United ended last season with defeat on penalties to Huddersfield,\" notes Charlie Wooden. \"Then they began this campaign with a defeat on penalties to Burton Albion in the Capital One Cup.

He committed a clear foul on an attacker just outside the penalty area, but the referee just waved 'play on'. The Madrid defender, however, not realising he'd got away with it bent down and picked up the ball (inside the penalty area by now), and handed it to the keeper. The other team called for a penalty, but again, the referee just waved 'play on'. I've looked for this incident on Google and YouTube, but the problem is I can't remember who Madrid were playing, and when I describe it to my friends they find it too far fetched to believe. Can someone confirm that I didn't just dream this, and that it really happened?

About 100 youths set fire to cars, a nursery school and a youth centre as well as firing buckshot and throwing projectiles at police officers, who filled the streets with teargas as reinforcements arrived from neighbouring areas.</p> <p>\"The confrontations were very, very violent,\" the mayor of Amiens, Gilles Dumailly, told French television network BFM, describing \"a scene of devastation\". One officer was in a serious condition, Dumailly said.</p> <p>There had been unrest among youths on housing estates in Amiens-Nord earlier this month and again on Sunday night, apparently triggered by resentment over spot checks by police on residents.</p> <p>The French media reported that violence broke out between local residents and the police following a check on a driver said to be driving dangerously, near to the spot where the family and friends of a 20-year-old who died in a motorbike crash on Thursday had gathered for a memorial ceremony.</p> <p>As the unrest grew police fired teargas and rubber bullet rounds, which some residents considered excessive.</p> <p>The poor relationship between police and local youths has often been the source of conflict on housing estates across France. The northern area of Amiens in the Somme is classed among the 15 most troubled neighbourhoods in France. It was recently included in a list of the government's \"priority security zones\", which will get a reinforced police presence.</p> <p>There were riots in Amiens during the nationwide disturbances in 2005 across France's housing estates. The city has often experienced unrest, but the prefect's office said there had never been violence \"as serious as this\".</p> <p>Public buildings including a nursery school and sports centre were destroyed by fire, causing an estimated \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000) in damage.</p> <p>A group of about 100 young men jeered and jostled the French interior minister on Tuesday when he met officials in Amiens.</p> <p>\"Calm down! Calm down!\" Manuel Valls yelled as the crowd bumped him while he entered the town hall surrounded by bodyguards.</p> <p>He told a news conference inside that a minority of people were terrorising the community. \"Firearms! Can it be considered normal that people turn firearms on police? It's unacceptable ... law and order must be restored,\" Valls said.</p> <p>The president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said: \"Our priority is security, which means that the next budget will include additional resources for the gendarmerie and the police.\"</p> <p>The far-right Front National party immediately seized on the unrest in the rundown neighbourhood to link insecurity in France to the issue of \"massive immigration\".</p>",
  "<p>Roy Hodgson has expressed his hope that John Terry will be cleared of allegedly using racially abusive language by an independent regulatory commission and can continue to play for England as the Chelsea captain awaits confirmation of a date for his personal hearing.</p> <p>Terry was charged by the Football Association last month for his alleged turn of phrase during last season's defeat at Queens Park Rangers, only 13 days after being cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster magistrates court that centred on the same incident. The 31-year-old, who has been rested along with a number of other senior players for this evening's friendly against Italy, denied the charge but the case may not be heard until late next month.</p> <p>Hodgson was understandably reluctant to enter the debateabout Terry's impending hearing, initially claiming the issue was \"sub-judice\" and stressing the player \"has a case to answer with the FA and I'll wait and see what happens\". Yet he went on to declare his hope that the defender, so outstanding at Euro 2012, will be cleared. \"I'm hoping, and I make no secret of that, the case will take its course and that John, hopefully, will be freed as he was freed in a court of law, and will carry on playing for England.</p> <p>\"That's my hope. What will happen, I have no idea. I thought John did well in the Euros and I'd like to keep using him, but this is a case which is way out of my hands. John understands that.</p> <p>\"All I can do, like many of his supporters I suppose, is just hope he gets freed and can continue to play.\" Asked whether he intends to select Terry for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine, he added: \"We'll wait and see.\"</p> <p>England's preparations for this evening's game in Switzerland, a rematch of the Euro 2012 quarter-final which saw them eliminated on penalties, have been hampered by a series of withdrawals, with Theo Walcott joining the list of absentees. The Arsenal winger is at home receiving treatment on a badly bruised thigh sustained in Sunday's friendly win in Cologne, leaving Hodgson likely to select only three men \u2013 Ashley Young, James Milner and Joleon Lescott \u2013 who started against Italy in Kiev.</p> <p>The manager, who has reminded his players of their responsibilities after the success enjoyed by Team GB at the Olympics, has handed Frank Lampard the captaincy against the <em>Azzurri</em> with the midfielder having indicated a desire to extend his stay at Chelsea beyond the expiry of his current contract . The 34-year-old's deal runs until next summer with the club yet to resume talks over an extension after a preliminary meeting last season.</p> <p>\"We spoke once and it was a case of coming back, and it hasn't come back from their end,\" he said.\"I don't know. I'd like to sit down and speak with them. But at the minute I'm playing and it's up to the club to do that.</p> <p>\"I would like [to end my career there]. I feel I can play at the top level for a good few more years, but it's whether the club feels the same. I know there are a lot of changes at Chelsea, and the youth coming into the squad this year has really freshened up our team, but I'd love to be involved. But it's a club decision to come and sit down with me. They used to sit down with me three years before the end of my contract. Now I'm waiting.\"</p>",
  "<p>The British bank Standard Chartered has agreed to pay a $340m (\u00a3220m) fine to a US regulator which had accused it of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">scheming with Iran</a> to hide billions of pounds' worth of transactions from the US authorities, leaving the financial system susceptible to \"terrorists\" and \"drug kingpins\".</p> <p>The last-minute settlement \u2013 just hours before the bank had been due to appear before the New York department of financial services (DFS) \u2013 came after the bank's chief executive, Peter Sands, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/13/standard-chartered-boss-arrives-new-york\" title=\"\">flew into New York</a> to take direct control of the situation and despite his insistence that the allegations contained inaccuracies.</p> <p>The fine is the latest embarrassment for a UK bank, following the penalties slapped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">on Barclays for attempting to manipulate Libor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">the accusations levelled against HSBC for laundering money through the US for drug barons in Mexico</a>.</p> <p>It is particularly damaging for Standard Chartered \u2013 which is based in London but best known for its banking services in Asia and Africa \u2013 as its management, led by Sands, had been boasting just two weeks ago that it was \"boring\" and had a more conservative culture than its rivals.</p> <p>A week ago, the DFS said that Standard Chartered had left the US financial system \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity\".</p> <p>Led by Benjamin Lawsky, the DFS said that the two parties had agreed that the problems included transactions of at least $250bn. This is the sum that he had included in his order last Monday. The bank conceded that $14m of transactions broke the rules and apologised for them.</p> <p>A hearing with the DFS originally scheduled for Wednesdayhas now been adjourned, but the bank may face penalties from other US authorities which are still investigating breaches of sanctions on Iran covering the period 2001 to 2007. There were suggestions last night that the $340m was half the fine the DFS had asked for.</p> <p>The bank said that a \"formal agreement\" with the DFS was expected to be completed shortly and that it was continuing to work with other regulators. The DFS alleged last week that one senior banker remonstrated with a US colleague using the words \"you fucking Americans\" when warned of the potential breaches of US sanctions. The bank was wrongfooted and took eight hours to respond publicly. US regulators have traditionally worked together when investigating alleged breaches of rules and Lawsky indicated that the DFS would work with the other bodies involved, including the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the New York Justice Department and the District Attorney.</p> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he had created the DFS last year because \"we believed that New York needed a tough and fair regulator for the banking and insurance industries to protect consumers and investors\".</p> <p>.</p>",
  "<h2>Archery<br></h2> <p>Funding: \u00a34,408,000</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.67</p> <p>Target: 0-1 medals. Two teams to finish between 4th-8th</p> <p>Outcome: No medals. One man and the women's team made last 16</p> <p>Verdict: Likely to be on the edge. Will need to show they can at least hope to finish in the top eight and be on course for a medal by 2020 to stand a chance of retaining funding</p> <h2>Athletics<br></h2> <p>Funding: \u00a325,148,000</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 9.52</p> <p>Target: 5-8 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 6 medals (4 golds, 1 silver, 1 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Athletics delivered the \"golden moments\" that Seb Coe desired and through Mo Farah, Jess Ennis and Greg Rutherford provided the memories to last a lifetime. But while they met UK Sport's medals target, it masked a lack of strength in depth.</p> <h2>Badminton</h2> <p>Funding \u00a37,434,900</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 2.81</p> <p>Target: 0-1 medals. One athlete to finish between 4th-8th</p> <p>Outcome: None through group stage</p> <p>Verdict: A mixed doubles silver medal in last year's world championships, plus home advantage, raised hopes. In the event it was a hugely disappointing Games, raising a question mark over future funding. A reduction is likely.</p> <h2>Basketball</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a38,599,000</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 3.26</p> <p>Target: Both men's and women's teams to finish in top eight</p> <p>Outcome: Men finished 5th in group. Women finished 6th in group</p> <p>Verdict: Missed their target but provided some hope for the future. Not only do they have to prove the home nations question is resolved but must show they can qualify for Rio \u2013 a tall order.</p> <h2>Boxing</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a39,551,400</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 3.62</p> <p>Target: 3-5 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 5 medals (3 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Massively punched above their weight in London, hitting the top end of the medal target and returning three gold medals. UK Sport commends the sport as a fine example of its high performance ideals in action. Should receive a funding boost.</p> <h2>Canoeing</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a316,167,700</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 6.12</p> <p>Target: 3-4 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 4 medals (2 golds, 1 silver, 1 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Another sport that delivered at the top end of expectations, including a first ever gold in the double canoe slalom. The sport has been transformed since Tim Brabants won its first gold in Beijing. On course for a funding boost.</p> <h2>Cycling</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a326,032,000</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 9.86</p> <p>Target: 6-10 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 12 medals (8 gold, 2 silver, 2 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: The international federation tried to check Britain's progress by changing the rules around the number of entries but Team GB dominated nonetheless. It is hard to see how they will carry on the trajectory in Rio \u2013 but that is what they said after Beijing.</p> <h2>Diving</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a36,535,700</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 2.47</p> <p>Target: 1-3 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 1 medal (bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: For all that Tom Daley's bronze on the final day of competition was a fantastic achievement and a heartwarming moment, the sport delivered at the bottom end of expectations. It will have to prove it can do better in Rio if it is to avoid a funding cut.</p> <h2>Equestrian</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a313,395,100</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 5.07</p> <p>Target: 3-4 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 5 medals (3 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: A series of spectacular successes in Greenwich Park, including a first individual dressage gold for Charlotte Dujardin on Valegro and a dramatic team showjumping gold, have left the sport in good shape in the run up to Rio. Will have to prove they can continue that run and have more talent coming through.</p> <h2>Fencing</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a32,529,335</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 0.96</p> <p>Target: 0-1 medals. One individual to make top 12. One team to finish 4th-8th</p> <p>Outcome: Two teams reached last eight. One individual made final 32</p> <p>Verdict: There was controversy before the Games with allegations of bias in the selection process, and the sport failed to deliver on its UK Sport target. It is likely to survive the post-London cull but must prove it can finish in the top eight in Rio.</p> <h2>Gymnastics</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a310,770,600</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 4.08</p> <p>Target: 1-2 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 4 medals (1 silver, 3 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Cited by the UK Sport chief executive, Liz Nicholl, as a prime example of a sport that has raised its game. The bronze medal collected by the men's team showed the strength in depth and Beth Tweddle's bronze was a standout moment. With more young talent coming through, the sport should receive a funding boost.</p> <h2>Handball</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a32,924,721</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.11</p> <p>Target: One team to finish between 5th and 8th</p> <p>Outcome: No matches won \u2013 both men and women finished bottom of group.</p> <p>Verdict: Handball was one of the hits of the Olympics, with crowds packing the Copper Box and anecdotal evidence of a surge in interest in playing a sport with no tradition in the UK. But it will almost certainly lose all its funding and must build from the grass roots.</p> <h2>Hockey</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a315,013,200</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 5.68</p> <p>Target: 1-2 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 1 medal (bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: There were high hopes of a bigger return from a sport that receives a disproportionately high investment owing to its team nature. Both teams reached their semi-finals but, despite a humiliating thrashing for the men, did enough to prove they will continue to compete with the best in the world.</p> <h2>Judo</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a37,498,000</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 2.84</p> <p>Target: 0-1 medal. Three athletes to finish in top eight</p> <p>Outcome: 2 medals (silver, bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: In the opening days of the Games its chairman was openly critical of his athletes and, in response, one likened the organisation to a rotting fish. But then came Gemma Gibbons' emotional silver medal and another bronze for Karina Bryant to complete the best return since 1992.</p> <h2>Modern pentathlon</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a36,288,800</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 2.38</p> <p>Target: 1-2 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 1 medal (silver)</p> <p>Verdict: Samantha Murray delivered Team GB's final medal of a triumphant Olympics in the modern pentathlon at Greenwich Park. The depth of talent in the British team and changes to the sport to make it more attractive to spectators should help it grow. Will expect to see funding maintained.</p> <h2>Rowing</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a327,287,600</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 10.3</p> <p>Target: minimum of six medals</p> <p>Outcome: 9 medals (4 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Even if the target of six medals always seemed slightly conservative given the huge strength of British Rowing, the team delivered in spades. Their success was driven by the female rowers, with Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's opening win setting the gold standard.</p> <h2>Sailing</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a322,942,700</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 8.69</p> <p>Target: 3-5 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 5 medals (1 gold, 4 silver)</p> <p>Verdict: Head coach Stephen Park said he was satisfied but not ecstatic with a return that met medal targets but not the gold rush the sport has become used to in recent Games. But it served notice of the young talent coming through and will expect to retain its funding to Rio.</p> <h2>Shooting</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a32,461,866</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 0.93</p> <p>Target: one medal</p> <p>Outcome: 1 medal (gold)</p> <p>Verdict: Shooting targeted one medal and duly delivered with Peter Wilson's memorable gold in the double trap. He may be trained by a Middle Eastern prince, but Wilson's victory will accelerate interest in the sport in Britain and should lead to a funding boost.</p> <h2>Swimming</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a325,144,600</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 9.52</p> <p>Target: minimum of five medals</p> <p>Outcome: 3 medals (1 silver, 2 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: Swimming's underachievement was stark, and without Rebecca Adlington's two battling bronzes things would have looked even worse. Plenty of swimmers reached finals but too few swam to their full potential, Michael Jamieson being the exception. Likely to be punished with a funding cut.</p> <h2>Synchronised swimming</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a33,398,300</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.29</p> <p>Target: Duet to finish in top 10. Team to finish between 6th and 8th</p> <p>Outcome: Team 6th, Duet 9th</p> <p>Verdict: The team met expectations by finishing sixth, and introduced the sport to new audiences, but must prove they can contend for a medal to maintain funding.</p> <h2>Table tennis</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a31,213,848</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 0.46</p> <p>Target: One man through to last 64. One woman through qualifying round</p> <p>Outcome: One man reached last 64</p> <p>Verdict: Paul Drinkhall reached the third round but it is unlikely to save the sport from the cull. Popular as a participation sport and facing the huge task of competing with players from the Far East, it is one of those that would like to see more discretion.</p> <h2>Taekwondo</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a34,833,600</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.83</p> <p>Target: 1-3 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 2 medals (1 gold, 1 bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: The Aaron Cook affair overshadowed the buildup to the Games for a sport that had been lauded as one that had made great strides. A fantastic first gold for Jade Jones and a redemptive bronze for Lutalo Muhammad should be enough to secure a funding boost.</p> <h2>Tennis</h2> <p>Funding: n/a</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: n/a</p> <p>Target: 2 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 2 medals (gold and silver)</p> <p>Verdict: UK Sport doesn't fund tennis, given the millions that flow to the Lawn Tennis Association from Wimbledon each year, so there are no funding implications. But thanks to Andy Murray and Laura Robson, the sport hit its medal targets on one heady afternoon.</p> <h2>Triathlon</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a35,291,300</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 2.00</p> <p>Target: 1-2 medals</p> <p>Outcome: 2 medals (gold and bronze)</p> <p>Verdict: For so long the nearly men and women of the Olympic sporting world, triathlon showed the benefit of investing in a long-term performance plan. The Brownlee brothers delivered on the big stage and Helen Jenkins came a battling fifth despite not being fit. Can expect a funding boost as reward.</p> <h2>Volleyball</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a33,536,077</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.34</p> <p>Target: Minimum of one team to win one match</p> <p>Outcome: Women won one match and reached repechage</p> <p>Verdict: The sport reached its modest target, a huge achievement for the women \u2013 who beat Algeria \u2013 given the funding cuts they had to contend with. Unlikely to receive any money at all for Rio, it will need to regroup and rebuild.</p> <h2>Water polo</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a32,928,039</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 1.11</p> <p>Target: Women 4th-7th. Men 10th-12th</p> <p>Outcome: Men finished 12th, women 8th \u2013 both last</p> <p>Verdict: The sport went down well with curious spectators but home hopes were extinguished early on. The women lost narrowly to Russia but that was as good as it got. Unlikely to meet the funding criteria for the next Olympics in Rio.</p> <h2>Weightlifting</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a31,365,157</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 0.52</p> <p>Target: One competitor to finish between 4th and 8th</p> <p>Outcome: Two athletes in top 12</p> <p>Verdict: The pre-Games target was missed but Zoe Smith acquitted herself admirably and recorded a personal best to a huge reception. The sport must prove it can get at least one athlete into the top eight by Rio and win a medal by 2020 to retain funding.</p> <h2>Wrestling</h2> <p>Funding: \u00a31,435,210</p> <p>Percentage of total funding: 0.54</p> <p>Target: One fighter to finish between 4th and 8th</p> <p>Outcome: Only competitor lost in first round</p> <p>Verdict: The sport became embroiled in a bitter dispute in the runup to the Games over imported wrestlers and drug scandals. The BOA ruled that it could only enter one wrestler, Olga Butkevych, who duly made an early exit. UK Sport takes the governance of a sport into account as well as performance; as wrestling did not do well on both counts its future funding must be at risk.</p>",
  "<p>It is just a week since the CEO of Standard Chartered, Peter Sands, insisted that Benjamin Lawsky, of the New York Department of Financial Services, was talking utter rubbish. The bank, said Sands, had not concealed $250bn (\u00a3160bn) of US sanction-busting transactions with the Iranian government.</p> <p>He came out fighting and branded the allegations as \"incorrect as a matter of law\". He claimed 99.9% of the transactions were clean, although he did fess up to $14m of accidental dealings.</p> <p>So the obvious question is, why agree to pay a fine of $340m? That would have covered a lot of lawyers' fees to allow Sands to prove his point.</p> <p>Instead, as part of the settlement, Standard Chartered agreed with Lawsky that business worth \"at least $250bn\" was at issue.</p> <p>There are analysts, and investors, who will say the agreed settlement is a good result, allowing this little local difficulty to be swept away and the bank to move on with its vital New York banking licence intact. There were suggestions the fine could be north of $500m. Dutch bank ING paid $600m to settle similar allegations.</p> <p>But several things are not intact, notably the reputations of Sands and finance director Richard Meddings (who, Lawsky's report suggested, had taken issue with \"fucking Americans\" telling the bank who they could and could not do business with). Sands might just hold on to his job, such is the store of goodwill he has built up among investors, but he can forget any aspirations to be the next governor of the Bank of England.</p> <p>Meddings, tipped as a potential head of Barclays, can similarly forget any career enhancing moves.</p> <p>The already near-shredded status of British banks has also taken another hammer blow. After Barclays' Libor rigging and HSBC's Mexican money laundering scandal, we now have Standard Chartered branded as a facilitator for \"terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes\". Can it really get much worse for the banking sector?</p> <p>Worryingly, the $340m agreed on Tuesday is a settlement with just one regulator. Sands admits four others are also looking at the same claims. Might there be more \"settlements\" to come?</p> <p>Those analysts and shareholders who think Sands still worth backing really need to find some moral fibre.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister says \"Team GB's work is done\", and that \"now it's GB's turn\". What does he mean? David Cameron identified the Olympic contribution to the nation's psyche as, variously, ingenuity, joy, friendship, tolerance, eccentricity, welcome and inspiration. He wins a gold for abstract nouns, but there is truth in them. The&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">London Olympics</a> delivered its undeniable panache by throwing a large&#xa0;amount of money at a small number of people who were set a simple&#xa0;goal. They delivered. But can such delivery be generalised across the political economy? Every commentator declares this to be obligatory, yet none says how. The national brain seems stuck on a narcotic high.</p> <p>At first sight, the idea of building a stronger economy on physical fitness is dangerous nonsense. The Third Reich and communist dictators showed that. Sport is a personal pastime, not a fascistic mobilisation. Nor is sport an economic good. Cameron assumes that in some sense it can deliver one. He attributes Olympic success to two things, competitive spirit and volunteering, which he now declares must change the country for good. Tony&#xa0;Blair added his characteristic descant, adding \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9744000/9744370.stm\" title=\"\">We have imbibed deeply of the Olympic spirit \u2026 in throwing timidity to the winds we have rediscovered a spirit that is our own</a>\". Every comment on the Games repeats this line, as if Olympic spirit was a subset of whirling-dervish fundamentalism.</p> <p>Nobody says what this is supposed to&#xa0;mean. Experience is unequivocal. There is no transference from news events to national behaviour. The gloom&#xa0;of royal funerals or football defeats, the joy of royal weddings and victories, always entails \"nothing will be the same again\", but this soon dissipates. Los Angeles and Barcelona rose and Sydney and Athens fell after their Games, but no causal relationship has ever been detected. There is no external benefit from sporting success, even in football-mad cities. Time passes. Ardour cools. Even the media, which left its collective brain in volleyball sand for the duration, will revert to type.</p> <p>Yet we assume Cameron and Blair are not cynics, and can at some point attach meaning to their abstractions. Reading the few newspaper pages not devoted to the Olympics last week, I tried to transfer \"inspiration\" into real life. Could Cameron's volunteering spirit deploy sports stars to enforce asbos? Could the army take up beat-policing, at which they seem adept? Ethnic diversity and the status of women have been given a boost. The competitive spirit may not need emphasis in financial services, but there is no harm in sharpening the nation's edge \u2013 if Cameron could only say how.</p> <p>The idea that the world's importers would suddenly buy neglected British goods and services because they saw London on television must be facile. Cameron said British companies could somehow win \u00a313bn worth of contracts for future Olympics. But they won few for this one. He seems unaware that the 2012 venues were largely the work of the American firm, <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/media-centre/media-releases/year=2006/month=08/article=clm-consortium-selected-for-key-delivery-role-in-2012-ol.html\" title=\"\">CH2M Hill</a>, who have already won the Qatar World Cup and, on the strength of London, should also dominate Rio. Henry V may have won Agincourt with a speech, but England lost the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/hundred_years_war_01.shtml\" title=\"\">hundred years war</a>. It seems fanciful to imagine Britons who spent two weeks glued to the TV will, like Stakhanovites, suddenly meet higher norms in car production, healthcare and financial arbitrage.</p> <p>The nearest to a hint of a transferable Olympicism came not from Cameron but from Blair. He declared that a unique feature of the London games was their \"playing unsafe\", their eccentric daring. While the closing ceremony was dreadful, like a tired pop industry video, the opening was superb. It was&#xa0;daredevil, inventive, funny and self-mocking. Like the draconian training of the cyclists, the real stars of Britain's performance, it was a gamble that paid off.</p> <p>Britain knows it can deploy eccentricity to make people happy for a short while. I would leave it at that. But the government message is for something more, something to make people produce and consume more, and thus haul the nation out of recession.</p> <p>It has indeed shown it can spend lavishly when it chooses, hundreds of millions spent on a few buildings, on winning medals and entertaining the world. If government can dare \u00a39.3bn to stimulate a transient event, surely it can do likewise to stimulate the economy. This is not a matter of bankers going for gold in lending to businesses or Whitehall officials shooting regulations out of the sky. The daring of which Blair speaks should be deployed intellectually in unblocking the logjam now afflicting the Treasury and the Bank of England. I would give the \"legacy\" not to Lord Coe but to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/28/olympics-2012-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle</a>, and cycling's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/08/olympics-lord-moynihan-dave-brailsford\" title=\"\">Dave Brailsford</a>. Both took vast dollops of public cash and spent it with spectacular results in new and exciting ways.</p> <p>British economic policy is like the Olympic Park without the athletes. It is barren of activity and incident. More than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/05/quantitative-easing-analysis\" title=\"\">\u00a3325bn has been \"injected into the economy\"</a> by the Bank of England, money that has gone nowhere near the economy. It is sitting in a bank vault. My Olympics legacy would be to get it out and inject it properly. With the economy deep in a liquidity trap, it needs an inventive genius like Boyle, who can blow \u00a360m in just three hours of happiness. As Bob Geldof would have&#xa0;said, <a href=\"http://www.contactmusic.com/news/bob-geldofs-fears-for-olympics_1374112\" title=\"\">had he been invited</a>, \"just spend the effing money\".</p> <p>The best Olympic legacy would be to return to taxpayers the cash Coe demanded they give him seven years ago on which he promised \"a profit\". It would take the form of the Bank of England creating \u00a31,000 for every family and injecting it into bank balances this autumn, with an order to go out and spend it before Christmas. Such \"unconventional monetarism\" is now gaining traction. It was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9471703/No-clue-Bank-of-England-urged-to-drop-anguished-religious-ethics-over-QE.html\" title=\"\">hinted at this week by Adam Posen</a>, retiring member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, in criticising his colleagues for their \"anguished religious ethics\" over quantitative easing.</p> <p>Such so-called helicopter money is daring and eccentric. It would require the printing of some \u00a320bn of new money, not far off what the Olympics probably cost in spending and lost economic activity. But it would feed directly into the economy where it's most needed: in boosting high street spending. It would aid a demand-starved economy, and certainly keep that Olympic smile on every face.</p>",

  "<p>An independent inquiry has established that&#xa0;Anders Behring Breivik, the clean-cut white supremacist who methodically murdered 77 people in Norway, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/anders-behring-breivik-attacks-halted-report?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">moved around unchallenged for three hours after detonating a car bomb,</a> despite police receiving eyewitness accounts of an armed man in protective gear.</p> <p>Were the police looking for a different kind of killer? Or, despite the existence of a long-established white power underground in Norway, was it assumed that this was not a terrorist attack which would have triggered a protocol of nationwide alerts and roadblocks? The verdict on Breivik, whom prosecutors wanted declared insane and who believes multiculturalism has harmed \"white Christian identity\", is due in a few days.</p> <p>While mass killing always has a madness to its method, white supremacists are all too often declared to be psychopathic loners, where others are seen as part of organised ideological networks.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/gunman-sikh-temple-wisconsin\" title=\"\">massacre of Sikh worshippers by another white supremacist in Wisconsin last week</a>, little was made of the similarities between this apparently \"senseless killing\" and the recent <a href=\"http://presstv.com/detail/2012/08/08/255058/mosque-target-hate-crime/\" title=\"\">firebombing of a Missouri mosque</a>. Had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/wade-michael-page-violent-far-right?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Wade Page</a> been Wadi Pervez and his victims predominantly white, talking heads would have debated the relationship between his religion and violent inclinations while \"moderate Muslims\" would distance \"the community\" from him.</p> <p>Instead, there were suggestions that Page had targeted Sikhs \"unfairly\", alongside irrelevant discussions about Sikhism. Chances are that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/peter-king-muslim-radicalization-hearings_n_1613746.html\" title=\"\">Representative Peter King will not hold hearings, as he did for Muslims</a>, on the \"extent of radicalisation in the American white Christian community and that community's response\".</p> <p>While black and, more recently, Muslim anger are widely seen as the problematic pathologies of our times, and thus subjected to the full weight of sociological, scriptural, political and even economic analysis, declared white rage is routinely relegated to the fringes, written off as the result of individual psychopathy, and eliciting passing interest only after blood is shed. Supremacists warn that there are \"thousands of other angry white men like Page out there, the vast majority of them unknown\". Yet as former department of homeland security analyst <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/9/former_dhs_analyst_daryl_johnson_on\" title=\"\">Daryl Johnson points out</a>, an extensive report on rightwing terrorism, including white extremism, was angrily repudiated by Congress in 2009 and the number of security analysts devoted to domestic non-Islamic terrorism slashed to just one.</p> <p>This marginalising of the real and present danger of white terrorism at a time when other forms of religious or nationalist militancy are under unprecedented scrutiny has to do with how \"whiteness\" itself operates.</p> <p>Sociologists note that in Europe and America, whiteness and the privileges that have accrued to it historically are reliant on invisibility. To have white privilege is to not identify or be identified as racially specific unlike, say, \"black athletes\", \"Asian entrepreneurs\" or just an ethnic minority air passenger.</p> <p>White supremacists make it difficult to uphold the individualist axiom that society is now \"post-racial\" or \"colour blind\". By asserting racial affiliation and calling for (the perpetuation of) an endangered white domination, they paradoxically undermine a more quotidian white power which, writes scholar Richard Dyer, \"secures its dominance\" by remaining ostensibly featureless and general. It can sit aloof from \"multiculturalism\", which is deemed a special pleading thing that only ethnic minorities do.</p> <p>Whiteness is no more scientific or natural than any other racial category and is as internally diverse, but it still has huge operative force. It has expanded over time from an Anglo-Saxon and Nordic provenance to include, for instance, the Irish and Italians. Historians such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Roediger\" title=\"\">David Roediger</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Ignatiev\" title=\"\">Noel Ignatiev</a> have shown how who was deemed white was often linked to capitalist imperatives, such as union-busting, increasing earning power and dividing labour forces. That economic affluence still bears on ideas of whiteness is clear from pejoratives such as \"chavs\" or \"white trash\" attached to \"poor whites\", the qualifier itself implying contradiction.</p> <p>While its institutional force is denied, a sense of collective whiteness is still appealed to for political purposes, often in code, through invocations of \"shared Anglo-Saxon heritage\" or attacks on immigration, criminal \"black culture\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-multicultural-crap-tweet-misunderstood\" title=\"\">\"leftie multicultural crap\"</a>. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/10/david-cameron-school-sports-targets\" title=\"\">David Cameron knowingly invokes \"Indian dance\"</a> as a time-wasting activity that justifies target cuts as sports fields are sold off, the address is to the presumed racial solidarity of the \"you and I who wouldn't think of [it] as sport\". It's the multiculturalism, stupid!</p> <p>Though all white supremacists are not poor, a brutally inequitable economic order generates underclass anger, and there is encouragement for this sometimes murderous rage to be displaced on to foreigners, Muslims, gays, blacks, Jews and immigrants.</p> <p>With ongoing military conflicts also pitting a \"civilised west against archaic others\", is it sheer coincidence that Page was an ex-soldier now thrown, like many veterans, into an economy where there are neither jobs nor prospects?</p> <p>No murderer represents a community. But all killers, however psychopathic, act in a context, whether of economic deprivation, racism, militarisation, gun proliferation or lack of mental healthcare.

  "<p>Standard Chartered has fended off threats by a New York regulator to revoke its banking licence for alleged breaches of US sanctions. Chief executive Peter Sands is however under intense pressure after the bank agreed to pay $340m (\u00a3220m) despite insisting that it had committed only minor breaches of the rules.</p> <p>Barely 24 hours before the bank was due to attend a hearing with the New York department of financial services (DFS), the regulator <a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1208141.htm\" title=\"\">announced the surprise settlement</a>which also includes the installation a monitor for at least two years to evaluate the bank's risk controls. Inspectors from the DFS will be installed at the bank's office in New York and the bank will \"permanently install personnel\" in New York solely to ensure that it adheres to money laundering laws.</p> <p>Benjamin Lawsky, head of the DFS, who stunned Standard Chartered last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">with damning allegations of sanctions breaches</a>, had summoned the bank to appear at a hearing in New York at 10am local time on Wednesday. But the showdown was adjourned following the settlement, which was announced after the London market had closed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfs.ny.gov/banking/ea120806.pdf\" title=\"\">Lawsky claims</a> that Standard Chartered schemed to hide 60,000 transactions valued at about $250bn (\u00a3160bn) which breached sanctions with Iran. Sands admitted to only 300 breaches, with a much smaller value of about $14m.</p> <p>Lawsky had said that he could withdraw the bank's licence but has now dropped the threat, which analysts said could protect the share price on Wednesday. However, his statement announcing the settlement insisted that both sides had agreed that the \"conduct at issue\" covered $250bn \u2013 the full amount of his original order.</p> <p>The fine is considerably larger than the $5m that the bank had argued its breaches should merit \u2013 although it may still rise as the DFS is only one of a number of authorities which has been investigating possible breaches. These include the Department of Justice and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac). Standard Chartered has admitted since 2010 that it has been discussing potential sanctions breaches.</p> <p>But the bank was unprepared for the decision by the DFS to publish its allegations while Sands was on holiday with his family. Investors' fears that it could be stripped of its New York licence and possible resignations at the top of the bank sliced almost 25% off the bank's share price. The shares have been recovering, ending on Tuesday at \u00a313.70, nearly 3% higher, but still below the \u00a316 levels from last week.</p> <p>A Standard Chartered spokesman told Reuters last night the settlement was \"a pragmatic decision in the best interest of shareholders and customers\".</p> <p>The loss of its banking licence would be more damaging than the fine, although Sands on Tuesday told the Business Standard paper in India \u2013 where the bank has a high street banking operation \u2013 that he did not believe the bank would be stripped of its ability to conduct business directly in the US.</p> <p>\"We hope we do not lose our licence, we don't believe we should lose our licence and we don't believe we will,\" Sands said, adding that the bank was planning for all possible outcomes.</p> <p>Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, said: \"It has taken the nuclear option off the table and suggests the total settlement will be manageable.\"</p> <p>Sands joined the bank as finance director in 2002 so has been on the board through most of the 2001-07 period covered by the allegations. He was appointed chief executive in November 2006, when he was replaced as finance director by Richard Meddings, who joined the bank four years earlier and was previously head of risk.</p> <p>Meddings is the executive who, Lawsky claimed, made a remark to a US-based Standard Chartered executive about \"fucking Americans\" when warned about the potential breaches of sanctions. Standard Chartered insists that the remarks are inaccurate.</p> <p>Lawsky also hit out against accountants Deloitte, which he said had drafted a \"watered-down version\" of a report on the potential Iranian sanction breaches for Standard Chartered.</p> <p>Joe Echevarria, chief executive of Deloitte, told Reuters that the allegations were \"distortions of the facts\". \"It's an unfortunate choice of words that was pulled out of context,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>After an Olympic fortnight full of fancy sportswear, mirrored swimming goggles and amazing bodies, you would be forgiven for feeling a trifle lacking in the confidence department on the beach this summer.

  "<p>A man who killed six people, including his wife and two young children, in a knife attack has been hearing voices in his head, a court heard.</p> <p>Damian Rzeszowski, 31, is accused of murdering his wife, Izabela Rzeszowska, 30, along with their daughter, Kinga, five, and two-year-old son, Kacper, in St Helier, Jersey.</p> <p>Rzeszowski, a builder from Poland, is also charged with the murders of his wife's father, Marek Garstka, 56, her friend, Marta De La Haye, 34, and De La Haye's five-year-old daughter, Julia.</p> <p>The royal court in St Helier has heard that Rzeszowski struck as his wife painted with the two girls and his son played with a toy car at their flat on the Channel Island.</p> <p>He is said to have been a hard-working and loving father who provided for his family but went off the rails after his wife admitted to an affair.</p> <p>Rzeszowski has pleaded guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility, but the plea is not accepted by the crown, which argues the defendant was not suffering an \"abnormality of the mind\" when the attacks took place. He denies murder.</p> <p>Consultant psychiatrist Dale Harrison said that when he interviewed Rzeszowski five days after the attacks, which happened on 14 August last year, he found no definitive symptoms of psychosis.</p> <p>Rzeszowski has been treated at Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire but Harrison re-examined him following his return to Jersey and reported that the defendant had been hearing voices.</p> <p>Harrison said: \"These voices are related to stress he is under. His stress levels are up since leaving Broadmoor hospital and being put in prison.\"</p> <p>In the first interview Harrison conducted with Rzeszowski on 19 August last year the defendant said he could not remember what had happened.</p> <p>Solicitor General Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, read from the notes the psychiatrist made during the interview. He read: \"Damian said: 'I just remember the knife. I remember bits and pieces, going behind wife and running behind her.'\" He told the psychiatrist he did not remember attacking the children.</p> <p>At another point in the interview, Rzeszowski told Dr Harrison: \"Everybody gone, it is father-in-law, my wife, my wife's friend and daughter. It is me, I did that.\"</p> <p>He told the doctor he had no previous thoughts of killing his family or anyone else because he was not \"that type of man\", although he later added, \"maybe when I was drunk or upset\".</p> <p>The court was shown the two kitchen knives Rzeszowski used during the attacks. It also saw a painting the children had been working on just before they were killed.</p> <p>It has heard that he had been drinking whisky on the day of the killings but was under the drink-drive limit.</p>",
  "<p>Four years is longer than the average jail term for assault or burglary. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/14/anton-vickerman-surfthechannel-sentenced\">that is the sentence received by Anton Vickerman of Gateshead today</a>, after he had been found guilty of two counts of \"conspiracy to defraud\" by running a website, surfthechannel.com, that linked to pirated films and more. </p> <p>Piracy is illegal of course and Vickerman was running a site that was so popular that its profits were estimated at \u00a3300,000 a year at its height. But there is nobody angrier about piracy than the vast film and music industries, whose businesses are said to suffer from the practice. To them a four-year sentence is a coup.</p> <p>No wonder then that Vickerman was targeted in a private prosecution by FACT, the anti-piracy body, funded by the entertainment industries. In fact the Crown Prosecution Service initially concluded that it could not give authority to bring a prosecution, leaving FACT to pursue a further investigation in order to gather more evidence.</p> <p>Pursue it did. FACT, quite legally, used its own private investigators. A former Dutch police officer was hired to pose as a potential investor, Newcastle crown court heard during Vickerman's trial. It was also established, according to FACT, that profits from Vickerman's company \"were funnelled to a bank account in Latvia operated by an offshore company based in Dominica\".</p> <p>Surfthechannel did not host pirated content, but linked to it. However, FACT says that Vickerman \"targeted pirated films including those not yet released at the cinema\" (impressive work, that) and \u2013 more to the point \u2013 \"anonymously uploaded\" them to third-party sites. </p> <p>This was no mere collection of links then, although it is interesting that FACT chose to prosecute under a common law offence rather than using the copyright laws which were surely passed by parliament precisely to tackle this sort of thing. But then, conspiracy to defraud <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/conspiracy_to_defraud_(common_law)/\">carries a 10 year maximum jail term</a>.</p> <p>So is this conspiracy a more serious offence than committing violence against a person? Is it more serious than breaking into a building with the aim of committing theft or violence? No doubt the damage suffered by Hollywood, (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/feb/01/uk-box-office-1bn-harry-potter?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">not notably struggling at the box office</a>) and its stars and executives is as serious in its way. </p> <p>Music, incidentally, may have a more legitimate gripe on the piracy front \u2013 but the industry has made its share of mistakes too, such as failing to introduce copy protection, coupled with the repeated devaluing of its content through whole-catalogue, all-you-can-listen licensing deals. Who needs piracy when it is all there on YouTube?</p> <p>Finally, though, one can only wonder why FACT doesn't have the heart to prosecute Google and YouTube, or any of the other content archives where links to, or actual, pirated material has been known to crop up. Of course surfthechannel was create to profit only from illegal material. By contrast, FACT argues search engines are quite legitimate enterprises that may happen to have some links to illegal material. </p> <p>Indeed, but it was only this week that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/13/google-acclerate-launch-music-service\">Google decided it would relegate the results of pirate sites</a>. Had Google done that a decade ago, it might not have been worthwhile for Vickerman to set up his site at all.</p>",
  "<p>Since 2005, same-sex couples in Britain have been able to contract a civil covenant which gives them the same legal protection and framework as heterosexual marriage. It is an act of legislation that has been almost universally acknowledged as a great good, a real advance for social stability and human happiness.</p> <p>Far more people entered civil partnerships than the government had anticipated, and in the first years a high proportion of them were older couples who had been together in secrecy or semi-secrecy for decades \u2013 some from before the time <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_Act_1967\" title=\"\">homosexual acts were decriminalised in 1967</a>. The sense of release and liberation, of joy in a newfound sense of dignity and affirmation, was extraordinary. For gay Christians it was a cause of profound thanksgiving to god.</p> <p>The official church \u2013 and here my concern is mainly with the Church of England \u2013 is one of the few public domains where this development has been only grudgingly accepted, and in some quarters vehemently opposed. In recent years, while society has moved towards acceptance, the church has arguably moved in the opposite direction.</p> <p>When the archbishop of Canterbury <a href=\"http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/pages/george-carey-103rd-archbishop-of-canterbury.html\" title=\"\">George Carey</a> was succeeded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rowan-williams\" title=\"\">Rowan Williams</a> in 2002, most expected a change of approach, not least since Williams himself had endorsed an ethical framework for gay relationships and personally campaigned against the culture of lying about homosexuality that obtains in the church. Tragically, he changed his public position as soon as he reached the throne of St Augustine. Since then the church's line on homosexuality has continued to harden. The CofE has refused to countenance any form of official liturgical recognition for civil partnerships; has sought special exemptions from human rights and equalities legislation in order to continue discriminating against openly gay clergy or gay employees; has repeatedly restated its condemnation of all sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage; and has formally debarred even celibate gay clergy from becoming bishops.</p> <p>Most recently, the bishops of the CofE have set themselves against government proposals to extend civil marriage to include same-sex couples. Their opposition is above all a public and political stance which is intended to maintain ecclesiastical unity, particularly within the Anglican communion. About half the world's Anglicans are African, and the majority of them are in violently homophobic countries whose churches back harsh punishments against homosexuals, right up to the death penalty.</p> <p>These are the Anglican provinces which the current policy is seeking to appease and keep on board, while the American and Canadian Anglican churches that now openly bless gay unions and consecrate gay bishops are condemned for daring to treat gay&#xa0;people equally.</p> <p>This policy may be institutionally expedient, but it is morally contemptible. Worst of all, by appeasing their persecutors it betrays the truly heroic gay Christians of Africa who stand up for&#xa0;justice and truth at risk of their lives.&#xa0;For the mission of the CoE the present policy is a disaster.</p> <p>Superficially there is little difference between civil partnership and marriage, as both rest on a similar covenant promise of permanent and exclusive commitment between two people. Popular instinct agrees: civil partnership is already widely referred to as marriage, and the partnership ceremony as a \"wedding\".</p> <p>However, the official distinction of terms signifies and helps perpetuate a distinction in status: if marriage is the gold standard, civil partnership, though analogous to marriage, will always be seen as something less.</p> <p>Theologically it is crucial that the relationship rests on the same sacramental understanding of marriage as reflecting God's covenanted love for us. Gay monogamy needs to be called marriage officially, as it already is instinctively and unofficially by many people, not simply because it must be seen to be equal, but because it must be seen to be equally holy, equally a gift and vocation of God to those who are called to it.</p> <p>Here is a prediction. When civil gay marriage becomes possible the church will initially continue to refuse to accept&#xa0;it, but will call for the continued availability of civil partnerships so that&#xa0;it can offer gay people a second best while reserving the term marriage for heterosexuals.</p> <p>In statements opposing gay marriage, the church's official spokesmen have already begun to praise the benefits of civil partnership, having conveniently forgotten that the civil partnership legislation only passed despite opposition&#xa0;from most bishops in the House of Lords.</p> <p>Civil partners will no doubt soon be offered a service of \"dedication\" of the same sort that divorced heterosexuals used to be offered when a full church marriage was denied to them.</p> <p>Already the demand for such a liturgy is growing among clergy, who are embarrassed by having to withhold the church's official support from so many of their own flock who are in civil partnerships. It will take a long time for the church&#xa0;to come round to solemnising same-sex marriage. But it will. The question is only how long it will take, and how much more damage we shall have to suffer on the way. The sadness is that the church will, yet again, only get there reluctantly, following the state, and will finally realise much too late that the impulse which brought this about was truly God's impulse, even though it had to begin outside the church. As with the equality of women, as with the emancipation of slaves, the thing which at first was supposed to be incompatible with scripture and tradition will finally be seen to be demanded by the heart of the Christian gospel itself. That is how it so often has been; but how bizarre that so few see it in advance.</p> <p>As Jim Cotter wrote 20 years ago: \"There are four stages in the church's response to any challenge to its tradition. First, it pretends the challenge isn't there. Secondly it opposes it vehemently. Thirdly, it starts to admit extenuations and exceptions. Finally it says: 'That's what we really thought all along'.\"</p>",
  "<p>You would have thought it would be ringed in red on the Downing Street calendar: '12 August, Olympics closing ceremony, make announcement placing sport at heart of health/education policy to capitalise on Games feelgood factor'.</p> <p>But either David Cameron was too busy enjoying the sport in his Team GB polo shirt or he simply forgot. Maybe the last minute panic to plug gaps in Olympic security was a distraction. Or perhaps he never intended to use the Games to do so in the first place.</p> <p>Either way, there is a certain irony in the fact that a big hole in the coalition's sports policy has been exposed by the triumph of London's Games and the heroic performances of British athletes.</p> <p>When London won the right to host the Games in 2005 in Singapore, under the Labour government, those at the heart of the project proclaimed it was a once-in-a-generation corrective: an opportunity to place sport at the heart of health, education and social policy; to knit together a coherent plan so the \u00a39.3bn cost of the Games would catalyse the estimated \u00a31bn investment in sport, across elite funding, schools, the grassroots and local authorities; to cut down on duplication and bureaucracy; and to give sport a role at the heart of government rather than considering it a sideshow.</p> <p>That didn't happen for the rest of Labour's tenure, although huge investment in school sport began to pay dividends and there was some (but not enough) progress in directing a proportion of the health budget to prevention rather than cure. And it certainly hasn't happened under the coalition, largely because the education secretary, Michael Gove, saw fit to dismantle a hugely effective school sports network on ideological grounds.</p> <p>The School Sports Partnerships hobble on in reduced form, having had their funding slashed from \u00a3162m to \u00a365m, but even that reduced funding runs out next year. Just as worryingly, the money to release specialist PE teachers to work in primary schools is also due to run out in the next academic year.</p> <p>While the government has promised to continue funding the elite performance system that led to an avalanche of medals \u2013 not a difficult call in the wake of a record medal haul in return for \u00a380m extra over two years \u2013 and there is at least a vaguely coherent plan in place for the grassroots (albeit with no increase in funding or guarantee it will work), the incoherence of the government's policy on school sport undermines that progress.</p> <p>Sir Keith Mills, who played an instrumental role in winning the Games for London and delivered the successful International Inspiration overseas legacy programme, has called for a wholesale rethink of sports administration and a new national plan that is backed at the highest levels of government \u2013 one that can't be unpicked by future ministers.</p> <p>And Lord Coe, the hero of the hour after helming a hugely successful Games, has called for a wide-ranging debate that recognises the need for a cross-party, cross-departmental long-term plan. The government would do well to listen to them.</p> <p>Instead, we have had Cameron's ill-advised broadside against \"Indian dancing\", and a return to the tired debate of competitive sport versus exercise. It is a red herring because both have their place; instilling in children a love of exercise for its own sake and allowing them to get the most out of organised sport are entirely compatible.</p> <p>But both need time, money and expertise at both primary and secondary level. While the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is busy investing in a new strategy to stop 14 to 25 year olds dropping out of sport, the Department for Education is undermining the chances of them getting into it in the first place.</p> <p>Sports minister Hugh Robertson, who has spent eight years either in the role or its shadow, warned of the complexity of the debate and said it was no time for kneejerk reactions or policy on the hoof.</p> <p>\"It is deeply unhelpful. To see the school sport debate simply as a question of competitive sport versus participation is an over-simplification. There are a number of ingredients in this pile: the number of PE teachers and what they do, the role of after school clubs, the role of school club links, primary provision and all the rest of it. It's a complicated, bigger picture,\" he said on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"I have been tearing my hair out for the last three or four days because the terms in which this debate has been conducted have not been helpful to finding a solution. The last thing we want is a school sport initiative. We want to have a structured think about how to move forward.\"</p> <p>Before the Games, culture secretary Jeremy Hunt seemed more concerned with whether there would be enough ponchos to go around if it rained or how to control the crowds expected to pour into central London. After it, he railed against a reporter who asked whether enough was being done to develop a cross-departmental strategy to maximise the Olympic legacy.</p> <p>\"I am absolutely astonished that you even dare to ask that question after the most stunningly successful example of joined-up government that any of us have ever seen, with 19 government departments working incredibly well to put on a wonderful Games,\" he said.</p> <p>He would do well to instead listen to Coe \u2013 who has taken on the unpaid role of \"legacy ambassador\" \u2013 and his own sports minister.</p>",

He told a press conference in the Jordanian capital, Amman, the Syrian army needed to \"take the side of the people\".</p> <p>\"I assure you, from my experience and former position, that the regime is collapsing, spiritually and financially, as it escalates militarily,\" Hijab said. \"It no longer controls more than 30% of Syrian territory.\"</p> <p>Hijab said that while he was prime minister he had been unable to stop the regime using heavy artillery against Syrian cities it considered opposition strongholds. He said he had felt \"pain in my soul\" at the shelling of civilian areas.</p> <p>\"I was powerless to stop the injustice,\" he said.

He wasn't truthful with us. He was a double-faced person,\" Jamil said, arguing that such defections could have a positive impact for the government.</p> <p>\"There's a process of natural selection going on within the regime. It should have started long ago. The regime didn't have the courage to do it, but events have done it. All the corrupt elements within the regime are leaving the ship because they think it's sinking.\"</p> <p>He also hinted that foreign intelligence services had helped Hijab to defect.</p> <p>Opposition figures claim many other leading military and political figures in the regime have swapped sides but remained at their posts, either out of fear of what would happen to their families if they defected, or because they had been asked to stay by the rebels to supply intelligence on the inner workings of Assad's government.</p> <p>Hijab is the highest-ranking defector to date. His flight from Damascus came a month after the defection of a Republican Guard general and former member of Assad's inner circle, Manaf Tlass, and the Syrian ambassador to Baghdad, Nawaf al-Fares.</p> <p>In the past week the head of protocol at the presidential palace, Muhi al-Din Maslaman, has also defected.</p>",
  "<p>Romania's prime minister, Victor Ponta, has said the political crisis that has gripped the country since May, pitting him against the president, is close to a resolution, bringing to an end what he called 20 years of \"lost time\" since the revolution brought down the communist dictatorship.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian during a visit to London, Ponta said that if his coalition's bid to oust President Traian Basescu through a disputed referendum fail failed, he would be prepared to \"cohabitate\" as long as the president stuck to his constitutional role.</p> <p>\"This is maybe the biggest crisis in the last 10 years, but all the institutions, including the constitutional court, the parliament and government have proven solid, and I think the worst part has passed,\" Ponta said. \"After this hot summer, we will go to a normal situation and we will prove all our European commitments will be fulfilled.\"</p> <p>Ponta was speaking as a deeply divided constitutional court debates whether to uphold a 29 July referendum on Basescu's impeachment. More than 80% voted for his removal but the vote was boycotted by Basescu's supporters and the turnout fell below the quorum of 50%. Ponta's coalition has attempted to amend the electoral rolls on which the quorum is calculated, arguing they are out of date.</p> <p>Ponta, Europe's youngest prime minister at 39 years old, adopted emergency decrees to limit the court's powers and remove the quorum requirement from the referendum, replacing the speakers of both houses of parliament and the national ombudsman. He was consequently rebuked by the European Commission and by his opponents for attempting a \"coup\".</p> <p>Ponta rejected the allegation. \"It's very clear the new coalition and the new government has huge popular support,\" the prime minister said. \"For eight years, President Basescu used his powers to politically appoint everyone, even the judges in the constitutional court and the ombudsman. All the positions appointed by Basescus. Right now, we are going back to a balance between all the political forces.\"</p> <p>He complained of \"double standards\" in his treatment by Brussels, arguing that Basescu had never been censured for his own very frequent use of emergency decrees.</p> <p>\"While I took office on 7 May, I was absolutely convinced in good will that we could cohabitate with President Basescu, because he is going to finish his mandate and he cannot run for another term. I'm young enough not to be a rival to Mr Basescu.\"</p> <p>However, Ponta said Basescu, the former captain of an oil tanker, \"could not accept he did not have majority in parliament and he constantly tried to delay the decisions of the government, attack the government. We got to this crisis because it was almost impossible to have a normal cohabitation.\"</p> <p>Ponta pledged that if the constitutional court decided in Basescu's favour, he would be prepared to try cohabitation once more, but he made that once more dependent on the president's own conduct.</p> <p>\"He will go back to his office, and if Mr Basescu only follows his constitutional powers, everything will be fine and perfect,\" Mr Ponta said. \"But Mr Basescu is a very strong personality. He was a former sea captain and in his DNA he has no ability to cooperate with anyone ... He should just exercise his constitutional powers, which are not very wide.\"</p> <p>Basescu was suspended from office last month and is operating out of his campaign headquarters in Bucharest. He said he would not comment on the crisis until the constitutional court has ruled. Monica Macovei, a former justice minister and close supporter of Basescu, said the suspended president was ready for a reconciliation with Ponta.</p> <p>But Macovei added: \"I don't think Ponta is the problem.\" She said Ponta was under pressure from his coalition partner and acting president, Crin Antonescu, to prevent Basescu returning to office. She argued the real goal of Basescu's opponents was to dismantle the office of the anti-corruption prosecutors.</p> <p>Laura Stefan, an anti-corruption expert at the Expert Forum thinktank in Bucharest, agreed.</p> <p>\"This unrest is generated by a transformation, the modernisation of Romania and introduction of rule of law. Powerful people never went to jail, but that is ending. So, of course, they are going to put up a fight. It's the worst fight since the revolution.\"</p> <p>Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a Romanian political scientist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, said: \"It is true that Basescu did a lot of things that the media and Brussels ignored. He said he wouldn't appoint Ponta and his coalition no matter what the outcome of elections. He believed the constitution was vague enough he could bend it.\"</p> <p>However, she added: \"This new coalition has done things that even Basescu did not, suspending the ombudsman and trying to change the electoral lists after the referendum.\"</p> <p>Ponta argued that his actions are justified by the popular support behind him and were necessary to break a system of centralised powerful inherited from the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown in a popular revolution and executed on Christmas Day 1989.</p> <p>\"This is negative for a young Romanian because it means we have lost this 20 years because many people feel the regimes are very much the same. We have televisions, we have internet, but power is the same because Mr Basescu ... kept everything under his grip, the parliament, government, the intelligence services, so that is why people are so enthusiastic about getting rid of him. But to be very honest, we have lost a lot of time and energy in the last 20 years and that is why I hope something has radically changed in this hot summer.\"</p>",
  "<p>The world's third-biggest platinum producer has shut down its South African operations after violent clashes left at least nine people dead at its principal mine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lonmin.com\" title=\"\">Lonmin's</a> shares dropped almost 5% in London and 4% in Johannesburg as production ceased due to a turf war between rival trade unions.</p> <p>Protests at the Marikana mine, 60 miles north-west of Johannesburg, began last week when workers walked out seeking a pay increase to 12,500 rand (\u00a3976) a month. <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-08-14-lonmins-killing-fields\" title=\"\">The trouble intensified over the weekend</a>, driven by a wider feud between two unions.</p> <p>Two policemen died in a machete attack by a mob near the mine; two security guards were hacked to death and a union said one of its members was killed while trying to report for duty. The body of a middle-aged man who had been bludgeoned to death could be seen in the area on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, as several thousand miners held another protest over working conditions.</p> <p>Lonmin executives said all its shafts across the South African platinum belt, which account for 12% of global supply, were closed to all but essential services, such as ventilation. <a href=\"http://www.kitco.com/charts/liveplatinum.html\" title=\"\">Although the price of platinum has fallen steeply in the past six months</a>, the spot price rose 2% on Tuesday in the wake of the violence.</p> <p>Barnard Mokwena, Lonmin's executive vice-president, said: \"Until the place is safe we don't want to talk about production.\"</p> <p>South Africa accounts for about three-quarters of the world's platinum, which is used to make catalytic converters in cars. It has one of the most unionised workforces in the world and has recently seen a rise in inter-union violence at mines.</p> <p>The flare-up at Lonmin, the deadliest so far, pitches the well-established National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the upstart militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).</p> <p>On Tuesday, hundreds of police officers, including mounted units and armoured vehicles, descended on Marikana. Police helicopters flew overhead as officers set up control checkpoints and laid down barbed wire. Some miners attacked journalists, hitting their cars with sticks and pipes.</p> <p>London-based Lonmin says 96% of its production comes from Marikana. The platinum sector is grappling with declining world prices for the precious metal and a surge in union militancy in South Africa.</p> <p>Complaints that the NUM, which remains a crucial supporter of the governing African National Congress (ANC), is not defending the interests of its rank and file have left it exposed to a challenge.</p> <p>The AMCU denies allegations of bullying tactics and claims the NUM is no longer effectively representing the interests of miners. Lonmin executives said AMCU now had 21% of the company's 28,000 South African workforce as members.</p> <p>At least three people were killed in a similar round of labour violence in January that led to a six-week closure of the world's biggest platinum mine, run by Impala Platinum. Aquarius Platinum briefly shut one of its shafts recently after an attack by unidentified assailants that left three dead and at least 20 injured.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cosatu.org.za\" title=\"\">Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu)</a>, which supports the NUM, claimed miners were victims of divide-and-rule tactics. Spokesman Phindile Kunene said on Tuesday: \"The federation believes that violence is in this case used as a political strategy to intimidate workers into making political choices about their association.</p> <p>\"It is no coincidence that similar incidents of violence engulfed Implats in Rustenburg and that the common factor in both cases is a splinter union which is hell-bent to utilise violence to further its political aims.\"</p> <p>Kunene added: \"The federation appeals to workers to observe maximum discipline and unity in the face of a political strategy geared towards dividing them and weakening their position in relation to mine bosses and capitalists.\"</p> <p>Lonmin officials did not say exactly how much production had been lost as a result of the latest unrest. The shutdown makes it likely that Lonmin will fall short of its target of 750,000 ounces of platinum this year.</p> <p>South Africa remains a major producer of platinum, coal and gold, but the industry has been hit by decades of under-investment. A <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-05-nationalisation-to-and-fro-damages-the-economy\" title=\"\">debate over nationalisation</a> that refuses to diehas created uncertainty and spooked potential investors.</p> <p>Tom Wilson, head of strategic advisory services at <a href=\"http://www.africapractice.com\" title=\"\">africapractice</a>, said: \"This incident feeds into a wider social frustration in South Africa about the government's failure to deliver on promises and shake off the effects of the financial crisis. We haven't seen the incomes and salaries that were expected.</p> <p>\"While some of the union militancy reflects this grassroots discontent, there's also a high level of frustration among union leaders that they haven't been able to exert as much influence on the government as they thought.\"</p>",
  "<p>After several major games industry events, EA Sports is <em>still</em> managing to reveal new facets of its forthcoming Fifa 13 title. During the publisher's pre-Gamescom press briefing on Tuesday, producer Dave Rutter unveiled the title's new Match Day feature, which will link the in-game action ever more closely to the real-life season, whichever major league you follow. </p> <p>Now, elements such as injuries, suspensions and team form will all be taken from the actual sport on a daily basis and fed into your Fifa matches \u2013 presumably if the player selects this option \u2013 affecting your approach to team selection and tactics. While this sort of functionality was previously restricted to the paid-for Live Season mode, it seems to be an integral part of the Fifa experience this time round.</p> <p>On top of this, real-life incidences and trivia will make their way into the commentary, so Martin Tyler and Alan Smith will, for example, mention how important a particular player has been during the season, with stats appearing on screen. The game will also show your real-life favourite side's next four fixtures on the menu, so you can choose to play them in synchronicity with the actual season. </p> <p>During the onstage demo, Rutter showed the Match Day mode working via a recreation of last season's Man City vs QPR and Man Utd vs Sunderland matches, cutting between the two to show the commentary reacting to events in the other game. It's not clear how this will be replicated in playable form within Fifa 13 though. </p> <p>EA Sports also announced updates to the popular Ultimate Team mode, with a tutorial element for newcomers, as well as Team of the Week feature and weekly challenges based on the real season. Meanwhile, a new Fifa Seasons mode will augment the old head-to-head seasons, offering revised two vs two competitive and co-op options. </p> <p>It's interesting stuff for committed fans of the series, adding to an already intriguing feature-set, including much smarter attacking AI, more controlled dribbling and a bunch of fresh modes including Skill Games, which will seek to teach you the key shooting, passing and set piece skills of the game. </p> <p>Fifa 13 is out on 25 September in North America and 28 September in Europe. EA will also be releasing a demo on Xbox and PlayStation 3 on 11 September.</p>",
  "<p>In the blink of an eye the London 2012 Olympic Games are over, leaving us with fantastic memories, amazing athletic performances and a legacy to inspire a generation through sport. For the global anti-doping community this means a legacy of clean sport, where tomorrow's athletes believe in striving to be the best they can without the use of performance-enhancing substances.</p> <p>London 2012 has taught us many things, not least confirming the public's suspicions that some athletes dope. The World Anti-Doping Agency reported that more than 100 potential Olympians were stopped from competing at the Games because of doping, and the International Olympic Committee announced a number of positive tests during the course of the Games. This is good news for clean athletes around the world.</p> <p>However, the pressure on today's athletes, coaches and indeed nations continues to increase and the whole sporting community needs to understand this and manage the need to \"win at all costs\". Working closely with law enforcement agencies, we are well aware of the availability of performance enhancing substances to athletes. Combine this with the weakness of human nature and it is easy to see how people are tempted to risk everything for the sake of success.</p> <p>Proactive education programmes and strong deterrence messaging, rolled out on a global scale, have played an important part in preventing dopers from reaching the podium at these Games. Equally we have seen a much more focused testing effort to make our tests really count. Using intelligence has proved successful in sharpening our collective focus and should be recognised as the way in which we all must work in the future. But tackling doping in sport starts with prevention, not tests, and we are extremely fortunate in the UK to have had the support of government, Locog, GlaxoSmithKline and King's College London, who have all contributed in ensuring every athlete understood that doping would not be tolerated at these Games.</p> <p>However, performance enhancement is not a problem exclusive to elite sport. The growth of online steroid sales corresponds to a worrying increase in the number of young people seeking to enhance their image through the use of such substances. By working closely with the police and UK Border Agency, we have a better grasp on the scale of this problem and it is clear this needs addressing from beyond the realms of just sport.</p> <p>Collaboration is essential to our success in tackling doping and it has been a huge achievement for our own athletes and sports to have shown such commitment to clean sport. Their success in the medal table mirrors their dedication to our anti-doping programmes. The challenge is to ensure that our next generation of champions continues to have the same attitude.</p> <p><em>Andy Parkinson is chief executive of UK Anti-Doping</em></p>",
  "<p>Whitehall's women leaders are much in demand. Dame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/13/national-trust-helen-ghosh-director-general\" title=\"\">Helen Ghosh has been lured from her berth at the top of the&#xa0;Home Office by the prospect of running the National Trust</a>.

Others have been moved to cover vacancies \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2011/dec/09/lin-homer-top-job-hmrc\" title=\"\">Lin Homer was plucked from Transport</a> as Whitehall's best manager to take over HMRC when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/08/dame-lesley-strathie-obituary\" title=\"\">Dame Lesley Strathie tragically died</a>.</p> <p>But the end result of the moves and departures we have seen since Gus O'Donnell proudly claimed an equal balance of men and women running Whitehall departments had been achieved is that Whitehall is reverting to stereotype, with men back in the clear majority.</p> <p>This pattern ought to concern the new leadership of the civil service. While Gus was clear in his determination to have a civil service leadership that looked more like its workforce (which is more than half female), the new knights at the top \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/new-head-of-the-civil-service-and-cabinet-secretary/welcome-letter\" title=\"\">Sir Bob Kerslake and Sir Jeremy Heywood</a> \u2013 have been highly conventional in their appointments. Philip Rutnam \u2013 with a background in the Treasury and more recently the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.roadsafetygb.org.uk/news/2100.html\" title=\"\">took over at Transport</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/chris-wormald/\" title=\"\">Chris Wormald moved back to Education</a> from the Cabinet Office. Ursula Brennan \u2013 a bold appointment to Defence two years ago \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jun/13/ursula-brennan-permanent-secretary-ministry-justice\" title=\"\">was moved early to cover the vacancy at Justice</a>. That in turn was created by the departure of the only ethnic minority permanent secretary, <a href=\"http://www.ebrd.com/pages/news/press/2012/120703.shtml\" title=\"\">Suma Chakrabarti, to head the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a>.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office response is that there are women coming through the pipeline \u2013 though Gus used to say that one of his concerns was that the progress at the top was not underpinned by similar progress lower down. But&#xa0;recent appointments suggest that pipeline is not strong enough.</p> <p>Of course women are not the only category to have been historically under-represented in the top echelons of Whitehall. The track record on ethnic minorities, on people with scientific as opposed to social science or arts backgrounds, with substantial private as opposed to public sector experience, is all pretty poor too. Diversity does not end by substituting Oxbridge woman for Oxbridge man. But Whitehall needs to&#xa0;draw on and encourage as wide a talent pool as possible \u2013 and to be seen&#xa0;to be doing so.</p> <p>So what next? There are four appointments up for grabs \u2013 at Defence, Home Office, <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Energy and Climate Change</a> and <a href=\"http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Wales</a> \u2013 all of which, three months ago, were held by women. Each will be individually made on merit. But if the best person for each of those jobs just happens to be a white man, those women and ethnic minorities will take the message and decide to look elsewhere, where their talents will be&#xa0;better appreciated.</p> <p>What to do? The first and most important move is to make sure that good candidates from a range of backgrounds are encouraged to apply for those jobs. The second is to make sure they are managed with an eye on the overall picture. But third is to have a positive plan to develop and support future talent \u2013 so that the next time Whitehall can claim some moves toward real equality, they can be made to last.</p> <p>Those signals matter. When I joined the Treasury, more than 30 years ago, there were three women at director level. When I left, 19 years later, there were three women at director level. Women were promoted, but with the one exception of the exceptional <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/nov/22/money.interviews\" title=\"\">Rachel Lomax</a>, they never got promoted in the Treasury. It wasn't until last January that the Treasury had its next woman policy DG after Rachel \u2013 Sharon White. The signal that the Treasury gave throughout my career was that women did not make it into senior management \u2013 and that has taken a long time to undo. The rest of the civil service must not fall into the same trap.</p>",
  "<p>Inter-generational Twitter feuds, alleged abductions and the direst allegations of false imprisonment of an elderly parent; world-famous siblings embroiled in protracted legal battles that recall Jarndyce and Jarndyce; and at the centre of it all, at the eye of a ghastly familial hurricane, lies a musical legend \u2013 the foremost musical legend of the past 40 years \u2013 who at his death had accumulated debts nearing half a billion dollars but who now, after three years as a corpse, and thanks to astute management of his estate and back catalogue, will soon once more be awash in accountants' black ink.</p> <p>Even in his grave, Michael Jackson lies uneasy, as his survivors collectively do as much to dishonour his name as the overzealous Santa Barbara police department twice did with its controversial failed child-molestation trials in 1993 and 2003. We are a very long way from Gary, Indiana, from Hitsville USA and from Motown's Sound of Young America. It makes you want to cry out: \"Stop! In the name of love.\"</p> <p>On one side of this toxic contretemps are the Jackson family matriarch, 82-year-old Katherine Jackson \u2013 the one truly dependable and loving person in MJ's life \u2013 and Michael's three children, Paris, Prince and Blanket, who together are the King of Pop's four principal legatees (along with a number of MJ's favourite charities, which get about one fifth of the estate annually). Michael made a point of excluding his siblings and his abusive father-manager, Joseph, from his will. This did not sit well with some of those on the other side of the dispute \u2013 Jermaine, Rebbie, Randy, Tito and, latterly, Janet, but not LaToya, Marlon or Jackie. Many of them had been receiving allowances from their superstar brother for years \u2013 all of which stopped at his death.</p> <p>Several of the aggrieved have sworn that Michael's will could not have been signed in Los Angeles on the date the document bears since, they argued, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/michael-jacksons-will-siblings-questions-validity_n_1728514.html\" title=\"\">their late brother was in New York on that day</a>. Thus, they said, Michael Jackson died intestate. In the state of California this means that the deceased's assets are portioned out by the state, not by the family's lawyers, with these going first to children, then to parents, then to siblings, depending on which of them survives the deceased. Such a situation can become the focus of multiple lawsuits, frivolous or otherwise, much more easily than can a well-managed, properly willed estate.</p> <p>This slender claim has been the basis for a family lawsuit (backed for a while even by Katherine) that was thrown out by first the Los Angeles superior court, then the California court of appeals and finally the California supreme court in the years since Jackson died. Why has the issue resurfaced now, and done so far more noisily than it did&#xa0;at the time of the comparatively low-visibility court cases?</p> <p>The focus of the recent disputes has been the team managing the Jackson estate, legendary entertainment lawyer John Branca and Jackson's friend, lawyer John McClain. Both were appointed by Michael as his executors well before his death, and he could scarcely have made a wiser choice. They have done a sterling job of turning Jackson's estate into a functioning money-spinner once again, all under the consistently approving eye of California superior court judge Mitchell Beckloff. Now that Jackson isn't buying up department stores' complete inventories of furniture, renting out entire hotel floors, or taking ruinously expensive narcotic safaris to the outer reaches of the Physicians' Desk Reference, expenditures have fallen off considerably. McClain and Branca meanwhile \u2013 two of the sharpest lawyers in modern entertainment, whose client base includes half of the Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame \u2013 made a series of fantastically remunerative deals and licensing arrangements that have piloted the stricken estate from developing world debtor nation status to something approaching solvency.</p> <p>And the money will not stop pouring in over the years to come. Jackson sold 35m albums in the 12 months after his death \u2013 as a wise man said, death really&#xa0;is a great career move \u2013 while the rehearsal film about preparations for the This Is It tour made $260m (\u00a3166m) worldwide during a limited two-week release. Jackson's executors cut a lucrative deal allowing Pepsi to associate itself with the 25th anniversary reissue of the Bad album, and licensed the Jackson catalogue to Cirque de Soleil for its Immortal show, which has toured nationwide in the US and packed them&#xa0;in steadily at its home base in Las Vegas. These big moves and others, including album sales and the judicious exploitation of the Jackson-owned Beatles publishing rights, took <a href=\"http://idolator.com/6724752/michael-jackson-estate-paid-back-most-of-his-500-million-debt\" title=\"\">the asset value of the estate from minus $500m to minus $25m in less than three years</a>. It will only grow and grow. This is a Sinatra-sized musical legacy, at least in&#xa0;terms of cash, that will pay off for decades to come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789298\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/14/1344959004334/Katherine-Jackson-with-so-010.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Jackson with some of her family, 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Announcing the Michael Forever tribute concert in 2011: Katherine Jackson with children LaToya, Tito, Jackie and Marlon.

Their particular issue with Branca and McClain concerns the 10% they earn from the estate in their role as executors. That's a pretty standard fee for managing a large estate, but that didn't stop siblings Randy, Jermaine, Tito, Janet and Rebbie from writing to&#xa0;the executors last month and demanding their resignations. Never mind a court ruling that the period to challenge the will had expired; they claimed that it remained \"fake, flawed, and fraudulent\", and that their brother had \"despised\" the executors while he was alive. Brother Randy later added a more startling allegation, claiming that \"anyone who stands up to the executors is denied access to my mother\".</p> <p>Which makes the <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2012/07/22/katherine-jackson-missing/\" title=\"\">disappearance</a> \u2013 if that's what it was \u2013 of Katherine Jackson only days later all the more intriguing. It also brought the next generation of Jacksons, the children with no memory of Gary, Indiana, or Motown, into the picture. They are teenagers, so social media is their go-to avenue of communication, which troubles the older members of the scandal-prone, tabloid-catnip family. Jackson's daughter Paris \u2013 the one with the Village of the Damned eyes \u2013 stepped up as her generation's chatty, flying-thumbed representative in the feud. On 21 July, she tweeted: \"yes, my grandmother is missing. i haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now.\" And: \"8 days and counting. something is really off, this isn't like her at all. I wanna talk&#xa0;directly to my grandmother!!\" And finally: \"9 days and counting \u2026 so help me god I will make whoever did this&#xa0;pay.\"</p> <p>The next day, several of Jackson's siblings showed up at the gated community in Los Angeles where Katherine lives with the children. The LAPD arrived on the&#xa0;scene after a call about a scuffle in&#xa0;which the elder siblings, Janet, Jermaine and Randy, allegedly tried to confiscate the mobiles of the increasingly talkative teenagers. Randy and Jermaine seem to have come to blows with Trent Jackson, a&#xa0;cousin who works for their mother, in&#xa0;a scene that one anonymous witness <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/music/4460736/Jacko-family-bust-up-was-like-bar-brawl-says-family-insider.html\" title=\"\">likened to The Jerry Springer Show</a>. The same day, Katherine was spotted by a photographer in Arizona, evidently very contented and healthy, giving rise to speculation that Jackson's siblings had sent their mother there so as to better control the situation in LA. Instead, they had made it worse. The executors had already moved to have custody of the children signed over temporarily to Tito's son TJ&#xa0;(Tito's children get some support from the MJ&#xa0;will).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789299\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/14/1344958677070/Prince-Paris-and-Blanket--010.jpg\" alt=\"Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson, January 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The children at the centre of the feud: Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson.

Local police interviewed her at her daughter Rebbie's home nearby and found no reason for concern, but LAPD investigators who later turned up to check on her were turned away, as Arizona is outside their jurisdiction.</p> <p>Jermaine issued a statement on behalf of the family, or whichever faction of it he is in: \"No one is being 'blocked' from speaking with Mother. She is merely an 82-year-old woman following doctor's orders to rest-up and de-stress, away from phones and computers. Everyone has been well aware of this within the family, but I would like to reiterate my reassurance to the outside world that Mother is fine. In the meantime, thank you for all&#xa0;your thoughts and concerns.\"</p> <p>What do these confusing titbits and&#xa0;unsourced accounts add up to? The whole story is riddled with contradictions, competing claims and counter-claims, and speculative accounting about other people's money. It is complicated by the fact that the Jackson family and all its tacky and embarrassing scandals can still, three years after Michael's death, drive the worst elements of the tabloid press into an orgasmic feeding frenzy, causing them to rely on paid witnesses and disgruntled, possibly mendacious former employees \u2013 and when they are not at hand, simply to make stuff up. The tabloid narrative on the Jacksons was set in stone decades ago and no one wishes to upset that money-spinning apple cart of rumour, lie and innuendo. So when something with a grain of truth to it rolls around, like this story of which we really know very little that is utterly reliable, that grain of truth has to be painstakingly extruded from a veritable Sargasso Sea of misinformation. You have been warned.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>L'heure espagnole </strong></h2> <p>Clocks of various shapes and sizes stand around Torquemada's shop, striking pleasantly. The muleteer Ramiro comes in to have his watch mended. Torquemada's wife Concepcion enters to remind her husband it is time for him to regulate the municipal clocks. She complains that he has not placed one of the two grandfather clocks in her room, as requested. It's too heavy to move, he responds. He asks Ramiro to await his return while he goes about his business.</p> <p>Concepcion and Ramiro stand looking at one other. She hints about having the clock carried to her room. Nothing easier, says the muscular muleteer. As he takes it upstairs, Gonzalve is heard arriving.</p> <p>Concepcion's lover is a poet who waxes lyrical as they prepare to fling themselves into each other's arms. On his reappearance she thanks Ramiro. To get rid of him again, she asks him to move the other clock upstairs, bringing the first one back. While he goes back upstairs to retrieve the first clock, Concepcion shoves Gonzalve into the second. </p> <p>Suddenly the banker Don Inigo turns up, enquiring after Concepcion's husband. It was he, he admits, who appointed Torquemada to the job of looking after the town's clocks to get him out of the way. He tries to take Concepcion's hand. The return of Ramiro with clock number 1 saves her. Ramiro picks up the second clock (containing Gonzalve) without difficulty. Concepcion is impressed and follows him upstairs. </p> <p>Left alone, Inigo decides he would improve his image as a playful lover by hiding in the remaining clock. As he does so Ramiro reappears, charged by Concepcion with minding the shop. Suddenly she returns, complaining at the upstairs clock's noisy innards. Would Ramiro kindly bring it back down? He instantly obliges.</p> <p>Inigo declares his love to Concepcion. She begins to see his potential. Ramiro returns with the first clock (containing Gonzalve) and offers to take up the second (containing Inigo). Concepcion accepts his suggestion.</p> <p>Opening the first clock, she tries to dismiss Gonzalve, who is reluctant to leave. She deserts him and he retires into his clock as Ramiro returns. He looks around the shop with admiration; if he were not a muleteer, he would like to be a clockmaker. As Concepcion returns, he divines her unhappiness with the second clock, and goes to retrieve it. </p> <p>Left alone, Concepcion expresses dissatisfaction with both her lovers. As Ramiro returns yet again, she appreciates his physical strength. She sends him back to her room \u2013 this time without a clock to carry \u2013 then follows him.</p> <p>Inigo and Gonzalve peep out of their hiding places, shutting themselves back in as Torquemada returns. He apologises for keeping them waiting. Noting their interest in the insides of the two clocks, he insists that they buy them. </p> <p>Ramiro and Concepcion return and all join in the moral: in the pursuit of love, there comes a moment when it's the muleteer's turn.</p> <h2><strong>L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394713806\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2012/8/14/1344940694278/lenfant-et-les-sortileges-008.jpg\" alt=\"l'enfant et les sortileges, Glyndebourne 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teapot (Fran\u00e7ois Piolino) and Chinese Cup (Elodie M\u00e9chain) in L'Enfant et les Sortil\u00e8ges.

She is cross that he has done nothing but spatter the carpet with ink; he responds by putting out his tongue.

He vandalises the painted figures on the wallpaper. </p> <p>As he prepares to fling himself into the Armchair, it hobbles away. Now the room comes alive. As the Child watches, the Armchair joins with the Chair, both demanding their freedom from him. The Grandfather Clock complains at the damage done to him. The Teapot and Chinese Cup threaten revenge and dance off. </p> <p>Feeling cold, the Child approaches the Fire, who tells him that he warms the good but burns the bad. The Child has offended the household gods that protect him. He begins to feel afraid. </p> <p>The wallpaper figures, including the Shepherd and Shepherdess, mourn their destruction. The Child weeps. Out of one of his torn books rises the Princess, complaining that he has wrecked the story she was in; he is too weak to rescue her from her enchanter and she sinks underground. Arithmetic, a little old man, arrives and he and his Numbers bombard the Child with questions.</p> <p>The Tom Cat, emerging from beneath the Armchair, spits at him and joins with the female Cat in drawing the Child into the garden. A Tree groans at the wound the Child inflicted on him the day before. Feeling pity, the Child lays his cheek against it. The garden begins to teem with life. The Dragonfly searches for his mate, whom the Child regretfully admits he caught and pinned to the wall. The Bat tells him he has killed the mother of his children. The Squirrel warns the Frog against the cage the Child will put him in. He realises that the animals love each other, but not him. He calls for his mother.</p> <p>The Animals and Trees unite in a desire for revenge. They throw themselves upon him. A Squirrel is injured. The Child binds his paw with a ribbon.

  "<p>A Labour police commissioner candidate who quit the race last Friday because of a minor offence committed 47 years ago has been reinstated after fresh legal advice.</p> <p>Alan Charles, Labour's candidate in Derbyshire, who has been vice-chairman of the county's police authority for the past three years, is to return to the campaign trail after a new legal opinion that the conditional discharge he received at the age of 14 in 1965 did not amount to a conviction.</p> <p>Charles, who has served as a councillor for more than 20 years believed a stringent rule that any past convictions, including those committed as a juvenile, which carry a sentence of imprisonment for those over 18 is enough to stop a candidate standing for the job of police and crime commissioner this November.</p> <p>Charles, who declared the offence, which he committed in 1965, to the Derbyshire police when he was vetted three years ago, said there was not even a police record of the incident.</p> <p>\"Due to a distinct lack of clarity from the Home Office we have sought further legal advice on behalf of Alan Charles, and it has become clear that he is eligible to become a police and crime commissioner candidate,\" said an East Midlands Labour party spokesperson.</p> <p>\"The Labour party has written to the Home Office calling for them to urgently provide more information and much greater clarity on the interpretation for all involved in these elections.\"</p> <p>There is however no such reprieve for first casualty of this stringent criminal record test in the paving legislation for the elections this November. That was Bob Ashford, Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset, who had to stand down last Wednesday because of a minor offence he committed when he was 13 in 1966. He was fined \u00a35 for trespassing on the railway.</p> <p>The news followed a warning from the police minister, Nick Herbert, that a free mailshot for all voters in November's first elections for police and crime commissioners will cost \u00a325m-\u00a330m.</p> <p>His warning came in response to a protest by a group of independent candidates that the rules on the elections are biased in favour of the political parties.</p> <p>The protest at Downing Street and parliament on Tuesday has been organised by Ann Barnes, the chair of the Kent police authority for the past six years, and other independent candidates from Thames Valley and Sussex, who say the lack of a traditional free mailshot to every voter will make it difficult for them.</p> <p>\"It's quite perverse because we have the prime minister, the policing minister and the home secretary on record saying they want highly visible, strongly credible independent candidates to stand,\" said Barnes, who is to hand in a protest letter to Downing Street.</p> <p>\"And yet they will not give them the one thing&#xa0;\u2026 that will help them get their message out to voters. It's perverse, it's undemocratic and it's really unjust.\"</p> <p>She said that without a state-funded mailshot those representing political parties had an unfair advantage because they had more money and resources to run their campaigns.</p> <p>So far, 41 independent candidates have declared their intention to stand in 16 of the 41 police force areas in England and Wales. They include eight candidates from the English Democrats and the English Defence League, as well as former magistrates and police officers.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission warned in March that, as a result of the government's decision, up to 7 million people who did not use the internet could be disadvantaged.</p> <p>The former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, who is standing as a candidate in Hull, described the move as scandalous.</p> <p>\"In my area of Humberside that will mean 170,000 people, mostly elderly, will be denied their democratic right to information on the candidates,\" he told the Lords.</p> <p>But the police minister told the BBC there would be a single national website with the details of every candidate's election address. Those who wanted to be sent a printed copy would be able to ring a helpline to request it.</p> <p>Herbert said he anticipated that several hundreds of thousands of voters would apply for printed copies of the election addresses but the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of posting them to every voter could not be justified \"in the current climate\".</p> <p>He said the success or failure of independent candidates would not turn on whether or not they had a free mailshot but on their use of the media, including new media, to capture local attention.</p> <p>The police minister repeatedly refused to set a benchmark for the turnout for the elections, which critics fear will be hit by voter apathy and poor quality candidates.</p>",

Listen here<br></a><br><strong>Hometown:</strong> South London.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Sam Howard (vocals, keyboards).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Halls is the solo project of 21-year-old south London musician Sam Howard, whose work is distinctive but amorphous-ambiguous enough to bear comparison with dubstep producers as well as ambient, soundtrack and neo-classical composers. And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/8ed2e0b3-aa4c-4e13-bec3-dc7393ed4d6b\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a>. Howard's high-flying voice \u2013 falsetto? tenor? \u2013 is quite Yorke-like and, like Yorke, he has a penchant for eerie atmospherica and glitchy electronica, set in a lugubrious and cavernously spacious context. And boy does he like an ecclesiastical mood, does Howard, although amusingly he says he's keen to avoid any religious connotations, despite the fact that at least some of the music on his debut album Ark was recorded in churches with choirs. We say amusingly because Ark couldn't sound more holy if it had comprised a series of Burial-blessed hymns sung by the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8373862.stm\" title=\"\">St Winifred's school choir</a> in St Paul's Cathedral.</p> <p>Apparently, Howard is not religious. Well, excuse us for assuming that he was. The tone throughout Ark is solemn verging on the sepulchral, and it all feels as though it was written in the aftermath of some terrible upset or shock, the tremors from which have led him to take recourse in the healing, reassuring power of the spiritual and divine. This is all guesswork, of course, and Howard is keeping shtoom on the subject. He merely said recently that his deeply affecting songs were written a couple of years ago during a summer in which he \"stayed in the house for pretty much the whole time \u2013 I couldn't really leave\", adding: \"The reason I sat down and decided to make some music [was] so that I had some sort of distraction ... Halls was a way of calming me down ... if anything it made me worse once I'd finished writing a song. I don't really want to talk about the specifics of what was going on...\"</p> <p>Howard does agree that his music has a cinematic quality, and that if it was used in a movie it would be \"the soundtrack [to] some bleak film\". The titles alone suggest that, no, this wouldn't quite suit the sequel to Seth MacFarlane's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>. There's one called Roses for the Dead, one called Shadow of the Colossus, and another called Funeral. And as for Holy Communion and Winter Prayer \u2013 how silly of people to make religious connections. Opener I features a church organ and is as sombre as a requiem. There's one called Reverie, but it isn't very dreamy \u2013 it's more like a dance of the dead. \"I can't hardly feel it,\" sings Howard, who hints here and there at the problems he's endured. \"Father, I've gone away,\" he cries poignantly on I'm Not There. It must be difficult to be this intimately acquainted with quiet despair. And yes, these glacial, glitchy symphonies could soundtrack a burial, or indeed any film scene where the protagonist is consumed with sorrow and grief. At times \u2013 particularly Funeral \u2013 it's almost parodic, like Chris Morris doing a spoof of a depressed adolescent: Kevin the Teenager in a particularly sullen temper. But really, this is no laughing matter, this music that matters.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Halls elegantly conjoins the sparseness of electronica/post-dubstep with the soaring heartache of the saddest of troubadours\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.2uptop.com/news/SAM-HOWARD-IN-A-HALL-OF-MIRRORS/\" title=\"\">2 up-top</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Should appeal to a broad church.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Blur the boundary between religious and solemn.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> See a mash-up of Ark and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/67461c8e-d864-3910-9bf4-39e44357aac9\" title=\"\">Parklife</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Ark is released on 15 October by No Pain In Pop.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Thom Yorke, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/c7ee3bc9-780c-42c0-91e9-4cd70ad692d3\" title=\"\">Tim Hecker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/8d1a5451-a106-4cc8-86b7-9905d5f5238a\" title=\"\">Thomas K\u00f6ner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/d03a54bc-6e07-4c04-a8d4-7fbf2bd07a01\" title=\"\">Nils Frahm</a>.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/hallsmusic\" title=\"\">facebook.com/hallsmusic</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Tiger Love.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, it's not what you do, but how you do it that counts. For proof of this, one need look no further than Sleeping Dogs, United Front's love-letter to Hong Kong action movies' late 1980s heyday. Here is a game that sounds like a cocktail of movie tropes and game mechanics that have been reheated and refried so many times that you can practically smell grease on them. But if you're able to stop picking at its component parts and just appreciate Sleeping Dogs as a whole, you'll most likely find that it's one of the most thrilling and consistently enjoyable games of 2012.</p> <p>Sleeping Dogs tells the story of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong bruiser who has just returned to his hometown after a lengthy stint in the US. Things kick off with Wei being thrown in a holding cell for selling narcotics and while there, he bumps into Jackie, a childhood mate who is languishing down the bottom end of the food chain in the local Triads. Wei asks if Jackie can get him some work, and before you know it, Wei's collecting protection money from market stall owners, stealing and selling cars and beating up rival gang members with a tyre iron. What Wei's new Triad mates don't know is that their newfound muscleman is an undercover cop, tasked with bringing down their criminal organisation from within.</p> <p>If the plot set-up in Sleeping Dogs sounds a little tried and tested, then the gaming structure that houses it will strike readers as even more so. To put it bluntly, Sleeping Dogs owes a huge debt of influence to the Grand Theft Auto series. It's set in a huge urban sandbox that the player navigates on foot and in vehicles, it tells a crime story through a series of fetch-quests and, yes, there are a ton of mini-games, side missions, car chases, gun battles and fist fights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731256\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954462813/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while United Front is working with an established gaming rubric and plot elements that are older than the game's age certificate, it infuses the proceedings with an enticing freshness that allows players to ignore their cliched origins.</p> <p>Take, for example, Wei's loyalties and how they're split between his Triad comrades and the police commanders to whom he reports. Sure, this is a plot device that's one part City on Fire and two parts Infernal Affairs, but United Front uses it as a springboard and dives straight to its murky depths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731257\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954780836/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Wei works his way up the Triad ranks, he becomes more valuable as a police asset, but he also becomes attached to the criminals he's essentially trying to bring down. His Triad brethren may be a pack of violent thugs and psychopaths, but they have strong codes about loyalty and family, and they care far more about Wei's well-being than his police commanders. They, for their part, are more concerned with building a case against the Triad bosses, and if that means Wei has to break the law, or put himself in harm's way, so be it. In a way, the taskforce commanders are as callous and calculating as the Triad overlords they're trying to bust.</p> <p>So on the surface, Sleeping Dogs is about a man with divided allegiances, but as the player progresses through the game, United Front digs deeper with its narrative. The taskforce authorities show a disturbing willingness to blur the lines of legality; the regular police find themselves having to use Wei's Triad connections to solve crimes that their commanders aren't concerned with. As Wei advances through the ranks, his former friends become liabilities he has to protect. And the Triad's code of honour is revealed to be little more than a set of manners that the gang leaders are expected to observe as they engage in bloody turf wars, which are later revealed to be part of a more insidious power play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954697130/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every time the player thinks they have the story clocked, United Front peels away another layer that both changes their expectations and ups the dramatic stakes. It's not completely original, but it's effective nonetheless. The fact that all the characters in the game are very well written and superbly voiced doesn't hurt, either. In short, United Front works hard to pull the player into the game's narrative, and it's easy to become invested in Wei's story even before the action starts. It's easily one of game's strongest assets.</p> <p>The game's second trump card is the in-game map of Hong Kong, represented here as a neon-encrusted metropolis where majestic skyscrapers tower over a sprawling hive of illicit activity. Flea markets and illegal fight clubs rub shoulders with chop shops and gang hangouts. Every main road and highway begs to be raced along, and the city's street grid is intercut by a ton of back alleys and side streets.</p> <p>The map is also bursting with activities, mini-games and side-quests for the player to get stuck into; they can bet money on mahjong or cock fights, compete in street brawls for money and test their mettle on the street racing circuit. In one particularly challenging mini-game, players can attack gang members in their hangouts, hack the nearest CCTV camera and then use it to bust local drug dealers. They can also hunt for lock boxes containing cash, shrines that offer health upgrades and a collection of statues they can trade at the local dojo to open up new combat moves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731259\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954633802/Sleeping-Dogs-009.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Story missions and side quests inevitably lead to gun battles, car chases or fist fights and United Front have done a lot of work to make Wei feel and handle like an action movie hero. The hand-to-hand combat system is a two-button affair that owes a debt of inspiration to Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it's loads of fun to use and surprisingly deep. Not only do players have a lengthy list of combos to unlock, they can also use items in Wei's environment to dispatch foes in decidedly grisly fashion \u2013 like wall fans into which they can shove faces or meat hooks on which they can impale torsos.</p> <p>Gun fights handle like they would in a cover-based third-person-shooter, but there's an element of bullet-time tossed in for good measure; when Wei vaults cover, the action slows down and players are able to easily draw a bead on opponents. Driving sections remain fun and fresh due to the fact that the game doesn't penalise players too much for collisions. Players are also able to ram other cars off the road using the X button, or hijack other vehicles by having Wei leap out of his car and onto the roof of a target in a move that'll prompt a knowing smile in anyone who ever played Midway's Wheelman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731260\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954508143/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly everything the player does feeds XP into three meters: Face, Police and Triad. The latter two unlock abilities on two skill trees, such as the ability to hotwire a car without setting off an alarm, or the power to disarm an opponent in one swift combat move. High Face rating allows players to wear sharp suits and drive flash cars, but it also bestows gifts such as a car valet who'll deliver a vehicle for Wei anytime and any place he needs it.</p> <p>So while Sleeping Dogs works from an established palette, it's an absolute blast to play. Like the Uncharted series, the focus here isn't to break new ground for the medium through innovation. Instead, the aim here is to make the player feel like an action hero in a piece of blockbuster entertainment, while remaining fun to play throughout. Sleeping Dogs is not the most original game you'll play all year, but it's easily one of the most enjoyable and it's arguably one of the best.</p>",

Yet this is regarded by many as the most important Jinnah moment of all.</p> <p>For it has become a touchstone for liberals aghast by the state of Pakistan, which they fear is increasingly intolerant of its minorities, including Hindus, Christians and Ahmadis, who regard themselves as a sect of Islam but are legally banned from calling themselves Muslims.</p> <p>\"You may belong to any religion, caste or creed \u2013 that has nothing to do with the business of the state,\" Jinnah told the gathering on 11 August 1947.</p> <p>Murtaza Solangi, director general of Radio Pakistan, said the speech had become a \"dividing line between the forces who want Pakistan to go in a particular direction\".</p> <p>\"Those who want it to be a sectarian or communal or Islamic state don't recognise this speech and never talk about it,\" he said. \"And [for] those who want Pakistan to be an inclusive Muslim state where people are free to practise their faith and not discriminate on basis of religion this is kind of rallying cry.\"</p> <p>Solangi has been on a quest to find a recording of the speech, which even in text form was ignored for decades, particularly during the 1980s when the country's leaders actively sought to create a more Islamic society.</p> <p>While state broadcaster Radio Pakistan has an almost complete library of Jinnah speeches, his call for a secular Pakistan is absent. No one has a copy. Both the BBC and All India Radio were asked to check their archives, but nothing was unearthed.</p> <p>There are near-daily reminders that Pakistan has struggled to live up to Jinnah's ideals. Hindu leaders cite killings, abductions and forced marriages, warning that many Hindus have had enough and are trying to leave the country.</p> <p>Last week, hundreds of Hindu pilgrims who attempted to travel to India were held up at the border after the government feared they would claim asylum. Despite assuring they would not, several crossed the border and promptly announced to Indian reporters their intentions never to return to Pakistan.</p> <p>Solangi said if a copy of Jinnah's speech was ever found and broadcast it would be \"huge\" because in the ongoing struggle about what sort of place Pakistan should be his voice would be \"galvanising\".</p> <p>\"It is not easy to discredit Jinnah, the founder of the country,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/\" title=\"\">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/the-role-of-the-speaker/biography-of-speaker-john-bercow/\" title=\"\">John Bercow</a>, has defended his controversial record by arguing that his changes have got parliament \"off its knees\", and called his critics \"embittered and resentful\".</p> <p>Bercow has attracted many critics during his three years in the role, and in recent months he has particularly upset Conservative colleagues by not forcing the Labour MP Chris Bryant to retract a claim that the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was a \"liar\" \u2013 a term which usually attracts the highest degree of opprobrium in the otherwise boisterous chamber.</p> <p>He also angered the Tory high command by demanding that the prime minister, David Cameron, appear in the house to answer Labour questions about Hunt's handling of a bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to take full control of the broadcaster BSkyB.</p> <p>Bercow's wife, Sally, has also attracted attention for views considered leftwing, and for public appearances such as taking part in the reality TV show Big Brother.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qptc\" title=\"\">Speaking on Tuesday to the BBC's World at One</a> programme, Bercow dismissed media criticism as \"low music hall drivel\".</p> <p>\"I never aspired to be Speaker simply so I can say: 'I'm the Speaker of the House of Commons',\" said Bercow, who has been an MP since 1997.</p> <p>\"I wanted it because I felt that there was a task to be undertaken and that's about strengthening backbench involvement and opportunity in parliament, and helping parliament get off its knees and recognise that it isn't just there as a rubber-stamping operation for the government of the day, and as necessary and appropriate to contradict and expose the government of the day.\"</p> <p>Examples of \"progress\" included increasing the number of questions answered by the PM during the half-hour weekly prime minister's question time and the \"renaissance\" of the urgent question, a device by which MPs can call ministers to the House of Commons to answer questions on an urgent topic \u2013 such as the Hunt affair.</p> <p>\"I was particularly concerned that ministers should be accountable first and foremost to parliament,\" he said.</p> <p>Such events have annoyed some ministers - \"and possibly their diary secretaries\" - said Bercow, but he said it was important not to take sides. \"Their upset, their irritation, their inconvenience cannot be the concern of the Speaker,\" he added.</p> <p>Some people thought he was \"genuine and down to earth\" and others thought he was \"puffed up with his own importance\", said Bercow, suggesting such critics often felt a \"lingering sense of resentment\" over his election.</p> <p>Bercow said that despite reports that Cameron was angered by his decision to call him to answer Labour's urgent question over Hunt, the PM had never said so to his face.</p> <p>\"Much as I have the highest respect for the prime minister&#xa0;\u2026 the prime minister's job is to captain his team, his party, his government; my job is to be the referee,\" added Bercow.</p> <p>Bercow specifically defended his decision not to make Bryant retract his allegation that Hunt was a \"liar\", saying he anticipated such an event might occur, and he took advice from the most senior official of the Commons, the clerk of the house.</p> <p>\"He [the clerk] said to me because we were debating a substantive motion on the conduct of a minister [Hunt], the normal rules about parliamentary language frankly don't apply,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I don't regret ruling as I did because it was uncomfortable and unpopular but correct.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Can I still buy Paralympics tickets?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, there are still tickets available on the <a href=\"http://www.tickets.london2012.com/browse?tab=para\" title=\"Paralympics website\">official website</a>. Currently, all Olympic Park sports sessions have sold out, though Locog is expected to release more tickets next week. It may also release day passes for the Park to satisfy demand. Locog says 2.1m of the 2.5m tickets have sold, meaning another 400,000 should be available.</p> <p>The official London 2012 ticket seller will be releasing tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, but at the time of writing it is only listing expensive tickets (\u00a3250-\u00a3500) for the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as tickets to visit the Orbit sculpture. Users have also reported problems with the website crashing, though Locog said this was a result of increased demand rather than any technical issue.</p> <h2><strong>How will I know when more tickets are released?</strong></h2> <p>Locog has in the past unleashed a flood of tickets early in the morning and some in late evening, but there is no real pattern. It means sports fans may need to make repeated searches on the official London 2012 Paralympics ticket site throughout the day.</p> <p>Some sports fans recommend doing this every minute to give you the best possible chance of bagging tickets, and advise people to be fully signed-in before they start searching to make the purchase process quicker: the faster you do it, the better chance you have of getting tickets.</p> <p>If you're on Twitter you could start following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/2012TicketAlert\" title=\"\">@2012TicketAlert</a>, an unofficial feed set up during the Olympics which runs a check on the official site every three minutes and posts a tweet every time a ticket becomes available. It now has more than 50,000 followers, so if it does tweet expect a stampede to the site. Also, it won't help you get round the problems with the sales site: for instance, when it shows tickets as available even after they have been sold. But if you are lucky, it might help you beat the rush.</p> <h2><strong>Can I transfer tickets to someone else?</strong></h2> <p>Officially, tickets are non-transferable. However, London 2012 terms and conditions state that: \"Providing you as the lead booker are contactable on the day in case of query, a member of your family or a friend may use tickets you can no longer use.\"</p> <h2><strong>I can't go and no one else wants my tickets. Can I return them?</strong></h2> <p>Yes. If you are no longer able to use the tickets you have purchased from London 2012, you can submit them for resale at face value through the <a href=\"http://www.tickets.london2012.com/about_resale.html\" title=\"\">official London 2012 ticket resale programme</a>. As tickets are meant to be non-transferable (see above) you are forbidden from selling or advertising them for sale on the internet, in newspapers or anywhere else other than via the official ticket resale programme. However, it's not guaranteed that your tickets will be resold, so you could still end up out of pocket.</p> <h2><strong>How much do Paralympic tickets cost?</strong></h2> <p>Tickets are cheaper generally than they were for the Olympics, and there are also deals. Locog has introduced \u00a35 ticket prices for children under the age of 16 and people over the age of 60 (as at 29 August 2012). Be warned: if you've got one of these discounted tickets you may be asked by a steward or official to provide photo ID as proof of your age. If you fail to produce this you may be refused entry or asked to pay the full adult price of the ticket.</p> <h2><strong>I've seen tickets for sale through external ticketing organisations. Are they legitimate?</strong></h2> <p>Some are, but many aren't. With demand for Paralympic tickets set to result in the first-ever sold-out Paralympic Games, illegal touts will be looking to cash in. London 2012 has a <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/spectators/tickets/ticket-checker/\" title=\"\">list of unauthorised ticket resellers</a> on its website, which are the ones to avoid. If you want to check a website, visit the same page and type the web address in the box \u2013 if it's authorised, a green box will pop up; if not, a red box will appear.</p> <h2><strong>I live outside the UK. How can I find a legitimate ticket seller?</strong></h2> <p>If you're an EU resident you can book using the same London 2012 ticket site. London 2012 also has lists of authorised international ticket sellers (within and outside the EU) for the Paralympics. For example, <a href=\"https://www.cosport.com/\" title=\"\">Cosport</a> in the US is the authorised Olympic tickets reseller, as are eVenture zone in Thailand and Suseia Event &amp; Travel Group in Belgium.</p>",

Libertarians who borrowed her political ideas but didn't buy her epistemology were \"a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people,\" \"plagiarizers,\" and \"scum.\" Conservatives were far, far worse. \"Futile, impotent and culturally dead,\" conservatives could only \"accelerate this country's uncontested collapse into despair and dictatorship.\" Despite their agreement on capitalism, unlike most conservatives Rand was a forthright atheist who supported abortion rights and opposed the Vietnam War.

His budget proposals are driven not by the demands of America's current fiscal situation, but rather by deeply held convictions about the need to limit government power. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this \u2013 if you believe that \"big\" government destroys personal initiative and strangles the economy, and that the current tax system is morally offensive and economically destructive, then you need to not just tinker with the system, but to remake it. What's wrong is that, so far, Ryan hasn't been honest about the fact that this is what he wants to do \u2013 probably because most voters, including most Republicans, don't actually want to dramatically shrink the government.

The contention that Paul Ryan is as responsible for the failures of the Obama administration as Obama himself is deeply preposterous, of course \u2013 but that doesn't mean the Democratic campaign won't make it.

First, Ryanism reminds the American people that a long-term trend is not the same thing as a law of nature. That the welfare state always has grown does not mean it always must grow. Indeed, a well-designed and well-administered welfare state can, in a welcome sense, grow and shrink at the same time.

They come from everything else. Ryan says that under his budget, everything the federal government does that is not Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security will be cut to less than 3.75 percent of GDP by 2050. That means defense, infrastructure, education, food safety, energy research, national parks, civil service, the FBI \u2013 all of it.

Many were queasy when George Bush cheesily described Jesus as his favourite philosopher, but at least he knew his market. In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness. So how can an American politician, who has described himself as a \"staunch Catholic\" and in what is supposed to be an electorate dominated by Christian values, side with one who so thoroughly rejected all the teachings of Jesus?</p> </blockquote>",

And not that he has ruined the economy; it's more accurate to say that he and the central bankers saved the world. Furthermore, he isn't a socialist or a tyrant bent on destroying America, as various demagogues \u2013 including a number of washed-out Republican presidential hopefuls \u2013 like to tell the teeming mouth-breathers. And, no, he's not a Muslim.</p> <p>Not that there's anything wrong with that.</p> <p>But President Obama is, come to discover \u2013 and forgive the tautology \u2013 a cynical politician. Not for selling out environmental interests for the sake of salvaging jobs, although, well \u2026 And not for soft-pedaling regulation and legal scrutiny of the Wall Street pigs who nearly destroyed us, to the ongoing rage of the grungy 99%. And not even for remaining virtually mute about the horrifying spate of gun violence, lest he antagonize undecided gun nuts.</p> <p>Let's just ascribe that behavior to presidential pragmatism. In the ebb and flow of politics, you can't always get what you want. Obama does, after all, face a Tea Party hostage situation in Congress, where the GOP leadership will pass neither a camera emplacement nor a law.</p> <p>Nonetheless, be not too quick to see the president of the United States as a mere hapless victim of vicious partisan politics. He is also a perpetrator.</p> <p>For the past 10 days, the president's Super Pac \u2013 Priorities USA Action \u2013 has been running a Swiftboat attack on Republican Mitt Romney so grotesque, so dishonest, so debased, as to force you to wonder who this Obama guy is, and whether he has been that guy all along. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/08/10/star_of_obama_super_pacs_cancer_ad_says_bain_offered_him_a_buyout.html\">ad features a former steel worker named Joe Soptic</a>, recounting the death of his wife from cancer, after Soptic lost his health insurance when Romney's Bain Capital shut down the steel mill in 2001.</p> <p>\"I don't think Mitt Romney understands what he's done to peoples' lives,\" Soptic says.</p> <p>What Soptic doesn't say, and what the ad leaves out, is that: a) Romney had left Bain Capital for the Salt Lake City Olympics when the plant was shut down; b) Soptic lost his health insurance, but his wife remained covered at her own job; c) she was not diagnosed with cancer till five years later; d) during which interim she held subsequent jobs and other insurance coverage.</p> <p>Yet, the message is unmistakable: Mitt Romney has blood on his hands.</p> <p>This is repulsive. The <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/team-obama-says-they-dont-story-of-man-who-stars-of-131462.html\">Obama campaign at first claimed</a> to know nothing about Joe Soptic; indeed, Super Pacs \u2013 awash in donations from labor unions, corporations, and the wealthy \u2013 are statutorily prohibited from coordinating with candidates. But nobody believes that firewall exists. And the <a href=\"http://newmediajournal.us/indx.php/item/6402\">campaign was caught in its transparent lie</a>, when someone remembered a Obama 2012 conference call in which Soptic and his sad tale were trotted out by the campaign for the assembled press.</p> <p>Back in 2004, when a political action committee favoring George W Bush unleashed scurrilous ads accusing Democratic candidate John Kerry of cowardice and treason for the very Vietnam episodes that had gotten him decorated for bravery, Democrats howled with outrage at the smear by Swifboat Veterans for Truth. They howled when George HW Bush trotted out the infamous, race-baiting \"Willie Horton\" ad against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. They howled when John McCain tried to link Senator Barack Obama with domestic terrorist William Ayres.</p> <p>And well that they should have. Such tactics are beyond obscene. They are depraved.</p> <p>And so is obliterating inconvenient facts to accuse the presumptive Republican nominee of homicidal neglect.</p> <p>Once again, in theory, what the Priorities USA Action Super Pac does is independent of the campaign, although the funding entity was founded by the president's closest associates from previous campaigns. But never mind that. In the past 10 days, the Obama 2012 campaign itself has had every opportunity to condemn the tactics, to reject the slanderous implication, to entirely disavow the sorry episode and demand that the ad be pulled. Instead, from top to bottom, the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/243271-axelrod-priorities-ad-doesnt-blame-romney-for-womans-death\">campaign has offered mealy-mouthed denials</a>. Likewise, the Democratic National Committee and a legion of partisan capos with long spears and short memories. Suddenly, swiftboating suits them just fine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the patron saint of hope and change has said not a word. It would have been so easy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am Barack Obama and I emphatically disapprove this message.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, nope, mum's the word. And the silence speaks volumes.</p> <p>Look, choose the candidates you prefer. There are manifest differences between them. But do yourself a favor. Dispense with the hero worship. Believing a politician transcends politics is to guarantee disappointment. Depravity turns out to be an equal opportunity employer.</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally stated in error that Soptic's steel mill closed in 1992; this was amended to 2001 (after Romney had left Bain Capital) at 11.40am (ET) on 14 August 2012</p>",

  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>If you happen to have an affinity for 19th-century military tales of derring-do, modern pentathlon might be worth a closer look. To most, this sport seems like a random collection of activities, but to the Mills &amp; Boon enthusiast it encapsulates a romantic legend in which, years ago, a young (and undoubtedly handsome) French cavalry officer ventured behind enemy lines on horseback to deliver a message. To complete his mission, he had to ride, fence, shoot, swim, run and snog a swooning mademoiselle with tongues. For the modern pentathlon, they dropped the last one.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>So there are five separate sports to get involved in here: horse riding, fencing, swimming (200m freestyle), shooting laser guns (YES!) and running 3km. These last two are combined in a thrilling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89034/battle.royale\">Battle Royale</a>-style climax to the day. No \u2013 that's a lie. There's no killing or maiming involved. </p> <p>The best way to begin is with one event, then by signing up for small combined events, working your way up to all five \u2013 for example you could start with a biathlon (run and swim), move on to modern triathlon (swim, run, shoot) or tetrathlon (fence, swim, run, shoot) before tackling your first pentathlon.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>If ever there was an all-rounder of an event, the modern pentathlon is it: there's no muscle group you won't work. Survival is no longer the main point.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>This is not an event for the small-budgeted among you. The running and swimming aspects are inexpensive, but the cost of fencing, shooting and riding can be considerable. Pentathlon in the UK is run regionally \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.pentathlongb.org/pentathlongb/ukstructure.php\">go to this page to locate contacts for yours</a>. Each region organises development training sessions under qualified coaches. At these training sessions you should be able to borrow equipment, with a small charge for maintenance. </p> <p>Most competitors learn to shoot using air pistols. These can be purchased secondhand for around \u00a3100, and to do so you need to be aware of the legislation on carrying and using air weapons. A new air pistol can cost up to \u00a3900. Fencing equipment will cost around \u00a3350. Check with your local club to see if they loan or sell secondhand kit. You don't need your own horse, but you do need to have a riding competency certificate in order to enter competitions.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 7/10</h2> <p>It's basically superhero training.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Jon Austin, chief executive of Pentathlon GB:</strong> \"Modern pentathlon is unique, with athletes tackling a combination of different sports in one day. You don't have to take them all up at once though. Many athletes start by enjoying swimming and running and then add one sport at a time until they can do all five. Thousands of young people take part in our schools biathlon championships each year, where we offer the opportunity to also have a go at shooting and fencing in a safe and fun environment.\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.pentathlongb.org/performance/olympics.php\">pentathlongb.org</a> \u2013 Pentathlon GB (national governing body).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pentathlon-scotland.org/\">pentathlon-scotland.org/</a> \u2013 Pentathlon Scotland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pentathlon.org/\">pentathlon.org/</a> \u2013 the homepage for the Union International de Pentathlon Moderne.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>James Bond films, triathlon.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>BMX, basketball.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Are you a pentathlete?

The hip-hop duo said they may seek financial restitution for the inclusion of \"Juggalos\" on the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment report, published in November.</p> <p>\"We're not attacking the FBI, but they got this wrong,\" <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/insane-clown-posse-says-its-investigating-f-b-i-gang-report/?ref=music\" title=\"\">wrote Violent J, AKA Joseph Bruce</a>.

But the subculture took a bizarre turn last autumn, when the FBI designated the group a \"loosely organised hybrid gang\". Juggalos, the threat assessment report said, were \"of concern to law enforcement\", exhibiting \"gang-like criminal activity\" and threatening communities \"due to the potential for violence, drug use/sales, and their general destructive and violent nature\".</p> <p>With their new campaign, Violent J said, Insane Clown Posse plan \"to do something huge for our fans, and the world\". The band have launched a website, <a href=\"http://juggalosfightback.com\" title=\"\">Juggalos Fight Back</a>, which encourages fans to submit accounts of any \"negative consequence\" they have experienced from officials. \"[The FBI is] trying to kill our band,\" Insane Clown Posse said, \"and we have to fight back.\"</p> <p>The FBI have yet to respond.</p>",
  "<p>Between the South Downs and the seafront, England's southeast has spawned some sterling alternative crime fiction of late, via imprints like Eastbourne's Soul Bay and Brighton's Pulp Press. Now add to that Ruth Ramsden, whose debut encapsulates the full gamut of Sussex weirdness, invoking the Hammer legend Charles Gray in the opening paragraph and finishing with the sort of Fifth of November night that opponents of the region's Bonfire Societies warn you about. Inadvertent private eye JJ is an arty dominatrix, pulled by her corset straps into dangerous intrigue by the murder of a kinky friend and a set of blackmail photographs implicating the local ganglord, subsequently delivered to her door, with the victim's car keys. Why the man was killed and who wants to implicate JJ is what she needs to know. Unwilling to involve the law, JJ turns to her own community at the Pink Parrot fetish club. Mentioning Miss Marple in the press release might be unwise, but aficionados of Christa Faust, Joolz Denby and Grant Morrison \u2013 enjoy.</p>",
  "<p>I was particularly struck by Clive Stafford Smith's comment about the madness of the justice system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/08/clive-stafford-smith-jury-system-insanity\" title=\"\">(Implacable foe of the death penalty, 3 August)</a>. It is something I have pondered, and was brought home to me recently when I was burgled. I came home to a ransacked house and various things stolen, and in no time two detectives and a fingerprint man were busy in my house.</p> <p>Next day a uniformed policeman gave me a number for my insurance company, which in due course replaced the stolen items. Later I was filled in on the identification of the suspect, who will almost certainly get a custodial sentence. I was a little shaky for a few nights afterwards, and a little inconvenienced while waiting for replacements.</p> <p>Consider in comparison the plight of the many children whose parents, including a vast army of absent fathers, have abandoned them for various reasons. These children, almost without exception, grow up feeling unwanted, deserted and maligned, usually at a very young age. And carry, at the very least, what some may call a chip on their shoulders for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Where is the justice and lawful support for these children? How is it possible that the law works unceasingly to find the cat burglar, but ignores the deserting parents who are, after all, very easy to identify? Why is it not unlawful to abandon your child?</p> <p><strong>Gaynor McGrath</strong><br>Armidale, NSW, Australia</p> <p><strong>More than some can bear</strong></p> <p>Amelia Gentleman's expos\u00e9 of what goes on at a strip club is, for most of us men, not much of a revelation at all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/lap-dancing-club-behind-scenes\" title=\"\">(Too much to bare, 3 August)</a>. If you want to get to the real truth, just ask a man that frequents these places.</p> <p>Strip clubs are for men who either can't get sex on their own, have been married for a long time and miss the contact with a different woman or recluses that can't get near a woman. The ugly truth of these clubs is that if the girls want to make money, they have to be willing to prostitute themselves. There is the off-chance that a rookie (a man) will go in and a girl will empty his wallet because he never bothered to ask how much a lap dance is and he keeps asking for another one. Other than that, most clubs are full-service places and the fee is usually $160 for 30 minutes for full service, half that for half-service.</p> <p>It's the ugly truth. A club gets busted, it opens under a new name in a different place \u2013 ad nauseam.</p> <p><strong>Maximo Pichardo</strong><br>New York City, US</p> <p>\u2022 The 3 August edition of Guardian Weekly runs to 48 pages, of which a full four, including photographs, are devoted to Amelia Gentleman's article about one of London's oldest lap-dancing clubs. Is this some sort of joke on the part of editor Abby Deveney or is the Guardian doing its best to become \"trendy\" in an effort to get away from its starchy image of a serious medium for the intelligentsia? If so, please desist, lest we revolt against having the piss taken out of us even more.</p> <p>Perhaps you have already planned a follow-up article on pole-dancing or massage parlours. The mind boggles.</p> <p><strong>John Orton</strong><br>Lindfield, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Congratulations on Amelia Gentleman's piece on the London lap-dancing club. It's useful to be reminded that such things \u2013 which, as we read it, make high claim to present themselves as respectable \u2013 exist. Certainly it is not a unique or even exceptional case of exploitation of women with poor prospects, but it is one case that has <em>pignon sur rue</em> in the centre of London (or western Europe, should you prefer).</p> <p><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br>Paris, France</p> <p><strong>Threat to peace process</strong></p> <p>Your leader comment is right: having come so far restoring peace after decades of brutal and often atrocious armed struggle on all sides, there is indeed a risk that an \"alienated and dispossessed youth\" in Northern Ireland could \"too easily become a recruiting ground for terror\" in a climate of recession and spending cuts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/editorial-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">(Keep focused, 3 August)</a>.</p> <p>The trouble is that these economic hardships are hitting hard just as the healing process is getting into its stride there. A decade back hopes were high that a better state was at last being created for young people in the north and the mood on this was buoyant.</p> <p>Certainly that was how Martin McGuinness, then education minister in the new power-sharing arrangement, put it to me in Adelaide in 2000. \"Young people,\" he said, had \"come through 30 very bitter years of conflict and this [was] bound to take its toll on them\". He continued: \"Undoubtedly that leads to a sense of insecurity about the political situation and nervousness about it, which is bound to have a detrimental effect in every aspect of their lives. The question now is how we can make politics work and show young people that politics can work for them so that they can place some faith in the democratic process.\"</p> <p>\"These young people,\" McGuinness said, \"have been given hope [by the peace process] and they've never had that before.\"</p> <p>It is this generational recovery \u2013 one that has continued strongly throughout the last decade or so \u2013 that is now being menaced by recession and cutbacks. While this threat remains, a peace process that is progressing well is being undermined and its ultimate success cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p><strong>Terry Hewton</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p><strong>Clientelismo in Sicily</strong></p> <p>Reading Tom Kington's report on Sicily's economic reality was a depressing experience <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/21/sicily-bankruptcy-mafia-new-greece?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Fears grow for Sicily as bankruptcy looms, 27&#xa0;July)</a>. Kington compares Sicily's bloated civil service (one full-time office staff for every 239 inhabitants) to Lombardy's more reasonable one to 2,500 ratio and points to clientelismo politics as the root cause.</p> <p>Two decades ago, following a 20-year study of Italy's regional government institutions, Robert D Putnam published Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Putnam found that, in the north, for \"at least 10 centuries\" a multitude of societies, guilds, mutual aid societies, co-operatives and unions fostered \"norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement\" resulting in horizontal political relationships. By contrast, Italy's southern regions evolved in the opposite direction, entrenching vertical political relationships.</p> <p>Putnam defines horizontal to mean \"I'll do this for you now, knowing that somewhere down the road you'll do something for me\" and vertical to mean \"I'll do this for you now, if you do that for me now\" \u2013 Kington's clientelismo.</p> <p>Vertical politics, clientelismo, is today's dominant ideology. It is more likely that those who would fix Sicily's problems will achieve little more than to install new clientelismo beneficiaries.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Carrel</strong><br>Terrace, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p><strong>Caught in drugs crossfire</strong></p> <p>What steps is the US government taking to reduce the number of drug users in the US? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/honduras-human-rights-war-drugs?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Ordinary Hondurans get caught up in the crossfire of US war on drugs, 27 July)</a>.

  "<p>It didn't take long for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/12/paul-ryan-hailed-donations-romney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney's Republican running-mate, Paul Ryan</a>, to make the kind of impact on us foreigners which will delight his admirers and confirm the bookies' hunch that Barack Obama may well win his second term in November despite an ailing US economy. Just two days on the job and some bright spark has just unearthed Ryan's attack on the NHS.</p> <p>It confirms the impression I got from reading the Fleet St Tory press on Sunday after Romney's introduction of him as \"the next president of the United States\" (whoops). \"Who says Romney is always risk-averse, eh?\" and, \"this will set the contest alight\". It sounded like whistling in the dark to keep conservative spirits up, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/13/conservative-elation-mitt-romney-pick-paul-ryan\" title=\"\">knowing that the choice may well prove a Palin-esque mistake</a>.</p> <p>We can shrug and say that Congressman Ryan doesn't know much about the NHS, either its strengths or weaknesses, so we needn't waste much time on his views. That's true as far as it goes. Very bright (so we keep being told) and charismatic (Mitt needs help in that department), Ryan is an ideologue who would look at a taxpayer-funded healthcare system and condemn it out of hand.</p> <p>That's what he did in the Wall St Journal (proprietor: R Murdoch) in 2009 when he warned that the Obama health plan would put the US on \"a glide path towards European-style socialism\" in which voters would become dependent on government, reluctant to embrace spending cuts which might hit their healthcare.</p> <p>\"We need only look to Great Britain and elsewhere to see the effects of socialised healthcare on the broader economy. Once a large number of citizens get their heathcare from the State (it's always with a capital 'S' among the Ryan crowd), it dramatically alters their attachment to government,\" he wrote.</p> <p>OK, we can follow that and agree with it \u2013 or not.</p> <p>What we do know is that the UK still spends less than 10% of its GDP on healthcare, as do most advanced EU healthcare systems, more or less, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"\">while the US spends at least 15%, and probably nearer 17%</a>, a US health executive (private sector) told me recently.</p> <p>Which system its both fairer and more efficient in terms of health outcomes? We all know the answer. Despite the brilliance of its hi-tech medicine and its restless quest for innovation, it's not the US.</p> <p>That's what the great battle over Obama healthcare was all about: to create a system underpinned by compulsory insurance \u2013 nearly 50 million Americans, one in six, are uninsured \u2013 greater efficiency as well as fairness and bear down on costs which benefit doctors, insurance firms and pharmaceuticals, but not US business overall. Health costs are a weighty burden on both employers and staff, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy.</p> <p>We know all this, don't we? That's where critics of Andrew Lansley's marketisation plan for the NHS \u2013 a bit more competition between the NHS, private and voluntary providers - often get it wrong.</p> <p>Lansley knows what a mess the US system is and doesn't want to copy it. No one does and even pro-market campaigners like <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform</a> now cite the low-cost health care innovations being pioneered in places like Mexico and Brazil as examples we might usefully explore.</p> <p>For all his vaunted cleverness I doubt if Paul Ryan knows much about this. Americans are surprisingly insular in many ways, that's why they call their local baseball competition the World Series (although the Toronto Blue Jays are allowed to play). Example? Two from yesterday's FT will do. Columnist Gillian Tett explained that many major American corporations earn most revenue abroad now - 90% of sales are overseas even for Tupperware now \u2013 which helps in a recession, but is bad for US politics. Most CEOs can no longer be bothered with it.</p> <p>And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/us-standardcharted-probe-idUSBRE87C04O20120814\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered Bank the way he did</a>. Right or wrong (probably wrong?) he acted unilaterally (probably for local political reasons) in a world where <em>co-ordinated</em> action between global bank regulators is more vital than ever. It wouldn't occur to Benny that Asian regulators might be unimpressed \u2013 and that their views now count for a lot, his for less.</p> <p>But Paul Ryan is a familiar type in so many ways. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan\" title=\"\">Check out his CV here</a>. Being born in heartland Wisconsin doesn't automatically make him insular. The region's industries have bled badly during globalisation. But he's also a professional politician of the kind conservatives usually like to deplore \u2013 Barack Obama didn't have much of a CV before politics either.</p> <p>Ryan's father died young of heart trouble (there's a family history) which has made him a fitness fanatic, something American health policymakers need to take more seriously than most. He worked his way through college, but also used his late father's state benefits to help out. There ought to be an irony check here, but \u2013 as Obama is already pointing out - Ryan advocates a small state solution while still voting for expensive government programmes. We know the type.</p> <p>Professional politician? Yes, After college in Ohio, where he first encountered Hayek, Friedman, Von Mises and the intoxicating works of Ayn Rand (Alan Greenspan, who presided over the great boom and bust at the Federal Reserve was also a Rand fan), Ryan went straight to work for Wisconsin senator Bob Kasten at just 22.</p> <p>When Kasten lost his seat the same year (1992) Ryan stayed on in Washington \u2013 the wicked capital to Tea Party types \u2013 so he's not the \"Washington outsider\" they claim he is. Within six years \u2013 at 28 \u2013 he was back home (1997) and elected to Congress. He will face his eighth re-election (the law allows it) while running for Veep this autumn. Though he always did part-time jobs, there's a sniff of privilege in that CV, the long-established Ryan family construction business and some political jobs which may have helped him up the ladder. Meritocracy and nepotism are close cousins, as we know.</p> <p>As you've probably read in the past two days Ryan is now chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, author of the Ryan Plan to shrink the federal government by such devices as a cap on healthcare spending (ironically Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, are government programmes that outspend the NHS), a 10% cut in government jobs and a simplified income tax system, 10% and 25% bands to replace the current six.</p> <p>That's a $6tn cut in federal spending over 10 years and would trim everything from roads and airports to student loans, environmental protection and food stamps for the poor \u2013 everything except social security (which is basically benefits and pensions) and defence. Ryan's proposed \"block grant\" system of payment to states running Medicaid would on some estimates cut the numbers entitled to it from 41 million to 27 million.</p> <p>It has prompted the wits to say that Romney, who has flip-flopped on so many issues in his quest for the presidency, has now outsourced his brain. Whatever the candidate says to reassure Middle America that he's not as radical as Ryan, the running mate is the more dynamic figure, the man who brought vast cheering crowds of loyalists out to cheer an astonished Romney in Waukesha, Wisconsin, yesterday.</p> <p>Plenty of Americans see government as the enemy \u2013 and only this year big money funded <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/after-wisconsin-recall-el_n_1579319.html\" title=\"\">a successful referendum result</a> in Wisconsin to endorse the governor's plans to curb trade union rights, this in a state once famous for progressive welfare reform. There was a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/wisconsin-shooting\" title=\"\">mass shooting at a Sikh temple</a> there only last week. Many people are under pressure and come up with some crazy solutions.</p> <p>One of the more interesting articles on Ryan that I have read claims that he is more of a principled conviction politician than many critics \u2013 or this article \u2013 might suggest.</p> <p>Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate website, has been telling his readers that Ryan's arrival on the ticket will force Americans to consider basic issues they might otherwise be tempted to duck.</p> <p>Thus he would pay for some of his promised tax cuts \u2013 Americans love tax cuts, even when it leads straight to added debts for their children - by eliminating tax deductions. He doesn't say which ones, but that is a recipe for getting more taxes from the rich.</p> <p>Other commentators say that Ryan's arrival allows Obama to switch the election's spotlight from his record, patchy in hard Bush-created times, to what a Romney-Ryan administration might do. Scary stuff.</p> <p>Weisberg's sombre conclusion is that Ryan knows about the hard choices ahead for the US as it seeks to improve its performance in the face of the Chinese ascendancy, that he has a coherent policy which finally starts to make have-it-both-ways conservatives honest as the Democrats are not yet in the quest to make government more affordably efficient.</p> <p>Brutal honesty in election year is a bold option. For that reason Ryan on the ticket probably means a Republican defeat in November. Rupert Murdoch, who likes winners, is backing him. But, as we know, Rupe is fast losing his grip. David Cameron should watch from a safe distance and learn from the Romney-Ryan train crash.</p>",

  "<p>A week may be a long time in politics but that's nothing compared to a year in fashion. In the last 12 months we've gone through more trends than Christian Grey goes through nipple clamps, and yet one man has remained committed to his signature holiday look in the face of intense, and totally justified, criticism.</p> <p>David Cameron, enjoying a coffee on holiday in Mallorca with his wife, flaunted his love of dark blue jeans and black slip-on loafers as if he wasn't sipping a hot drink in the broiling Spanish heat. The only difference between this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/may/31/david-cameron-holiday-wardrobe#\" title=\"\">year's choice of clothes and those seen when the Camerons holidayed in Ibiza</a> last May is that Dave has got rid of the polo T-shirt, the only part of last year's outfit that made any sense, and replaced it with a long-sleeved shirt. In navy. The sleeves aren't even rolled up, for God's sake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394702515\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344946654041/The-Camerons-in-Ibiza-las-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Camerons in Ibiza last year\" width=\"220\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Camerons in Ibiza last year.

The cotton dress is from Cos, a brand whose take on utilitarian chic is very \"current\", and whose clothes retail at the more affordable end of the spectrum. The Birkenstocks might be as 90s as sun-dried tomatoes and MiniDisc players but white shoes are making a comeback, almost certainly because they set off a summer tan beautifully.</p> <p>You can imagine the scene back at the villa. \"Samantha you look lovely.\" \"Dave, are you sure you're not going to be too hot in that? Don't you want to \u2026 roll your trousers up a bit? On second thoughts, don't.\" There's a big important question that this picture begs and it is this: why on God's Earth doesn't Samantha take control of her husband's wardrobe? If she's anything like the rest of us, just looking at Dave's outfit will bring her out in a sweat.</p>",
  "<p>Celebrity magazine Heat has been censured by the Press Complaints Commission over an article that claimed a singer had kissed a girl and therefore cheated on his then girlfriend.</p> <p>The PCC ruled that the magazine had breached the clause in the editors' code of practice about accuracy in the story headlined \"Exclusive: 'Fazer cheated on Tulisa with me'... Fazer told me he didn't have a girlfriend - then we kissed\".</p> <p>The story, trailed on the magazine's cover, concerned a nightclub incident involving Richard Rawson, known as Fazer, who was with the band N-Dubz.</p> <p>Rawson, while accepting that he had danced with the woman, strongly denied that there had been any kiss or that he had told her that he didn't have a girlfriend. </p> <p>He said that the magazine should have approached his representative for comment before publication, rather than informing him of the claims only after the edition had gone to print.</p> <p>The magazine explained that it had not approached Rawson's people for comment because it was confident of its story. To that end, it provided an affidavit signed by the woman plus a witness statement from a freelance journalist who had taken the photographs used to illustrate the story. He confirmed that he had witnessed the alleged kiss.</p> <p>Though the commission was unable to reconcile the conflicting versions of events it took account of the wording of the editors' code, which states: \"The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information.\" </p> <p>It noted that the magazine had been unable to provide direct corroborating evidence of the kiss, such as a photograph.</p> <p>It also took a dim view of the magazine's decision not to contact Rawson's representatives prior to publication, ruling that it represented a failure to take care over the accuracy of the story. So it upheld the complaint.</p> <p>Charlotte Dewar, head of complaints and pre-publication services, explained the PCC's reasoning:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Although the code does not impose specific requirement of 'prior notification', seeking comment from the subject of a story before publication may be a necessary step to ensure the accuracy of any resulting coverage. </p> <p>While the commission was not able to reconcile conflicting claims from witnesses about what had happened at the club, it decided that in the full context - which included the nature of the claims and the prominence with which they were trailed to readers - the magazine's decision not to seek comment from the complainant's representative about the incident before publication breached the terms of clause 1.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Rawson also complained about that pictures of him dancing with the woman breached his privacy.</p> <p>But the commission noted that the evening on which they had been taken had been a \"press night\" and that, in such a context, a well-known musician did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. That part of the complaint was rejected.</p> <p><strong><em>Comment:</em></strong> This ruling reminds us, yet again, about the controversial business of prior notification. The code is silent on that matter, as the PCC properly states.</p> <p>I can understand why Heat magazine's editors felt confident enough to publish, given an affidavit and a supporting statement.</p> <p>But I guess the failure to contact the complainant's representatives has a too-good-to-check element about it. Similarly, the thinking might have been that Rawson's people would call in lawyers and prevent publication.</p> <p>My feeling is that we have to sort out this business of \"prior notification\" in whatever code emerges in the wake of the Leveson report. An obligation to notify would sort out many post-publication problems.</p> <p>It could, as with other parts of the current code, be subject to a public interest test. In other words, if editors decided not to contact a person about a story involving them in advance, they would need to show that they had good reasons not to.</p> <p>I hear Max Mosley whispering in my ear that such a compromise just isn't good enough. But I accept the view, as newspapers argued when he sought to make it a legal requirement before the European court, that a code would be better than a law.</p> <p>At present, as the Rawson-versus-Heat case illustrates, there is far too much leeway in the current code.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/cases/adjudicated.html?article=Nzk1Ng==\">PCC</a></p>",
  "<p>To those in France with only a passing interest in its national football team, the current scene would appear to be vaguely familiar. A member of the golden generation is appointed to breathe new life after a rueful and ratty tournament which went down like a lead balloon. The country that invented deja vu conveniently provides its very own word to describe <em>Les Bleus</em>.</p> <p>Dig a little deeper, though, and there is reason to believe that life under Didier Deschamps may not turn out to be a replica of Laurent Blanc's period as France's head coach. Although they have substantial shared history \u2013 both are well loved icons for France who won World Cup and European Championship honours, both left their homeland to experience top level football abroad in Spain, Italy and England, and both showed great promise as a young coach winning Ligue 1 \u2013 they are very different managers with very different personalities to inject into the job.</p> <p>Compared to Blanc's more laid back, conservative style, Deschamps is ferociously passionate, engrossed in studying football and constantly challenging his own ideas, wears his heart on his sleeve, and has a disciplinarian streak he is not afraid to use. The early evidence is there from his first get-together. Mobile phones have been banned, and a new set of expectations about behaviour will be enforced. \"I really want everyone to have the right attitude and behave properly,\" Deschamps explains. \"If anyone doesn't do that, they'll be condemning themselves, not me. Being picked or not picked is a form of sporting sanction.</p> <p>\"From a historical point of view, what happened in 2010 and at Euro 2012, players have to realise they have a responsibility to be an example on and off the pitch. To be a French international has to be the pinnacle, even for players who are playing at big clubs and in big competitions. I won't use the term 'zero tolerance' but with what happened, French supporters attached as much importance to the result as to behaviour.\"</p> <p>In addition to the absent Samir Nasri and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez, who picked up bans from the federation as punishment for their brattishness during the European Championships, Deschamps has cast aside Hatem Ben Arfa and Yann M'Vila for his first selection. France play Uruguay on Wednesday night in a friendly, and the squad has been refreshed with an emphasis on a nucleus of young players. \"Talent has no age,\" Deschamps says.</p> <p>Just because Blanc's era ended in disappointment, that is not to underestimate the work he did in repairing the havoc wreaked by France at the last World Cup in South Africa. There is a more pointed question to be asked of the current generation: If Blanc managed to get France back on track only for old problems to resurface when it came to the crunch at tournament time, are there certain elements that are almost beyond managing? Can Deschamps do enough things differently? That is the burning issue, and it will be fascinating to observe whether the former France captain can find the answer, either by bringing the more complex personalities into line, or finding a winning team without them.</p> <p>Rio Mavuba's return to the fold, after five years out of the picture, emphasises the qualities Deschamps likes in a player. Mavuba is a dedicated guy, a serious professional, a team man. So too the likes of \u00c9tienne Capoue, the midfield anchor who has been interesting a few Premier League teams, and the sharp defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, who deserves more of a chance on the international stage than he had last season.</p> <p>Deschamps has only one warm-up to blend his team and instil his ideas before the real business begins next month. He managed to get the whole squad together only by Monday lunchtime, so time to actually work on strategies is scarce. France begin their qualification campaign for the 2014 World Cup with a double header against Finland and Belarus. So far so reasonable, but the problem is they drew Europe's shortest straw as they also landed Spain in their group. When you consider Group E has Norway and Slovenia as top seeds, and Group G has Greece and Slovakia, you can appreciate that France might feel a little miffed to end up with the current world and double European champions. There is an acceptance that a play-off place is the realistic aspiration en route to Brazil 2014. Deschamps said as much himself.</p> <p>But deep down he is the one man who won't settle for that. It is not only his job, but his nature, to aim as high as can be. As he said when he was handed the reins of the national team: \"You know me. Winning is in my blood.\"That was why, as a player for <em>Les Bleus</em>, he had an overwhelming feeling in the seconds after France won Euro 2000 that he should call time on that stage there and then. He had captained his team to the international double, and had played the role of the manager on the pitch \u2013 cajoling, inspiring, ordering tactical adjustments \u2013 with unerring conviction. As his team-mates celebrated, he was overwhelmed by the feeling that it was the end of his era. \"I gave all my energy, my faculties, my time, my heart and my spirit,\" he said.</p> <p>Picking up where he left off is some challenge.</p>",

  "<p>One of the media's more seductive Olympics tunes urged us to marvel at a capital transformed. London 2011 was flaming and riot-torn, it sang, but London 2012 is glowing with glory, civility and efficiency.</p> <p>The previous summer was behind us. The true character of the city had been revealed, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london-riots\" title=\"\">shocking horrors of last August</a> buried by history.</p> <p>Wishful thinking, I'm afraid. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2012/aug/13/five-things-to-love-about-london-olympics\" title=\"\">I've loved Olympic London</a>. Games time really has showcased us at our very best. It still feels a bit spoilsport to argue for perspective, even though the main show has now closed. But for every golden triumph there is a torn achilles heel, for every Super Saturday, a tale of disappointment and dismay.</p> <p>The capital's shopping streets have given us a foretaste of that story. A full balance sheet cannot be drawn up for a while, but big West End operators and East End small traders alike are among those reporting fallen sales. Perhaps they will all gain in the end, but some will always feel they've been sold a false dream.</p> <p>This uneven spread of Games-time spoils may anticipate the bigger, longer picture \u2013 the true social and economic legacy. London mayor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/politicians-success-london-olympics\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson has spoken of</a> a \"can-do city\" for which the future is shiny bright, telling the \"doom and gloom merchants\" they were wrong to predict that London would implode under the strain of staging the greatest sporting show on Earth, and pledging that \"the catalyst of the Games\" will attract investment to every development prime site in town.</p> <p>Enthusing is what Johnson does best. He is right that the various authorities deserve great credit, not least Transport for London, which, with the help of the public, has confounded predictions of \"transport chaos\". Maybe the mayor will be right about an investment bonanza, too, but this is where the complications start. The legacy aspiration is to move London's centre east, bringing health and wealth to parts of the capital that have long been mostly poor. But will the less well-off enjoy the promised benefits?</p> <p>Host borough Newham is proud that its partnership with the giant Westfield mall, which overlooks the Olympic Park, has helped local people secure some of the newly created jobs. But this part of east London, still wounded by the hammer blow closure of the docks, is a very big ship to turn around. BBC London has reported that Johnson-backed schemes to secure a long-term Olympics job boost for London's unemployed, one of them targeted at the host boroughs, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19184807\" title=\"\">have fallen short of their goals</a>.</p> <p>Housing costs are a crucial factor. Improved transport links and schools, which Newham and fellow host boroughs have worked hard to secure, help local people find and hold down work and attract incomers bearing social capital and spending cash from which all can profit.</p> <p>But will a retail or restaurant job pay well enough for a young East Ender to secure an East End mortgage or pay an East End private sector rent if, as typically occurs, gentrification pushes prices even more insanely high than they are now?</p> <p>For some home-owners, this regeneration effect might provide an opportunity to sell up and head for Essex or Kent, following a long-established trail. For others, though, outward migration will continue to be borne of unwelcome necessity, not choice. Academics have warned that any \"convergence\" of living standards between their part of the capital and the more affluent west might end up being achieved \"by simply changing the population mix, rather than transforming the lives of existing east London communities\" unless enough homes, including the new ones to be built, are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/jul/27/affordable-housing-sidelined-olympic-regeneration?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">genuinely affordable to people on low and even middle incomes</a>.</p> <p>Government housing and benefits policies are intensifying this problem on the grounds of deficit-reduction. The mayor supports those measures, when he should be flaying them publicly. Meanwhile, his political interests and core convictions suggest he won't rush to exploit other possibilities for a better London that Games time transport arrangements have raised. Encouragingly, he's praised the seemingly successful greater use of night-time freight deliveries, but seems less keen on home-working or managing road space differently. A bedrock Tory, Johnson's moral message from the Games is that competition conquers all. If only urban life were that simple.</p> <p>Meanwhile, London's biggest problems remain: mountainous youth unemployment, child poverty, overcrowding, territorial street rivalries, costly road traffic congestion and the highest public transport fares of any big city in the world. A year on from those riots the mother of Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police lit a hidden tinderbox of resentment, violence and pitiless rage, says she's had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/03/mark-duggan-mother-waiting-answers\" title=\"\">no proper explanation for why her son died</a>. Olympic London has brought joy and optimism. Long may they endure. But they could disappear so easily.</p>",
  "<p>Is there another franchise in the shooter genre that casts a longer shadow than Call Of Duty? Certainly Activision's FPS mammoth draws as much ire as it does admiration from the gaming community, but you can't argue with the statistics. Call Of Duty shatters through unit sales records as a matter of course, year in, year out. The last entry in the series, Modern Warfare 3, grossed a whopping $775m (\u00a3495m) in its first five days of release and its predecessor tops the franchise's highest-seller list, having shifted more than 23m copies to date. </p> <p>That last little piece of information probably weighs heavy on the collective minds at Treyarch, the developer behind the upcoming Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2. Since the first Black Ops is the biggest selling CoD entry of all time, expectations for its sequel have been pumped up to the point of absurdity. Whether or not Treyarch can top its personal best depends largely on Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 living up to the hype, and a big part of this \u2013 the silver bullet, in fact \u2013 is down to the game's crucial multiplayer mode.</p> <p>First, the bad news: if you were a fan of the wager matches in Black Ops or, indeed, its in-game currency, which allowed some non-linear progression through the unlockables \u2013 too bad! They're now things of the past. Kill Streaks have gone too, although they exist in a more malleable form as Score Streaks. The big push with Black Ops 2, seems aimed at delivering as much customisation to the player as possible without breaking the overall balance.</p> <p>The Class Creation tools have been overhauled somewhat. Instead of a set rubric in which players are forced to pick a certain number of perks, weapons and pieces of equipment, in Black Ops 2, they're assigned 10 character points to spend as they please. Let's say, for example, you're a CoD player who hardly ever uses their secondary weapon. Well, in Black Ops 2, you don't need to select one; you simply cash it in for some extra points, and you can spend them something else. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394733029\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344946113657/turbine.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Black Ops 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Players can also buy up to three Wildcards (each costing a point), which allow them to bend the rules and configure their class further. The \"Perk Greed\" Wildcard, for example, allows players to select two Perks from the same category \u2013 such as Hardline and Flack Jacket. Wildcards can also be used to buy more weapon attachments or extra grenades. To maintain some sense of balance, there are upper limits on what the player can buy \u2013 you can't stroll into a match with five guns, for example. </p> <p>Once in a match, players will notice that the rejigged Score Streak system is more user-friendly than its Kill Streak predecessor. In the past, players had to string together a series of kills in order to call in useful items such as UAVs, rocket bombardments and K9 attack dogs. Now they're rewarded for what Treyarch has labelled \"positive gameplay\". Each Score Streak piece of equipment is assigned a numerical value, and once the player earns that value through their actions, the equipment is available for them to deploy. So, for example, if a player captures a flag (100pts), shoots an enemy on their way back to base (100pts) and then plants their flag at homeplate (100pts) they can then call in a UAV drone (300pts) having only fired one shot.</p> <p>The new equipment in the game is an absolute blast to use. A lot of the guns in the game look like revamped versions of the weapons in Modern Warfare, but there are some completely unique items in Black Ops 2's arsenal too, befitting its slightly futuristic setting. These include the Assault Shield, a metal riot shield that can be used as deployable cover, Shock Charges, that temporarily stun targets and the Millimeter (sic) Wave Scanner, that allows players to see stationary targets through walls (think about that, campers). </p> <p>The Score Streak rewards are equally satisfying. There are obviously the tried and tested assets, such as Care Packages and UAVs, and there are some re-skinned features too \u2013 an attack drone mini helicopter presents a smaller target, but it pretty much does the same thing as the Harrier from MW2. </p> <p>Then there are brand new items, such a remote drone that the player flings into the sky as soon as they unlock it, and it circles the battlefield until it finds a target \u2013 making it pretty much a guaranteed kill. There's also the HellStorm Missile, which works the same way as a Predator Missile, except that it can split off multiple warheads, decimating enemies moving together in a group. There are even a couple of non-lethal items such as The Guardian (no relation), a turret that emits a microwave pulse that slows down opponents. Stick this baby in the right section of the map and you can create a bottleneck filled with a lot of downed enemies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394733030\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344946215835/aftermath-drone-guards.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty: Black Ops 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Players also have the option of taking control of some of their AI equipment remotely. Players can switch to the HUD of items such as attack drones or remote turrets and better direct their fire against foes. They can also leave the equipment to work remotely, if they so choose. </p> <p>There were four maps available at the multiplayer reveal: Cargo, Yemen, Turbine and Aftermath. Aftermath and Cargo were set in LA, the former featuring a decimated downtown area, and the latter set in a container bay at the docks. Yemen is a classic street battle set in a small town, while Turbine \u2013 my favourite of the lot \u2013 takes place in a canyon around a downed cargo plane. All of the maps look exquisite and favour the close-quarters run-and-gun style of gameplay COD is known for. Aside from Team Deathmatch, we were allowed to play the new Hardpoint match, which is essentially a version of King Of The Hill from Gears Of War 3.</p> <p>Everything the player does in the online mode earns them XP, and each new level offers them a new unlockable item. There are 55 levels in the game, and we're told that hitting the top level won't be enough to unlock all of the mode's content. This means that in order to obtain shiny new perks, guns and equipment beyond level 55 requires players to Prestige \u2013 and there are a further ten levels of that available. There are also a ton of medals, tags and baubles in the mode for players to collect for, as Treyarch puts it, \"doing something cool in a match\".</p> <p>Players now also have the option of playing in ranked matches, as one of the key pushes for Black Ops 2 is in the direction of the eSports market. To that end, they've introduced League Play, which offers skill-based matchmaking and seasonal ladders. If you start playing in the online Leagues, Black Ops 2's online mode will record your skill level, size you up, and plonk you in a league with players you have a chance of beating. Once you get into the habit of trouncing opponents on a regular basis, you move up to the next League in terms of skill-level. Quitting matches in League Play is punished harshly, by the way, as Treyarch doesn't want highly skilled killjoys to be able to drop down to the lower leagues and mess up anyone else's experience. </p> <p>Treyarch has also furnished its League Play mode with a new toolset allowing players to commentate on games, rather than play in them. The designated commentator \u2013 or CoDcaster \u2013 has an array of play-by-play features to allow them to fill out their uploads including Score Panels, Name Plates and different views they can use to follow the action. Treyarch says it has a streaming component in development, which will allow CoD-heads to follow matches on their tablets. </p> <p>Of course, whether eSports proves a substantial draw for the CoD faithful remains to be seen, but even without it, the online mode looks set to rack up impressive audience numbers. Overall, the focus in Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2's multiplayer is on quickness and customisation.</p> <p>Treyarch wants players to dive into this mode, work out their play preferences and then level up as quickly as possible. This doesn't mean that it'll be easy to become an elite player, but it makes Black Ops 2's online mode arguably the most accessible of its type in series. It's a sharp, brutal and compelling experience, and all of this bodes well for Black Ops 2's chances when it's released this November.</p>",
  "<p>Like many Kenyans, Eko Dydda's tribal origins used to be obvious from his name. But after witnessing the ethnic violence that followed the country's last election, the gospel rapper decided to change his name to remove any reference to his tribe.</p> <p>The 26-year-old, who was named best male artist at Kenya's 2012 Groove awards, says many young Kenyans support his battle against tribalism. He warns that time is running out ahead of the country's next election in March.</p> <p>\"I tell (my fans) 'let's not be tribal, but let's be Tribe-All because we are the Tribe-All generation,\" he says.</p> <p>Dydda, who grew up in the Mathare slum in Nairobi, was nearly a casualty of the violence that broke out after President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">declared the winner of the 2007 election</a> and the prime minister Raila Odinga, a Luo, cried foul.</p> <p>\"Things were crazy \u2026 I saw the ugly of the ugly,\" Dydda said.

But Dydda only spoke Sheng, the mixture of Swahili and English, which is the language of the ghettos.</p> <p>Luckily, an older man appeared and told the gang that Dydda was one of them. \"It was a wake-up call,\" Dydda said.</p> <p>The rapper, known for his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN3_fUlrKj0\" title=\"\">stammer-and-stagger style</a>, now preaches tolerance at his concerts and hosts a conversation under the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23GHETTO_PARLIAMENT&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#Ghetto_Parliament</a> on Twitter. \"(I changed my name) because I wanted to belong to the country Kenya and not a specific tribe,\" he said.</p> <p>Four Kenyans, including presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, are<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/23/court-kenyans-trial-election-violence\" title=\"\"> facing trial at the international criminal court</a> for their alleged role in the poll violence.

But already, analysts says, some politicians are using the divisive rhetoric of \"us against them\" on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\"[Political] mobilisation is still \u2026 being done around individuals and these individuals are talking to their ethnic base first,\" said Ndung'u Wainaina, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.icpcafrica.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Policy and Conflict</a>.</p> <p>In July Kenya's <a href=\"http://www.cohesion.or.ke/\" title=\"\">National Cohesion and Integration Commission</a>, brought a case against three Kikuyu musicians, charging them with inciting violence against people of the Luo tribe in political songs.

Yes, your tribe is important to you because that is your heritage \u2026 but it doesn't define you,\" she said.</p> <p>While calls for change resonate in Nairobi, it is hard to gauge the hunger for a new political dynamic outside the cosmopolitan capital.</p> <p>Wainaina said rural communities would support change if they thought it would improve their access to jobs, services and political representation, but warned that the ethnically based divisions were easily manipulated.</p> <p>\"Issues of resource allocation and accessibility, representation, accountability and participation are at the heart of these communities but (the lack of) an enabling environment, including access to critical information, remains a major hindrance,\" he added.</p>",

  "<p>Two interns who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/29/black-swan-interns-sue-studio\" title=\"\">last year sued Fox Searchlight over unpaid work</a> on the Oscar-winning film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137726/black-swan\" title=\"\">Black Swan</a> are now expanding their legal action to include all internships at parent company Twentieth Century Fox, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fox-black-swan-internship-program-lawsuit-361424\" title=\"\">according to the Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p> <p>Alex Footman and Eric Glatt's latest suit could have a major impact on working practices in Hollywood, where unpaid internships have risen in recent years. Fox itself says it changed its guidelines in July 2010 to ensure that all interns are paid at least $8 an hour. But the plaintiffs remain angry, claiming that they were made to undertake menial work with little or no educational value that ought to have been carried out by paid employees. The financial success of Black Swan, filmed in New York in 2009 prior to Fox's rule change, has also caused anger. Darren Aronofsky's intense psychological thriller earned more than $300m (\u00a3191m) at the global box office and won the best actress Oscar for its star Natalie Portman.</p> <p>The interns' motion, which will be considered next week at a federal court in Manhattan, asks a judge to \"broaden the scope of the case to include all interns who participated in Fox Entertainment Group's internship program\", citing evidence that \"the same hiring, personnel and company policies that applied to Searchlight interns applied to all interns who participated in FEG's internship program\". They seek compensation in the form of back payment for work done and a legal ruling that similar internships should not be offered in future.</p> <p>The motion also seeks to expand the suit to cover production interns, who worked on films that Fox Searchlight co-produced, as well as more than 100 \"corporate interns\", who worked through Fox's intern program. Two new plaintiffs, Eden Antalik and Kanene Gratts, are hoping to add their names to the legal action. The former worked through the intern programme and the latter worked on 2009's (500) Days of Summer, which was co-produced by Fox Searchlight.</p> <p>US law makes it clear that unpaid interns must gain educational benefit from their work experience and cannot be used to replace regular paid employees. Speaking to the New York Times in September, Footman said he spent his time on the Black Swan set making coffee, handling lunch orders, taking out rubbish and cleaning the production office. \"The only thing I learned on this internship was to be more picky in choosing employment opportunities,\" he complained. \"Black Swan had more than $300m in revenues. If they paid us, it wouldn't make a big difference to them, but it would make a huge difference to us.\"</p> <p>Glatt says he was employed as an unpaid accounting intern, which involved creating documents for purchase orders and petty cash, going to the set for signatures and making spreadsheets to track missing information in personnel files. \"When I started looking for opportunities in the industry, I saw that most people accept an ugly trade-off,\" he said. \"If you want to get your foot in the door on a studio picture, you have to suck it up and do an unpaid internship.\"</p> <p>Twentieth Century Fox has so far made no public comment on the new motion. In September the studio argued that interns were working for Aronofsky's production company, rather than directly for the studio \u2013 a point which the new legal motion seems designed to bypass. \"These are completely meritless claims aimed solely at getting press coverage for the litigants and their attorneys,\" said a spokesperson at the time of the original legal action.</p>",
  "<p>It's now more than 18 months since the lord chief justice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/dec/20/twitter-court-lord-chief-justice\">gave his blessing</a> to tweeting from court \u2013 though reporters had been using it with permission some time before that \u2013 and many of us are now familiar with Twitter feeds that give us a real-time account of high-profile cases.</p> <p>The scoop of delivering a verdict, once the preserve of TV and radio reporters who could race outside to get on air, is now shared by every reporter in court with a laptop or smartphone. But away from the drama of well-publicised cases, many court reporters are engaging with new audiences on Twitter, and some in very creative ways.</p> <p>Jason Evans (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/evansthecrime\">@EvanstheCrime</a>), the South Wales Evening Post's police and crime reporter, began tweeting from court shortly after the lord chief justice gave permission to do so, and his tweets are a daily illustration of the varied caseload of Swansea magistrates court.</p> <p>\"I started it partly to promote the paper and to get people interested. What I try to do is give people a flavour of what goes on in court,\" said Evans. Rather aptly, for a reporter whose paper once employed Dylan Thomas, Evans tweets in verse.</p> <p>\"We hadn't tweeted from court before and one of these verses just popped into my head and I've been doing it since then,\" he said.</p> <p>Sample verses: \"A day spent drinking lager &amp; ouzo led to an unpleasant offence/ He butted his next-door neighbour and smashed her garden fence\"</p> <p>\"Respect to the ushers using Stone's Justices' Manual guide to law / With one lusty blow they fixed a sticking courtroom door\"</p> <p>\"Dressed as an Apache Indian you stand before the law / To face charges of owning animals' parts - eagle's wing &amp; badger's paw\".</p> <p>Evans is the first to admit his Twitter verse may not challenge the reputation of his predecessor at the Post, but they have gained him a new audience. \"I get the odd nod from the lawyers who have seen them,\" he said.</p> <p>Rob Middleton, assistant news editor at the Northampton Chronicle, who tweets from the local crown court as @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/robmiddleton23\">robmiddleton23</a>, finds his tweets enable him to engage with a new audience.</p> <p>\"I've been followed by judges and barristers and I get quite a bit of feedback from police officers. I tweeted that one defendant hadn't turned up for a court appearance and a police officer who follows me saw the tweet and then saw him in the street, and arrested him \u2013 that's happened a couple of times.\"</p> <p>Middleton live tweets court cases and the tweets then form a skeleton for a longer court report for the paper and website. Since the Chronicle has gone weekly, the tweets provide a means of getting the news out first, with longer in-depth reports to follow. And being first with the news from court is still something reporters compete to do, he said.</p> <p>\"If there's a case that a few national news organisations are covering, you try to be the one that breaks it first,\" he said.</p> <p>Other tweeting court reporters use Twitter as a means of advertising the cases they have covered, as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/CourtNewsUK\">@CourtNewsUK</a> does. But this does not stop them putting in some of the colour and sheer variety that life as a court reporter has to offer: \"That last case was delayed by about two hours while the solicitor general umm'd and ahh'd about accepting guilty pleas to lesser offences.\"</p> <p>\"Quite nice how they actually get involved. A while back a colleague bumped into the attorney general representing govt in wig and gown!\"</p> <p>\"Not recognising him, she asked what his name was, and Dominic Grieve sportingly spelled it out, letter by letter.\"</p> <p>As Jason Evans pointed out, Twitter is often useful as a place to recount little vignettes of court life that might be inappropriate or just lost in a longer court report. But captured in a tweet they capture a little of the atmosphere of our courts.</p> <p><strong><br>Guardian reporters who regularly tweet from court</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/sandralaville\">@sandralaville</a> (crime correspondent)<br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/stevenmorris20\">@stevenmorris20</a> (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/twitter/list/JoYeatesTrial\">Vincent Tabak murder trial</a>) - see also his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/02/vincent-tabak-trial-tweeted\">article</a> on the challenges of tweeting from court<br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/robert_booth\">@robert_booth </a>(Twitter joke trial)<br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/estheraddley\">@estheraddley</a> (Julian Assange)</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>12.00pm: Good afternoon. The Guardian's Olympic editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a> will be online <strong>from 2pm BST</strong> to take part in a live webchat. </p> <p>Owen took the job as Olympics editor in December 2008 and will continue in the role through for Paralympics, which begin in two weeks' time. If you have any questions for a man who has lived London 2012 for the past three and a half years, drop them into the <strong>comments section below</strong>. </p> <p>In the meantime, here is Owen writing on the unexpected success of the Games: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/olympics-success-story\">From tiptop venues to friendly volunteers \u2013 where did it all go right?</a>\"</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It began with fears that venues were sinking into the mud following weeks of rain, serious concerns over whether there would be enough security guards to keep the public safe and the biggest call on the army outside wartime.</p> <p>The reaction to the Olympic torch as it toured the nation had raised the hopes of organisers, but the last-ditch security crisis dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the \u00a39.3bn cost to the public purse grew louder.</p> <p>Just over a fortnight later, London's Games ended bathed in sunshine as the country giddily rose to acclaim a host of new sporting heroes amid hopes that it would lead to a new sense of ourselves and \u2014 in the words of a Locog slogan that once seemed cloying but now feels appropriate \u2014 \"inspire a generation\". </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>1.57pm: Owen will be along to answer questions soon, but while you're waiting here is his pick of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/13/london-2012-guardian-highlights-golden-games\">the best moments of the Games</a>: </p> <p><strong>Mo Farah's 10,000m triumph</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah's historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.11pm: Owen is now in the comments sections answering questions. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17679272\"><strong>peteC58</strong></a> starts us off with a question about the lack of Olympic spirit, to which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680335\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hello all. Hope you're not feeling too bereft. There's still the Paralympics to look forward to. In answer to @peteC58, glad you had a great Olympics. I agree on your first point. Generally, thought the presentation of the sport was first class and made a real effort to include those who didn't usually follow them without alienating the purists. But it was a shame that they didn't find time to introduce every athlete before every race. Sometimes it was entirely random - the announcers would get halfway through the field and have to stop because the gun was going off.</p> <p>Saw plenty of spontaneity on the podium (what about the Farah/Bolt moment?) but agree that biting your medal is becoming a bit passe. Perhaps we can persuade medal winners to come up with something new for 2016?</p> <p>Supporters from some nations were certainly rowdier than others (the Lithuanians gave particularly loud and well-refreshed backing to their basketball players) but in the main I was struck by how sporting the crowds were. Even when Greg Rutherford was leading the long jump, there were still loud cheers for his opponents. In the team sports (and the boxing arena) the atmosphere was more raucous - but in a good way. Can't comment on that particular incident with the Poles though I'm afraid.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680277\"><strong>markgreenwood</strong></a> asks a questions about the fairness of the ticketing process: <strong>\"You say that you think the ticket allocation process was probably the fairest way of distributing tickets I still feel this was the one thing that Locog got completely wrong. Their system encouraged people to bid for far more tickets than they really wanted. It encouraged the rich, the gamblers, the credit-card-junkies to go for broke and commit thousands of pounds. These people were usually rewarded with success, for some, fistfuls of tickets. Their system specifically discouraged anyone who was more careful.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680521\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Compared to a first come, first served system (the only real alternative), I still think a ballot was the best approach for the first batch of ticket sales. Locog have figures that they claim show no one really ended up with fistfuls of tickets - the average successful applicant got four costing \u00a3275.</p> <p>But - and it's a big but - there were many other aspects of the ticketing process they got wrong. There should have been a stricter limit on how many tickets a single applicant could apply for. Ticketmaster's system simply wasn't able to cope with the demand and seemed unnecessarily unwieldy. Many people spent many frustrating hours waiting to be told the tickets they wanted weren't available. Ben Marsh, with his amazing online ticket tracker, managed to do what the world's biggest ticketing company failed to do and find a way of checking which tickets were actually available at any one time.</p> <p>I also feel Locog should have been upfront about roughly how many tickets would be available for each session at each price point. Both the IOC and Locog admit there are lessons to learn from the ticketing process - not least for the way the IOC divides up its tickets between the host, the International Olympic Committees and the sponsors.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.22pm: On <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Guardian Sport's Facebook page</a> K.k. Kaushik asks when will India have a chance to host the Games.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680698\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You could ask the same question of the middle east and Africa. The fact the IOC will go to Rio next time, the first ever Olympics in South America, shows it is willing - and keen - to take the Games to new territories. <br>But it was notable that Baku and Doha both dropped off the longlist for 2020 (leaving Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid) and president Jacques Rogge has a long list of logistical and practical concerns about the middle east.</p> <p>India is an interesting one - the Delhi Commonwealth Games was seen by many as the proof of concept for an Olympic bid, but didn't go so well. A solid bid for 2020 did not materialise. But there is no doubt that in sporting and economic terms it is a huge market - even if Olympic sports are not traditionally very strong. There are also issues around how a bid would be structured and funded. 2024 could be a possibility.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.26pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680622\">ExtraConnect</a></strong> asks about the handover between Games: <strong>\"Any idea why the \"Olympic Movement\" do the Olympic handover ceremony at the end of the main Olympics and not after the paralympics? Surely the Games are over / shouldn't hand over until after both events are finished, or are the Paralympics not officially under the IOC banner?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680819\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Olympics are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee. They then pack up their Louis Vuitton suitcases and leave Park Lane, before the International Paralympic Committee (based in Bonn and headed by Brit in Sir Philip Craven) roll into town.</p> <p>Locog, however, organise both events as an integrated whole - they have been held in parallel with the Olympics since 1988 in Seoul.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.29pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680572\">OllyWinkles</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of future Games: <strong>\"It seems entirely likely that the BBC will not be able to afford rights to broadcast future Olympics. The thought of watching the games on Sky Sports fills me with dread. Is there anything the Government can do to make sure the Olympics remain on free-to-air television in perpetuity?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680897\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rest easy, the BBC has rights through to 2020. The BBC certainly had a good Games, with almost universal praise for its coverage (if not its full spread of presenters)...</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.33pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681044\">beninho</a></strong> asks about the use of background music at the track and field events: <strong>\"Seb Coe said he thought is was 'appropriate' but his body language was not convincing. Since it was not discernable via TV and I didn't attend any live events, I have no strong view, but don't much like the way music has crept into football (e.g. when a goal's scored). What do you think about it?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681044\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was certainly one of the talking points of the Games for those of us in the stadium. On the first night of athletics action, as Dibaba surged to victory in the women's 10,000m there was extremely loud European dance music playing and it seemed entirely incongruous. Locog admitted they'd got that wrong and turned it down a bit.</p> <p>But, to my own surprise, I found that once they had done so the music actually added to the atmosphere - particularly in morning sessions that are traditionally flat affairs but in London were attended by noisy fans who seemed excited to be there.</p> <p>Not sure Seb, a track and field purist, was massively convinced but most seem to like it. I agree with you about music after goals in the football though - Middlesbrough and Wigan among the worst offenders.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.38pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678926\">HarryPalmer42</a></strong> asks about the legacy of the Games and how the media will cover some of the sports that have been popular during the past two weeks: <strong>\"Having seen the public interest in these sports raised over your stint as olympics editor what will your recomendation be to the Guardian senior management in relation to future coverage of the smaller sports? As I fear the back pages and content of the website will soon be Football, Football Football as before.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681232\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a very fair question - if largely above my pay grade. There's no doubt that many of those watching (and many of those covering) the Olympics welcomed the respite from the national obsession/sport. It's a simple fact that for many people these sports exist only once every four years, but I agree the media also has a responsibility to provide a spread of coverage. But with the best will in the world, it's going to be hard to find space for sports in which we're unlikely even to qualify in 2016.</p> <p>The likes of rowing, triathlon, taekwondo, equestrian are a slightly different case - it's up to those sports to capitalise on the boost in profile and popularity the Olympics brings and bring their sport to a wider audience. If there is a genuine appetite for coverage (and with web analytic tools we can see exactly how popular different sports are) then we will provide it. Cycling is a good example of a sport that really broke through in Beijing and has capitalised since - there were days during the Tour de France when we filled page after page of the sport section with it, often at football's expense.</p> <p>But for all everyone is slightly down on football at the moment, you can bet that within a fortnight everyone will be back on board with the soap opera.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>2.45pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678736\">mullets</a></strong> is curious about the Olympic village: <strong>\"Were athletes able to come and go freely? Would they be able to leave and go for, say, a meal with their families on an evening? Was there a guest house-like curfew? What about during the day on non-competition days?\"</strong></p> <p>Owen replies:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Athletes could come and go from the Village at will, but individual teams would all have had their own policies regarding curfews etc, especially while still in competition. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-kim-collins-axed-st-kitts\">Kim Collins fell foul of his team's rules and was barred from competing in the 100m</a>.</p> <p>Team GB officials said their athletes were all disappointingly well behaved. German discus gold medallist Robert Harting, on the other hand, celebrated victory by tearing off his vest and running down the hurdle track. He then got drunk on a German cruise ship moored in Docklands, lost his accreditation, failed to get back into the village and spent the night at a train station. Needless to say he looked a bit sheepish at his medal ceremony the next day.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>2.48pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678670\">AndyMitchell</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of the Games: <strong>\"Am I being unreasonable or do you agree the Olympic Broadcasting was a bit under par in places?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681506\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interesting you should say that @AndyMitchell. Although the BBC's coverage was generally widely praised (not that I saw much of it for obvious reasons), there were some grumbles about OBS - the IOC-owned broadcaster that provides the feed. There was a huge row during the cycling road races about their inability to provide split times, making the race difficult to follow (which prompted a blame game between OBS, the BBC and Locog). Neither were the various intricacies of the controversies in the velodrome (most obviously Victoria Pendleton's elimination) made very clear. I suspect it is one of the issues that will form part of the debrief - after Locog did such a good job of presenting the sport in the venues, it was a shame that OBS couldn't always capture that.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>2.52pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678443\">JacksonPollocksNo5</a></strong> wants to know about the volunteers and how many of them were paid: <strong>\"I know of someone who was going to do it (but be paid) but despite being paid for training and getting his uniform etc. was refused to be allowed to do it as he didn't turn 18 until his first day of work. He says that everyone else he knew was essentially paid to stand about all day. How can you tell the difference between the two? I often saw groups of seven+ volunteers stood about. Which ones were doing it for free?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681605\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi @JacksonPollocksNo5 (good name, btw. I was lucky enough to see the Stone Roses with Bradley Wiggins et al during the Games - definitely an Olympics highlight). Anyway, the 70k Locog volunteers - the Games Makers - were all unpaid, they just got their purple uniform and a travelcard. Likewise Boris's army of 8,000 London Ambassadors (the ones in the garish pink). But other staff were paid - the G4S security guards (in bright lime green - garish colours apparently being a 2012 prerequisite) and the TfL advisers in stations and tube stations.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>2.55pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681580\">bromley</a></strong> asks about the future of the Olympic stadium: <strong>\"How are they going to reduce the capacity by 20,000 and provide a roof over all the seating for football? It will be a huge shame to lose the character of the place.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681678\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It remains to be seen. There still hasn't been a final decision on the stadium, with negotiations between the London Legacy Development Corporation and West Ham ongoing. There should a final conclusion to the long running saga/fiasco by October. I suspect West Ham will still get the nod, but there is much negotiation still to be done. I agree that it was a fabulous sporting arena. It's likely that the reduction in capacity will come from the addition of hospitality boxes between the two tiers and spacing out some of the remaining seats. But the sight lines and intimate atmosphere that made it so special as an athletics stadium should remain. The sound system sounded great too so it should work for big concerts. Whether it will work for football? For me, the jury is still out.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>2.58pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680908\">IanB4</a></strong> would like to know more about the Olympic Park: <strong>\"Owen, do you know how soon the park will open to the public? It is going to be a superb attraction - I can't wait!\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681743\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The north park (the bit by the velodrome and the handball arena) will reopen on July 27 2013 - exactly one year after the opening ceremony. The rest won't reopen until easter 2014.There has been some talk of trying to reopen the Orbit earlier than that but health and safety issues may preclude it.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>3.04pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681669\">MitchellStirling</a></strong> has some praise for the Gamers Makers but wants to ask about the change in mood that occurred during the Games:<strong> \"Before the Opening Ceremony what fears did you have that didn't come to fruition and at what point did you start to think that you could stop worrying?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681873\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi @MitchellStirling. Seconded on the Games Makers - they were superb and, er, made the Games. Before the opening ceremony I guess my fears were the same as everyone else's - that the transport wouldn't cope, that the atmosphere in the venues would be flat, that some terrible unforeseen security breach would overshadow the Games. <br>The transport fears receded fairly quickly once it became clear that the TfL information campaign/scare tactics had worked, the security fears were allayed as soon as I met my first Marine manning the searches and any fears over the atmosphere were definitively answered by the opening sessions in each venue. Looking back, it's amazing how much the triumph of Danny Boyle's clever, funny, moving opening ceremony set the tone for what followed.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>3.13pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681473\">ThePlusOne</a></strong> shares an intriguing point about the Sydney Games and asks: <strong>\"Do we judge a successful Olympics by slightly different things over time, and if so, what has London 2012 achieved uniquely that other future hosts would hope to match and emulate?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17682078\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there's something in that. Certainly, there were big fears before the Games (fuelled by the government and organisers) that these Olympics would take place in some sort of militarised zone and feel oppressive and overly corporate, with long queues and endless search points. Warships in the Thames, rocket launchers down the road from my house in Oxleas Wood and fighter planes flying overhead in the days before the opening ceremony didn't do much to change perceptions. <br>In the event it didn't feel like that at all. Once hundreds of thousands of people flooded the venues they changed the atmosphere entirely, aided by the brilliant volunteers and - ironically - the 18,000 troops drafted in. I was happy to be proved wrong.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>3.16pm: Owen is signing off now. Thanks for your comments and questions.

  "<p>Labour should go into the next election promising to reassess every single item of departmental public spending in response to mounting government debt and the pressure on public resources caused by an ageing population, Stella Creasy, a Labour frontbencher has told the Guardian.</p> <p>Creasy, one of the 2010 intake of MPs increasingly making their mark on parliament and best known for her campaigns against legal loan sharks, says Labour should propose a \"zero-budget\" spending review after the election in which every public service is re-examined. She argues that value for money in public spending is a \"progressive agenda\" because the poorest pay most tax.</p> <p>\"The whole idea that we can somehow manage this through salami-slicing does not match either the challenges we face due to demography or the financial mess the country will be left in. What does my generation of politicians do? Do we say, well, we will try our best to limit the damage, or do we say there is a new world out there, and it requires radicalism,\" she said.</p> <p>\"In the next spending review absolutely everything should be on the table and the onus should be not just in the government, but the public, the private sector and the third sector to say where could we work together. We don't need just to switch spending, we need to pool spending.</p> <p>\"Wasting money is not progressive. When the poorest people in our country pay the most tax, the value for money agenda is a progressive agenda.\"</p> <p>Creasy's emphasis on the long-term debt challenge does not clash with Labour policy, but places a focus on an issue that leaders from all parties have sometimes preferred to evade, fearing the electorate's response.</p> <p>It also suggests a determination among the new generation of Labour MPs for the party not to win the next election off the back of the failure of coalition economic policy.</p> <p>She denies the electorate will recoil. \"If we think and talk about all this now, I think we can recover that sense of hope. People have no confidence in the political system right now. That is not about electoral reform, it is about a sense of lack of efficacy. I think we can provide an exciting vision of what kind of country we can become.\"</p> <p>She proposes reconfiguring services to meet the new needs of the public, breaking down departmental silos, engaging citizens, and finding new ways of measuring value in public services through concepts such as social return on investment.</p> <p>She also called for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government spending watchdog, to be given greater powers, including the ability to issue traffic light signals if spending is out of line with stated objectives.</p> <p>Her remarks follow the forecast from the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/08/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-growth-forecasts?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">close to zero growth this year</a>, suggesting the OBR will have to downgrade its growth forecast for a sixth time in the November autumn statement.</p> <p>There have also been several reports from bodies including the Kings Fund, the Local Government Association and the OBR itself on the additional pressures that will be placed on public finances due to long-term demographic changes.</p> <p>The OBR has said rising health, social care and pension costs require a permanent tax increase or spending cut worth \u00a317bn in today's terms in 2017-18, rising to 40% of GDP by 2061-62. The LGA has predicted rising demand for social care and waste services would mean an 80% real-terms cut in other council spending by 2019-20.</p> <p>Creasy, MP for Walthamstow in east London, said: \"You cannot represent a community like this and think about the future of Britain, and not think there is a short-term challenge due to an economy in which there is no confidence, and a political leadership in which no one has confidence. But more fundamentally none of this should blind us to some of the challenges my generation of politicians are going to face. \"This is not one or two people, but a lot of Labour politicians are starting to think about this long-term future. Yes, we have to focus on what we do in the next 18 months to stop the rot.</p> <p>\"It's worrying when you have a governor of the Bank of England admitting: 'There is no growth at all and I do not know when it is going to get better, and I can understand why people are not investing.' But there is a difference about what you can do in the next 18 months to three years, and what you have to do in the next 10 to 20 years.</p> <p>\"The fact is this year we get a trillion pounds of public debt and if we carry on as we are we are going to hit \u00a31bn a week debt repayments by 2014. I campaign about household debt and loan sharks, but I cannot ignore public debt, and its impact on people in my constituency.</p> <p>\"We could be facing an election in 2015 in which the situation is much worse, and there is virtually next to no growth. For those of us who came into politics watching budget after budget, with Labour governments announcing investments in the country, we have to say we owe it to the people we represent we need to think about the next 20 years, and the challenges that will come.</p> <p>\"The challenges my generation are going to face are going to be very different. If you think 65% of our welfare spending already goes on people of over working age. That is going to increase due to demographic changes in our society, and it will put a different set of pressures on the public purse through social care, and our lifestyles. Not to address those issues is to miss the progressive challenges of our generation.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.party.coop/person/stella-creasy/\" title=\"\">Creasy, who also represents the Co-operative party</a>, argues greater public participation in the delivery of public services can be a key to reshaping services effectively, so it is focused on better outcomes, rather than processes.</p> <p>\"I don't think it is progressive to wait for people to get ill, or to write off people with mental health issues. In the 50s and 60s it was infectious diseases, but now it is lifestyle diseases. Almost a tenth of the NHS budget goes on the consequences of failing to deal with the consequences of diabetes earlier.\"</p> <p>She insists that all the evidence shows that where people are involved in reconfiguring services there can be better results \u2013 and better results save money.</p> <p>\"In a way I think the biggest challenge for the left is not going to be money. I think it is going to be control, and being willing to devolve more power to local level, but devolve again and argue: 'If we are going to resolve this you as a user need to have not just more say, but more responsibility.' But I think that is where the public are.</p> <p>\"If the Olympics shows anything it shows the number of people volunteering wanting to be part of something, is huge. People feel that like their local areas and families. It's not about the government getting out the way, it's about being partners.\"</p>",

  "<p>Rail fares in England are set to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/14/rail-fares-rise-january\" title=\"Rail fares to rise by 6.2% in January\">rise by up to 11.2% in January 2013</a>, pushing the cost of some commuter tickets beyond \u00a35,000 a year.</p> <p>The annual price rise is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/inflation-surprise-rise-july\" title=\"UK inflation rises again after recent falls\">linked to July's retail price inflation (RPI) figure, which was 3.2%</a>. The average increase for regulated fares is calculated by adding three percentage points to RPI, meaning an increase of 6.2%, although some tickets can go up by a further five percentage points (or more than 11% overall) as long as they are balanced by cuts on other fares.</p> <p>It is not clear what companies will do with unregulated fares (cheap advance fares, leisure tickets for local journeys and business fares for intercity journeys at busier times of the day), but past experience suggests the only way is up. Here are some ways you might be able to beat the latest increase.</p> <p><strong>Buy the right ticket to fit your lifestyle</strong> Many people are unaware you can buy season tickets that are shorter than a 12-month period. So if you are, for example, going on maternity leave in 17 weeks' time you can ask the booking office for a 17-week season ticket, which will be cheaper than buying a series of monthlies and weeklies. If you work one day a week at home and can switch to off-peak travel for the other four days, you can also reduce your annual bill. You can check the price of season tickets, for any time frame, at National Rail's <a href=\"http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search\" title=\"National Rail Enquiries: Season Ticket Calculator\">season ticket calculator website</a>.</p> <p><strong>Buy your ticket before the end of the year </strong>If your annual ticket expires before the end of the year, you can buy a new one at the current price and delay the pain for 12 months. If it expires a couple of weeks into the new year it will be worth getting your calculator out and checking if you will save money by buying a new one slightly early.</p> <p><strong>Buy carnet tickets </strong>Carnets were introduced by First Capital Connect to offer slightly lower fares to those who travel into London two or three times a week, but not enough to make it cost-effective to buy a season ticket. They were sold in packs of 10 for the price of nine tickets in both peak and off-peak formats. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/31/first-capital-connect-carnet-tickets\" title=\"First Capital Connect raises cost of carnet tickets by 11%\">in May 2012 FCC withdrew the original carnets</a> without warning and replaced them with five return tickets, rather than the 10 singles. They might still represent marginally better value for some commuters.</p> <p><strong>Buy early</strong> To get the lowest fares for non-commuter trips you should book 12 weeks before travel. Contractually, Network Rail must have the timetable set 12 weeks in advance. Therefore, train operators commonly \u2013 though not always \u2013 release cheap advance tickets shortly after.</p> <p><strong>Travel off-peak and super off-peak </strong>If you work flexible hours you might be better off getting in after the morning peak hours. Off-peak and super off-peak times vary by train operator and route, but off-peak tickets are generally not valid on weekdays before 9.30am and between 3.01pm to 6.44pm inclusive, but they are valid on all trains at weekends and on public holidays. Super off-peak tickets are generally not valid on weekdays before 10am or early evening (between 4pm to 6pm) from major cities.</p> <p><strong>Be alert </strong><a href=\"http://www.thetrainline.com\" title=\"Trainline homepage\">The Trainline</a> has a little-known ticket alert system that emails an alert the moment cheap advance tickets for a specific journey come on sale, and these tend to be the cheapest fares. And remember, two singles are often cheaper than a return.</p> <p><strong>Change your route </strong>Check to see if rival operators have cheaper tickets if you take a slightly different route.</p> <p><strong>Look at the Megatrain</strong> The <a href=\"http://uk.megabus.com/default.aspx\" title=\"Megabus homepage\">Megatrain/Megabus website</a> sells hundreds of singles from \u00a31 (plus 50p booking fee) for routes across England and Scotland to about 30 locations on the South West Trains, East Midlands Trains and Virgin Trains networks. But Megatrain only releases tickets 45 days before the date of travel, which is handy for those booking later.</p> <p><strong>Get the bus </strong>On some commuter routes it may be possible to get a bus rather than a train. For example, anyone travelling regularly from Oxford to London can get an <a href=\"http://www.oxfordtube.com/tubefares.aspx\" title=\"Oxford Tube website\">annual travel card on the Oxford Tube for \u00a31,133</a> versus an annual rail ticket for \u00a34,348, although the tube takes approximately 100 minutes compared to an hour for the same journey by train. A month's travel from Stockport to Manchester will cost \u00a344 on the bus \u2013 half the price of a <a href=\"http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/times_fares/promotions/pr93c0eaeb9d4653b48ac9b0307154fb/details.html\" title=\"National Rail fare breakdown\">traincard offering similar flexibility</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Historical romances are not what audiences traditionally associate with Alfred Hitchcock. Yet in 1949, after returning from America, this was the story he decided to tell \u2013 although it almost never saw the light of day. If Under Capricorn is not Hitch's crowning glory, it is undeniably his most underrated film. </p> <p>The story opens as the new governor of New South Wales arrives in Australia with his dandy relative Charles Adare, played with a deliciously camp swagger by Michael Wilding. In an attempt to find his fortune, Adare meets the roguish Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotten). He is married to Charles's childhood friend Lady Henrietta, a woman who spends her days in a gothic colonial mansion, drinking her mysterious past away. Due to the wily schemes of the witch-like housekeeper Milly (a shockingly brilliant performance by Margaret Leighton), Flusky becomes jealous of Adare's affections for his wife.</p> <p>This was an unusual outing for Hitchcock, yet the themes are more than familiar. Many of Hitch's films relish in the dynamic of men who control women and women who control men, and the fear caused by gender ambiguity (particularly in the case of the effete Charles). Under Capricorn is no exception. </p> <p>The feature met with such negative reactions on its release that financiers repossessed the film, making it unavailable for many years \u2013 a reaction that seems, at the least, over the top. Others blamed the initial failure on the scandal caused by its star Ingrid Bergman, who was discovered having an affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini, shocking her fans. </p> <p>Slowly but surely, however, Under Capricorn gleaned much-deserved critical praise, most notably from critic Peter Bogdanovich, who praised it as one of the director's finest \u2013 a point of view I gladly share. It is a masterclass in technical proficiency, making great use of the long take, where scenes average between five and eight minutes in length. Such scenes challenge audiences, used to rapid cuts and edits, yet they are a cinematic wonder to behold. A heartbreaking eight-minute scene with Bergman in focus, confessing her past, is the crowning achievement of the story and, in my opinion, one of the finest performances of her career. </p> <p>Under Capricorn was a victim of circumstance on its release, but why should it remain so? It contains a weight of beauty that should not be ignored. It's time to revive one of Hitch's most unusual and overlooked works.</p>",
  "<p>Promising players, low-level doubts, patchy wins marked by moments of excellence, swelling hope, and then a crash against the first decent side they came up against. Brazil's Olympics ended in disappointment and, as the frustration of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/11/mexico-olympic-football-gold-brazil\" title=\"\">their defeat to Mexico in the final clears</a>, so the post-mortem begins. Brazil were desperate to win Olympic gold for the first time but, with the Confederations Cup representing their only competitive football between now and the start of their World Cup they are hosting in 2014, it was also about preparation.</p> <p>The evidence is contradictory. On the one hand, Brazil are clearly blessed with a highly gifted generation. If home advantage proves a spur rather than an intolerable pressure, that may be enough to carry them to a sixth world title. But the Olympics also exposed the flaw at the heart of Brazilian football, the tension that threatens constantly to bring them down.</p> <p>As Tim Vickery explains in <a href=\"http://www.theblizzard.co.uk/product/issue-six-print/\" title=\"\">Issue Six of The Blizzard (out September)</a>, Brazilian football changed in the 70s. Part of the justification for the military coup in 1964 was the appointment of \"technocrats\" to run the economy and counter rampant inflation. The desire for bureaucratic experts seeped into other areas, including football. There was a desire to measure and to control, a movement that received a boost after the 1974 World Cup when Holland exposed the flaws of the South American style by thrashing Argentina and Uruguay and then beating Brazil with a highly systematised approach. From that moment, the men with the clipboards took over.</p> <p>There was a reversion to the old, individualistic style under Tel\u00ea Santana at the 1982 World Cup \u2013 and to an extent in 1986 \u2013 but thereafter the technocrats have held the upper hand. It's won two World Cups and led Brazil to another final, while radically improving their record in the Copa Am\u00e9rica: until 1997 (in part, it's true, because they hadn't taken the tournament particularly seriously) Brazil had never won the Copa Am\u00e9rica on foreign soil; they went on to win four of the next five.</p> <p>Vickery argues that, contrary to stereotype, Brazil cares more than most places about winning. The defeat to Uruguay in the final game of the 1950 World Cup is still seen as a national catastrophe. Attendance figures fluctuate wildly according to the form of club sides. Success, though, hasn't brought Brazil much love; there's still a harking back to the verve that brought three World Cups between 1958 and 1970. Dunga, having won a Copa Am\u00e9rica and a Confederations Cup, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/04/world-cup-2010-dunga-brazil\" title=\"\">was bundled out of the manager's job</a> for one bad half in the World Cup, largely because his approach was seen as somehow inimical to Brazilian football's self-image.</p> <p>\"Today football is made by technocrats, but also by commerce and marketing,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jul/12/emerson-leao-ney-franco\" title=\"\">said Emerson Le\u00e3o</a>, who saw the change of emphasis as Brazil's goalkeeper at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. \"It's not about romance. What is a technocrat? Somebody who learned from a teacher in college or from a computer and not from the field. Now I'm going to tell you the Brazilian disaster: in the junior section of many professional teams the coaches are 100% technocrats. The president of the team believes in those people, because they come and present a wonderful training plan. Maybe they don't present things harshly as I would. These are the technocrats who appeal to the marketing types. But you have to know how to handle the players; to use psychology.\"</p> <p>A generation has grown up watching Nike adverts showing carefree men with questionable hair-cuts freestyling through airports, cityscapes and prison ships and wondering how that equates to Dunga and C\u00e9sar Sampaio, or Edmilson and Gilberto Silva, or Z\u00e9 Roberto and Gilberto Silva, or Felipe Melo and Gilberto Silva, sitting doggedly in front of the back four. Nike's advertising hasn't created the contradiction that lies at the heart of Brazilian football culture, but it has highlighted it, perhaps even accentuated it.</p> <p>Neymar, poor, overhyped, brilliant Neymar, is compelled to do tricks. It's not enough that his team wins; he must also perform individual miracles and live up to the advertisers' ideal. It is his misfortune to live in the age of an Argentinian genius: he must also confirm to Brazilians with every breath that he is as good, or at least may soon become as good, as Lionel Messi. Pel\u00e9's pursuit of the line that they are equals not merely confirms his debased status as a pundit, but is actually counter-productive, heaping pressure on Neymar and deflecting attention from far more significant issues.</p> <p>The twin pressures on the Brazilian game have resulted in a style of football that recalls Arrigo Sacchi's description of Real Madrid in the galacticos era: it is full of specialists. There are those who dribble and run and shoot, and there are those who sit back and fill the spaces to allow them to do so. It's simplistic and effective against weaker opposition, but vulnerable to more streetwise opponents: even before Mexico beat them, Brazil had stuttered against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/brazil-egypt-football-london-2012\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-brazil-honduras-quarter-final\" title=\"\">Honduras</a>, before being extraordinarily fortunate against South Korea, who should have had two penalties in the semi-final. It also explains why so many of Brazil's holding midfielders are tacklers and distributors like Lucas or shuttlers like Ramires, and so few of them deep-lying creators in the way Falc\u00e3o or Gerson once were.</p> <p>As football elsewhere becomes increasingly about universality, about players being able to perform a multiplicity of roles, it also feels like an old-fashioned style. Old and new came together a year ago today in Pereira, Colombia, in the quarter-final of the Under-20 World Cup. Spain, with their systematised approach, held the ball, passed and passed, worked players into positions and twice scored from crosses from overlapping full-backs. Brazil, thanks largely to the individual excellence of Oscar, Willian, Henrique and Duda, also scored twice, then won on penalties. The quality of their forwards was not in doubt, but it felt like a smash-and-grab. Brazil went on to win the tournament but Spain had been the best side.</p> <p>High-class individuals are not enough, as Brazil found at the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year. Neymar and Ganso were both given their head there and both found it hard to deal with the sort of tough, tight defending they simply they don't experience in Brazil. Brazil failed to beat Paraguay twice and Venezuela before going out in the quarter-final. It wasn't so much that defenders went in hard, but that the willingness of opposing defences to press and close down space in a way that was unfamiliar to them, while referees were far less generous in awarding free-kicks for minimal contact. The frustration the Brazilian coaching staff showed to Mark Clattenburg and his officials in Saturday's Olympic final was another manifestation of that, as Brazil ended up, again and again, dribbling down blind alleys as they were denied to time to measure passes.</p> <p>The far bigger problem was Mano Menezes's baffling decision to start, as he had in the semi-final against South Korea, with Alex Sandro rather than Hulk. Perhaps it was an attempt to bridge the gap between the back and front of midfield, perhaps it was born of a fear of Neymar's reluctance to track the opposing right-back (Oh Jae-suk in the case of South Korea; Israel Jim\u00e9nez in the case of Mexico), but it left Brazil hopelessly unbalanced, with Romulo and Oscar forced to drift right to try to fill the space in front of Rafael. As Rupert Fryer pointed out, it was the lack of anybody ahead of him on that right flank that cost Brazil the first goal, as the Manchester United full-back was forced to turn inside and then underhit his pass to Sandro.</p> <p>In terms of personnel, Brazil look reasonably well placed in their preparations for 2014. A front four of Neymar, Oscar, Hulk and Leandro Dami\u00e3o offers a blend of pace, power and individual skill, knitted together by the vision of Oscar. Lucas and Ramires, while neither is a great long-range passer, will protect the back four. Marcelo on the left and Dani Alves or Maicon on the right are as good an attacking full-back pairing as exists at the moment. Thiago Silva needs a partner at centre-back (Juan? Dede? David Luiz?) and there are serious problems in goal, where J\u00falio C\u00e9sar is in decline and there are no obvious candidates to replace him.</p> <p>Most sides, though, would be delighted to have such a nucleus of players already in place. Brazil's problem is to reconcile them to one unifying philosophy.</p>",

On a giant screen, blinking dots track the agency's 400 patrol cars \u2013 and ensure the vehicles aren't themselves speeding.</p> <p>The service, set up in 2008, is at the heart of an attempt to reduce road deaths in Nigeria. \"We have done a lot through technology and database improvements,\" said the agency's director, Osita Chidoka. \"Every Nigerian knows someone who has died on our roads. Now people don't always have to depend on villagers, who may mean well but are not the best qualified people to be the first to reach an accident scene. I have had people say to me: 'You don't know me, but you saved my life'.\"</p> <p>Statistically, at least, things are looking up: registered crashes have more than halved, to about 5,000 annually; deaths are down a third, to 12 a day. Many other accidents may go unreported. \"Overall it's positive, because our ultimate goal is to bring down deaths,\" said Chidoka. \"But we need to make more investments in enforcement and a culture of safety.\"</p> <p>One floor above his office, staff watched a monitor showing real-time data, from the number of bookings on particular stretches of road to which patrol cars' sirens were switched on. \"This is something we couldn't do before [2008]. Having everything digitised means we can look at if numbers are going up or down and ask ourselves what do we need to do,\" said Janet Adepegba, the information technology director at the centre.</p> <p>Under a pilot scheme, solar-powered speed cameras in the capital, Abuja, can track new licence plates. That coincides with 100,000 more bookings dished out year-on-year. Offenders include on-duty patrol officers \u2013 which, the agency says, shows that it polices its own employees. \"We are trying to improve visibility through technology. Not only are you caught, but people know you're caught,\" Chidoka said.</p> <p>Engineering is also helping. Nigeria has increased the number of paved roads in recent years, often sponsored by multinationals that are also ploughing money into training schemes for drivers of articulated lorries.</p> <p>But there are glitches. Unrolling digitised licence plates nationwide has faltered amid erratic registration price increases, and the speed cameras work intermittently. Complaints of extortion by traffic police are routine.</p> <p>But officials say the most formidable barrier to road safety remains poor driving. \"Speeding is the main problem,\" said Chidoka. \"Road safety is also a class issue in Nigeria \u2013 there's a perception that it only affects poor people. The political will isn't there among people who think: 'I have a good car, an expensive car, so I am safe'. Or they can afford to fly longer distances.\"</p> <p>In an average week, 1.5 million Nigerians cram on to buses. Others turn to motorcycle taxis \u2013 often driven by people with no formal training, in overcrowded cities, and that sends the numbers of fatal crashes spiralling upwards, officials say.</p> <p>Road signs, which have popped up across the country, have a limited impact. \"In Abuja, where the roads are really good, we still see high incidents of accidents,\" said Adepegba. \"You can put the best driver in the best car on a terrible road, or a terrible driver and car on the best road, and both can have the same results.\".</p> <p>On a carpet of crushed glass, Oliver Onyemoes watched a roadside mechanic attend to his battered green taxi. For the second time in a week, the brakes had failed in his 14-year-old car. \"I will drive the car until it stops because I cannot hang myself by not working,\" he said.</p> <p>Sebastian, the garage owner, said: \"Nigeria is like a dumping ground for cars whose lifespan has expired. You know the car is going to break down again because this person has no money to buy a new one. That is why our mechanics can fix cars with their eyes covered.\"</p> <p>Back in Lokoja, as his shift drew to a close, traffic marshal Said watched people collecting spilt fuel from an overturned tanker. \"It's ignorance, yes, but poverty more than that,\" he said. \"If the driver is badly trained, it is because of [a lack of] money. If people are running towards the [fuel, when they] should be thinking 'Let me run away, and live', [they] are desperate to sell some fuel just to make some small money.\"</p>",
  "<p>Apple is claiming that more than a quarter of Samsung's $30.4bn in US smartphone and tablet sales result from copying of the iPhone and iPad or infringe on other patents, a damages expert for the US company said on Monday.</p> <p>But Samsung's lawyers argued that Apple's evidence was not sufficient to merit such an award as the two sides clashed in the San Jose courtroom as the trial entered its third week.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley company is demanding up to $2.75bn of damages from its Korean rival. The figure includes an estimate of profits lost to infringing Samsung gadgets.</p> <p>The South Korean company sold more than 87m mobile devices in the US from mid-2010, when Apple's complaint originates, to March 2012, according to documents displayed before the jury.</p> <p>Accountant Terry Musika, citing Samsung records and testifying as an Apple expert witness, estimated that $8.16bn in revenue, or 22.7m of those total unit sales over that two-year period, came from products that infringed Apple patents, such as the first Galaxy S smartphone in July 2010.</p> <p>Samsung typically does not reveal its sales in the US or elsewhere. Since the third quarter of 2011 it has stopped giving figures for worldwide shipments of its mobile phones, smartphone and tablets. Instead it provides briefings to financial and industry analysts, who then make their own calculations from other industry sources about the totals. Apple, Nokia and BlackBerry maker RIM all declare how many handsets they have shipped in each quarter, while Samsung, HTC, Motorola and Sony have ceased doing so.</p> <p>However, Samsung has been obliged to divulge details of US shipments for a wide range of allegedly infringing phones and tablets. Those have pointed to far smaller figures than many had expected.</p> <h2>Complex calculations</h2> <p>Musika said that his team's calculations suggested that Samsung earned roughly a 35.5% gross profit margin on that revenue, between June 2010 through March 2012, and justified his calculation by saying that it involved a team of 20 programmers, accountants, statisticians and economists to work out the estimated damages at a cost to Apple of $1.75m.</p> <p>\"It's not me sitting at a desk with a calculator,\" Musika, a former KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers accounting partner, told the court. \"There are literally hundreds of millions of calculations.\"</p> <p>But Samsung argued that Apple, which was struggling to keep up with demand for the iPhone 4 from July to October of 2010, did not have the capacity to have delivered on those additional sales. \"Apple couldn't service its own customers with the iPhone 4, but it could service customers it didn't have?\" Samsung attorney Bill Price asked Musika.</p> <p>Price also argued that the damages should vary depending on whether the Samsung products at issue in the lawsuit infringed on just one or all of Apple's patents.</p> <p>Apple's legal battle with its fiercest business rival \u2013 which is also its largest supplier \u2013 has transfixed the global mobile industry. It moves into a technical damages-estimate phase this week. The trial, which began in late July, has seen a procession of executives, designers and patent experts testifying on behalf of the US company. Closing arguments are expected to begin next week.</p> <p>Apple concluded its case on Monday, upon which Samsung's lawyer made a formal request to have the complaint dismissed on the basis that Apple had not proved its case. Judge Lucy Koh listened to about an hour of argument from both sides before determining that it should continue on the basis that the testimony so far was sufficient that a jury should make a determination of whether there was infringement.</p> <p>Because the case is against the US subsidiaries of Samsung Electronics, Koh did drop three phones that are not widely sold in the US, and not sold by Samsung US, from the case. Those are the \"world\" variants of the Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S and Galaxy S2 smartphones. But the US-specific models of those phones remain part of the case, and Apple can still pursue its case against Samsung's parent company on those three phones.</p> <p>The world's most valuable technology company is accusing Samsung, now the leader in smartphones, of copying its iPhone and iPad in various elements of \"trade dress\" \u2013 the cosmetic appearance of the devices \u2013 and infringing a number of patents covering their onscreen operation. The South Korean company denies that and says Apple infringes several of its wireless technology patents.</p> <p>Musika cited Samsung documents that identified the iPhone back in 2007, when the first of the revolutionary smartphones emerged, as one of four major factors defining mobile trends in the ensuing five years.</p> <h2>Prior art?</h2> <p>Samsung called its own expert witnesses on Monday afternoon, seeking to disqualify a number of Apple's patents \u2013 in particular its \"rubber-banding\" effect, in which when a user tries to scroll beyond the top or bottom of an onscreen list, it \"bounces\" back, and its \"pinch to zoom\" two-finger control gesture, and the use of a single finger to move objects onscreen \u2013 by citing university and other products devised in 2003.</p> <p>If the jury decides that Apple's patents are invalid because of such \"prior art\", Samsung might not have to pay any damages under those elements.</p> <h2>Microsoft: no cloning</h2> <p>The trial continues to offer glimpses behind Apple's secretive operations, from its industrial design process to its product marketing machine.</p> <p>On Monday, an Apple executive testified that the company had licensed prized design patents to its one-time bitter rival Microsoft but with an \"anti-cloning agreement\" to prevent copying of its iPhone and iPad. That deal is believed to be part of a licensing deal struck by Steve Jobs with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in 1996 when Apple was in dire straits. Jobs persuaded Gates that Microsoft should cross-license the patents, keep developing Microsoft Office for the Mac platform, and invest $150m in buying non-voting stock in Apple. That deal is believed to be why Apple and Microsoft have not clashed in the courts over any patent issue relating to smartphones since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 \u2013 but in contrast battles with Nokia, Motorola and other handset makers have become commonplace.</p> <p>The decision to license Apple's design patents to Microsoft was consistent with its corporate strategy, Teksler said, because the agreement prohibited Gates's company from manufacturing copies. \"There was no right with respect to these design patents to build clones of any type,\" Teksler said.</p> <p>Apple had contacted Samsung in 2010, hoping to strike an agreement with its rival on patent licensing before their dispute hit the courts, patent licensing director Boris Teksler said. Teksler testified that Apple offered a clutch of patents for licensing but, crucially, viewed patents related to what he called the \"unique user experience\" as a highly protected category.</p> <p>Those included design patents at issue in the lawsuit, covering the look and feel of the iPhone and iPad. Teksler told jurors last week he could count \"on one hand\" the instances Apple has licensed those patents. Samsung was offered other patents at a cost of $20 per handset and $30 per tablet. It declined the offer.</p> <p>Apple filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Jose, California, in April 2011.</p> <p>Apple finished presenting evidence on its own patent claims on Monday, and Samsung began calling witnesses. Koh said she hoped the attorneys would be able to present closing arguments next week.</p>",
  "<p>The success of any marketing department depends on its knowledge and understanding of the customer. In the past, marketing professionals would apply a range of tools to collect this information. They convened focus groups, conducted surveys and solicited feedback directly from their customers. Although these tools were useful, they often lacked rigor and marketing decisions tended to rely on a mixture of intuition and experience, rather than robust data and analysis.</p> <p>Today the opportunities to develop a deep understanding of the customer are greater than ever. We live in a world of big data, where the quantity of information generated by companies is doubling almost every year. Much of this data is unstructured and resides in channels such as social media, email or text messages. For those companies that can harness and analyse this data, it is possible to generate an extraordinarily detailed picture of customer behavior, preferences and trends.</p> <p>The supermarket chain <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/\">Wal-Mart</a> provides a good example of how these skills can be applied. In 2004 the company analysed the buying behavior of shoppers during the hurricane season in America. They found that when storm warnings were announced customers bought the expected items, such as torches and batteries, but there was also a sudden spike in demand for Pop-Tarts, a convenience food, and beer. Armed with this knowledge, the company was able to increase stock levels of these items in storm-hit areas and benefit from a significant increase in sales.</p> <p>Analytics can also help companies to maximise the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns. With the economic downturn putting pressure on company's costs, marketing teams must demonstrate that their efforts add value. They are increasingly in competition for scarce budget allocation so it is vital for them to provide tangible evidence that their campaigns are effective. By developing a better understanding of what works, marketing teams can use that information in their planning, and ensure that their resources are being effectively targeted.</p> <p>The growing importance of analytics and data in customer insight is having a dramatic effect on the marketing profession. Rather than relying on the traditional toolkit and capabilities, marketing departments are becoming huge consumers of data and technology. A recent webinar hosted by Gartner indicated that <a href=\"http://my.gartner.com/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=202&amp;mode=2&amp;PageID=5553&amp;resId=1871515&amp;ref=Webin\">by 2017 chief marketing officers will spend more on information technology than chief information officers</a>.</p> <p>This convergence between marketing and technology is also having a profound impact on the career paths of marketing professionals. New graduates seeking a career in marketing are now expected to possess a much broader set of skills than previously required. In addition to creative flair, strong communication skills and a passion for the customer, aspiring marketing professionals must also demonstrate a strong head for numbers, an understanding of digital media and the ability to analyse complex information. This does not mean that a background in statistics is essential, but it does mean that professionals need to understand the language of analytics and how it can be applied in their role.</p> <p>For graduates or doctorates who have a background in statistics and mathematics, the potential career options are becoming increasingly varied. In the past, these individuals would have headed straight for the finance function or a business analyst role. But the rise of analytics creates huge new opportunities for these individuals to apply their skills in a marketing context and they will often move through the ranks quickly. In recent years, it's become increasingly common to find marketing directors who have a formal background in statistics and, over time, we expect a growing proportion of senior marketing roles will require these capabilities.</p> <p>At present, the level of maturity in analytics varies considerably across industries. In sectors, such as retail or fast-moving consumer goods, these capabilities are already extremely advanced whereas they remain relatively immature in many business-to-business sectors. Over time, however, marketing analytics may well become a core capability for any company, regardless of the sector.</p> <p>This is not to say that marketing departments are being entirely taken over by pure mathematicians. Despite the growing prevalence of a more analytical approach to marketing, the creative skills and passion for the customer remain as critical as ever. When making recruitment decisions, companies will increasingly look for rounded individuals who can combine analytical rigor with the ability to apply this knowledge in a practical and creative context. Art and science have always co-existed in the marketing department, but the relationship between the two is now closer than ever.</p> <p><em>Conor McGovern is senior executive in <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/pages/index.aspx\">Accenture</a> interactive's marketing analytics practice</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\"> Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Creating a Scottish civil service is not as simple and straightforward as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/02/scottish-civil-service-more-than-independence\" title=\"\">David Walker suggests</a>.</p> <p>The debate on Scottish public service delivery has been doing the rounds since the Home Rule campaign of 1978-79, and has been back again more prominently since the election of a Scottish National Party administration in 2007.</p> <p>It is easy to speculate, but there are many factors to be taken into consideration when addressing further delegated powers. The \"Scottish civil service\" does not include UK departments and agencies in Scotland. Far from decoupling from Whitehall, two-thirds of serving civil servants in Scotland are retained in UK departments \u2013 their pay, terms and conditions determined by Westminster not Holyrood.</p> <p>Crucial to Scotland's constitutional future will be how welfare, revenue, customs and defence work in Scotland might come under control of a future Scottish government and what happens to the work carried out by thousands of civil servants in Scotland for other parts of the UK.</p> <p>Scottish government workers were retained as home civil servants in the devolution settlement. Therefore, even they are subject to UK civil service pensions, redundancy compensation schemes and transferability. Pay, however, is devolved to Scottish ministers in the 40 bargaining areas covered by Scottish public sector pay policy.</p> <p>Following years of attack by the UK government on the civil service compensation scheme and the <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/reform-of-the-principal-civil-service-pension-scheme\" title=\"\">Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme</a>, and the slavish adherence by Scottish ministers to UK Cabinet Office pay freeze policies, many PCS members in the Scottish government must now be asking whether the advantages of retaining that home civil service status was worth it, but also whether a Scottish civil service controlled by Scottish ministers of whatever political colour, would actually see any improvements on these fundamentals.</p> <p>The parting shot of Sir John Elvidge, the permanent secretary to the Scottish government before Sir Peter Housden, the present incumbent, was to suggest that local and central government in Scotland could be centralised under one service. Report after report point to the benefits of joined-up governance, the most recent being the findings of the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Review/publicservicescommission\" title=\"\">Christie Commission</a>, chaired by the late Campbell Christie, a former leader of civil service unions.</p> <p>But it has proved impossible is to put any of this into action in any coherent and meaningful way across the silos of the Scottish public sector landscape. Co-location, shared services, IT networks, workforce development, pay coherence, HR functions all remain cumbersomely out of step.</p> <p>Trade unions consistently raise the need to take a long-term view, but our cries fall on deaf ears and closed minds, as to seriously address parity would involved a project scale beyond the one-year budget round or even the five-year Scottish government administrative term.</p> <p>Networks of senior civil servants, chief executives, human resource heads and leaders in health, local government and Scottish public services may come together to discuss these concepts endlessly, but it always comes down to the same barrier: cost.</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>Whatever Scotland decides about its future, it will be essential to have proper consideration and open discussions with those who work every day delivering key public services, who have gone through more restructuring in the past 12 years in Scotland than in the history of the UK civil service and are at the forefront of developing a model for modern Scottish public services accountable to the people of Scotland.</p> <p>And for the record, New St Andrew's House, referred to in Walker's piece, was abandoned some years ago following the discovery of asbestos in the fabric of the building. It has lain empty ever since it was vacated by the Scottish Office and remains a ghost building, a mausoleum to a pre-devolution era.</p> <p><em>Lynn Henderson is the Scottish secretary for the </em><a href=\"http://www.pcs.org.uk/scotland\" title=\"\"><em>Public and Commercial Services Union</em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A few weeks ago, a picture showing hundreds of dark-skinned men splayed across a beach was passed around on Facebook. The men appeared to be either asleep, or more likely, dead. They lay against each other, their faces averted from the camera, while men in fatigues holding semi-automatic weapons towered over them. The caption read: \"Continuity of massacre of Muslims of Burma by Buddhists. More than 1,000 killed yesterday. Please share.\"</p> <p>After some probing, the photograph <a href=\"http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/12867/social-media-is-lying-to-you-about-burmas-muslim-cleansing/\" title=\"\">turned out to be a fake</a>. But all fabrications aside, there actually is a bona fide crisis unfolding along the Burma and Bangladesh border \u2013 despite the poppycock on social media, the sham did raise questions that traditional media have largely ignored.</p> <p>Violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Burma's Rakhine region erupted in June after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18395788\" title=\"\">alleged rape and murder</a> of a Buddhist girl by Muslim men. The scale of violence has led to scores of deaths and the <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/31/burma-government-forces-targeting-rohingya-muslims-0\" title=\"\">mass displacement of tens of thousands of people</a>. After a state of emergency was declared in the province, the entry of Burma's security forces lent another dimension to this conflict. Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19\" title=\"\">said in early August</a> that Rakhine Buddhists, together with security forces, purposefully meted out devastating violence against the Muslim minority.</p> <p>This violence is only the latest chapter in a long history of state-sponsored repression against the Rohingya. It began when Burma began its project of \"Burmanisation\" in the 1950s, with its lofty aims for racial purity and the nationalisation of resources following the end of British rule. The minority was targeted in pogroms in 1978, <a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/suu-kyi-must-not-ignore-the-rohingya-1.122681\" title=\"\">stripped of their citizenship in 1982</a> and became the perfect foil for rampant human rights abuse, including slave labour and torture, that <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ishak-mia-sohel/plight-of-rohingyas-in-myanmar-international-community-and-aung-sung-suu-kyi_\" title=\"\">led to a second exodus into Bangladesh</a> in 1991-1992.</p> <p>But not only are the Rohingya a disenfranchised people, they are dark-skinned Muslims with little relevance, representation and significance to anyone. Unable to deal with a matter the much-vaunted Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has not endorsed, the western world has tiptoed around the issue. Aung San Suu Kyi's silence is evidently an attempt to placate her constituency ahead of general elections in 2015, and to criticise her now would be like admonishing Nelson Mandela in the run-up to the 1994 election in South Africa. But unlike South Africa in the 1990s, Burma is not on the verge of some tremendous political shakeup; while the Rohingya are being sacrificed as collateral damage in the greater project of the democratisation of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi is missing an extraordinary opportunity to live up to her reputation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in that parallel universe known as the \"Muslim world\", the Rohingyas have joined Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of flagship Muslim causes. In a region that is home to the world's greatest concentration of Muslims, the delayed reaction of neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei is startling. Last week, Bangladesh, another Muslim country, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19125916\" title=\"\">ordered three NGOs</a> to stop providing food and other humanitarian assistance to Rohingyas in the border area, claiming it did not want to encourage more asylum seekers to its shores. Already 40,000 unregistered Rohingyas live in makeshift camps in Bangladesh, and <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e487546.html\" title=\"\">according to the UN Refugee Agency</a>, the latest violence will result in a greater influx of people \u2013 whether Bangladesh likes it or not.</p> <p>While Burma's Muslim neighbours struggle to respond, Saudi Arabia has thrown money at the problem. It has fallen to Turkey to <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/fm-davutoglu-pledges-to-help-rohingya-muslims.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27556&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">act decisively</a> by further extending its newly found benevolence to the Islamic world. As images of the Turkish prime minister's wife <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEfniqNel0g&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fb_source=message\" title=\"\">sobbing</a> as she witnessed the effects of the violence herself begin to be passed around online \u2013 further cementing the Rohingya cause to the long list of Muslims' suffering \u2013 Muslim prayers have bemoaned the global silence as proof of the grand conspiracy against Islam. And yet little is being done by Muslims to actually reverse the treatment of their purported brethren themselves.</p> <p>It all makes for a rather disempowering picture, but it doesn't have to. Given how fast a fake picture can spread its way across the world, imagine what we could do with a little engagement.</p>",
  "<p>A police officer and a bystander were killed and others injured Monday during a shoot-out with a gunman near a college campus in Texas.</p> <p>The officer received a fatal wound after reportedly trying to serve an eviction notice at a home close to A&amp;M University. The gunfire prompted college officials to issue a \"maroon alert\" to any students still on campus during the summer break, warning them to stay indoors.</p> <p>A man at the address was also killed in the exchange of fire, while at least three others \u2013 including two law enforcement officers \u2013 were injured. The gunman was shot and later died, police officials said.</p> <p>Assistant police chief Scott McCollum named the dead officer as 41-year-old Brian Bachmann. He described as a constable in the local force, and was killed after confronting the gunman at an address in College Station, around 90 miles north-west of Houston.</p> <p>Local news reports suggest he was attempting to serve an eviction at the time of the shooting.</p> <p>McCollum said that backup arrived at the home, by which time \"there was a constable down on the front yard\". An exchange of fire took place, during which two other officers were also wounded by the gunman. The suspect was shot and later pronounced dead.</p> <p>The shooting led to officials at A&amp;M University posting a message on its website shortly before 12.30pm local time, warning students and staff of an active shooter at an intersection close to campus. \"Please avoid the area. Residents in the immediate area need to remain in their residence,\" it stated.</p> <p>At 12.44pm another message was posted confirming that the gunman had been taken into custody.</p> <p>Of the two other injured police officers, it is thought one was shot in the leg. Neither are thought to be in a life-threatening condition. It is not immediately clear if the two others shot in the incident were hit by the gunman's bullets or by police returning fire.</p> <p>A female bystander was taken to hospital and was undergoing surgery on Monday afternoon.</p>",
  "<p>It might sound strange, but it was more of an honour to be nominated for the Social Enterprise Unsung Hero award than to win it. That's not to say I wasn't pleased, but to know my colleagues had taken the time and effort to put me forward was really something.</p> <p>The past year has been extraordinary, not just for me but for the whole team at <a href=\"http://www.thirdsectorhebrides.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Third Sector Hebrides</a>. Based in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, a chain of islands just 150 miles long, we run seven trading social enterprises.</p> <p>We're a 40-strong team, and it's been 28 years since I joined the organisation. I was the only employee, supported by a committee, and was armed with a \u00a324,000 grant we needed to overhaul what we were doing.</p> <p>Fast forward to 2012, our turnover is \u00a31m \u2013 not bad in a population of 26,400 people. We've recently expanded our facilities through the purchase of a 1.4 acre site, which was formally part of a tweed mill. As well as acquiring a new asset, it also serves as the base for Staran CIC, our ground maintenance and landscaping enterprise. With the bigger space we've grown our community transport hub, adding another 12 minibuses. Fuelled by a larger fleet we've tendered for (and won) more contracts.</p> <p>The 2,000-square metre \"shed\" is home to a new micro enterprise too, which we believe is the first social enterprise MOT station in the UK. We're now able to service our own vehicles, which keeps costs down and means we can do repairs quickly.</p> <p>We bought the equipment from a garage that was closing down. While the owner wanted to sell up, the community was going to lose a valued business and a young mechanic his job. It was an opportunity for the taking. We employed the mechanic as part of the team and over the winter got ourselves ready for business. This included registering the CIC with the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/\" title=\"\">Vehicle and Operator Services Agency</a> (VOSA), who had not come across a social enterprise garage before.</p> <p>The enterprise is getting a good stream of customers, many of whom come in via referrals from nearby garages that don't offer MOT services.</p> <p>The next thing on the to-do list is to recruit another employee. Getting people into training and employment is one of our social missions and this year we helped 66 young people into work through the Future Jobs Fund. And one of our social enterprises, <a href=\"http://www.hebrideanchocolates.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hebridean Chocolates</a>, which produces quality handmade chocolates and has a workforce that includes people with physical and learning disabilities.</p> <p>To tackle unemployment we have been working with community organisations across the Hebrides. Almost a third of households (29%) are now on the edge of poverty. Faced with these realities, we have been frustrated by the Work Programme \u2013 delivering it has not been easy in a rural environment. It is no surprise when faced with so few opportunities that people take action. We're seeing this in the islands. People are getting together to use \"community right to buy\" legislation to acquire substantial plots of land and estates. There's a quiet revolution going on, and its capturing people's imaginations both near and far.</p> <p>We've just hosted a visit from a representative of the Youth Council of Croatia who wanted to see firsthand how we do things. We're also helping inform the Croatian government about social enterprise. It's sharing this best practice that makes me realise how much we've learnt along the way. Other countries are only just exploring what social enterprise can do for their people and their communities, and the <a href=\"http://activecitizens.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">British Council's Active Citizens</a> programme is helping to facilitate these international exchanges.</p> <p>Crucial to our success has been to know our long-term goals. It helps keep an organisation on track but allows for flexibility. It doesn't matter the road you take as long as you're delivering your social mission on the way.</p> <p>I also believe in keeping your eyes peeled for opportunities and building good relationships with everybody you meet. We had rented the \"shed\" for six months and were able to buy it at a good price because the seller has been able to witness the work that went on. People see social enterprise at work and want to contribute. Now, not only can we plan long term (key to our sustained growth) but we've got assets in property to the value of \u00a31.4m. I'm already wondering what's the round the corner and what other opportunities are on the horizon, but I guess that comes with the job.</p> <p><em>Alasdair Nicholson, chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.thirdsectorhebrides.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Third Sector Hebrides</em></a><em>, the winner of the Social Enterprise Unsung Hero award 2011. </em><a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>The 2012 Social Enterprise awards are now open for applications</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

A regular ARM-powered smartphone, such as an iPhone 4S, is some 12-13 orders of magnitude more powerful as a computing device than a late 1970s-vintage Cray 1 supercomputer, but consumes milliwatts of power for computing (rather than radio) operations, rather than the 115 kilowatts of the Cray.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-07/should-twitter-charge-users-pay-them-or-both\">Should Twitter charge users, pay them - or both? &gt;&gt; Businessweek</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Godin's solution is similar to Caldwell's model for his new venture, App.net: While Caldwell wants to make user and developer fees the primary revenue source for his network, Godin suggests that Twitter should charge users for a variety of features that only power users are likely to want--such things as advanced analytics, verification (which some users have already been given, but only on a case-by-case basis decided by Twitter), or other enhancements.

  "<p>Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, sold stock in US banks on the same day he attended a confidential meeting where top level officials disclosed the sector was heading for a deep crisis.</p> <p>The congressman on Monday denied profiting from information gleaned from the meeting on 18 September 2008 when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, then treasury secretary Hank Paulson and others outlined their fears for the banking sector. His office said he had no control over the trades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/paul-ryan-donald-trump-republican-national-convention-chair\">Paul Ryan offers to step down as GOP convention chair if Donald Trump asks</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.the-richmonder.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-traded-on-insider-information.html\">Public records show </a>that on the same day as the meeting, Ryan sold stock in troubled banks including Wachovia and Citigroup and bought shares in Goldman Sachs, Paulson\u2019s old employer and a bank that had been disclosed to be stronger than many of its rivals. The sale was not illegal at the time.</p> <p>Not long after the meeting, Wachovia\u2019s already troubled share price went into free fall. It plunged 39% on the afternoon of 26 September alone as investors worried the bank would collapse. It was eventually taken over by Wells Fargo for $15bn, a fraction of its former value. </p> <p>Citigroup\u2019s share price fell soon after the meeting. In October 2008 Citigroup was among the largest beneficiary of the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), the taxpayer-funded bailout of the banking sector.</p> <p>Ryan was a supporter of the Tarp bailout \u2013 a position that has put him at odds with the right wing of his party despite his otherwise conservative credentials. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are now among his largest financial supporters, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;cid=N00004357&amp;type=I\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>.</p> <p>The trades were highlighted at the weekend by <a href=\"http://www.the-richmonder.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-traded-on-insider-information.html\">the Richmonder</a>, a left-leaning political blog in Virginia. </p> <p>After the story was picked up by the media on Monday, the Romney campaign moved to deny it. <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-insider-trading-rumor-quickly-debunked.php?ref=fpnewsfeed\">Talking Points Memo quoted Larry Gaffney</a>, an independent accountant for the partnership that handled the trades questioned by commentators, said the shares were not controlled by Ryan.</p> <p>\u201cTrades are done automatically based on an algorithm on a regular basis,\u201d said Gaffney, in a statement to TPM that was provided by the Romney campaign. \u201cIn addition, this index was held at the time within a partnership in which Rep. Ryan had and continues to have no trading authority.\u201d</p> <p>Until this year members of Congress were allowed to trade on price-sensitive information gathered at Washington meetings. Nor is Ryan alone in having done so. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7388130n/\">CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes </a>criticised Democrat Nancy Pelosi for buying into Visa\u2019s initial public offering as the House discussed credit card legislation.</p> <p>After the CBS documentary, pressure mounted for change. In April, Barack Obama signed legislation that bars members of Congress and other federal workers from profiting from non-public information learned on the job. As well as banning insider trading the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (Stock) Act requires members of Congress to post details of transactions exceeding $1,000.</p> <p>In April the Office of Congressional Ethics cleared Spencer Bachus, Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, of allegations of insider dealing. Critics had charged he had taken advantage of insider information to trade shares on numerous occasions.</p> <p>Bachus was present at the meeting that Ryan attended with Bernanke and Paulson. The next day he traded \u201cshort\u201d options, betting on a decline in share prices in the financial services sector.</p> <p>Attendees at the meeting have said Bernanke and Paulson\u2019s warnings were met with stunned silence. \u201cWhen you listened to him describe it you gulped,\u201d Senator Charles Schumer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/washington/19cnd-cong.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated at 9.30pm ET on 13 August to reflect a denial of impropriety by on the part of Ryan.</p>"
