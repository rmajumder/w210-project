  "<p>What happens once iPhone and iPad users update to iOS 6 and try the Maps app? Do they stick with it, or do they decide - in line with chief executive Tim Cook's \"extremely sorry\" letter on Apple's site - that it isn't up to standard?</p> <p><a href=\"http://snappli.com/\">Snappli</a>, which makes a data-compression service for iPhone users (so in that sense rather like what RIM provides for users of its BlackBerry handsets) has been monitoring what has been happening over the past week since people began upgrading to iOS 6, and in particular with the change from offering Google data to Apple's own data.</p> <p>The graph is below: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396886271\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/29/1348874011135/gmaps-ios.png\" alt=\"Data use: maps on iOS 5 v iOS 6\" width=\"460\" height=\"325\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snappli data on maps data use in iOS 5 (blue) and iOS 6 (red)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eldar Tuvey of Snappli says the figures are as follows: </p> <p>\u2022 64% of our users in the past week are now on iOS 6 (UK and US) - in fact 16% upgraded to iOS on the first day</p> <p> \u2022 Before the upgrade to iOS6, 25% of our users were viewing Google maps at least once a day</p> <p>\u2022 Once they moved to iOS6, that immediately went to 35% of users using Apple Maps</p> <p>\u2022 However, over the next five days that drops down to 4%</p> <p>In summary, says Tuvey, \"Before iOS 6, one in four people were using Google Maps [daily]; after iOS 6, one in 25 are using Apple Maps daily, and that figure is falling\u2026.\"</p> <p>On its face, this is pretty damning: people aren't downloading any data through Apple Maps. So they can't be using it, surely?</p> <p>Except there's one confounding factor: Google's maps on iOS 5 use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics\">raster graphics</a>; Apple's Maps on iOS 6 use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics\">vector graphics</a> (the same format as Nokia, and as Google's Maps on Android).</p> <h2>Raster, vector, data</h2> <p>The key difference between raster and vector graphics is that raster graphics are a fixed-frame set - essentially, a picture - whereas vector graphics are files where the images they encode can be scaled up or down without requiring any extra data. There is a cost in terms of CPU to using vector graphics - but the big advantage is that you don't have to download any extra data once you have the tile.</p> <p>Let <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics\">Wikipedia explain it: </a></p> <blockquote> <p>Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygon(s), which are all based on mathematical expressions, to represent images in computer graphics. \"Vector\", in this context, implies more than a straight line.</p> <p>Vector graphics is based on images made up of vectors (also called paths, or strokes) which lead through locations called control points. Each of these points has a definite position on the x and y axes of the work plan. Each point, as well, is a variety of database, including the location of the point in the work space and the direction of the vector (which is what defines the direction of the track). Each track can be assigned a color, a shape, a thickness and also a fill. This does not affect the size of the files in a substantial way because all information resides in the structure; it describes how to draw the vector.</p> </blockquote> <p>The key difference is that Google Maps on iOS 5, because it uses raster graphics, needs repeated downloads. You'll see this if you load a page on maps.google.com in iOS 5, then turn the phone to Airplane mode - so the Wi-Fi and data connections are off - and then try to scroll off the page. You'll hit a blank spot because there isn't any data.</p> <p>By contrast, the vector graphics used in Apple Maps don't require extra downloads. You can confirm this by loading a page (choose your own location, for simplicity), and then turning the data connections off. Now try scrolling across the page: it will load. You'll be able to see detail in your surrounding area. You'll be able to zoom in and out. If you're in a car or train, you should find that you can track your travel - even plan your route, to some extent - with zero extra data. The whole of the UK is encapsulated in less than 200MB, according to data from CoPilot.</p> <h2>Korea factor</h2> <p>That was certainly my experience earlier this week in Korea, where on a visit to Samsung I had an iPhone running iOS 6 which had no data contract. One evening I looked at the overview of North and South Korea (it turns out Apple's Maps offer more detail than Google does for North Korea; the latter's is just a white blank). The next day, with zero data coverage, we were taken on a coach trip to a Samsung production facility.</p> <p>The phone tracked our entire journey, with street-level data including the names of shops, all the way. And all the way back. And then, later, out to the airport. All that, without getting a single extra drop of data.</p> <p>The day starts in Seoul, on a bus. I took more than 100 screenshots during this trip with zooms at all sorts of levels of detail. This is only the tiniest, illustrative selection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396886272\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/29/1348874164662/seoul-1.png\" alt=\"Seoul on Apple maps\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seoul, mapped on an iPhone on iOS 6 with no data.

The time lapse between some of the screenshots is due to the visit paid to Samsung's memory factory. There weren't any data sources there.</p> <p>Bottom line: vector mapping is powerful. </p> <p>So while there's absolutely no reason to doubt that Snappli is correct in what it shows about the amount of <em>data</em> being downloaded by iOS 6 users, it might be worth pondering whether that's actually representative of <em>time spent</em> on maps. That's likely to stay much the same.</p> <p>For one thing, if people use maps a lot - as the figures seem to suggest they do - it's odd if they go from using them a lot (iOS 5) to using them a lot (iOS 6 first install) and then not using them at all (as the graph implies). If Apple Maps is so <em>unbelievably</em> terrible, wouldn't you expect to see an uptick in the graph in the use of Google maps data again (since Snappli can see where the data demand is coming from)? Yes, you would.</p> <p>Personally - I'll repeat, since people seem to think I'm making this up - I have found Apple's maps to be fine. I haven't been horrified by the lack of detail compared to Google Maps. </p> <p>Certainly, they're sparse - but the ability (at last) to turn the map around, tilt it in 3D, and <em>especially</em> navigate to locations using voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation - particularly when you add the ability to get Siri to set up the navigation without having to take the phone out of your pocket (wearing a mic and headset, or Bluetooth earpiece/mic) - means, I think, you have something far, far better than what preceded it. I've personally used it multiple times and been very satisfied by it.</p> <p>Imagine: two weeks ago, if you used an iPhone you'd have to look at your screen to get turn-by-turn (with no voice guidance); you couldn't set it up via Siri; you'd have to hope your data connection was good as you moved around the country or city. (Of that, there's no guarantee.) Yes, you did have transit data built into Google Maps. (You now, if you try to use the public transport option in routing with Maps, get pointed to apps in the App Store to plan the route. Great for app developers.)</p> <p>By contrast, what the iPhone has now in terms of functionality (if not uniform data quality) finally matches what Android and Nokia have had for some time. Vector graphics change the game compared to raster graphics; and turn-by-turn, enormously important in Apple's main market of the US (because so much time is spent driving). Google and Apple couldn't agree on terms for Google to license either element; Google wanted more branding in the app, and to use its Latitude user-tracking service in the app. Apple resisted both and built up its mapping expertise.</p> <p>Clearly, there's a lot of anger out there about Apple's Maps. (There's a lot of schadenfreude too, I think.) Apple didn't get it right, by a long chalk; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology\">Tim Cook acknowledged that</a>. But Apple equally didn't feel it could leave mapping to someone else.</p> <p>Personally, I haven't been let down by Apple's Maps. In the brief time I had to test them while reviewing the iPhone 5, they seemed - as I said at the time - good. And miles better in many regards than what preceded them (shall I repeat? Voice navigation inegrated with Siri, vector mapping). </p> <p>Clearly, their quality varies enormously for different people in different places. In Ontario, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.mtonic.com/applemaps/\">quality in place names looks dire</a>. In the UK, by contrast, the <a href=\"http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/products/50k-gazetteer/index.html\">Ordnance Survey gazetteer</a> has 250,000 place names and details - and is free, open data. (Remember a campaign for free map data in the UK?) Possibly that has helped; and the fact that Canada doesn't have the same regime may have made it harder there. The US also has enormously variable data quality at the local and national level, whereas the Ordnance Survey is world-renowned for the quality of its work. Let's hear it for free data, then. (Criticisms of the satellite pictures - many gathered on <a href=\"http://theamazingios6maps.tumblr.com/\">Amazing iOS 6 Maps</a> - seem by-the-by. If you really use satellite pictures to navigate, you're either an astronaut or a pilot, and in either case shouldn't be using an iPhone.)</p> <h2>All fields?</h2> <p>The reality though is that Apple still has a problem on its hands - which Tim Cook has acknowledged. But equally, even while it is conceding at least seven years' experience of offering public maps to Google, it is a company that has a lot of resources - not least those billions in the bank. People might not be pleased with Apple's maps right now. But it's going to be fascinating to see where it is in a year's time.</p>",
  "<p>Fox News was forced to apologise on Friday after showing a man shooting himself in the head on live television.</p> <p>The network was broadcasting a car chase \u2013 a staple of cable news \u2013 when at about 3.30pm the suspect dumped the car, stumbled down a track, put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. </p> <p>Sergeant Tommy Thompson from the Phoenix police department said the man died at the scene. \"Efforts to revive him were futile\", Thompson said. \"He died of his injuries.\" Thompson said the man had stolen the car, a Dodge Caliber, at gunpoint before the chase began. He fired at police officers in pursuit and at a police helicopter before shooting himself, Thompson added.</p> <p>While Fox issued an immediate and unqualified apology, other websites \u2013 including the vogueish social news site <a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\">Buzzfeed</a> and longer-established rival <a href=\"http://gawker.com\">Gawker</a> \u2013&#xa0;chose to re-publish unedited video of the apparent suicide.</p> <p>The incident raised questions about the fascination of US news networks with car chases, as well as the lengths to which popular websites will go to attract an audience.</p> <p>For much of Friday afternoon, Fox News had been streaming helicopter footage, with a voiceover commentary from host Shepard Smith, of a car chase near Phoenix, Arizona. For part of the time, police were pursuing the Dodge through the state. By mid-afternoon, police had stopped following the car, but it continued to be tracked by media helicopters. </p> <p>Just before 3.30pm the vehicle had slowed to a crawl; the driver turned off the road and onto a dirt track. The driver's door was slightly ajar as the car advanced through the field, before coming to a halt after around 15 seconds. A man wearing a dark sports shirt stepped out of the car, and appeared to reach back inside before walking away.</p> <p>The man looked around him before stumbling down the dirt track and then into long grass. He stopped, raised what appeared to be a gun to his head, and fell to the ground.</p> <p>Fox News went back to the studio, where Smith was seen looking off camera and shouting: \"Get off it, get off it.\" The network swiftly cut to a commercial break.</p> <p>When Smith returned, he apologised for the graphic coverage, saying that the channel had been carrying the chase on a delay to avoid such an incident, but had made a mistake in broadcasting it anyway.</p> <p>\"While we were taking that car chase and showing it to you live, when the guy pulled over and got out of the vehicle, we went on delay,\" Smith said.</p> <p>\"We created a five-second delay so that we would see in the studio what was happening five [seconds] before you did, so if anything went horribly wrong we were able to cut away from it.\"</p> <p>\"We really messed up, and we're all very sorry. That didn't belong on television. We took every precaution ... I personally apologise to you that that happened,\" Shepherd continued.</p> <p>\"It's not time appropriate, it's not sensitive: it's just wrong,\" he said. \"That won't happen again on my watch, and I'm terribly sorry,\" Smith said.</p> <p>Fox News did not immediately respond to the Guardian's request for comment. </p> <p>Officers did not appear to be following the car at the time the man abandoned it.</p> <p>After Fox News apologised for its error, the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/\">Buzzfeed</a> website posted a clip of the incident on its website. It offered users an edited version without the apparent suicide, and an unedited version.</p> <p>Fox later issued a statement: \"We took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay. Unfortunately, this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen.\"</p> <p>Buzzfeed also issued a statement, which said: \"Making an editorial decision on how to cover a sensitive, tragic news event like this is never an easy one. But it is, indeed, a news event and we are a news organization. We posted both an edited version and the full version and we respect our readers' judgment.\"</p> <p>Gawker writer <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5947440/car-chases-live-tv-and-ethics?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&amp;utm_source=gawker_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">Hamilton Nolan posted</a>: \"Some Gawker staffers were against publishing the clip. My position was that it is clearly news, and that we should run it on that basis. When we heard that Fox News had aired a suicide, what was the first thing we all did? Search on the internet for the clip. The clip is news. It is unpleasant, but it is news.

  "<p>Two years ago, it called time on Big Brother in advance of a \"fundamental creative overhaul\". But on Saturday Channel&#xa0;4 opens its doors on its latest reality project, as visitors check in to Hotel GB.</p> <p>Successful applicants will stay in a building full of cameras, and be beamed into living rooms \u2013 but they will also be welcome to leave should the service not come up to scratch.</p> <p>\"I think this is trying to do something completely different from Big Brother, which was looking at Channel 4 from the outside in,\" said Jay Hunt, the broadcaster's chief creative officer, adding: \"Channel 4 is back.\"</p> <p>Taking issue with the food probably isn't for the faint-hearted: in a twist to the reality format, the broadcaster's most prized lifestyle stars will be running the hotel \u2013 with the perpetually swearing Gordon Ramsay presiding over the dining room.</p> <p>Already, an altercation over a vegetarian main has resulted in a well-oiled group of 40 diners at an engagement supper being turfed out of the hotel's grey linen-lined walls before it was even officially open for business. \"They weren't dry runs, they were disaster runs,\" said the chef, talking to journalists about trial days before the week-long experiment. \"We turned Hotel GB into Hotel GBH.\"</p> <p>If the threat of Ramsay isn't enough to get troublesome customers into line, no-nonsense Mary Portas, trademark orange bob gleaming, will be overseeing the rooms side of the business as general manager, with How Clean is Your House's Kim Woodburn \u2013 \"I've already seen everything. Nothing can shock me, love\" \u2013 keeping things spick and span. Given that Portas said she had already found \"a moist rubber gimp outfit in a Tesco bag\" in one of the rooms and been asked if she could provide \"company\" for another guest, Woodburn's unshockability might be tested a little.</p> <p>Seemingly determined to showcase all their lifestyle talent, Channel 4 has also shoe-horned into hotel roles Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer \u2013 as concierge and ma\u00eetre d' respectively \u2013 and Gok Wan, busy designing cocktails as manager of Hotel GB's Chesterfield-heavy bar.</p> <p>Embarrassing Bodies' Dr Christian Jessen will run the gym, while Katie Piper, a TV presenter and former model whose face was rebuilt after an acid attack \u2013 and who did at least used to work in a salon \u2013 will run the spa.</p> <p>Business guru Hilary Devey, somewhat unfathomably, will run House of Devey: a hotel shop selling everything, she said, from evening gowns to dog outfits. Ensconced in Hotel GB's penthouse with her teacup yorkshire terriers Mixie and Dixie, Devey pre-empted the almost inevitable clashing of egos by demanding Ramsay cook her pets special meals \u2013 \"kidneys, liver, chicken with no seasoning, and very lightly steamed carrots\" \u2013 before saying she wanted to cure him of his swearing.</p> <p>\"I've brought a thesaurus and a dictionary to help teach Gordon Ramsay a new word instead of the f-word,\" she said. \"It's unnecessary; the English language is very beautiful.\"</p> <p>For his part, Ramsay replied: \"She's in for a massive bollocking.\"</p> <p>Were the idea of Hotel GB not quite odd enough, Channel 4 has also upped the ante by taking inspiration from other factual entertainment shows. Big Brother filming aside, the celebrities will compete in two teams to make the most money. In an initially outrageous-sounding departure from Big Brother, guests at Hotel GB must pay for their stay: a double room costs \u00a3100 a night, while a personal training session will set you back \u00a330, or a full leg wax \u00a320.</p> <p>The cash will go to The Prince's Trust and The Springboard Charity \u2013 which work to tackle youth unemployment. This ties in with the third aspect of Hotel GB: as well as showing us guests and celebrities inside the hotel, Channel 4 has selected 14 trainees, with the aim of finding them work by the end of the show's week-long run.</p> <p>How that soup of ideas will translate to screen remains to be seen: Channel 4 will be hoping that it revolutionises television as Big Brother did before it. \"In a sense the joy of this is its unpredictability. The moments the audience will love are the things nobody can predict happening,\" said Hunt.</p> <p><em>Hotel GB airs </em>Monday 1 October to Friday 5 October<em>at 9pm</em></p>",

Filthy Bostonian Rob Delaney's in a slightly different category, though \u2013 he's a comedian who owes his big break entirely to his judicious, frequently disgusting and hilarious tweets. In the last few years he's been frequently dubbed the funniest man on Twitter, and he's now coming over here to prove he can cut it on stage too. He's certainly not the kind of performer to find favour with the fainthearted, thanks to his love of gratuitous sexual imagery, celebrity insults and all-round taboo-smashing, and it's no surprise that he's highly-rated by the likes of fellow filthmeister Frankie Boyle. But there's an edge of playful silliness in Delaney's stuff that's often absent from the (no less amusing) clanking comedy fist of Boyle, and means that he delivers much more than simple offensive shock value.</p> <p><em>Soho Theatre, W1, Mon to 6 Oct; Bloomsbury Theatre, WC1, Thu &amp; Fri</em></p> <h2>Tony Law, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396781100\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348746714305/Tony-Law-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Law\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Law</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recognition's been a long time coming for unique Canadian comic Tony Law, but an Edinburgh comedy award nomination this summer means his own particular brand of sanity-mangling surrealism could finally be getting the respect it deserves.

On a more positive note, it was also when Nas recorded easily his best album: Illmatic. It was a bleak and cinematic view of project life widely reckoned as a game-changer. A rap Definitely Maybe, Illmatic made Nas's name, but also raised unreasonable expectations about what he might be capable of.

  "<p>In 2007, Barbara and Harry Cooper went through a terrible year. Their daughter, Carol, died of cancer, then six months later their son, Jan, had an unexpected, fatal heart attack. On top of that, the couple's own health deteriorated. Barbara had a heart attack and lost weight. Harry had several falls, and his mobility was impaired. Both frequently forgot to take their medication. Harry was 95, Barbara was 90.</p> <p>The couple initially refused to admit they needed help, unwilling to acknowledge that they were not as independent as they had been. Only after months of persistence from their granddaughters did they agree to move&#xa0;into an apartment at an assisted living complex in Los Angeles. By this&#xa0;time, they needed something positive and fun to do, so their granddaughters Kim and Chinta (Jan's children by different mothers) introduced them to&#xa0;the internet.</p> <p>They set up a blog, <a href=\"http://www.the-ogs.com/\" title=\"\">the Original Grandparents</a>, and started making videos of Barbara and Harry telling stories, singing songs and offering advice. The <a href=\"http://www.the-ogs.com/\" title=\"blog\">blog</a> was intended just for family but slowly the number of visits increased as more and more people came to Barbara for advice.</p> <p>Today, Barbara, who is now 94 and is known by the nickname Cutie, has a huge following, with nearly 6,000 Facebook fans asking for help on everything from how to end a relationship to how to handle teenage daughters.</p> <p>Recently, there was a letter from a 48-year-old man whose girlfriend won't commit. It worries him that she stays in touch with all her exes. He doesn't know what to do. \"The question I have is, should I stay or should I just move on?\" He signs off under the pseudonym Perplexed.</p> <p>The reply is no-nonsense \u2013 even bossy \u2013 as every good advice column should be. \"Dear Perplexed,\" writes Barbara. \"She better make up her mind about what she wants. If there are boyfriends in the past that she is considering, then&#xa0;drop her ... If she is thinking, 'maybe this', 'maybe that', that's not&#xa0;good enough. You deserve to be with someone who knows what they want.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396771425\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348677794122/barbara-cooper-001.jpg\" alt=\"barbara cooper\" width=\"300\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara with granddaughters, Kim (left) and Chinta</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barbara has always loved giving advice. \"If I ever tell her I've got a crush on someone, she'll always tell me to go straight up and tell them,\" says Chinta, 23. \"She'll keep saying, 'Just talk to them!', I say 'I can't!' and it goes on and on. But I always consult&#xa0;her. She's usually very&#xa0;supportive.\"</p> <p>Now, with Kim and Chinta's help, Barbara's advice has progressed from an online blog into a book, Fall in Love For Life, which was published this month. There have also been <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128489672\" title=\"\">interviews on National Public Radio</a> and in the <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/13/local/la-me-grandparents-20100614\" title=\"\">Los Angeles Times</a>. Everybody wants to learn from Barbara about how to maintain a happy, successful relationship. She should know \u2013 she was married to Harry for 73 years before he died in 2010.</p> <p>\"Barbara is a pretty sharp girl,\" he once said. \"I've benefited from her advice since 1937 and, usually, she steers me right. Ask her \u2013 I don't do anything without Barbara's advice.\"</p> <p>Like many of their generation, Barbara and Harry married young. They met in 1937, were engaged within months and married the same year. She was 20, he 25. As newlyweds in love but who didn't initially know each other very well, they worked things out as they went along. They lived simply and happily, within their means and didn't complicate matters unnecessarily.</p> <p>Barbara's portrayal of their marriage is tender but not rose-tinted. She recounts realistic day-to-day bickering \u2013 occasional arguments over how to raise children, money, in-laws. Barbara confesses that she once told Harry to leave, and for several days, he did. Her advice? \"No matter how great the temptation, do not make big&#xa0;pronouncements when you're angry. Take a time-out, think and cool&#xa0;off.\"</p> <p>As a young woman, Barbara was curvy with dark curls, plump cheeks and a winning smile. Now, her curls are white and her cheeks less full, but her eyes remain bright \u2013 sometimes she wears chic, black-framed glasses, or just balances them on her head. In the online videos on the blog (in the latest&#xa0;one, Barbara makes a prank phone call), she speaks slowly, her words slightly slurred now, after several strokes.</p> <p>Kim and Chinta worried about how Barbara would cope when Harry became frailer. After they moved into their new home, Harry fell again, and needed an operation. He'd lost more weight and grown weak. His eyesight and hearing were fading, and he lacked the strength to walk without support. Harry stayed in hospital, drifting away, preferring to sleep than&#xa0;talk.</p> <p>Barbara sat with Harry in hospital every day, eating and sleeping there, holding hands in silence. But Kim and Chinta worried that as much as Harry and Barbara loved each other, it wasn't helping their grandmother emotionally to be in the hospital all day, every day. \"It seemed that she wanted to slow down with him,\" says Kim.</p> <p>Barbara began to see her granddaughters' point of view. She used her time with Harry in hospital to think about what might happen to him, and to her. Slowly, she realised she wasn't ready to give up herself. \"One day, I told the girls that I missed my husband and that I felt like he had gotten old on me. I felt guilty for even saying this out loud but once I did I found it easier to deal with my conflicted feelings,\" she writes.</p> <p>Barbara decided to keep living. She still visited Harry daily, but also kept up with her own life \u2013 blogging, eating out, shopping, getting her hair done. \"There is no shame in taking time out to look after yourself,\" she writes. \"It does not make you a bad person if you recognise that you have reached your limit in looking after another person.\"</p> <p>In carrying on, she grew stoical: \"My older man of a husband had become, at long last, an old man. But I was not an old woman yet. I wasn't ready to lie down and miss out on all the adventures that life still had in store for me.\"</p> <p>Harry died in the middle of the night in October 2010. He was 98. Earlier on in the day, Barbara went to see Harry as usual \u2013 he told her he loved her and kissed her. Barbara got to see him an hour after he died and stayed with him until she was ready for her grandchildren to take her home.</p> <p>Barbara thinks about Harry every day. She still grieves for him and sometimes forgets he is gone. But her stoicism prevails: \"I don't complain to God because I know if I did, God would tell me that I am not the only one who lost a husband. If it hurts, I just have to learn to be stronger. This is my life and I have to accept it.\" She also says she \"can't afford to mope\" \u2013 people all over the world are waiting for her latest advice columns and the next instalment on her blog.</p> <p>Barbara still lives an active life. Her granddaughters take her out to get her nails done, visit her favourite restaurants and bakeries, which she loves to review, and watch films \u2013 \"She likes romantic stuff,\" says Chinta.</p> <p>\"When Harry died, we just tried to be there for her,\" says Kim. \"She misses him, but she is whole without him too. He made her a strong person, and gave her the strength to carry on after his death.\"</p> <p>With 22 years between them, Chinta and Kim had different mothers and barely knew each other before their father died. But when they realised their grandparents needed help, they came together. \"They didn't have any children any more,\" says Chinta. \"They&#xa0;only had us.\"</p> <p>Chinta now lives with Kim and her husband, and they visit Barbara at least five times a week. \"Our grandparents always used to make us feel like the most special, most important people in the whole world,\" says Chinta. \"They looked after us, and it's our turn now. A lot of people my age don't spend time with their grandparents, but I really hope they might be inspired to do that. My grandmother is my favourite person in the world.\"</p> <p>Both younger women believe they have learned a lot from their grandparents' long marriage, especially Kim, who was a child when her parents divorced. \"I was aware growing up that my grandparents were different to my parents. My parents didn't hate each other \u2013 they just didn't connect.</p> <p>\"But my grandparents, well, they really loved each other,\" she says. \"They had always been stable. It's definitely the model for my marriage. What it boils down to is the simplicity of respect and care, and if you can do that, you can have a happy relationship. That's what I've learned from my&#xa0;grandparents.\"</p> <p>Still in her early 20s, marriage seems a long way off for Chinta. \"But my grandmother thinks I should be married by now,\" she laughs. \"What I love about my grandparents was that there was so much acceptance between them. They never even considered the option that one of them might just up and leave \u2013 they were in it for the long-term. I want to have that for the person I care about.\"</p> <p>There are plenty of lessons to learn from Barbara and, indeed, Harry too, from the stories Barbara shares of their long, strong marriage and the advice she gives: lessons in patience and respect in love, accepting your faults and those in other people, making mistakes and living without bitterness or regret. It is impossible not to be moved by the strength of Barbara, who, despite the loss of her children and her beloved husband, is happy and strong and has found a way to live with her loss.</p> <p>Perhaps this is the most inspiring lesson of all. As Barbara says: \"Never count yourself out. Every person has something to give, some love or some wisdom or a shoulder to cry upon. As long as you care about others, you have a reason to be on this earth. So go take your place in the grand scheme, and live your life with all your heart.\"</p> <h2><strong>Barbara's wise words on ... </strong></h2> <p><strong>Love:</strong></p> <p>\"To find love, you must develop good instincts and trust them. Respect your intuition. If something about a person rubs you the wrong way, pay attention, or you might be sorry later.\"</p> <p>\"Fill your life with trustworthy friends, and don't drop them should you fall in love. They can be your guides should you lose track of what is important.\"</p> <p><strong>Marriage:</strong></p> <p>\"Marriage is first and foremost a passionate institution. Don't take the plunge unless you feel that sizzle for your partner.\"</p> <p>\"Pay attention. One of the most important things you can do for the good of your relationship is to never take the one you love for granted.\"</p> <p><strong>Sex:</strong></p> <p>\"Yes, you are busy, but if you try to make time for intimacy, you'll soon find you don't need to try to make time for it.\"</p> <p>\"Treat a relationship with the same care and scepticism that you apply to making a major purchase or life choice. It's fine to feel excited, but don't be so excited that you stumble into something that will make you miserable.\"</p> <p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p> <p>\"Never ambush your partner with an old grievance. Work your problems out when they're fresh, forgive and then move on with your lives.\"</p> <p>\"It's fine to disagree, so long as you're nice about it. Contrary to popular belief, agreeing to everything is not necessary for a happy marriage.\"</p> <p><strong>Grief: </strong></p> <p>\"Grief affects each person uniquely. You cannot predict or control it. You must must endure it, accept it, and let it pass through you so you can move on.\"</p> <p>\"Everyone who lives long enough to love deeply will experience great losses. Don't let fear of loss, or the losses themselves, take away your ability to enjoy the wonderful life that is yours.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781452109169\" title=\"\"><em>Fall in Love for Life</em></a><em>, by Barbara Cooper, with Kim and Chinta Cooper, is published by Chronicle Books, \u00a311.99.

Her lyrics are more assertive, too: \"I'll give you everything you need,\" Ellie trills, \"But I don't think I need you!\" For once, she doesn't sing it like she's swallowed a butterfly, either.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_7roOj07k\" title=\"\"><strong>David Guetta Feat Sia</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>She Wolf (Falling To Pieces) (EMI France)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The slow bits on this track are David Guetta doing emo.

Rubbish. Without wrinkling my forehead, I can think of three places this song fits like feet in slippers. One, in a smug vegan coffee shop where asking for \"milk from an animal\" is a faux pas. Two, soundtracking a Natalie Portman romcom, but a low-budget one, where she doesn't pluck her eyebrows. Three, on Stella McCartney's next perfume advert.

  "<p>We got married last year and even before the wedding I knew you weren't happy. You were constantly on edge and often had that lost look in your eyes \u2013 what my mum calls your rabbit in the headlights face. Social situations were difficult and you were struggling to find focus in work.</p> <p>Our wedding day was perfect, and we had a lovely honeymoon. However, straight after the wedding you went away for six weeks with work and I'm ashamed to say I made your life very difficult. I was struggling with a job I didn't enjoy and felt that you had abandoned me, so we had several stormy conversations over the broken telephone connection.</p> <p>Since, things have got steadily worse. You lost a key client, so had very little income. You also had an injury, which prevented you from doing a lot of the sport you usually love.</p> <p>Over a matter of weeks, you went from being an overactive, enthusiastic lover of life to someone who struggled to leave the house. I have lost count of the number of times I found you sitting curled up in a ball with your eyes closed, or your hands over your face, or hiding behind the bed, or simply in tears.</p> <p>The low point came on holiday, when you confessed that you'd been wondering what the point of carrying on was. You couldn't understand that life with you is a million times better than life without you would be, even with the recent difficulties. Holding you night after night while you cried, I felt utterly out of my depth and terrified that you would do something serious.</p> <p>I know you feel guilty for making our life difficult over the last few months, but you shouldn't. These things happen; you can't control it and it won't last for ever. The times you flinched when I've touched you hurt, but I remind myself that the real you is missing at these moments and will return. We are simply having our commitment to the vows we made last year tested, and however painful the process is, I know we will get through it and be stronger for it.</p> <p>You are driven, clever, funny and thoughtful. Your achievements over the last 12 months are more than most people would manage in a lifetime and people constantly tell me how amazing they think you are. Yet none of this seems to register with you and you focus on the negatives. Your self-esteem is rock bottom and you automatically assume people think the worst of you.</p> <p>Your family have not been very helpful while all this has been going on. Your mum just doesn't know what to do and for a long time chose to ignore it, not asking how you are or else not listening when you told her. This has damaged my relationship with her, as I don't feel able or willing to confide in her about anything. I'm not sure how to repair things, but know I need to for your sake.</p> <p>This wasn't how I imagined our first year of married life, but I hope things are looking up. You have just completed a course of cognitive behavioural therapy and are on medication, and you have a new job which will, hopefully, give your life a bit of structure and boost your self-confidence. You are a wonderful man and I know this will pass. Hang in there, love.</p> <p><em>Your wife x </em></p>",
  "<p>With her false eye-lashes, minuscule frame and windswept mane of curly hair, the tiny 19-year-old shivering on the seafront at Lytham St Annes bears scant resemblance to the thick-set brass statue of Les Dawson she's hugging with her mother, Tracy. But when she curls her bottom lip, rolls her eyes into a familiar cartoonish gurn and bursts into a spontaneous guffaw there's no mistaking her genetic&#xa0;heritage.</p> <p>\"I can see Les so strongly all the time in Charlotte,\" says Tracy, who spent six years \u2013 four of them married \u2013 with Dawson, the Manchester-born national treasure, before his sudden death, aged 62, in June 1993. \"I see him in her mannerisms, the things she says, the way she acts. And, like Les, she doesn't take life too seriously.\"</p> <p>Charlotte Dawson's arrival in the world, in October 1992, was as unlikely as one of her late father's notoriously tall tales. \"Les was doing an awards show in London,\" recalls Tracy, who married Dawson in May 1989, three years after his first wife's death. \"And the doctors told me I should really have been at home as I was so close to giving birth.</p> <p>\"I started having labour pains and Les was adamant that he wanted the baby to be born in the north, so a friend of ours who had a small plane flew us up to Manchester's St Mary's hospital.\"</p> <p>With labour in full flow, Dawson, who already had three grown-up children from his first marriage, captured the proceedings on his Box Brownie camera \u2013 \"I've still got the pictures of my stomach being sewn up to prove it,\" says Tracy \u2013 and also treated the staff to an impromptu performance.</p> <p>\"When I was giving birth he was doing his act and making the nurses laugh while I was screaming out with pain and shouting, 'Finish the gag, Les! Quick, I need you.'</p> <p>\"She came just before the specialist arrived and Les got to cut the umbilical cord and do his finale.</p> <p>\"He was totally elated and for the next eight months we did everything together. Charlotte came on stage when they did the second This Is Your Life for Les and met Cher on the Michael Aspel Show. He was full of plans for the future.</p> <p>\"He said she'd never go to school because she'd travel with us and he would educate her and help her get into showbusiness. He wanted her to learn her craft as a child and follow in his footsteps.\"</p> <p>Everything changed on 10 June 1993 when Les Dawson \u2013 who had once admitted to drinking a bottle of whisky and smoking 50 cigarettes a day \u2013 had a&#xa0;fatal heart attack.</p> <p>\"It was a horrific shock,\" says Tracy. \"It was so sudden that we didn't even get a chance to say our goodbyes and I didn't cope well.\"</p> <p>\"When Les died I felt that it was very important for her to know who her Dada was \u2013 she'd just started saying 'Dada', not 'Mama', that week.</p> <p>\"I remember her in the funeral car wearing a pink hat and banging really hard on the window, shouting, 'Dada, Dada,' \u2013 I knew I had to keep his memory alive for her.\"</p> <p>Tracy's avowed plan \u2013 including a life-size cardboard cutout of Les next to Charlotte's cot \u2013 has clearly worked, and Charlotte talks movingly about her father. \"I was only eight months old when he died, so I don't have concrete memories but when I look at photos I do get a very vivid sense of him.</p> <p>\"It was hard growing up without him because I know that I probably would be a daddy's girl. I was about five when I realised what he did and used to watch old videos of him. I'm very fortunate in that I can go on YouTube and just look at him if I need cheering up.</p> <p>Charlotte admits: \"There have been times when I've wished I could speak to him instead of my mum. It is hard when you get a boyfriend and they end up messing you around, and your dad's not there to give you a hug. But I know it's been hard for Mum as she had to be a mum and a dad to me. It's sad he's not here but it makes me even more determined to keep his legacy going as that's what he deserves.\"</p> <p>Aside from the emotional fallout from his death, there were also unfortunate legal complications. Tracy and the children from Les's first marriage disagreed over his will and who should pay for the funeral. The two families remain estranged to this day.</p> <p>\"It's sad because they are my brother and sister,\" says Charlotte, \"and we should really be speaking. I know my dad would want us to.\"</p> <p>As well as planning a museum of comedy in Blackpool, featuring some of Les's memorabilia, Tracy and Charlotte have compiled the Les Dawson Joke Book, a timely reminder of the Blankety Blank host's gift for the absurd one-liner. It also includes a chapter on the comic genre he made his own \u2013 the Take My Mother-in-Law jokes, which must have made uncomfortable listening for Tracy's own mother.</p> <p>\"Les never actually met her,\" says Tracy, \"as she died before we got together but I'm sure she wouldn't have minded, and I don't think Meg's mum minded either.</p> <p>\"She found it funny but Les actually stopped doing mother-in-law jokes out of respect when his first mother-in-law died and when Meg died. \"But then he got all these letters saying, 'Why aren't you saying things about us any more, Les?' signed, 'The mother-in-law.'</p> <p>\"But he brought them back in very soon, as he was great at the mother-in-law jokes.</p> <p>\"The thing about Les was that he had this great quality of observing people and that's how those jokes originally started.</p> <p>\"When he was learning his craft he did all the working men's clubs in the north and he got paid off many times because he was trying to be what he wasn't. He was wearing a pink wig and playing the piano and doing silly things, and then he went to Hull and he'd had enough. He walked around Hull during the day and went on at this club that night and just talked about the dreary weather, about work, the wife and the mother-in-law ... and the crowd clapped. He'd never had that for years. Nobody had clapped and laughed. So he sort of fell into it because he wasn't married when that happened. He was just observing.\"</p> <p>The future of the Dawson entertainment legacy now lies with Charlotte who, after a stint in a fringe theatre play, Wag! The Musical, earlier this year, is hoping to get her foot on the first rung of the performing&#xa0;ladder.</p> <p>\"There is a little bit of pressure to live up to my dad's reputation and obviously I want to carve out my own career but I'm not desperate for the day when people don't describe me as Les Dawson's daughter because I'm proud to be his daughter.</p> <p>\"He's very much in my memory all the time and I always question what he would think. I'm just very lucky to have him as a dad \u2013 even though I only had him as a dad for eight months.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781843178705\" title=\"\"><em>Les Dawson's Joke Book</em></a><em>, by Tracy and Charlotte Dawson, is published on 4 October by Michael O'Mara Books, \u00a39.99</em></p>",
  "<p>It was my youngest daughter's sixth birthday last week. Her gift haul included Lego Friends (Lego designed specifically for girls), My Little Pony accessories, a fluffy bunny and a Minnie Mouse sweetshop. She&#xa0;loved her presents, although they were obviously a moral disgrace, as they underwrote and perpetuated the patriarchy.</p> <p>Or that, at least, is what one woman I spoke to remarked when I was discussing the subject. The gifts were \"gendered\". So why don't I give a shit? (My wife doesn't care either \u2013 \"I'm not that kind of feminist\".)</p> <p>Which kind of feminist is that? I suppose one who takes it all a bit too far and a bit too earnestly. My wife's generation \u2013 she's in her early 40s \u2013 was brought up with even more pink fluffy iron-and-apron-type objects than my daughters have been faced with, and it hasn't been any obstacle to producing the largest generation of more or less radicalised women in history. But some stuff just won't go away, and bunnies and ponies probably fall into that category.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.pinkstinks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Pinkstinks</a> movement I have full sympathy for, on aesthetic as much as political grounds. It appeals, I think, partly because it taps into something nascent. My third daughter held an \"I hate pink\" party, unprompted, when she was six, not out of feminist conviction but because of a spontaneous dislike of naffness. And that I think we can all sign up for.</p> <p>I just believe that the link between children's toys and adult behaviour is quite hard to demonstrate. When I was growing up, there was only one thing I wanted to do, and that was shoot people. If you wanted to see a shy little boy rendered ecstatic, give him a toy gun. But I have had relatively little desire to go on a shooting spree as an adult.</p> <p>Guns assuage boys' feelings of helplessness, and that is a fantasy all children \u2013 female and male \u2013 covet. The same woman who complained to me that these gifts were a moral disgrace, also pointed out that she thought fairies and princesses and any girl figure with a magical power were OK, because they made girls, in the same way, feel powerful.</p> <p>Gendered toys, although regrettable, may not be such a terrible thing. The nuancing of these marketing strategies actually opens out possibilities. If Lego were all building trucks, factories and farms, girls would probably not be that interested in what is a very creative and hands-on toy. Sling in a few ponies and an array of little plastic girlfriends, and it was the first toy that both my youngest and her sister went for out of the pile on their birthdays, and has kept them occupied ever since.</p> <p>It's really no different to providing Action Men dolls for little boys. Yes, they are dolls that ostensibly kill people (or other dolls). But at least they are dolls, and they get boys thinking in a different sort of way.</p> <p>A lot of gendered toy marketing is pretty rank. At Christmas, my 10 year old was given a <a href=\"http://www.hasbro.com/en_GB/shop/details.cfm?R=942A4D15-6D40-1014-8BF0-9EFBF894F9D4:en_GB\" title=\"\">Monopoly pink edition</a>, which, instead of normal properties, had nail-manicure salons and mobile-phone cards. This really did stick in my craw. It didn't improve the game, it&#xa0;specifically excluded boys, and it was, in all, tacky and unnecessary, a pure act of profit maximisation to a market sector.</p> <p>You could say the same of Lego Friends I suppose. Perhaps it's just a matter of taste and degree \u2013 Lego Friends tweaks the toy, but doesn't entirely subsume the concept in sexist stereotypes. Rather it uses the fact \u2013 or construction, if you prefer \u2013 of femaleness to edge girls towards something they may have traditionally eschewed. But no girl, I suspect, would turn against Monopoly because there wasn't enough pink.</p> <p>And therein lies the difference between cynical opportunism and pragmatic, even enlightened, marketing.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/timlottwriter\" title=\"\"><em>@timlottwriter</em></a></p>",
  "<p>If you are fed-up with living in a cold house or paying huge heating bills, and can't afford expensive home improvements, could the government's long-awaited green deal help? Unveiled in 2010, and promoted with the promise that \"every British home will be able to install energy-saving technologies such as insulation at no upfront cost\", this much talked-about scheme finally kicks off on Monday.</p> <p>Big and small firms will be able to borrow from a central fund and use the money to install energy efficiency measures in homes. The householder gradually pays for the work done via the savings they will see in lower gas and electricity bills. Inevitably, it is more complicated than that \u2013 much more \u2013 but if you are keen to make your home more energy efficient and don't have the money available upfront, you will want to take a look at this scheme.</p> <p>Consumers will be able to arrange for a green deal assessor to visit their home to calculate how best the property can be improved. Wall insulation or a new boiler are likely to be the most recommended work, but a host of other measures are also possible under the scheme's terms.</p> <p>Once you have a home improvement plan in place, you will have to wait until January before you can sign up for work to start. The scheme will particularly appeal to those living in rural areas off the gas grid who currently heat their home using oil or LPG. When combined with the government's Renewable Heat Incentive, due next year, householders will be able to replace their heating with a renewable system and spread payments over many years.</p> <p>Energy-efficiency firms across the UK (though not in Northern Ireland) have been gearing up for the green deal, which they hope will rejuvenate the sector and help bring Britain's traditionally poor housing stock into the 21st century. And with ministers keen to get the scheme up and running with a good take-up, and backing it with \u00a3200m, it looks as though those signing up at the start will see some financial benefits for being an early adopter.</p> <p>So how does it work in detail? At the heart of the green deal legislation is the \"golden rule,\" which states that estimated savings on bills must always equal or exceed the cost of the work.</p> <p>If you agree to have work done, the firm that installs the measures informs your electricity supplier about your green deal \"plan\" so that your payments for the work can start to be collected through your electricity bills. Your energy supplier then writes to you confirming the details.</p> <p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) says it particularly wants to encourage the take-up of solid wall insulation and \"hard-to-treat\" cavity wall insulation, which is often expensive \u2013 typically \u00a35,000-\u00a310,000 per home for solid wall insulation. It can take many years to recoup the cost in lower energy bills, but once this type of insulation is installed, it can transform a home's energy efficiency, delivering benefits for decades.</p> <p>How much you can \"borrow\" will depend on the identified savings based on the size of your home, the number of occupants and the current size of your bills. Some work, such as double glazing, may require an upfront part-payment. The same may apply to those looking to install an A-rated gas boiler, typically costing \u00a32,500. Householders will be able to use the scheme to pay to install electricity generating solar panels, but won't be able to include the feed-in-tariff payments when calculating the savings, meaning some upfront payments will again be required.</p> <p>Consumers will initially have an Energy Performance Certificate survey carried out which will be used to create your green deal plan. Some companies will charge householders for the survey and plan, while other firms are expected to offer them free as long as you take their package of measures.</p> <p>Decc says it has put in place a scheme that will let \"the market\" decide how the deal is offered to consumers. It expects some firms to be able to offer deals on an interest-free basis, while others will charge interest. Currently, it looks as though 7.5% will be a typical rate, but this could change.</p> <p>Decc says it has set up the scheme in a way that householders will be able to use their local plumber, provided they have been through the accreditation process. It adds that consumers signing up should see a seamless process.</p> <p>What looks certain is that those signing up will have to do a lot of shopping around. Different companies will offer different terms, and it will be a case of working out which is best. Those \"borrowing\" more than \u00a310,000 will be required to get several quotes. Buyers will also want to compare what they are told with the cost of borrowing on the high street. Expect a rash of websites comparing the cost of these offerings.</p> <p>Green deal borrowers will be able to pay off their \"loans\" early, but there might be redemption fees, which could be significant if the loan was taken over more than 15 years. Tenants will be able to sign up to the deal, and social housing providers are expected to be big users.</p> <p>Although much of this area looks set to be dominated by the \"big six\" energy firms, the government wants the scheme to be available through small plumbing and other energy firms as well. Meanwhile, Ecology building society and the Energy Saving Co-operative have launched what they describe as a \"co-operative, community-based alternative\" to the green deal that will be available initially in Oxfordshire and the Midlands. They say it is about putting power in the hands of homeowners and small businesses to help them capture the benefits \"rather than handing these over to the financial markets and the 'big six'\".</p> <p>Decc says anyone selling green deal products will have to be accredited, and needs to have been through the training process. It hopes this will cut out much of the mis-selling that has blighted the energy and solar markets in particular. Strict standards will be put in place to prevent consumers being ripped off by cowboys, it says. Customers in dispute with providers will have access to an ombudsman service.</p> <p>Some people will wonder what happens if they move house after signing up. One of the clever bits of the green deal is that the debt remains on the home's electricity account until it is paid off. If you move house, the next owner is expected to take on the repayments, which is fair given that they will be enjoying the benefits. Equally, renters moving into a property will have to pay for any measurers carried out by previous tenant/landlord.</p> <p>The government says anyone who has had work done will still be able to switch gas and electricity supplier \u2013 although very small/new suppliers may not accept green deal debts.</p> <p><em>For more information call the </em><a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Organisations/Government/Energy-Saving-Advice-Service\" title=\"Energy Saving Advice Service\"><em>Energy Saving Advice Service</em></a><em>: 0300 123 1234 (for Scotland call 0800 512 012).</em></p>",
  "<p>There is a moment, as Gareth Bale leans against the wall and the photographer zooms in, that it becomes clear the most formidable left-sided player in the Premier League does have one small vulnerability. \"Spiders,\" he explains. \"They terrify me.\" He has seen a cobweb, too close for comfort, and there is a look of horror that feels a long way from the calm, supremely gifted athlete we are used to seeing on the football pitch.</p> <p>He has been good company and though the wall has to be swept clean on his behalf, nobody could ever categorise Bale as one of football's divas. He might be one of the A-listers these days, but he also comes across as remarkably grounded considering the rare qualities \u2013 the running power, the ability to sprint full-pelt with the ball under control, and that firecracker of a left foot \u2013 that make him such a formidable asset for Tottenham Hotspur, coveted by all the top European clubs.</p> <p>Playing abroad does appeal: \"I'd never be scared of it. It's something I'd like to experience. It's in the future but if something did come up I would obviously look at it with interest.\" Yet Bale can say that now without fear of it being misconstrued given that he signed a new four-year contract at the end of June. Indeed, the firm impression, from an afternoon in his company, is of someone who is perfectly happy at White Hart Lane, buying into the long-term strategy of the chairman, Daniel Levy, and convinced the new-look Spurs can flourish if they are afforded a little patience.</p> <p>Bale's new deal certainly represents a huge declaration of faith bearing in mind the club did not even have a manager in place at the time, coming in that three-week period between Harry Redknapp's sacking and the appointment of Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas.</p> <p>Did he ever consider leaving? \"No,\" Bale replies matter-of-factly. \"The manager situation wasn't really my worry either. It was more a case of whether the club wanted to go forward and be ambitious. I spoke to the chairman \u2013 he talked to me privately \u2013 and he told me about his plans and what he wanted to bring to Tottenham. It was exciting. We're going in the right direction. We've made some great signings. We've got a new training ground, we're planning a new stadium. It's all looking bright.\"</p> <p>His early impressions of Villas-Boas are positive. \"He's very approachable. If there is a problem, or something we feel is not right, his door is open. He wants us to work that way: together, the players and staff, and if there is a problem we can always share our ideas with him and he will take it on board.</p> <p>\"For example, if we feel we are working too hard in training, if we say that to him, then he'll ease it off. He's still learning as well as a manager but he does all the coaching and everything himself, which is great. Every manager is different and he has his own ways of working. Sometimes it just takes a little bit of time.\"</p> <p>It has, after all, been a summer of considerable upheaval at White Hart Lane and it cannot have been easy, for example, when a player with Luka Modric's influence and talent is lost. Rafael van der Vaart, too.</p> <p>Spurs began the season with only one senior striker, Jermain Defoe, and did not win any of their first three league games. The scrutiny on Villas-Boas has been intense at times \u2013 too much so, for Bale's liking.</p> <p>\"It's crazy, to be honest,\" he says when asked whether football can be too impatient sometimes. \"There seems to be this thing in football where everything has to be ... now! But look at the amount of changes we have had. Everything. The new manager coming in, a new training ground, a new formation, new players, getting used to different types of training. It does take time to adapt.\"</p> <p>Bale has seen \"progression in every game\" ahead of Saturday's match at Manchester United. Spurs head to Old Trafford after back-to-back league wins over Reading and QPR and Bale is encouraged by the early impact of the new signings, in particular Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9: \"Everybody saw what Mousa can do at Fulham. He's a great signing, a great player, he's proved it at Fulham and can do even better at Tottenham. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 playing in central midfield instead of Modric \u2026 I think he's capable of filling Luka's boots and more, to be honest.\"</p> <p>Bale was moved to left-back against QPR last week in the absence of the injured Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto \u2013 but only briefly. Tottenham, to put it bluntly, missed him too much in attack and Villas-Boas changed things back at half-time, turning a 1\u20110 deficit into a 2\u20111 win.</p> <p>The new manager is operating a 4\u20112\u20113\u20111 formation that includes a modified role for his most penetrative player. \"It's a new formation,\" Bale explains. \"I'm still on the left, attacking, but I have a bit more freedom now to come inside and mix my game up. Instead of being in just one section the idea is to confuse defences, make space, try to cause some different problems. It's one of the things we've been working on since pre-season.</p> <p>\"A lot of old-fashioned wingers will just be stuck out on the wing and these days the other team stick a full-back on you, the winger drops back and one of the central midfielders comes over. Once people find out what you're good at on the wing, they try to stop you. In some games I've faced two right-backs: one playing right-back and one right-wing. They double up. It's hard to get the ball, hard to get the space and you can be marked out of the game.</p> <p>\"The idea now is that if I mix my game up, come inside, they can't all follow you as they have to stay in shape. It gives me a bit more freedom and a bit more licence to get on the ball and do damage in other parts of the field. If you've got a plan B, they're not expecting it and the right-back can't follow you to the left-back spot.\"</p> <p>This comes a few minutes after Bale states that the opponent who tends to give him his hardest game is the one, curiously enough, Roy Hodgson and previously Fabio Capello do not rate highly enough to play for England. \"Micah Richards \u2026 I always have a tough battle with him when we play Manchester City. I'm massively surprised he can't get in the England team. He's strong, quick, bombing up and down the line, causing all sorts of problems.\"</p> <p>A similar description could be applied to Bale, one of the players who features prominently in Sir Alex Ferguson's list of those-who-got-away.</p> <p>United, Bale recollects, were \"definitely interested\" before Spurs snapped up the then 17-year-old from Southampton for what now looks like a steal, an initial \u00a35m rising to \u00a310m.</p> <p>Five years on, Bale has changed his shirt from No3 to No11 this season, symbolising his preferred role in the team, and seems determined to show it is possible to be both a superstar and still grounded enough to consider himself \"a normal lad\" with no intention of his \"head blowing up\". This is not someone who will ever be snapped falling out of a nightclub.</p> <p>Bale doesn't drink for a start. A relative gave him a glass of champagne one year and he just didn't like the taste. Away from football, he explains, he tends not to mix with celebrities and London's glitterati but his old mates from Whitchurch high school in Cardiff, where he was timed as a 13-year-old running 100m at 13.4sec and where he was so freakishly good at football the PE teachers tried to make it fair on everyone else by banning him from using his left foot.</p> <p>This interview is also his chance to clear up what happened in the summer when he missed the Olympics because of a back injury but was fit enough to play for Tottenham, on their pre-season tour of the United States, at the same time.</p> <p>\"For me, it was simple,\" Bale says. \"I had a problem with my back. I knew I was in the mix for the Olympics squad so I was trying to get myself fit but when I was running, my back was still sore. I spoke to the Olympics medical team, went for a scan, and it showed a problem.</p> <p>\"I just wasn't expecting to recover that quickly. The rehab went very well. I played just as the Olympics was starting and it obviously created a bit of a stir but, for me, I didn't do anything wrong. It was all dealt with professionally and the fact is I never actually pulled out \u2013 it was a decision made by both medical teams.</p> <p>\"It was a bit of a coincidence that I came back at pretty much the same time but people really blew it out of proportion. I knew the truth and they, the Olympics team, knew the real truth.\"</p> <p>Remembering the controversy, the mind also goes back to the injury Bale suffered on tour, this time inflicted by Charlie Adam, then of Liverpool. The same player also injured Bale last season and while there is no appetite to prolong the argument, the recipient of Adam's studs does point out that he has never received an apology. \"Not the second time, or the first. He doesn't like me very much, I don't know why.\"</p> <p>All of which feels a long way from the playground at Worcesters primary school in Enfield as a \u00a350m-rated player takes a group of enthusiastic year-three pupils through their paces. Bale is here as part of the considerable community work Tottenham put in behind the scenes in Enfield and other areas of north London. Footballer, role model, spokesman.</p> <p>\"People tend to laugh when you talk about Tottenham winning the league but at the same time there were people talking about it genuinely last season,\" he says. \"That itself is a step in the right direction. We were up there, three points off the lead until we hit a bad patch. I'm ambitious, I want to play in the Champions League and that's the aim with Tottenham \u2013 to start qualifying for the Champions League on a consistent basis.\" Real Madrid, Milan, Barcelona \u2013 anyone else for that matter \u2014 can wait.</p> <p><em>Gareth Bale was speaking at an appearance at Worcesters Pprimary Scschool in support of Tottenham Hotspur Foundation's work in Enfield.</em></p>",
  "<p>You've probably seen the TV and newspaper ads, with well-known names such as Karren Brady from The Apprentice and Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis saying: \"I'm in.\"</p> <p>The adverts are part of an \u00a38m government awareness campaign to promote what ministers are calling \"the biggest shake-up in UK pensions for over 100 years,\" which starts on Monday.</p> <p>Under the new \"automatic enrolment\" (aka auto-enrolment) regime, millions of people will be put directly into a workplace pension scheme. Both the worker and their employer pay into the scheme. You can opt out, but you'll have to do all the legwork. You will need to get an \"opt-out notice\" from the pension scheme, fill it in and give it to your employer \u2013 and have only a month to do it.</p> <p>The government reckons that by Christmas more than half a million people will be saving in a workplace pension for the first time. But are we ready for this \"truly radical social change\", <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/newsroom/press-releases/2012/sep-2012/dwp103-12.shtml\" title=\"\">as it was described by pensions minister Steve Webb?</a> This month, <a href=\"http://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Widows</a> published research showing that more than half of the UK's workers were \"completely unaware\" of the impending changes \u2013 though that was before the advertising blitz kicked off. Inevitably, the first time some employees will realise something is afoot is when they get their payslip and see that money has been deducted without their consent.</p> <p>It's certainly a big programme: the aim is to get up to 11 million more people saving in a workplace pension. Auto-enrolment is being phased in over several years, starting with the largest employers and eventually taking in people who employ just one person. Among the first companies auto-enrolling employees will be Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons.</p> <p>But amid all the hullabaloo, it is worth remembering that for millions of employees, nothing is changing. If you're already in a pension at work and it meets the government's new standards, this shake-up will not affect you. The basic facts are these:</p> <p>\u2022 Employers will have to enrol workers who are at least 22 but below state pension age; who earn more than a minimum amount (\u00a38,105 a year for the current tax year \u2013 \u00a3156 a week); and are not in a workplace scheme. That means anyone on the national minimum wage and working more than 25 hours a week will be auto-enrolled.</p> <p>\u2022 Workers not in that group can opt in if they wish to. If you're at least 16, but under 75, earn more than \u00a35,564 a year and ask to be enrolled, your company will have to put you in the scheme and pay a minimum contribution, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Companies will also need to enrol any workers aged 16-74 who earn less than that, and who ask to be put into the scheme, but do not need to pay contributions for them.</p> <p>\u2022 If you are automatically enrolled and stay in the scheme, you and your employer pay in \u2013 and the taxman helps by giving tax relief. The total minimum contribution will start at 2% of earnings (typically 1% from the employer and 1% from the worker). By October 2018 this will have risen to 8% \u2013 at least 3% from the company, up to 4% from the employee and 1% tax relief.</p> <p>People are free to say no, and many probably will because they will see this as a pay cut. But many experts are urging workers to stick with it.</p> <p>\"Quitting could mean losing tax breaks and employer contributions which are, in effect, 'free money',\" says Joanne Segars, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.napf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association of Pension Funds</a>.</p> <p>Morten Nilsson at <a href=\"http://www.nowpensions.com/\" title=\"\">NOW: Pensions</a>, one of the new players aiming to grab a chunk of the auto-enrolment market, says the way to see it is: \"You have to give up 1% of your salary to get 2% saved. If you opt out, you are throwing away that money your employer would have been contributing.\"</p> <p>As to what you might get back at the end, the predictions are wide-ranging. <a href=\"http://www.standardlife.co.uk/1/site/uk/home\" title=\"\">Standard Life</a> says a 22-year-old man earning \u00a38,105 now would, at 67, be looking at a tax-free lump sum of \u00a321,500 and a weekly pension of \u00a375. It says a 50-year-old on \u00a326,200 might expect a \u00a313,100 lump sum and a pension of \u00a347 a week. But these are based on some pretty optimistic assumptions. <a href=\"http://www.nestpensions.org.uk/schemeweb/NestWeb/public/home/contents/homepage.html\" title=\"\">Nest</a> (National Employment Savings Trust), a new workplace pension scheme set up by the government, estimates the figures for the 22-year-old at \u00a34,500 and \u00a314 respectively, and for the 50-year-old at \u00a37,920 and \u00a326.</p> <p>Some will feel they can't afford to pay into a pension. The <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Work and Pensions</a> says that for many people, paying into a workplace pension is a good idea even if they have other financial commitments such as a mortgage or loan. However, it suggests you should consider opting out if your finances aren't too great: \"You should make sure you can afford to meet your other commitments. If you're behind on your mortgage, rent, credit card or other debt payments, a pension might not be the right step at the moment. It's something you should come back to once your debts are more under control.\"</p> <p>Auto-enrolment has been years in the planning, and the big test will be whether those at the sharp end \u2013 pension providers, company payroll and HR departments etc \u2013 can cope with the strain. Tom McPhail at pensions and investment firm <a href=\"http://www.hl.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hargreaves Lansdown</a> says that between 1 February and 31 May 2013, more than 6.5 million people will pass through the system while it is still in its early stages.</p> <p>He reckons that some employers will simply opt for Nest as a default, without being fully aware of the other options available. Rival schemes include NOW: Pensions and <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplespension.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The People's Pension</a>, the latter of which is run by construction industry specialist <a href=\"http://www.bandce.co.uk/\" title=\"\">B&amp;CE</a>.</p>",
  "<p>While we clearly all have a responsibility to control our energy usage, there are a number of potential problems with the government's green deal.</p> <p>The initiative is designed to help businesses and encourage homeowners to employ more green technologies in their homes. The idea is simple; install them into your property with no upfront outlay. You pay back the costs through your energy bill over a period.</p> <p>This is unlike a conventional loan, because if you move the bill stays with the property where the savings are occurring, not with the bill payer.</p> <p>The main \"hook\" that will be used by sales reps to get consumers interested is the fact that it won't cost them anything extra \u2013 the monthly repayments will be covered by the savings made on your energy bill after the relevant measures have been installed.</p> <p>This sounds great. But no two households are the same, and no two households have the same pattern of consumption. There are complicated formulas to predict what savings can be made, but there are so many variables \u2013 plus continual energy price changes \u2013 that it's almost impossible to work out.</p> <p>Bear in mind that doorstep selling, where sales reps are paid a commission for signing up consumers, will be one of the main routes to market for green deal providers. This method only operates in the economic interests of businesses, not consumers, and sales reps on commission are often economical with the truth and don't provide best value for money. Just look at the evidence from the debacle of doorstep energy sales by the \"big six\".</p> <p>Trading standards officers advise consumers to <em>never</em> buy under pressure on the doorstep, and recommend taking time to shop around.</p> <p>After much lobbying by the <a href=\"http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Trading Standards Institute</a>, the green deal code of practice contains a requirement for all providers to respect \"No cold callers\" stickers displayed in homes. If you haven't got a sticker yet, get one.</p> <p>In some cases there will also be other work that needs to be done in conjunction with green deal measures, such as repointing of chimney stacks, repairs to the damp-proof course or some electrical rewiring.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> is wasting the golden opportunity it has to signpost consumers to approved trader schemes such as the local authority-run \"<a href=\"http://www.buywithconfidence.gov.uk/sitepages/bwchome.aspx\" title=\"\">Buy With Confidence</a>\" , which mainly operates in southern England, or the government-endorsed <a href=\"http://www.trustmark.org.uk/\" title=\"\">TrustMark</a> scheme. If ancillary work is carried out by the cowboys, the green deal will be irrevocably tarnished.</p> <p>There is a great reliance on self-regulation within the new regime. However, I want to see some independent inspection of work that has been carried out to ensure it has been done properly and that the expected energy savings have a greater chance of being realised; rogue operators need to be pinpointed and eliminated very quickly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, great care is needed to avoid turning homes into hermetically-sealed greenhouses, which might lead to condensation problems and thereby contribute to health issues for householders.</p> <p>Finally, the notion that green deal plans will be passed on to future buyers of your home is flawed.</p> <p>The reality is that when you sell your home, a prospective purchaser will probably ask you to pay off the plan in full before they buy from you. I would.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Steve Playle is investigations and enforcement manager at Surrey Trading Standards</em></p>",
  "<p>Poor old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/rupert-everett\" title=\"\">Rupert Everett</a> thought he'd taken every care to say nothing in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/oct/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">his first memoir</a> that could upset his friend Madonna. Then the book came out, she threw a strop and stopped talking to him.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/20/vanished-years-rupert-everett-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">His new memoir</a> is less scandalously gossipy,&nbsp;so further fallings-out had looked unlikely \u2013 but before its release this week, he was already in hot water again. Everett can't understand it. \"What's happened to humour? We're becoming American. Everyone gets so angry over everything.\"</p> <p>But I'm not sure how much he really cares, and to my mind you'd have to be even more humourless than Madonna to hold anything against him. After reading Vanished Years, I didn't just want to buy the book but kidnap its author and gallivant about town with him for ever.</p> <p>Not so much a kiss-and-tell as a love letter from Everett to a lost past, the book is nostalgic for a&nbsp;world in which big stars were big characters. He's a dreadful snob, really, but of the most adventurous kind, drawn to life's underbelly and in thrall to extremes, but bored to death by mediocrity. Now 53, still handsome but no longer the shocking beauty of his youth, Everett writes with a rare blend of wistful lament, comic observation and opinionated mischief \u2013 and in person turns out to be exactly the same.</p> <p>Vanished Years opens with Everett's account of&nbsp;his ill-fated appearance on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9JOIR24ssg\" title=\"\">Comic Relief Does The Apprentice</a>, to which he'd agreed having never actually seen the show. Appalled to find himself on a testosterone-crazed team led by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a>, and overseen by a man he mistakes&nbsp;for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_James\" title=\"\">Sid James</a> but who turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/alan-sugar\" title=\"\">Sir&nbsp;Alan Sugar</a>, Everett has a panic attack, bolts out of an emergency exit and legs it to the Ritz. Pursued by&nbsp;the production crew, he ends up cycling to King's Cross and escaping on a train to Norfolk. I'm not sure he's fully recovered yet.</p> <p>\"Seeing Morgan and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alastaircampbell\" title=\"\">Alastair [Campbell]</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kemp\" title=\"\">Ross Kemp</a> was like a flashback to me of exactly why I peeled off from the mainstream in life so very early. Just feeling outside from groups of rugger-buggers at school; they just set off a kind of alarm bell in me. To me, Piers Morgan was a person who just reminded me, exactly, of all the people I was terrified of at school. I don't like how he is; I've seen him on a few other Apprentice-like things and he takes it too seriously. He's a killer. He's pathological.</p> <p>\"But, at the same time,\" Everett reflects, suddenly looking quite impressed, \"I think how he's moulded himself into a new career \u2013 well, I&nbsp;love people managing to achieve things. I&nbsp;think it's quite clever. Also, he reminds me of Oscar Wilde, in a way. He could play Oscar Wilde if you&nbsp;put him in a long wig \u2013 he's so kind of slobby and elephantine. But I can't imagine him with poor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Walden\" title=\"\">Celia Walden</a> [Morgan's wife]. She's gorgeous and very funny. I mean, she deserves to be fucked by a god.\"</p> <p>Maybe she feels that's what she's getting? Everett considers this possibility doubtfully. \"Maybe he is. I've always imagined him to be hung like a budgie underneath it all.\" He ponders the matter further. \"Or maybe the penetrative act is not what turns her on. Anyway,\" he brightens, \"it only makes it more <em>riveting</em> to me. I mean, the Celia factor does make it fascinating. I love his wife. So now that I love his wife, I'm rather confused about him. Because <a href=\"http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/piers-morgan-and-celia-walden-london-fashion-1cBnaD.jpg\" title=\"\">she's so chic-looking</a> and he dresses like a school slob.\"</p> <p>I tell him Morgan now has a personal trainer on&nbsp;each coast of the US, and that last time we met&nbsp;he made me touch his tricep so I could feel the results. Everett's face lights up and he leans in, enthralled. \"<em>Ree-aa-lly?</em>\"</p> <p>It's this ambivalence about whether he's one of them or one of us that makes Everett such a&nbsp;divine chronicler of celebrity. \"It's good to write things down, because I think everyone kind of colludes in misrepresenting show business quite often \u2013 from your side and our side. We both ask each other and answer each other the wrong questions, always. And the bullshit gets wiped back and forth. It's so boring. So we all collude in misrepresenting the nuts and bolts of a rather interesting world.\"</p> <p>Or at least, a world that used to be rather interesting. \"I'm very romantic about the past, really. So I think it's also a middle-aged book. I&nbsp;guess middle age is, well, probably every generation feels the world is ending, slightly, at that age \u2013 and it is. I guess every generation is kind of ending. But New York has really changed. I mean it really has changed, so it isn't just a&nbsp;middle-age whine \u2013 the old New York of the 70s really doesn't exist. Everywhere is the same place now; everything's been made into a&nbsp;Disney Street. If you look at books of Hollywood homes in the 70s, it's just amazing how humble they are; they're like little beach shanty houses with bric-a-brac furniture. Now, the smallest fucking brainless Hollywood producer lives in an <a href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090820042724/lyricwiki/images/d/d4/Earth,_Wind_%26_Fire_-_All_'N_All.jpg\" title=\"\">Earth Wind &amp; Fire Egyptian palace</a>. It's just\u2026 It's&nbsp;become so tasteless, I suppose.\"</p> <p>Everett is comically glum about the sanitisation of show business \u2013 the military schedules of early nights and abstinence enforced by po-faced publicists, and all the \"hollow, vulnerable\" parties that make him long for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54\" title=\"\">Studio 54</a>'s carnival of freaks. But then again, he's become uncharacteristically abstinent himself; a few years ago he noticed his libido had vanished, and&nbsp;he stopped taking drugs once the thought had occurred, \"Oh God, I'd hate to have a stroke doing a line of coke.\" So it's not always clear if he's mourning a world that has passed, or the passing of his own gilded youth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396778314\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348743390500/Rupert-Everett-and-Sabrin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett and Sabrina Guiness, 1982\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett and heiress Sabrina Guinness in 1982.

He'd more or less run away from his Catholic boarding school in his teens, to train at drama school in London, making ends meet by working on the side as a&nbsp;rent boy until general insubordination got him kicked out. Another Country propelled him to Hollywood, and the auspices of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/orsonwelles\" title=\"\">Orson Welles</a>, but after success with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088987/\" title=\"\">Dance With A Stranger</a>, his early promise began to unravel. Following some forgettable films and a bizarre stab at pop stardom, Everett ended up making TV in Russia, lolled around Europe, wrote a couple of novels, did some modelling and gradually inched his way back into Hollywood's gaze with comic turns in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/55729/madness-of-king-george\" title=\"\">The Madness Of King George</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110907/\" title=\"\">Pret-A-Porter</a>. In&nbsp;1997, he starred alongside Julia Roberts in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119738/\" title=\"\">My&nbsp;Best Friend's Wedding</a> and was suddenly red hot again, charming everyone with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare In Love</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122541/\" title=\"\">An Ideal Husband</a> \u2013 until an over-hyped 1999 comedy co-starring Madonna, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2000/jun/23/madonna\" title=\"\">The Next Best Thing, bombed so badly</a> that both their&nbsp;Hollywood careers were over for good.</p> <p>Since then, Everett has rebuilt a reputation as&nbsp;an unpredictable but inspired elder statesman of&nbsp;the theatre, and in 2006 surprised everyone again with his recklessly indiscreet memoir, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/oct/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Red&nbsp;Carpets And Other Banana Skins</a>. No one writes about failure more delightfully than Everett. The only downside to it all has been having to experience it.</p> <p>\"Oh, it's horrible,\" he says. \"You've been lulled into being somebody very important in a business \u2013 and our business is all about status \u2013 so every idea you have when it's going well, everyone says, 'That is a great idea, Rupert, we've got to go and have a meeting about that.' You think it's because it's the most fantastic idea, but you have the same idea the next year and no one listens. So it's a character destruction. You have to die \u2013 it's dying. The disaster is holding on. You keep acting in the way that you were to those people to whom you are no longer who you were, and they go, \"You're not that person any more.' And&nbsp;that's when you become really vile. That's what normally happens.\"</p> <p>Everett has always blamed all his false starts and failures on Hollywood's prejudice against an openly gay leading man. Any suggestion that self-sabotage might have played a part, too, has made him terribly indignant in the past, but today, when I observe that at the very height of his My Best Friend's Wedding renaissance, he scandalised America by telling a tabloid about his days as a rent boy, he just lets out a guilty little laugh. \"Did I? Oh.\"</p> <p>By his own admission, he behaved appallingly towards the director of Dance With A Stranger when he was still far too young to have seriously expected to get away with it. And how could he have thought Madonna wouldn't mind being called a \"whiny old barmaid\" who played with her boyfriend's penis in public? For all the white heat of Everett's ambition, I'm not convinced he ever truly wanted the success he thought he craved.</p> <p>\"That's weird, because I'm playing Oscar Wilde at the moment [in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/12/the-judas-kiss-review\" title=\"\">The Judas Kiss</a>], and people say about him that he sabotaged himself. And I&nbsp;don't know that you realise, yourself. I mean, obviously it's true, but whether it's just from being a silly fairy or from really, inside, wanting to sabotage things, I don't know.\" Which does he think it is in his case? \"Both, probably.\"</p> <p>He thinks Aids had a lot to do with some of his early diva-ish misbehaviour. \"Having been such a&nbsp;slag and a slut in the 1970s, then Aids came along and I spent six years in sheer terror.\" A mosquito bite on set one day was enough to plunge him into meltdown, when he mistook the red mark for a lesion. \"That was part of my landscape then, this terror that was always there. Nearly everyone I slept with was dying, you couldn't test until about 1986, and that was really the big period of my life. That's what all queens went through who'd been in those days beforehand, when everyone fucked everyone just as a matter of course, so I think that's what started everything off for me in a kind of weird, skewed way. Because terror makes you behave very strangely. People have forgotten about that. It was absolute terror. So living like that, if something niggled you, you&nbsp;could explode and be really difficult.\"</p> <p>I ask if he's ever had therapy and he looks appalled. \"No!\" He has been to a hypnotherapist, though \u2013 \"To get me to go to work with a more cheerful attitude\" \u2013 and to his amazement it worked. He thinks he'll probably need to see her again, though. \"Mmm. Old habits die hard.\"</p> <p>These days, he's a brilliantly funny observer of celebrity tantrums \u2013 \"screaming and throwing things and torturing assistants and complaining about the schedule of their next movie to various vassals in offices still open on the coast\" \u2013 so I&nbsp;tell him I can't understand how he can write like that and still be capable of behaving like that. \"Oh, because you behave like a diva when you get tired. For example, last week I was really nasty to the lady in the wardrobe of my new play about putting on my new wig \u2013 I was horrible to her. Well, I just was horrible, because I was incredibly nervous and this lovely lady who doesn't normally put on wigs was very nervous, and I&nbsp;was unsure. I loathed the wig, and result: sheer&nbsp;tsunami of divadom.\"</p> <p>And in that moment it feels entirely justified? \"Oh, absolutely, yeah. Female circumcision was about to happen.\" And afterwards, how does he feel? \"Awful. Terrible.\" Yet never so bad that it won't happen again? He offers a carelessly elegant little mea culpa shrug. \"But things happen, don't they?\" He chuckles, then sighs. \"Things happen.\"</p> <p>His problem, he thinks, might be that he grew up in the 1970s with a misleading impression of&nbsp;what stardom would entail and demand. \"That&nbsp;was when stars like Elizabeth Taylor said exactly what they thought, and my notion of being a star was that there&nbsp;was only one way it was valuable, and that's if you are yourself. Not these mirages \u2013 these ghost figures, untouchable, who don't allow themselves to be anything.\" I wonder if he thinks he might also have been just a bit too clever. \"For acting? Oh, yeah. I'm much too intelligent. The best thing to be is bovine in acting \u2013 it looks best on screen. Yes, I think being bovine is definitely a&nbsp;plus. Because then, if you just go, 'Moo', everyone goes, 'Oh my God, that guy has got so much hidden depth' because they&nbsp;can put anything they want into the moo.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396778315\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348744018892/Rupert-Everett-and-Freddi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett and Freddie Fox in The Judas Kiss\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett as Oscar Wilde and Freddie Fox as Bosie in The Judas Kiss, London, 2012. Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways Everett must be the&nbsp;closest approximation we're ever likely to see of a&nbsp;21st-century Oscar Wilde. He is capable of sincere appreciation of almost any activity, if skilfully executed; tabloid trickery is \"genius\", advertising is \"genius\", and when I point out that the Third Reich could also be described as genius, he looks pleasantly surprised. \"That's the kind of thing I&nbsp;would say.\" But he's equally sincere about the charitable causes he's supported and gets worked up about everything from global poverty to the law that requires Jamaicans to get visas before they can visit Britain. \"Just because, what, maybe some dealers are going to come over? We need dealers, to be quite honest. It's the English who&nbsp;want the drugs. It's so unfair.\" He adores the traditional high Tory old-fashioned values of stoicism and honour, while extolling a languid sort of affectless libertarianism \u2013 \"People can do whatever they like, as far as I'm concerned\" \u2013 and finds everything either wildly funny or deeply serious, sometimes simultaneously. Around his neck hangs a gigantic, diamond-encrusted crucifix, but his last words before we part are a&nbsp;baroque rant against churches.</p> <p>\"Why do queens want to go and get married in churches? Obviously this crusty old pathetic, Anglican church \u2013 the most joke-ish church of&nbsp;all jokey churches \u2013 of course they don't want to have queens getting married. It's kind of understandable that they don't; they're crusty old calcified freaks. But why do we want to get married in churches? I don't understand that, myself, personally. I <em>loathe</em> heterosexual weddings; I&nbsp;would never go to a wedding in my life. I loathe the flowers, I loathe the fucking wedding dress, the little bridal tiara. It's grotesque. It's just hideous. The wedding cake, the party, the champagne, the inevitable divorce two years later. It's just a waste of time in the heterosexual world, and in the homosexual world I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster.\"</p> <p>So I wasn't entirely surprised when, just a few days later, he landed himself in trouble. It was a&nbsp;throwaway remark to a Sunday supplement \u2013 \"I&nbsp;can't think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads\" \u2013 and within hours the world's media was buzzing with letters from&nbsp;angry gay dads calling Everett a dinosaur. Like every other ding-dong to have ever come his way, it seems to have taken him by surprise, because he calls and invites me to lunch to explain what he meant.</p> <p>\"For me, being gay was about wanting to do the&nbsp;opposite of the straight world, so I think that's&nbsp;where my problems in this particular area come from. For me, personally, the last thing I would like in the entire world would be to go through cocktailing my sperm with my boyfriend and finding some grim couple in Ohio who are gluten-free and who you pay $75,000 to have your baby. To me it feels absolutely hideous. But that's me, just me. I'm not having a go at gay couples who do. I think if Elton and David want to&nbsp;have babies, that's wonderful. I think we should all do what we want.</p> <p>\"Isn't there a middle way, where you can just say, 'Not for me, but it doesn't matter'? But no, everything's sort of turned into al-Qaida. I'm sure I'm going to be nail-bombed. David Furnish is probably going to send Patrick Cox with a bomb and blow up the theatre.\" Beneath the expression of&nbsp;pained innocence, he looks rather&nbsp;thrilled.</p> <p>\u2022 Vanished Years, by Rupert Everett, is published by Little, Brown at \u00a320.

  "<p><strong>My wife and I are having trouble with Lloyds Bank. I have my account with one of the bank's local branches, and my wife's account is with one of its other branches further away.

We had no prior knowledge of this and have no wish to bank with the Co-op. Up to now we have had very good service and have been very satisfied with Lloyds. Is the manager's advice correct? We feel we are not in control of our own finances. </strong><em>RR,</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Bournemouth</em></p> <p>In July this year, the Co-operative secured a deal with Lloyds Banking Group to take over 632 Lloyds TSB and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester branches. The affected branches will first be rebranded to TSB in the summer of 2013, ahead of a deal being completed by November 2013. Lloyds has <a href=\"http://www.lloydstsb.com/\" title=\"\">published a list of affected branches on its website</a>, but that does not help customers who don't use the net or have not read the story online.</p> <p>As the details of the deal are not yet finalised, it is also unclear exactly what will happen to existing customers, which is why we know of a number of people in your position who are also concerned.</p> <p>In your case, for example, because your husband uses Lloyds, it may be possible for you to remain with the bank regardless of what happens with other branch customers. You could switch branches now by opening a new account at your husband's branch and arrange a bank transfer to move over all your direct debits, standing orders and so on. However, Lloyds suggests that your wife sits tight for now. It says that once the deal has been agreed and it has written to customers, which it expects to do in the new year, an \"opt-in\" and \"opt-out\" process will be in place, subject to regulatory approval, which will help customers choose where they want to bank.</p> <p>In the meantime, nothing will change with your wife's accounts, services or branch until the middle of next year. Lloyds says that, well before the point that things could change, it will have confirmed to your wife \"whether she is going to be divested or not\" and the options available to her.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p><strong>I have recently returned from a family holiday in the US and have had big problems with Expedia. It started the day before departure when I noticed my name was wrong on my tickets for all three flights. I rang Expedia in some state of worry and was told we would have to cancel the tickets and buy some more \u2013 no hint of any sympathy or customer service at all.</strong></p> <p><strong>I agreed to buy a new ticket at a cost of almost \u00a31,000 to New York to save the holiday. Expedia promised to try to amend the two remaining flights: to&#xa0;San Diego, and home from San&#xa0;Francisco. It said there was plenty of availability so this should be fine and would get back to us.</strong></p> <p><strong>Nothing happened so we rang from New York at a cost of \u00a31.40 a minute, and were told new tickets had been ordered for us at the cost of a further \u00a31,500. We were told that if we didn't like this, we could cancel, claim back the tax, and sort out new tickets for ourselves.</strong></p> <p><strong>We found cheaper flights ourselves for around \u00a3750 and tried to cancel with Expedia by email but couldn't due to security \u2013 so we asked if Expedia could ring us, as calls from New York were expensive. Expedia rang our house in England then emailed us to say \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 that there was no reply.</strong></p> <p><strong>Finally, it cancelled the tickets and promised a tax refund within seven to 10&#xa0;days. Twenty&#xa0;one days later, still nothing. We have contacted Expedia to try to get some compensation but have had no luck. </strong><em>PO, Newcastle</em></p> <p>Another week, another complaint about Expedia. Yours was one of the worst on our pile, not only because of the size of the financial loss but also because of the impact on your holiday. Aside from the time you spent sorting this out, you were also forced to endure an interrogation by airport police at Newark airport, who were suspicious about why you had booked your one-way flight alone and right at the last minute. The trip was also meant to be a celebration for your 50th&#xa0;birthday, which you claim was ruined as a result of Expedia's mistake.</p> <p>It appears an agent with fat fingers was to blame for your initial problem. Expedia says that \"all our agents are trained to check names carefully when placing a booking\", but that on this occasion the agent entered your name incorrectly. It has refunded you \u00a31,701.90, which covers your extra flights and phone calls, and&#xa0;has given you \u00a3250 in&#xa0;Expedia vouchers.</p> <p>We asked Expedia what it was doing to fulfil the promise it made in its statement to us that it would \"ensure such issues are not repeated\". It says it is working on a process to \"prevent such delays in the resolution of any name mistakes made over the phone and to significantly reduce \u2013 or remove entirely \u2013 the costs to the customer\".

  "<p>What an astonishing place <a href=\"http://www.thewappingproject.com/\" title=\"\">the Wapping Project</a> gallery is. This hulking Victorian brick building, a&#xa0;former hydraulic power station, squats in its neglected, scrubby grounds like the setting for a&#xa0;particularly gothic melodrama. Inside, its restaurant is even lovelier, if your tastes run to the monolithic and vaguely ruined. The combination of concrete, soaring ceilings and cracked tiles with iconic modernist furniture can render even the jaded restaurant-goer temporarily speechless. Vast hooks on chains dangle from the ceiling. And, in the evening, abandoned machinery, its peeling paint mottled with rust, twinkles with candles, a bit like&#xa0;draping Godzilla in fairylights.</p> <p>OK, I'm gushing. But I'm a huge fan of Wapping Food and its creator, the clever and slightly scary theatre director and curator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jan/20/features.jobsmoney18\" title=\"\">Jules Wright</a>. So much so \u2013 full disclosure \u2013 that this is where I had my wedding party. Wright is given to tinkering with her giant baby \u2013 furniture might change overnight, or it might sprout a book-stuffed greenhouse \u2013 but the open kitchen has been remarkably consistent, run for several years by the talented Cameron Emirali. His departure earlier this year \u2013 to run his own place, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/26/jay-rayner-restaurant-greek-street\" title=\"\">10 Greek Street</a> \u2013 left a hole as niggling as a missing tooth.</p> <p>So I'm here to check out new chef Matthew Young, his CV a mix of London names-to-drop (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/19/margot-henderson-rochelle-canteen-interview\" title=\"\">Rochelle Canteen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/nov/15/restaurants.restaurants\" title=\"\">Anchor &amp; Hope</a>) and New York big-hitters (<a href=\"http://elevenmadisonpark.com/\" title=\"\">Eleven Madison Park</a>, <a href=\"http://ilbuco.com/\" title=\"\">Il Buco</a>). It looks as if he might be a bit of a star turn. His menus zip along without waffling, but are lively with curiosities: coco beans, za'tar, cow's curd. They're not just there for effect: he knows what he's doing.</p> <p>With the exception of an assembly of lardo with black figs and rocket \u2013 fine ingredients, but nothing to bind or cohere \u2013 every dish we try is as exhilarating as the setting. Young uses n'duja to add musky heat to plump palourde clams with octopus;&#xa0;and sumac to deliver a hit of refreshing sourness to a slab of cod, its Basque-style pil-pil sauce daringly slicked with dill oil.</p> <p>Duck \"two ways\", a familiar combo of crisp confit leg and ruby-rare slab of breast, comes with a dense puree of carrot and hazelnut, ripe and autumnal. I do wish chefs would stop that trick of dragging the spoon through the sauce (though it's still preferable to my other plate-dressing bete noir, the \"skidmark\").</p> <p>The killer dish is a starter of tempura borage, the lemon-scented leaf battered and fried with the lightest of hands. The crunch of herb paired with clean-tasting, sweet white crabmeat, the thick creaminess of labneh and fleeting impression of liquorice from fennel fronds is one of my mouthfuls of the year.</p> <p>Truthfully, if Young's cooking hadn't been up to snuff, I wouldn't have written about it: yep, I love Wapping Food that much. But he's a&#xa0;worthy successor to Emirali, sharing his willingness to let ingredients tell their own story, but happy to give it a bit of playfulness. He has an instinct for things that wind up being more than the sum of their parts: I'm still dreaming about a&#xa0;limpid chicken broth, its savoury depths intensified by mushrooms and nubbly wheat grains with the genius addition of wafer-thin foie gras on top. It's a&#xa0;murky rockpool of gorgeousness. And there's something to be said for a&#xa0;restaurant that invites you to lie in&#xa0;an asylum-style metal bed in disturbing gloom, 3D glasses on, watching a writhing, naked woman projected on to the ceiling by way of&#xa0;post-prandial entertainment.</p> <p>Wapping Food is never going to be&#xa0;everyone's cup of matcha: too cerebral and uncompromising. Even&#xa0;the wine list refuses to countenance anything that doesn't come from Wright's native Australia, but it's rammed with well-priced dazzlers, so who's complaining? Its cool, arty constituency would never dream of anything as cheesy as going down on one knee, but I think it shimmers with edgy romance.

  "<h2><strong>My employer is so nice I feel guilty about handing in my notice</strong></h2> <p><strong>I recently started at a company which I am enjoying compared with the last two, which were nightmares. </strong></p> <p><strong>My current company is totally different, and I feel bad but am looking to move away as I am still living at home. I have only been with the firm for two months. I am doing well, but have to leave the area to further my career and life in general.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel I am being unfair to employers who have been so nice, and I will feel guilty handing in my notice. Should I be offered the job for which I am soon to be interviewed, what would your advice be? Would you recommend I ask my new employers to contact my current employer for a reference?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>The first and most obvious point to make is one you already know: don't count your chickens. Unless, and until, you have a firm offer from this company you're soon to be interviewed by, don't let a hint of your intentions slip out. The worst thing of all would be for your current excellent employers to catch a whiff of what you were up to, and then for you not to get the job.</p> <p>I'm glad you feel a bit guilty about handing in your notice; I think you should have been able to foresee your need to move away. Having said that, you must not allow guilt to dissuade you from taking up a better job if and when offered. But do be quite exceptionally open with, and grateful to, your current employer. If your new job permits, offer to help find your replacement and stay on long enough to effect a smooth transition.</p> <p>The question of references may be out of your hands. If at all typical, your new boss will almost certainly want a reference, and probably before your contract's finally signed. So don't let anything that your current boss might say come as a surprise. You already risk being thought a bit unreliable. Don't give them any reason to believe you're devious or deceitful as well.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Presumably this job has a probationary period? If you leave after two months (or three) for something better, or more suited to you, I don't think it would look bad. <strong>lporter</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Never quit a job unless you've got a new one lined up in this economic climate. Never. <strong>StueLDUK</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Is it a good idea to uproot on two fronts at the same time? New job and new living environment at once may be a challenge too far. Continue living at home for a while, save some money, get some valuable experience in a job you appear to like. Then apply for another job next year? <strong>farawayfromleeds</strong></p> <h2><strong>I went into teaching but it's not for me. What can I do now?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I have a 2.1 degree in economics, and after graduating went into teaching. I chose to train as a maths teacher, but since my degree was not in mathematics I did a six-month maths enhancement course, and subsequently got a place on a local graduate teaching programme (GTP).</strong></p> <p><strong>However, my school placement did not turn out to be great. I ended up with a very unsupportive maths faculty and a mentor with whom I could not agree on anything. To make matters worse, the school was given a \"notice to improve\". The local teaching authority in charge of the GTP could not find me another school and I was advised to withdraw from the course, so decided to quit.</strong></p> <p><strong>I had hoped to get more experience and apply for a PGCE some time in the future. I moved to London and ended up getting a job as a cover supervisor in a secondary school. I've been here for two years and come to realise that, after seeing what teachers go through in a modern inner-city comprehensive, teaching is not what I want to do.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am quite passionate about working in business, the private sector, government policymaking (civil service) etc. With my economics/maths background I think I can offer so much, but feel I'm stuck. I am generally confused as to what I should apply for, or where I take my career from here. I don't think I can commit two years to teaching (PGCE &amp; NQT) just for the sake of having a qualification.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Can you remember why, all those years ago, you chose economics as your degree subject? There must have been some enthusiasm there \u2013 yet oddly you never seem to have pursued it. The moment you got your degree, you elected to go into teaching, which meant getting a maths qualification. Now, some years on, you've come to the conclusion that teaching's not for you \u2013 but feel \"quite passionate about working in business, private sector, government policymaking (civil-service) etc\". I have to say, these alternatives don't immediately seem to have a great deal in common.</p> <p>The mistake I believe you're making is a familiar one. You're confusing a degree in a given subject with an aptitude; while the first may certainly contribute to the second, they're not at all the same thing. Employers don't want people just because they've got a degree. They see a degree as objective evidence that an individual has certain basic levels of intelligence and diligence, but beyond that they want people who can do things; have skills and abilities; who make things happen.</p> <p>When you say that with your economics/maths background you feel you've much to offer, your confusion on this point is clear, and I think it also goes some way to explaining your general confusion about a career path.</p> <p>So forget about your qualifications for a moment and concentrate on your aptitudes. Teaching doesn't just demand an aptitude for teaching; or, put it another way, an aptitude for teaching is made up of many subsidiary aptitudes. What were your strong points?

  "<p>The year is 1992. John Major has just won an election and will become, in due course, the most unpopular prime minister since polling began. Edwina Currie's second volume of diaries opens with her being offered a job in the new government. The level of detail is unwarranted: anecdotes that were not of much consequence to begin with (she didn't want the job, asked if there was anything else, and they said no) are rendered perverse with intricacy (\"I was phoned at Findern at 12.50pm; I'd been in the office at Swad since 11am, and the kids were at home \u2026\"). The inner workings of her mind are depressingly mercenary \u2013 she wants to be an MEP because the \"weather is better, the money is interesting and the food both\". She wants to write a \"serious novel based in Westminster\" (it turns out she means <em>A Parliamentary Affair</em>), because it would be \"a challenge, could be fun, and might just sell a bit\".</p> <p>She will tell you the price of absolutely everything. Sometimes it's high spirits, such as the meandering paragraphs in which publishers bid for her \"serious book\". Other times I suppose there's a point to it \u2013 she explains her desire to leave parliament partly by the fact that she can't afford school fees on her salary, and so bestows the dignity of motive on an otherwise unreflective stream of huffing and moaning. But often it is just straight itemisation, every in and every out, from 50p per book in royalties to \u00a3150,000 earnt in the year 1995-96, to \u00a32.50 \"(outrageous!)\" spent on a pint of Becks. This has a kind of Brechtian alienation effect, a constant reminder not to become emotionally involved with the narrator because she has monetised her interior life. All that's going through her head is: \"I look nice, I'm sure that K\u00f6nigswinter industrialist fancies me, I bet he'd be head over heels if I bought this bra in peach cashmere \u2026 TWO HUNDRED AND HOW MANY DEUTSCHMARKS?\" Never is a belief in the supremacy of the market less helpful than when you're trying to tell a story.</p> <p>This isn't to say that the book is totally unengaging: Currie's style is arch and straight-talking, full of sideswipes (\"it's such a pity that I can't stand her\", of Virginia Bottomley), open attacks (on everyone whose success she ever felt displaced by \u2013 which is pretty much everyone in her party), derision (for everyone in any other party) and, when all else fails, a snide remark about someone looking fat or dowdy. It's so downright unpleasant at times that you peer in for the seam of a joke, but you'd look long and hard (she berates Shelagh Roberts for fighting and losing a European seat while she was ill: \"What a remarkably brave woman \u2013 but it would have been better for the party \u2026 if she had allowed someone else to fight it\"). Other times, it's so sentimental that, again, it's hard to take it at face value. Sitting down to begin writing her parliamentary bonkbuster (which, with hindsight, was most probably intended as a warning to John Major), she writes: \"I've ordered a new computer, faster and quieter and lighter than the old one \u2026 Please God, support me and help me find a voice.\" Why would God, of all people, support such an endeavour?</p> <p>That is all quite diverting, though you'd have to be interested in early 90s politics to a pathological degree to plough through 300 pages of it. It's not the length that makes it deadly, so much as the pointless detail combined with a lack of self-awareness, the first doubtless a consequence of the second, since nobody who'd ever given one minute's thought to whether they were adding to or depleting the sum of human happiness would ever write: \"The chimney breast in the study is also wet and a bit smelly. So we haven't finished here yet.\" She makes this telling remark after a shopping trip: \"I look stunning in Balenciaga and Ungaro and Karl Lagerfeld, but \u2026 the Chanels and Yves St Laurent looked ordinary.\"</p> <p>Throughout, when things go well, it's because she's stunning; when they go badly, it's because someone else is ordinary. After all that fussing about school fees, her older daughter does poorly in her A levels. \"This against a background of a record national entry and a record 80% getting A, B or C [Debs got a C and two Ds]. So Denstone [the school] has a lot to answer for.\" It never occurs to her to look for fault in her own daughter, and neither does it give her a second's pause about private schools being, just possibly, a giant waste of money.</p> <p>There are ideas that I can't help thinking were added after the fact \u2013 it's true that she is on record as wanting to bring down the age of consent for homosexuals but it seems improbable that many of her close friends died of Aids, as she claims. I also doubt that anybody who had thought deeply about sexual politics in this era would use the phrase \"HIV positive\" as a noun (yes, really: \"On Tuesday Margaret [Thatcher] herself had derided the whole business by saying she had had scrambled egg for breakfast that morning. She might just as well have said she slept with an HIV positive at the height of our Aids campaign\").</p> <p>Oh yes, the politics \u2013 various paragraphs overflow with names, all footnoted so that we learn what constituency they held but nothing else. Dramas are called \"exciting\": no evidence appears. Indignation burns from the prose, but there's no insight or reflection, which makes it sour and underpowered, like bitching about people who are dead.</p> <p>But John Major \u2013 he's still alive, if anything more convincingly so now than he was then. Currie's feelings for him are contradictory; she is bitterly resentful of almost everything, from being offered the wrong job to being served some unsatisfactory lamb. And yet, catch her late-night reveries and she could well be thinking \"Funny how I used to wait at this hour for a visitor! He might be performing better elsewhere if he still came to see me\", as though she were some sort of fluffer for conservatism. As much as this is a book about all the brilliant things she's done, it's a book about all the things that would have been better if she'd done them. Remembering the Major government, it's hard to conceive of its having been worse; but that's about as far as I can travel with this analysis.</p>",
  "<p>Hippy redoubt, artsy hub, unofficial lesbian capital of Britain, ecotown, hill walker's paradise \u2026 is there a more Guardian-friendly destination than Hebden Bridge?</p> <p>The \"new\" White Lion offers another persuasive reason to visit. This old boozer is now a polished country inn, all log fires, smart designer fabrics and references, in wood panelling and exposed stone, to this Grade II-listed building's 17th-century vintage. In a West Yorkshire town that, unusually, lacks great pubs (the outlying <a href=\"http://www.stubbingwharf.com/\" title=\"\">Stubbing Wharf</a> is one real ale beacon), Michael Grimes and Rebekah Grayson's revival of the Lion is clearly welcome. On a rain-lashed Tuesday night, it is packed, the convivial hubbub merging with a discrete background soundtrack of Sinatra and Fitzgerald. Thanks to candles and sensitively distributed lights the whole place is suffused in an amber glow as warm and enticing as a glass of good single malt.</p> <p>Upstairs, four \"boutique\" rooms (\u00a3125) are finished to a similarly high spec, with rain showers and roll-top baths in chic slate bathrooms. If they lack vivid personality, the building, with its sloping floors and cobbled courtyard overlooking the Hebden river (and, erm, the back of Boots), adds quirky character. There is also a beauty room where Grayson offers treatments, which I didn't try. My face is beyond repair.</p> <p>Be warned, however, that not all the rooms have been renovated to this standard. The four cottages (\u00a395, dogs welcome) have had a \"cosmetic\" face-lift, ahead of full renovation in November.</p> <p>I ended up, as the pub was fully booked, in room five (two doubles in separate rooms), which is a half-finished hotchpotch \u2013 its trendy striped carpet at odds with the scruffy old bathroom suite. At \u00a3125, for four adults, the room is fair value (breakfast, where high-quality local ingredients shine, is included in the room rate), but at \u00a3105 for one couple it's not. Either way, until its January refurb, that room will lag behind. Certain details could be tweaked, too. The underpowered shower takes more than 90 seconds to come warm (a higher pressure boiler is being installed); the toiletries look a bit naff, and why, when you have a good kitchen, spoil a good tea tray (Yorkshire Gold, Taylors tea, ground coffee) with bought-in biscuits?</p> <p>In that kitchen, chef Simon Marshall has devised a broadly sensible menu of affordable pub dishes with, this being Hebden Bridge, plenty of vegetarian options. There is the occasional unnerving creative flourish (a lasagne of hot-smoked salmon, spinach and mozzarella, topped with garlic bread, is, if not unpleasant, strange), but a bowl, or rather a bucket \u2013 \"We're known for our portions,\" laughs Grayson \u2013 of rich beef stew topped with a perfect suet dumpling (\u00a310.95) is very tasty. Crisp, spicily bitter, Slightly Foxed, one of five well-kept ales (\u00a33.30), is a good foil.</p> <p><em>\u2022 For information on Yorkshire, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.yorkshire.com\" title=\"\"><em>yorkshire.com</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The department of homeland security has agreed to consider same-sex partners as being in a \"family relationship\" during immigration proceedings, in a move that may spare undocumented immigrants in long-term partnerships with US citizens the grief of forced separation.</p> <p>The concession, enshrined in writing in a letter from the DHS secretary, Janet Napolitano, softens one of the most bitterly resented aspects of the Defence of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and woman. Under DOMA, immigration rights that are extended to bi-national heterosexual couples are not similarly offered to gays and lesbians.</p> <p>\"One of the most painful aspects of the Defence of Marriage Act is when couples are separated. So we are happy to see the DHS acting on this,\" said Victoria Neilson, legal director of Immigration Equality, a group that advocates for changes in US immigration laws relating to the LGBT community.</p> <p>Napolitano's letter is the latest move by the Obama administration to use its procedural powers to ameliorate some of the harshest aspects of immigration law without having to face political opposition in Congress. In June the administration allowed young undocumented immigrants who had come to the US as children and were in education to apply for a deferral of any threat of deportation for two years. More than 80,000 people have applied for deferred action so far.</p> <p>The procedural shift on deportations of gay partners is much smaller in its likely reach. It is estimated that there are about 24,000 gay and lesbian couples in the US where one partner is a national of another country, though how many of those are without immigration authorisation is not known.</p> <p>The DHS has been saying for more than a year that it wanted to focus its resources on priority cases for deportation, such as those with criminal records. It has made clear that it would treat favourably anyone with strong family or community ties in the US, though until now it left the status of gay relationships unclear.</p> <p>Napolitano's letter removes the ambiguity. She writes that guidance will now be sent to all immigration officers in the field, to clarify for them that \"family relationships includes long-term, same-sex partners\".</p> <p>The DHS secretary has been coming under mounting pressure to do something about the status of gay couples facing immigration problems. In July, a group of 84 members of Congress wrote to her, asking her to put into writing the equal position of gay couples in terms of deportation proceedings.</p> <p>One of the authors, Michael Honda of California, told NBC News: \"No one should have to choose between their spouse and their country, and no family should be left out of the immigration system.\"</p> <p>Immigration Equality has tried to persuade the DHS to grant what would in effect be temporary visas to undocumented immigrants. DOMA prohibits LGBT partners of American citizens from applying for green cards that would grant them resident status.</p> <p>Under the Immigration Equality proposal, people could apply for the cards and their applications would then be put on hold, pending the repeal of DOMA which the Obama administration has indicated it supports. While their applications were on hold they would be granted temporary permission to stay in the country, although they would not have the right to work.</p> <p>The DHS, however, has indicated that it is not likely to implement such a proposal.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron and Nick Clegg were at odds over the EU on Friday night after the deputy prime minister warned of the dangers of abandoning British involvement in the European arrest warrant.</p> <p>Hours after the prime minister said Britain would opt out of a series of EU law and order measures, the deputy prime minister said the value of the warrant was highlighted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/28/megan-stammers-jeremy-forrest-found-bordeaux\" title=\"\">arrest in France of the teacher Jeremy Forrest</a>.</p> <p>Clegg spoke out after the prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/28/david-cameron-referendum-euro-crisis\" title=\"\">reached out to eurosceptics</a> by confirming that the British people would be given a say, possibly in a referendum, on any new EU settlement after the next general election. In an interview with Sky News in Rio de Janeiro, Cameron said major changes to the EU in the light of the eurozone crisis would require \"fresh consent\" from the British people.</p> <p>In a sign of a more immediate hardline approach, the prime minister said that Britain would exercise its rights to stand apart from a series of justice and home affairs measures later this year.</p> <p>Asked by the BBC whether Britain would opt out of EU justice and policing powers, he said: \"That has to be done before the end of the year, and the opt out is there. We'll be exercising that opt out.\"</p> <p>His remarks mean Britain will withdraw from 140 measures on justice and home affairs, including the European arrest warrant, later this year. The arrest warrant was used to capture one of the July 2005 bombers.</p> <p>Britain will then embark on a process of negotiations to opt in to some of the 140 measures. This is technically not allowed under EU rules which say that a country can either wholly opt in or wholly opt out.</p> <p>Clegg made clear he would press Cameron hard to maintain the arrest warrant. In a statement, his office said: \"The value of EU police co-operation has been demonstrated only today with the arrest using the European arrest warrant of Jeremy Forrest. Any opt out in this area is still under review and discussion. Our decision must follow the interests of national security, public safety and Britain's international reputation for leadership on cross-border security matters.\"</p> <p>In his remarks about consulting voters on changes to the EU, Cameron stopped short of specifically mentioning a referendum because the timing of a new EU agreement could mean it would make more sense to seek the consent of voters in a general election. The fact that he says the decision will come after the next election show he thinks EU negotiations on new eurozone governance arrangements will proceed slowly.</p> <p>The prime minister told Sky News: \"When we achieve that new settlement, I think we will be able to seek fresh consent from the British people. I will be setting that out in the autumn.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who is facing intense political pressure from the UK Independence party in the runup to the 2014 European parliamentary elections, believes voters will need to be consulted if the EU agrees a major treaty revision in the next few years.</p> <p>Eurozone leaders are expected to agree wide-ranging changes to the governance of the single currency, possibly by moving towards a fiscal union, to avoid a repeat of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of the new arrangements, but major changes will have to be agreed by all 27 EU members in a new treaty or a revision to the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>The prime minister is planning to use the treaty negotiations, in which Britain would have a veto, to recast Britain's relationship with the EU by repatriating powers. It is expected he will ask for the contents of the social chapter on social and employment laws, which is now sprinkled in various places of the Lisbon treaty, to be repatriated.</p> <p>Clegg's spokesperson said: \"The fresh settlement is essentially what David Cameron, as leader of his party, has said before. There is currently no process of treaty change under way and no treaty change proposal on the table.</p> <p>\"In 2011, the government legislated for an act to enable the British people to have the final say in any treaty change that pools further UK powers at the European level. As the PM said, EU membership is clearly in Britain's national interests, and in the interests of jobs, growth and investment in this country.\"</p> <p>Cameron will tread with care because Britain does not know when a major treaty revision will take place and he does not want to undermine Britain's negotiating position by sounding too shrill about a referendum.</p> <p>Some eurozone leaders want prompt action, but Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, has called for a slower approach. In his state of the union address recently, he floated the idea of using the results of elections to the European parliament in 2014 as a way of establishing a negotiating framework.</p> <p>Britain expects a slower approach because German chancellor Angela Merkel is focused on next year's federal elections. But Cameron feels the need to speak out now because there will be three EU summits before Christmas covering a banking union for the eurozone, the next seven-year EU budget and the eurozone crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Sinfield has led Leeds to some remarkable victories during his decade as club captain but rarely has his contribution to a win been so encompassing. The most decorated captain in the club's history provided an outstanding first-half display to give his side a commanding lead and then produced two decisive late contributions in an engrossing Super League semi-final.</p> <p>Wigan had somehow recovered from a woeful first half to lead 12-11 going into the closing stages, when Sinfield stepped forward. His towering, spiralling high kick was dropped by the young Wigan full-back Jack Murphy, a late replacement for the knee injury victim Sam Tomkins. When the retreating Wigan defence were caught offside at the next play-the-ball, there was only one man for the job. Sinfield stepped forward, keeping alive Leeds' hopes of retaining the Super League title.</p> <p>Alongside Sinfield in the Rhinos trenches, Rob Burrow produced a typically immersed performance in the absence of the suspended Danny McGuire, and Brett Delaney and Jamie Peacock were the pick of a tremendously hard working set of forwards. Now, a fifth Grand Final in six years awaits. \"At this time of year, when everyone is losing their nerve a bit, our fellas come into their own,\" the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott, said. \"This is a sensational group of people.\"</p> <p>His counterpart, Shaun Wane, cut a deflated figure. \"If you play for 40 minutes like we did in the first half against a quality team like Leeds you give yourself too much to do,\" he said. \"Leeds know how to grind out wins.\"</p> <p>All the pre-match talk had been of the absence of Tomkins but it is doubtful whether he could have done anything to impact on the dominance that Leeds enjoyed in the first half.</p> <p>The Rhinos had opened the scoring against the run of play, however. Wigan were enjoying a rare foray into the Rhinos half when Brett Finch's pass went behind his support players, and Kallum Watkins swooped on the ball to race 90 metres to the other end of the field.</p> <p>Sinfield added the simple conversion, and then began his own kicking master class as Leeds began to exert their control. He added a penalty when Harrison Hansen was penalised for interference and then kicked a superb 40/20 to launch another attack. With Wigan struggling to regroup they were caught offside on their own line. Sinfield added the resulting penalty and then extended the lead to 11 points with a drop goal from in front.</p> <p>At times, the home side may even have been grateful for Sinfield's decision to kick for the posts, with several of their forwards struggling to cope with the pace of the game. They fared little better with the ball either, with the sight of Gareth Hock resorting to a chip and chase for himself to try and find a way through the Leeds defence indicative of their inability to create any real chances.</p> <p>Whatever Wane, a passionate&#xa0;man at the quietest of times, said at the break had an effect within the first two minutes. Wigan quickly produced their first significant clean break of the match, their captain Sean O'Loughlin punching a big hole in the Leeds defence in midfield. On the back of the momentum created by that, Thomas Leuluai's perfectly delayed pass sent Hansen over to close the gap to five points.</p> <p>On the hour mark, Wigan took the lead for the first time. After Shaun Lunt had been adjudged to have knocked on, Brett Finch crafted a try for Pat Richards, who then converted from the touchline to make it 12-11.</p> <p>For a spell it looked as though Wigan would avenge their Challenge Cup semi-final defeat to the Rhinos. But, again, they had reckoned without Sinfield.</p> <p><strong>Wigan Warriors </strong>Murphy; Charnley, Goulding, Carmont, Richards; Finch, T Leuluai; Lima, O'Loughlin, Mossop, Hansen, Hock, Farrell. <strong>Interchange </strong>Lauaki, Smith, Flower, Hughes</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hansen, Richards. <strong>Goals</strong> Richards 2.</p> <p><strong>Leeds Rhinos </strong>Hardaker; Jones-Bishop, Watkins, Ablett, Hall; Sinfield, Burrow; K Leuluai, Lunt, Peacock, Jones-Buchanan, Delaney, Bailey. <strong>Interchange </strong>Kirke, Clarkson, Griffin, Ward</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Watkins. <strong>Goals</strong> Sinfield 4. <strong>Drop Goal</strong> Sinfield.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood (Mirfield). <strong>Attendance</strong> 8,235</p>",
  "<p>It could be a weekend of unhappy endings for England, as their hopes of defending the World Twenty20 title go on the line 24 hours before Kevin Pietersen's current central contract expires. However, there is another, much more cheery, pair of alternatives to Pietersen becoming a freelance cricketer and England crashing out of the tournament before the semi-final stage.</p> <p>Victory over New Zealand in their second Super Eights game in Pallekele on Saturday would give Stuart Broad's team a fighting chance of making the last four, although they would almost certainly have to win their last game against Sri Lanka on Monday to do so. The Pietersen case is less clearcut, but after all the positive noises that have been coming out of his camp and the England and Wales Cricket Board over the past couple of weeks, there must be a decent possibility of a new deal being announced over the weekend.</p> <p>He was conspicuous by his absence when the ECB announced on 7 September that 10 other England players would have their central contracts renewed when they expire on Sunday. \"In respect of Kevin Pietersen, discussions are ongoing,\" the ECB's statement said. Despite his subsequent omission from the squad for the four-Test tour of India that starts next month, the talks continued in Sri Lanka, where Pietersen has been fulfilling a lucrative media deal, and the ECB's chief executive, David Collier, hinted that they had gone well when he left Colombo at the start of the week.</p> <p>It is therefore thought to be a question of when, rather than if, Pietersen signs a new 12-month deal, which would bring him back under the control of the England management when it comes to thorny issues such as his availability to play in Australia's Big Bash t20 competition this winter, and for Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League next spring.</p> <p>As for the England players upon whom Pietersen will again be commenting on Saturday, the time for caginess has long since passed. The best players must get to the crease early and get the runs. In golfing terms this is no time to be lagging your putts.</p> <p>Broad had no hesitation in describing the New Zealand game as a \"must-win match\". The focus now is on England's batting and whether their men are coming out in the right order. Their run-chase against West Indies was a curious affair, in which the margin of defeat was probably flattering \u2013 to England. They lost two wickets in the first three balls of the innings and just two more in the next 19.3 overs before ending up 15 runs short.</p> <p>The contributions of Craig Kieswetter and Luke Wright were unsatisfactory, but so, too, were those of Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales, albeit in trying circumstances. Bairstow could not score fast enough and by the time he was dismissed in the 10th over the game was up. Even Hales, stumped with two balls remaining, could not accelerate. Only Eoin Morgan batted flawlessly. His should have been a match-winning innings \u2013 71 from 36 balls usually does the business \u2013 but in reality England were never in the hunt.</p> <p>Reflecting on the match Broad outlined the problem clearly enough but was less forthcoming about the likely solution. \"What we have to do is stop losing early wickets and it has not been the same guy every time. But the No3 has been out there in the first couple of overs in every game. Which is not good enough. That can really hurt you.</p> <p>\"Last night you watch the best striker in the world in Chris Gayle and he never goes from ball one, does he? He has a little look, assesses the wicket then explodes. I think we haven't got that quite right yet, but it is important we do get that right tomorrow. We need to take a bit more responsibility and protect our wickets especially in the first over. Some of the decisions in that first over have been pretty poor.\"</p> <p>Clearly Kieswetter's position at the top of the order is under scrutiny, though Broad offered the reminder that he played \"a fantastic knock at Edgbaston only five games ago\". It would be more logical to drop Kieswetter down the order rather than to drop him from the team, which has been widely suggested. He is undoubtedly a better keeper than Bairstow.</p> <p>In which case Wright might operate as a makeshift opener though, however willing, he is not so much more reassuring against international bowlers than Kieswetter. The critical decision is to ensure that England make the most of Morgan, who, after his display against West Indies, is restored as their most dangerous and feared batsmen in this form of the game. There is no point having him in the dugout for too long. It is no easier to score runs there than in a TV studio.</p> <p><strong>England (from):</strong> SCJ Broad (capt), C Kieswetter (wk), AD Hales, LJ Wright, EJG Morgan, JM Bairstow, JC Buttler, SR Patel, GP&#xa0;Swann, ST Finn, JW Dernbach, DR&#xa0;Briggs,&#xa0;TT Bresnan.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand (from):</strong> LRPL Taylor (capt), RJ Nicol, MJ&#xa0;Guptill,&#xa0;BB McCullum (wk), KS Williamson, JDP&#xa0;Oram, NL&#xa0;McCullum, JEC Franklin, DL Vettori, TG Southee, KD&#xa0;Mills, AF&#xa0;Milne</p> <p><strong>Umpires:</strong> S Taufel (Aus) and A Rauf (Pak)</p> <p><strong>Third umpire:</strong> S Davis (Aus)</p> <p><strong>Match referee:</strong> J Srinath (Ind)</p>",
  "<p>A curious coincidence of events this month illuminates the limits of the conventions that mediate the relationship between monarchy and democracy. On Tuesday, the BBC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/poll/2012/sep/25/bbc-queen-frank-gardner-apologise-radio?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">apologised to the Queen</a> (with a startling obsequiousness) after Frank Gardner, the corporation's security correspondent, breached <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/guardian-law-blog/2012/sep/25/queen-abu-hamza-constitution?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">one of the conventions</a> by revealing that she had once told him of her concerns about Abu Hamza. The Queen's conversations, not only with ministers but with everyone, stay private: a compromise between the monarch's constitutional duty to advise, encourage or warn while remaining, constitutionally, above the political fray.</p> <p>A week earlier, in a <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/media/judgments/2012/evans-v-information-commissioner\" title=\"\">careful ruling</a> in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/prince-charles-letters-ministers-judges\" title=\"\">case brought by the Guardian</a>, the information tribunal upheld the right to see some specific correspondence between Prince Charles and ministers. The government argued that the so-called \"black spider\" memos, in which Charles promotes pet projects, were made in a personal capacity and should remain confidential. In a thumping rejection of this claim, the three judges found the missives were, while not actually unconstitutional, not within the terms of the conventions either. They concluded: \"Those who seek to influence government policy must understand that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing what they have been doing and what the government has been doing in response.\" The public interest was, they said, particularly strong where Charles was involved. His charities had such widespread interests that they potentially affected the work of many departments.</p> <p>This skirmish is not over: the government has a fortnight to decide whether to appeal. Yet the battle may be lost. In 2010, in what the former MP and constitutional campaigner Tony Wright called the \"Prince Charles\" clause, parliament agreed to exempt all of his correspondence from the Freedom of Information Act. The Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/13/charles-letters-freedom-information-act?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">has been told</a> that royal pressure led to it being rushed through just before the election. As a result, last week's FoI victory will not unleash a flood of material. It solely covers letters over a few months in 2004 and 2005.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/wato\" title=\"\">one royal biographer</a>, Charles regards being Prince of Wales as his life's work. He is said to accept that campaigning would be unacceptable if and when he becomes king. But this requires us to believe he can simply set aside strong views and assume the discretion needed to sustain the monarch's impartiality. In the meantime, accepting that his secret activism is time-limited makes it no more acceptable. Transparency and accountability are fundamental to good government.

  "<p>Women over 50 are bearing the brunt of the government's economic policies while often trying to cope with the increasing burden of caring for relatives, according to research carried out by the Labour party.</p> <p>Since the coalition came to power in May 2010, unemployment among women aged 50-64 has seen a huge 31% increase to 142,000, compared with an overall increase in all unemployed people over 16 of 4.2% to 2.6m, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_276985.pdf\" title=\"\">according to Office for National Statistics figures</a>.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian on women's issues before Saturday's party conference, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the generation of women who fought for equal pay, improvements in childcare and maternity leave were being caught in a bind between caring for elderly parents and grandchildren at the same time as suffering from outdated workplace practices. \"A toxic combination of sexism and ageism is causing problems for this generation,\" she said.</p> <p>Women as a whole have lost more jobs than men since 2010 (an estimated 11% increase) but women over 50 in particular have been hit hardest by the big cuts in local authority budgets.</p> <p>The number of long-term unemployed (those out of work for 12 months or more) has increased by 105,000 to 904,000 since May 2010 and women make up 82,000 of the rise, or 78%, although men are still a majority of the unemployed overall. In contrast, unemployment among men above the age of 50 has barely changed since 2010 despite the overall increase and budget cuts.</p> <p>As well as suffering from increased unemployment and changes to pension provisions, the over-50s are also dealing with the increasing life expectancy of their parents.</p> <p>In an attempt to help, the Labour party is to announce a social care information service for what it describes as a \"true squeezed middle\" as part of the launch of a special older woman's commission. Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the party and a long-term advocate on women's issues, will chair the commission.</p> <p>Cooper, who has responsibility for women and equalities as part of her Home Office brief, said: \"This is really a first step for women who don't even know where to go for help. They may have a mum in Bolton who increasingly needs help and support and they may live somewhere else and have no idea what to do. Whether it's the council, a voluntary organisation or just a neighbour, this information service will help.\"</p> <p>The scheme is similar to the family information service piloted by the party in the early 1990s to publish information on childcare providers.</p> <p>David Cameron has come under fire for policies that make it harder for women to work and also for behaviour (criticising his rival Ed Miliband for not being \"butch\" enough or telling a female MP to \"calm down dear\" among them) that appears to patronise them. In an effort to stem falling support among women in the polls, he appointed an adviser on women's issues last year, but in the latest reshuffle he failed to increase their overall number attending the cabinet above the previous five.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/21/labour-conservative-party-womens-issues-ipsos-mori_n_1903751.html\" title=\"\">opinion poll for the Huffington Post</a> this week suggested that Labour is ahead of the Tories by 22 points when it comes to looking after the interests of women.</p> <p>Overall, about 34% say Labour is best at looking after the interests of women, compared with 12% for the Conservatives. This gap has widened from a six-point split on the issue in February 2010, when 26% backed Labour as best at supporting women, compared with 20% for the Tories \u2013 a swing of eight points. What's more, this view is held by both men and women.</p> <p>In a speech at the pre-conference on Saturday, Cooper aims to take issue with the suggestion by Tory minister David Willetts that the first generation of women to benefit from changes in equality laws were somehow selfishly denying less educated men a chance to work. \"These women are the very opposite of selfish. They are often the generation holding the whole family together.\"</p> <p>In research done last year, Labour used parliamentary statistics to show that women contributed \u00a311bn of the \u00a315bn raised from changes to the tax and benefits system by the government since 2010.</p> <p>Cooper has raised concerns that the introduction of universal credit, which gives no allowance for a second earned income, will act as a disincentive to working mothers, while targeting the main earner could lead to women who traditionally collected child benefit losing control of the family budget. \"Changes are directed at the wallet rather than the purse,\" she said.</p> <p>The changes to tax and benefits come into force next April. The social care information service will start in Salford, and then the party plans to extend it across Labour-run authorities before the next election.</p>",
  "<p>Members of Congress and supporters of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) are to press the Obama administration to recognise it as the \"legitimate opposition\" to the Iranian government after the group is removed from the US list of banned terrorist organisations in the coming days. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, delisted the MEK as a terrorist group on Friday following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/iran-mek-group-removed-us-terrorism-list\">a well funded campaign to change the image of the group</a> \u2013 which was banned in 1997 because of a history of killing Americans, assassinating Iranian politicians and violent support for Saddam Hussein \u2013 and portray it as Washington's ally in confronting Tehran.</p> <p>The state department said it is not overlooking \"the MEK's past acts of terrorism\" and that it has \"serious concerns about the MEK as an organisation, particularly with regard to allegations of abuse committed against its own members\". But the group's renunciation of violence and \"the absence of confirmed acts of terrorism by the MEK for more than a decade\" had led to it being unbanned.</p> <p>Critics say it is a marginal organisation with little popular support in Iran, even among opponents of the Islamic government. Its removal from the terrorism list is seen as a political move that may complicate negotiations over Tehran's nuclear programme and provide a pretext for a further crackdown against the opposition.</p> <p>A group of 20 pro-MEK Iranian American groups in the US, some of which poured significant sums of money to donations to political campaigns and paying lobby firms to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/iranian-exiles-lobbyists-delist-mek\">press the case for the group's unbanning</a> on Capitol Hill, issued a statement praising the delisting.</p> <p>\"This action will liberate the largest peaceful, secular, pro-democratic Iranian dissident group from the constraints of US sanctions law and it represents a significant step by the Obama administration to promote a democratic and nuclear weapon-free Iran,\" they said.</p> <p>MEK supporters and members of Congress at the forefront of the campaign to unban the organisation now want the Obama administration to back it as a spearhead to regime change in Tehran. The delisting will leave the group free to raise funds without concerns of breaching anti-terrorism laws and to shift the focus of its now considerable political support, which includes scores of members of Congress and former top officials including ex-directors of the FBI and CIA, toward its campaign to topple the present government in Iran.</p> <p>A Texas congressman, Bob Filner, who has been among the most vigorous proponents of delisting the MEK, has described it as \"Iran's main opposition\" and a US \"ally\" against the Tehran government. Filner was the author of a pro-MEK resolution in Congress in favour of unbanning the organisation.</p> <p>Another member of Congress, Dana Rohrabacher, is also pushing for the US government to embrace the group as the \"legitimate opposition\" to the Iranian government. He has praised it as \"among the first to warn us of the Iranian nuclear programme\" and said he believes it to have cooperated with Israel in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists.</p> <p>Rohrabacher welcomed the delisting. </p> <p>\"The MEK was placed on the foreign trrorist organisations list in a misguided attempt by the Clinton administration to gain favour with the government in Tehran. The MEK are Iranians who desire a secular, peaceful and democratic government. Nothing threatens the mullah dictatorship more than openness and transparency,\" he said. </p> <p>Ted Poe, a member of Congress from Texas who has received political donations from Iranian Americans campaigning for the MEK to be delisted, has described the group as \"freedom fighters\" fighting \"the mullahs of Iran\" who he described as the \"real terrorists\". He, too, is pressing for the Obama administration to recognise the group. </p> <p>Homeira Hesami, president of the Iranian American Community of North Texas, said the delisting would free the MEK to campaign in the US. </p> <p>\"The removal of the MEK from the terrorist list will unshackle the movement in its efforts to bring change to Iran, will send a very strong message to the Iranian people that they can pursue their democratic aspirations, and serves notice to the ruling Ayatollahs that the days of blackmail and intimidation are over,\" he said. </p> <p>The MEK has described itself as a government-in-exile and self-appointed its leader, Maryam Rajavi, as Iran's de facto president in waiting. </p> <p>However, there is likely to be strong resistance from within the state department and US intelligence services \u2013 mindful of the experience of dealing with Ahmed Chalabi, who portrayed his Iraqi National Congress as having far more support than it had \u2013 to working with the MEK because it is seen by many US officials as a fringe organisation, even a cult, with little support on the ground in Iran. If anything, opinion in Iran is broadly hostile to the MEK in large part because it allied itself with Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. The group is also viewed by many as a tool of the American and British intelligence services, and possibly Israel's Mossad.<br> Iran's pro-democracy Green Movement spurned the MEK after the government tried to link the two in an attempt to discredit the popular opposition. Zahra Rahnavard, a Green Movement leader and wife of the former prime minister and now opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, has said the MEK is not representative of Iranians. </p> <p>\"The MEK can't be part of the Green Movement. This bankrupt political group now makes some laughable claims, but the Green Movement and the MEK have a wall between them and all of us,\" she <a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/09/22/congressional_backers_look_to_exiled_iranian_group_for_regime_change\">told Foreign Policy magazine</a> in 2010.</p> <p>Reza Marashi, a former official on the US state department's Iran desk who is now research director for the National Iranian American Council in Washington, said unbanning the MEK will do little to help the Iranian opposition. </p> <p>\"The majority in the country know that these guys fought with Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and they view them as traitors. During my time in Iran, and I'm still hearing this from people who are on the ground in Iran, there's little to no support,\" he said.</p> <p>Marashi said the delisting feeds into Tehran's narrative that the US is using the MEK for attacks on Iran and may complicate negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme. </p> <p>\"That affiliation will likely become even more of an excuse for the persecution of students and legitimate indigenous pro-democracy, pro-reform activists. But more than that, the delisting will be seen as a general hostile act. It's a boost to the regime because now they can use this as a pretext to crack down on the legitimate opposition inside the country. Any effect of the delisting on nuclear negotiations is going to be negative. The Iranian government will read it as one more indication that the US is only interested in hostility and regime change without coming to terms with the regime itself,\" he said. </p> <p>John Limbert, a state department diplomat who was held hostage in the US embassy after the 1979 Iranian revolution, and later served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Iran, called the delisting decision a \"strange and disappointing decision\".</p> <p>\"I know the group claims it has abandon its violent and anti-American past. I wish I could believe them. They have a very dubious history and a similarly dubious present,\" <a href=\"http://www.lobelog.com/analysts-respond-to-expected-us-decision-to-delist-mek-from-fto-list/#more-13843\">he told Lobelog</a>.</p> <p>The state department will not publicly discuss the decision to delist the MEK until Clinton formally announces it. But it follows a multi-million dollar campaign that won the support of members of Congress and a slew of prominent former officials, including former heads of the US military and ex-White House officials for unbanning the MEK.</p> <p>Iranian American groups recognised that contribution as they praised the decision to unban the group.</p> <p>\"The delisting was in part due to the perseverance of members of Congress and the courage shown by senior former US officials,\" said Ross Amin of the Iranian American Community of Northern California.</p>",

  "<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/ed-miliband-prime-minister-manchester\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband will address the Labour party conference</a>, giving his third speech as leader. It is not a make-or-break affair. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/24/labour-lead-tories-icm-poll?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Labour's poll lead is in double digits</a> and the party is uncharacteristically united.</p> <p>One shadow cabinet minister reckons that, of the three main Westminster leaders, Miliband is the only one sure to lead his party into the next election. That gives him a rare freedom on Tuesday. While Nick Clegg had to look over his shoulder at Vince Cable, and David Cameron will next week keep a permanent eye on Boris Johnson, Miliband can lift his gaze beyond the party gathered in the conference hall and address the country.</p> <p>The speech is written now, already circulated to close colleagues. The last thing Miliband will want is more unsolicited advice, still less a whole new draft. Nevertheless, in the spirit of public service, this column offers a proposed text for the Labour leader. Here is the speech he could give:</p> <p>\"Conference, it's traditional to begin with a dig at our opponents, often in the form of a slightly wince-worthy joke. Something, perhaps, about how a famous American late-night TV show last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/27/david-cameron-letterman-late-show?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">starred a guy called David</a> who knows nothing about Britain or its history \u2013 and also David Letterman. Or how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-armed-officers-plebs\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a>'s been taking Latin lessons from Boris: trouble is, he can't get past the word plebs. That kind of thing.</p> <p>\"Next, there usually comes a gag seeking to defuse some simmering internal tension. So here's where I gesture towards Ed Balls and say, 'We're not next-door neighbours and we're not brothers. As Labour rivalries go, that counts as an improvement.'</p> <p>\"But I can hear you groaning and I don't blame you. These are serious times and I'm a serious person. I couldn't look into the camera, oozing sincerity, like Nick Clegg, and I couldn't be a PR man for a rich TV company, like David Cameron. What you've heard about me is true. I'm the guy whose idea of holiday reading is a volume of political philosophy. I'm interested in ideas. And I don't apologise for that. Because if you want to know what a man with no interest in ideas looks like, look at David Cameron.</p> <p>\"I know that many of the people watching at home will feel as if they don't yet know me. You might have heard that my parents were Jewish refugees from the Nazis, two young people hounded out of a Europe that wanted people like them wiped out \u2013 but who found a haven right here in Britain. That history lives on inside me, even if I'm only now coming to grips with what it means for me and for the young sons Justine and I are raising.</p> <p>\"But there's more to my personal story than that. I came of age in the era of Thatcherism, a time defined by the slogan, 'There is no alternative'. My parents, and the procession of activists and campaigners who sat round our kitchen table, refused to accept that. They believed \u2013 and I learned \u2013 that there is always an alternative. That another world is possible.</p> <p>\"So when I see our economy struggling to breathe, while the government says there is only plan A \u2013 no alternative \u2013 I won't accept it. Cutting the deficit is vital, but it has to be done at the right time and in the right way or else it will make things worse. The evidence is all around us in Europe, in Greece, or in Spain: austerity squeezes the life out of an economy at the very moment it needs more oxygen.</p> <p>\"George Osborne makes a fetish of cutting the deficit, but the joke \u2013 the cruel joke \u2013 is that he's making the problem worse, not better. The national debt has actually gone up by 25% in two years under the coalition \u2013 and we've borrowed more this year than we did last. And it's no wonder, because only growth puts money into the national coffers. If that means short-term borrowing, so be it: after all, we're borrowing anyway. We can do it because, unlike the nations of the eurozone, we control our own currency and can borrow cheaply. And who do we have to thank for keeping us out of the euro? Gordon Brown and, yes, Ed Balls. You see, there is an alternative to plan A. Another world is possible.</p> <p>\"No one disputes that the deficit is a problem, one that looms over our generation. Once the economy is stable, we will have to deal with it. Strange to think there was a time when the main task of politicians was to decide how to slice up the pie, what to give away. Politics isn't like that any more. Which is why I started a debate last year about changing the economy itself.</p> <p>\"I <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/rebuilding-britain-real-change-for-britains-banks,2012-07-09\" title=\"\">spoke then about predators</a>. Today I want to tell you that the next Labour government will have zero tolerance of those who abuse the system to feed their own greed. Those who rig the system, as in the Libor scandal, won't get a slap on the wrists. They'll go to jail. And I'll implement the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/12/vickers-report-banks-given-until-2019?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Vickers proposals</a> in full, splitting the banks, separating casino from high street \u2013 and we won't wait till 2019. We'll do it straightaway.</p> <p>'But I also want to encourage the genuine producers, those who answer that crucial question: where will the jobs of the future come from? That means making the City the servant, not master, of the real economy, as well as nurturing the industries that make things people want to buy. Our labour market has become so short-term, so casualised, there's too little investment in the training and apprenticeships that take time to reap rewards. If we're going to be a high-skill economy, that has to change. And it can. Because another world is possible.</p> <p>\"And this is about more than the economy. For years we were told private is better than public \u2013 more efficient, more modern. Well, when it came to the crunch this summer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/28/g4s-executives-resign-olympics-security-failure\" title=\"\">who secured the Olympics</a>: was it G4S or was it the fine men and women of the British military? When the private sector failed, Private Smith stepped in.</p> <p>\"London 2012 showed us that another Britain is possible: a place that is proud, varied, hopeful and which knows that when we come together \u2013 athletes, volunteers and, yes, government \u2013 there is no limit to what we can achieve. This is the Britain I dream of, a country that shows itself \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 that there is an alternative.

  "<p>A group of authors has sounded a warning over the decline of non-fiction for children, calling on publishers and libraries to reverse the slide or risk depriving children \u2013 particularly boys \u2013 of vital reading material.</p> <p>Led by the prolific children's non-fiction writer <a href=\"http://www.jennypvaughan.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Jenny Vaughan</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/28/children-nonfiction-books-libraries\" title=\"\">26 authors have written to the Guardian</a> in an attempt to save a genre they believe is in terminal decline.</p> <p>\"We got to the end of our collective tethers,\" Vaughan said. \"We thought that something had to be done \u2013 that we've got to start making a noise about this before children's non-fiction is obsolete.\"</p> <p>In the letter the authors argue that \"once, there were hundreds of such books available, covering every topic imaginable \u2013 but, almost overnight, it seems, the market for them has almost vanished.

The majority of this is made up of sales of study guides \u2013 worth \u00a322.6m \u2013 with the range of TV tie-in books on the Moshi Monsters taking the top five chart slots and making \u00a32.2m over the period, up 35% on last year.</p> <p>Caroline Horn, children's literature expert and editor of the children's books resource <a href=\"http://www.readingzone.com/home.php\" title=\"\">Reading Zone</a>, agreed that children's non-fiction had declined significantly in recent years.</p> <p>\"Publishers have cut back, partly because of people like Waterstones completely cutting back on non-fiction about six or seven years ago. It started then and it's got progressively worse as the internet has become more powerful,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Without these character/TV-based books [such as Moshi Monsters], there would be an enormous slide in non-fiction sales \u2013 what we see as traditional reference books, encyclopaedias, topic books etc \u2013 which is very dispiriting for authors and publishers, and damaging for the children and young people who need it to help develop them as readers.\"</p> <p>Vaughan's fellow author and signatory to the letter Phil Steele called it a \"pretty dire situation\". He said: \"If you go into bookshops you see the lack of children's non-fiction on the shelves, [and] a lot of writers have thrown in the towel.\"</p> <p>The authors believe that booksellers are focusing on children's fiction, and have \"all but given up\" on non-fiction, partly because \"the strictures of the national curriculum have driven many publishers to stop producing anything very original, and how many books on vikings and rainforests do we really need?\"</p> <p>Instead of innovative, new non-fiction titles, there are \"endless 'Horrible History' imitations\", they say.</p> <p>They point to the All Party Literacy Group's 2012 report, <a href=\"http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/assets/0001/4056/Boys_Commission_Report.pdf\" title=\"\">Boys' Reading Commission</a> (pdf), in which Phil Jarrett, national adviser for Ofsted, says that boys \"tend to read&#xa0;\u2026 non-fiction, autobiographies, newspapers and so on\", and that boys in particular are \"turned off\" by a lack of texts that interest them.</p> <p>\"There is more to life than children's fiction,\" Vaughan said. \"It's wonderful all the attention it gets, but not all children want to read fiction all the time.\"</p> <p>The authors call for publishers to \"start to take risks again\", to break free from the curriculum and produce \"new non-fiction in forms and on subjects that will delight and inspire\".

  "<p>It's early Monday morning in a leafy corner of Hertfordshire and a cabal of senior Tesco executives are starting the week with a no-nonsense meeting in the staff canteen at the back of its Bishop's Stortford superstore.</p> <p>They are the top secret \"Baldock group\" \u2013 named after the Tesco Extra near its head office in Cheshunt where they first gathered \u2013 charged with stopping the rot at the UK's biggest retailer, which will report its first fall in profits in nearly 20 years next week. Philip Clarke, under pressure as chief executive, is at the head of the table and is close to losing his voice.</p> <p>Not, as it turns out, from bawling out the group, whose members include internet boss Ken Towle and UK chief operating officer Chris Bush. The previous day the Liverpool supporter was among the angry fans at Anfield lambasting the referee for sending off Jonjo Shelvey, sealing his team's defeat at the hands of Manchester United. But, after Tesco's shock profit warning in January, Clarke has also been banging his fists in the boardroom, prompting the unexpected departure of UK head Richard Brasher in March. On Wednesday he will be the one carrying the can for an expected 10% fall in group first half profits to \u00a31.6bn. UK profits are expected to fall 13% to \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>Until recently Tesco's grip on the nation's weekly grocery shop had looked unassailable, but deep fault lines were exposed when poor Christmas figures meant the retailer could no longer deny that shoppers, put off by grubby aisles and long queues at the checkout, were deserting its supermarkets. Last year, UK checkouts rang up two-thirds of the group's \u00a33.8bn full year profits, but Clarke said some of the spoils would be sacrificed in the coming year as executives went back on the floor en masse to reinvigorate the chain.</p> <p>At its full-year results in April, Clarke fleshed out a \u00a31bn fightback that would see 430 UK stores given a warmer new look, 8,000 extra staff to improve customer service and a painstaking product by product review of its thousands of own-label foods.</p> <p>The sheer energy of the Baldock group, which picks one of the grocer's 3,000 stores to meet in each week, is likely to strike fear into the hearts of competitors which in recent years have benefitted from apparent complacency at the market leader. There are 150 projects on the boil, with Clarke using the new bank of \"self-scan\" guns which shoppers use to tot up their shopping as a sign of how quickly it is moving. After just two months they check out 15% of the store's transactions. The service had languished as a five-store trial for two years but, after getting the green light from the Baldock group, will land in 100 stores by Christmas. \"Don't ask me why it got stuck,\" says Clarke pointedly. \"Ours is not to look back but to look forward.\"</p> <p>Leading a whirlwind tour of the Hertfordshire store, Clark proudly plucks new products such as his current favourite, the \u00a31.89 frozen pea and asparagus risotto which takes seven minutes to stir-fry, off the shelves. He points to new features ranging from the patisserie to the power shakes in the health and beauty aisle which are in hot demand as Britons carry on the Olympic torch. When other executives are holding court, he straitens up the rows of cans and bottles, revealing a shopfloor pedigree that saw him first clocked in at Tesco as a 14-year-old stacking shelves in the store managed by his father.</p> <p>But good housekeeping is not Clarke's only headache. He picked up the baton from Sir Terry Leahy just as the supermarket industry was being jolted by a shopping revolution. The \"space race\", which had seen the leading chains spend the best part of two decades slugging it out for planning permissions for new stores, had started to look like an expensive waste of time as Britons increasingly turned to the internet to buy everything from CDs to groceries and garden sheds.</p> <p>With a market share of more than 30% Tesco won the supermarket space race but that victory has looked increasingly hollow as recession accelerates changing shopping habits. Higher prices at the pumps have encouraged Britons to \"top up\" on groceries at local shops rather than drive to an out-of-town superstore filled with temptations like DVDs and clothing.</p> <p>Suddenly Tesco's 230 sprawling Extras, which underpinned its growth during the last decade, look like \"expensive warehousing\", says Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Roberts: \"There is no doubt that the hypermarket is losing its appeal in mature markets like the UK.\"</p> <p>Clarke, who took over last March, has acknowledged the shifting sands and axed the amount of new space being opened this year by nearly 40%. But the retailer needs to reinvent its biggest stores fast and Bishop's Stortford Extra suggests a way forward. The clothing and homewares department has been shrunk to threequarters of its previous size with the space used to accommodate 1,000 new food lines instead, part of a renewed focus on food that sees rows of fruit and vegetables once again greeting shoppers at the front door.</p> <p>Analysts think the changes introduced in stores this year are starting to make a difference, with the UK chain expected to end an 18-month losing streak with flat like-for-like sales for the second quarter.</p> <p>Oriel analyst Jonathan Pritchard says it will take time to turn round the Tesco supertanker. \"There have been some signs of possible green shoots of recovery here and management's increased focus on the food side at the expense of general merchandise does show a degree of realism. However the road to recovery will be a lengthy one and rolling out the improvements from a handful of stores to the whole chain will not be easy.\"</p> <p>As a footnote to his hand-wringing at Anfield, Clarke adds: \"I predict we'll win again before the end of the season.\" With the market leader rediscovering its form, Tesco might do too.</p>",
  "<p>Todd Akin has issues with women. And so does his Republican party.</p> <p>Akin, of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">\"legitimate rape\" fame</a>, is now complaining that his Democratic opponent, Claire McCaskill, had the nerve to actually campaign against him. McCaskill's decision to run a standard political campaign was <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/27/akin-mccaskill-more-ladylike-in-last-election/\">apparently not properly \"ladylike\"</a>, and Akin is offended at her aggressiveness. No, really; here's the quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think we have a very clear path to victory, and apparently Claire McCaskill thinks we do, too, because she was very aggressive at the debate, which was quite different than it was when she ran against Jim Talent. She had a confidence and was much more ladylike [in 2006], but in the debate on Friday she came out swinging, and I think that's because she feels threatened.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Personally, I think it's a good thing for women to come out swinging, whether they're facing down a \"legitimate rapist\" who thinks he has the right to violate women's bodies, or a misogynist political opponent who thinks he has the right to control women's bodies. And it's some pretty sweet irony to hear the man who says women can't become pregnant from \"legitimate rape\" also suggesting that women shouldn't fight back when they feel threatened because aggressive self-defense is unladylike.</p> <p>Ladies, apparently, should lie back and take it.</p> <p>Akin's problems aren't limited to his own backwards views on women, or even the repeated slip-ups that reveal <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/08/20/todd_akin_s_legitimate_rape_comment_not_a_misstatement_but_a_worldview_.html\">the depth of those views</a>. A look at his past comments and at his voting record shows that Akin fundamentally doesn't trust women, and he definitely doesn't trust rape victims. Akin doesn't just have a far-right anti-abortion voting record; <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/missouri-senate-candidate-praised-right-wing-milit\">he praises rightwing militias with ties to radical anti-abortion action</a>. He opposed the creation of a sex offender registry. (Tracking rapists is too aggressive and unladylike, perhaps?) When voting for legislation that would have finally made it possible to prosecute husbands for raping their wives, Akin supported the bill but worried that the legislation might be used \"in a real messy divorce as a tool and a legal weapon to beat up on the husband\". He co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which changed the definition of rape by specifying that government-sponsored healthcare dollars would only pay for abortion if a pregnancy was caused by \"forcible\" rape, instead of just regular old rape. </p> <p>Akin repeatedly uses terms like \"legitimate rape\" as synonyms for \"forcible rape\". That means, simply, that Akin will accept that you were \"legitimately\" raped if a stranger jumps out of the bushes and assaults you. If you're assaulted by your partner, or an acquaintance, or a sports coach, or a guy at a frat party? Not \"legitimate\".</p> <p>It's easy to write all of this off as a problem with Akin himself. The man clearly does have some misogyny issues. But Akin's antiquated views on rape, abortion and women's rights <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/todd-akin-missouri-women\">aren't his alone</a>; they're standard GOP fare. </p> <p>Even as some members of the Republican party tried to cast Akin's \"legitimate rape\" and abortion comments as personal and fringe, the GOP amended its platform to be stricter on abortion, <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/g-o-p-approves-strict-anti-abortion-language-in-party-platform/\">calling for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion in all cases, including when the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest</a>. A plain reading of the <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_We/\">party plank</a> is also clear that the Republican abortion ideal wouldn't include exceptions even if the pregnant woman was going to die from the pregnancy. Unborn children have a right to life; adult women do not.</p> <p>The attempt to restrict abortion access to women who were \"forcibly\" raped, and not just \"regularly\" raped, was also a GOP-wide phenomenon and not a solo Akin move; <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/08/todd_akin_s_apology_his_comments_on_spousal_rape_and_forcible_rape_show_mistrust_of_women_.html\">more than 160 members of Congress</a> (almost all Republicans) co-sponsored that bill before widespread outrage obliged the withdrawal of the word \"forcible\". And it wasn't Todd Akin who blocked the Violence Against Women Act from passing; it was <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/republicans-violence-against-women-act\">other well-placed members of the GOP who opposed the legislation</a> because it offered protection from violence to immigrant women and LGBT people.</p> <p>All of this \u2013 the belief that some rape victims are more legitimate than others, the hostility toward women who are \"aggressive\" and \"unladylike\", the refusal to protect women from violence if those women are immigrants or lesbians \u2013 reflects the GOP's fundamental view that women are not equal citizens. The entire Republican social platform is structured around the idea of the \"traditional family\", where men are in the public sphere as breadwinners and heads of households, and women stay in private, taking care of children and serving as helpmeets to their husbands. The conservative worldview sees men as naturally in charge, and women as naturally nurturing and supportive of male authority.</p> <p>Unfortunately, for the GOP, it turns out that when you give women a little bit of freedom, they take it \u2013 and women, too, want to be in charge of their own lives. Since that doesn't fit into the social conservative ideal, the GOP is left trying to hamstring women's freedom through sexist legislation. </p> <p>A woman having the right to determine for herself the number and spacing of her children, through access to contraception, sex education and abortion? That doesn't fit the ideal. A woman saying that her body is <em>hers</em>, and that she has the right not to be physically violated through sexual violence or forced pregnancy? That doesn't fit the ideal. A woman running for public office against a man, and not pulling any punches? That doesn't fit the ideal. </p> <p>These aren't a few wayward comments from an unhinged candidate who doesn't know when to shut up. This <em>is</em> the Republican party platform. </p> <p>And despite being initially criticized by his party for voicing a position on abortion and rape that gels almost perfectly with the party's official stance, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-support-todd-akin-legitimate-rape-comment-missouri/story?id=17332911#.UGXUyhhy8tw\">Akin appears to be back in the GOP's good graces</a>. He's officially on the ballot as the Republican candidate, and enjoys the practical and financial support of the national Republican senatorial committee. He's been endorsed by Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Jim DeMint. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich is campaigning with him. The Missouri Republican party issued a statement saying it \"stands behind\" Akin. </p> <p>With GOP support, Akin is faring surprisingly well in the polls. McCaskill is now tasked with showing voters that Akin's views are far outside of the mainstream \u2013 an unladylike endeavor at which I hope she succeeds. It would be awfully nice to see a lady take on an intensely sexist, rightwing Republican and shut that whole thing down.</p>",
  "<p>It turns out that political Siberia, in the Republican party, isn't so far away after all \u2013 and you don't have to stay there all that long. It's more a sort of political Canada.</p> <p>One month after banning Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin from their national convention, Republican leaders are welcoming him back into the fold, his trespasses forgiven, if awkwardly unforgotten. Led by RNC chair Reince Priebus, whose stoical about-face on the issue has been worthy of the royal guard, members of the GOP top brass are gradually stepping forward, one by one, to say that the interests of the nation are now such that it is important to elect Todd Akin to the Senate, all the bad and rather unfortunate things that were said about the man last month notwithstanding.</p> <p>At the time, Republicans were deeply offended at their candidate's \"insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong\" \u2013 in the words of Mitt Romney \u2013 statement that \"legitimate rape\" does not entail a procreation risk because \"the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" At the time, the list of elected GOP officials, strategists and pundits condemning Akin was worthy of the government printing office. At the time, what Akin said plainly made his thinking so unsuitable for the public sphere that basic decency \u2013 all talk of politics aside \u2013 mandated that he withdraw his candidacy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/aug/21/todd-akin-defies-gop-live-blog?INTCMP=SRCH#block-50339a7295cb03723d6abe8f\">Akin lost the support</a> of the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Karl Rove's Super Pac. The leaders of those organizations went on TV to talk about how many millions of dollars they were withdrawing from the Missouri Senate race.</p> <p>But now, with Akin having ignored the drop-dead dropout deadline on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/senate/maps\">with various pollsters seeing improving chances</a> for the Democrats to hold control of the Senate and with the Missouri race still apparently in play, the <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/election-tilts-toward-obama-senate-democrats/\">indignation over Akin's paleolithic gender politics is subsiding</a>.</p> <p>Instead, Republicans are now taking the advice of that wise old head Newt Gingrich, who never appeared to be so troubled by Akin's comments in the first place, who never called on him to step down and who is campaigning with him.</p> <p>\"For the first 48 hours, fine,\" Gingrich <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/328556/some-conservatives-lend-support-akin-dropout-deadline-passes-john-fund\">said Monday of intra-party attacks on Akin</a>. \"Now, it's stupid.\"</p> <p>Without further ado, a first-pass list of the key players, what they said then, and what they say now:</p> <h2>Reince Priebus, chairman, Republican national committee</h2> <p><strong>Then</strong></p> <p>\"You're not always the person that has to be the guy.

  "<p>Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party is increasingly assuming the role of law enforcement officers on the streets of the bankrupt country, with mounting evidence that Athenians are being openly directed by police to seek help from the neo-Nazi group, analysts, activists and lawyers say.</p> <p>In return, a growing number of Greek crime victims have come to see the party, whose symbol bears an uncanny resemblance to the swastika, as a \"protector\".</p> <p>One victim of crime, an eloquent US-trained civil servant, told the Guardian of her family's shock at being referred to the party when her mother recently called the police following an incident involving Albanian immigrants in their downtown apartment block.</p> <p>\"They immediately said if it's an issue with immigrants go to Golden Dawn,\" said the 38-year-old, who fearing for her job and safety, spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"We don't condone Golden Dawn but there is an acute social problem that has come with the breakdown of feeling of security among lower and middle class people in the urban centre,\" she said. \"If the police and official mechanism can't deliver and there is no recourse to justice, then you have to turn to other maverick solutions.\"</p> <p>Other Greeks with similar experiences said the far-rightists, catapulted into parliament on a ticket of tackling \"immigrant scum\" were simply doing the job of a defunct state that had left a growing number feeling overwhelmed by a \"sense of powerlessness\". \"Nature hates vacuums and Golden Dawn is just filling a vacuum that no other party is addressing,\" one woman lamented. \"It gives 'little people' a sense that they can survive, that they are safe in their own homes.\"</p> <p>Far from being tamed, parliamentary legitimacy appears only to have emboldened the extremists. In recent weeks racially-motivated attacks have proliferated. Immigrants have spoken of their fear of roaming the streets at night following a spate of attacks by black-clad men on motorbikes. Street vendors from Africa and Asia have also been targeted.</p> <p>\"For a lot of people in poorer neighbourhoods we are liberators,\" crowed Yiannis Lagos, one of 18 MPs from the stridently patriot \"popular nationalist movement\" to enter the 300-seat house in June. \"The state does nothing,\" he told a TV chat show, adding that Golden Dawn was the only party that was helping Greeks, hit by record levels of poverty and unemployment, on the ground. Through an expansive social outreach programme, which also includes providing services to the elderly in crime-ridden areas, the group regularly distributes food and clothes parcels to the needy.</p> <p>But the hand-outs come at a price: allegiance to Golden Dawn. \"A friend who was being seriously harassed by her husband and was referred to the party by the police very soon found herself giving it clothes and food in return,\" said a Greek teacher, who, citing the worsening environment enveloping the country, again spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"She's a liberal and certainly no racist and is disgusted by what she has had to do.\"</p> <p>The strategy, however, appears to be paying off. On the back of widespread anger over biting austerity measures that have also hit the poorest hardest, the popularity of the far-rightists has grown dramatically with polls indicating a surge in support for the party.</p> <p>One survey last week showed a near doubling in the number of people voicing \"positive opinions\" about Golden Dawn, up from 12% in May to 22%. The popularity of Nikos Michaloliakos, the party's rabble-rousing leader had shot up by 8 points, much more than any other party leader.</p> <p>Paschos Mandravelis, a prominent political analyst, attributed the rise in part to the symbiotic relationship between the police and Golden Dawn. \"Greeks haven't turned extremist overnight. A lot of the party's backing comes from the police, young recruits who are a-political and know nothing about the Nazis or Hitler,\" he said. \"For them, Golden Dawn supporters are their only allies on the frontline when there are clashes between riot police and leftists.\"</p> <p>Riding the wave, the party has taken steps to set up branches among diaspora Greek communities abroad, opening an office in New York last week. Others are expected to open in Australia and Canada. Cadres say they are seeing particular momentum in support from women.</p> <p>With Greeks becoming ever more radicalised, the conservative-led government has also clamped down on illegal immigration, detaining thousands in camps and increasing patrols along the country's land and sea frontier with Turkey.</p> <p>But in an environment of ever increasing hate speech and mounting tensions, the party's heavy-handedness is also causing divisions. A threat by Golden Dawn to conduct raids against vendors attending an annual fair in the town of Arta this weekend has caused uproar.</p> <p>\"They say they have received complaints about immigrant vendors from shop owners here but that is simply untrue,\" said socialist mayor Yiannis Papalexis. \"Extra police have been sent down from Athens and if they come they will be met by leftists who have said they will beat them up with clubs. I worry for the stability of my country.\"</p> <p>Seated in her office beneath the Acropolis, Anna Diamantopoulou, a former EU commissioner, shakes her head in disbelief. Despair, she says, has brought Greece to a dangerous place.</p> <p>\"I never imagined that something like Golden Dawn would happen here, that Greeks could vote for such people,\" she sighed. \"This policy they have of giving food only to the Greeks and blood only to the Greeks. The whole package is terrifying. This is a party based on hate of 'the other'. Now 'the other' is immigrants, but who will 'the other' be tomorrow?\"</p>",
  "<p>Originally released on PC back in 1997, The Last Express was one of the true classic point-and-click adventure titles, plunging gamers into an intriguing tale of death an conspiracy aboard the Orient Express. Set in the final days before the First World War, the game features a unique real-time clock, which gives the player a set period within which to solve the mystery. Meanwhile, the large cast of secondary characters all have their own agendas, moving around the train as the plot progresses.</p> <p>Critically acclaimed at the time, the game has now been scrupulously updated for iPhone and iPad, with original creator<a href=\"http://jordanmechner.com\"> Jordan Mechner</a> overseeing the process alongside French developer, DotEmu. We spoke to Mechner, who also created the hit Prince of Persia series, about the game and the challenge of updating it for a whole new generation.<br></p> <p><strong>Can you tell us how you originally came up with the idea of the Last Express? There seem to be lots of literary elements in it including Agatha Christie of course, but also spy novels and Hitchcock movies...</strong> <br>A man on the run, accused of a crime he didn't commit, stuck on a train with no escape... yes indeed, Last Express owes a huge debt to adventure thrillers like Graham Greene's The Third Man, Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes and North By Northwest, with a bit of The Maltese Falcom, and even Indiana Jones. Basically, if you're going to steal, steal from the best. </p> <p>The higher-brow ingredients, like Rebecca West, Russian fairy tales, and Yeats poetry, got stirred into the soup thanks to my late co-writer Tomi Pierce, who is the best-read person I've ever known.</p> <p>Also, a train is an ideal setting for an adventure game because it's a confined space, but it's moving. You've got to do such-and-such before the train stops in Munich, or you're dead. And this may be heresy, but I personally find Murder on the Orient Express the most boring train movie ever filmed, because the train is stopped dead for two hours. Cinematically, we'd much rather be accused of stealing from Hitchcock than from Christie.</p> <p><strong>The game looked beautiful - I loved the rather stately visual design, which sort of had elements of Toulouse-Lautrec but also Bande dessin\u00e9e comics. And the character animation was done using rotoscoping wasn't it? What do you remember about the process? </strong><br>We wanted to achieve the effect of a pen-and-ink drawing come to life. As a player, I've always felt that the moment you see full-motion video of actors in a game, it kills the illusion of interactivity. It's easier to suspend your disbelief when you're playing a cartoon. </p> <p>And yes, we were inspired by the Art Nouveau style that was popular in the era of our game: Toulouse-Lautrec, Alphonse Mucha... So we rotoscoped it. We did a three-week live-action, blue-screen film shoot in San Francisco, with over sixty actors, a small child and a large dog \u2013 and costumes, makeup and crazy wigs specially designed to be rotoscope-friendly. We also had a separate film shoot with miniature model trains. We shot on 16mm film and spent two years digitally rotoscoping the footage to create over 40,000 inked and coloured frames of animation, using a semi-automated process which we developed in-house and patented. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396876794\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348856913503/express1.jpg\" alt=\"Last Express\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>And all the time, in the background, the game plays out to this beautiful soundtrack. How did that come about? Will it be replicated in the iOS version?</strong><br>The Czech film composer Elia Cmiral (Ronin) gave us a fantastic score. He managed everything, including recording with real string musicians, which was unusual for a game at the time, but important for us because a key character, Anna Wolff, is a violinist and this becomes central to the plot.</p> <p>The complete original soundtrack is retained in the iOS version, including a major setpiece in which passengers gather in one of the train cars for a violin and piano recital that lasts over an hour. As the player, you can take this opportunity to explore other parts of the train, the music continuing while you duck in and out, or, if you prefer, you can stay and watch the characters perform Cesar Franck's A Minor sonata in its entirety.</p> <p>Oh and here's a piece of trivia: If you visit the piano car in the middle of the night and eavesdrop outside the door, the pianist you hear on the recording is actually my Dad, who composed the music for my first games, Karateka and Prince of Persia.</p> <p><strong>How have you updated or altered the game content for the new format? Are there any new features or story elements?</strong><br>The game is complete and identical to the original - including all graphics, sound, and dialog - but we have added some features for iOS. There's a new three-tiered hint system, so that any time you're stuck, you can get a hint; and if you're still stuck, you can get a hint that's somewhat more explicit, and finally one that tells you straight out what to do. </p> <p>Purists and die-hards of the original game may want to resist the temptation, as much of the fun of Last Express is in exploring and discovering alternative paths that don't necessarily lead you closer to winning. But with five to 20 hours of game play, we recognise that many iOS gamers would prefer a more streamlined experience, so we've made the hints available.</p> <p>For iOS, we've also added GameCenter achievements, unlockable character biographies when you meet a new character, and the ability to replay unlocked cinematic sequences \u2013 whether to refresh your memory for clues, or just to replay favorite game moments.</p> <p><strong>How did you re-think the controls for touchscreen devices?</strong><br>We've redesigned the original point-and-click interface for the touchscreen. All the same actions are available to the player as in the original game, but the element of scanning with the mouse pointer to find them has been eliminated. You simply tap the desired action. It took us a bit of experimentation to arrive at such a straightforward solution, but it's very satisfactory. Even if you're used to the PC version like me, it's surprising how quickly you get used to playing this way. I actually prefer it now.</p> <p>Certain other elements, like the inventory screen, have been redesigned to be more iOS-intuitive.</p> <p>One really nice thing is that on the iPhone, the game now plays vertically. In the original PC game, we depicted narrow train corridors and compartments in portrait mode to create a sense of the confined space in these areas of the train. That struck some people as an eccentric decision, since it left two-thirds of the screen black. On iPhone, it's perfect. When you step into a larger room, such as the restaurant car, you can swipe with your finger to scan the room horizontally. On iPad, the game plays horizontally, as on the PC.</p> <p><strong>How challenging has the whole process been? And has it been interesting to rediscover the game again? Has it reminded you of the original development process?</strong><br>This was a big project for DotEmu, certainly bigger than they realized at the start. I think that's the nature of the Last Express beast \u2013 few iOS games have this much content, let alone so many alternative paths and different ways to play. It took a lot of playtesting and extra QA to iron out all the little quirks and details, much as we did 15 years ago. DotEmu did a terrific job, diligent and conscientious. I could only sympathize. </p> <p>Then again, the original Last Express game was supposed to take eighteen months but ended up taking four years. So by that standard, the iOS port was a piece of cake.</p> <p>Personally, it's been a great pleasure for me to replay Last Express after 15 years. Not only was I relieved to find that the original game holds up well, but as an even happier surprise, iOS is now my favorite way to play it. Maybe because the rhythm of TLE is somewhat meditative, more like reading a novel than playing a typical game, it just feels natural playing it on a comfortable couch instead of sitting in front of a computer. Of course, nothing beats playing it on an actual train, or long plane flight, with headphones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396876795\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348856953117/express2.png\" alt=\"Last Express\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>It's interesting that Last Express is returning just as Revolution Software has had such success with Broken Sword on iPhone \u2013 it seems there is a new audience hungry for adventure games. What is the appeal of this genre in the modern era?</strong><br>I hope you're right. Game studios and publishers have operated for three decades on the assumption that their audience will choose a game with better technology, higher resolutions or frame rates, over one with, say, better plot construction. And this assumption has been largely self-fulfilling, at least on console and PC. But there's always been the occasional wild card success like Tetris, and more recently, the huge boom in simple games like Temple Run, that suggests there's a potentially even bigger public out there that doesn't care that much about the bells and whistles \u2013 they just want an experience.</p> <p>I'd love to think this huge mass of iPhone owners is hungry not just for the next quick addictive fix, but also for games that engage them with stories and characters they can care about, an experience that's different from reading a novel or watching a TV show, but potentially just as meaningful. I don't know if that's true, but I hope it is.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us how your remake of Karateka (Mechner's first game \u2013 another classic) is coming along - how different is that process for you?</strong><br>Karateka is nearly finished and is due out later this year. I don't want to take away from the TLE release, so I should save most of what I have to say about Karateka until we're closer to the date \u2013 but one big difference is that whereas TLE is a straight port, Karateka is a ground-up reinvention of the original 1984 Apple II game. And whereas TLE is a complex, multi-layered story, rich with the ironies of 20th-century history, and full of opportunities for meandering, reflection and exploration, Karateka was and is extremely compact and linear. You're in medieval Japan, the evil warlord has kidnapped your true love, and you set out to rescue her by fighting an army of karate warriors. Karateka is a straightforward challenge that anybody, young or old, can pick up immediately, grasp what's going on and start playing and having fun.</p> <p>As different as they are, TLE and the new Karateka are both romantic adventures grounded in a historical time and place \u2013 each with a distinctive atmosphere and visual style, and using sound and music in an innovative way.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever thought of producing a follow-up to Last express? It feels like it could so easily be a series... </strong><br>I love these characters and their world and I've certainly thought of revisiting them. Story-wise, [lead character Robert] Cath being the kind of guy he is, and the 20th century being what it was, there's no doubt he would go on getting into trouble and probably landing on the losing side of more struggles \u2013 during the war, after the war... A certain promise is made at the end of the game; it would be interesting to find out what happens with that. Or a prequel involving Cath and Tyler's younger adventures, like the one that ended so badly in Cuba \u2013 or was it Mexico?</p> <p>The thing is, the original TLE was such a huge, ambitious undertaking \u2013 technically, artistically, logistically \u2013 it would be virtually impossible to fund an adventure game on that scale today. The challenge would be to find a way to do it that is smaller, but still builds on the original game in a way that's new and interesting. It would have to be done with the internet and mobile in mind from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>There was such a beauty to Last Express and Price of Persia - they had such a unique visual style, so graceful and artistic. Do you think games have lost something in their quest for photorealism?</strong><br>Thanks for that. The drive toward photorealism has pushed technological advances that all games can now benefit from. But yes, absolutely, games that strive for photorealism pay a price, both literally, in that they're expensive to make, and artistically, in the constraints that come with this choice. The closer we get to photorealism, the more we notice the ways the scene falls short. The ;uncanny valley' is a terrible place to live, yet so many games choose it.</p> <p>But the future is bright. Looking at most of the big console releases over the past few years has sometimes felt a bit like walking through a 17th and 18th-century painting gallery \u2013 room after room of giant canvases, beautifully rendered and lit, yet taken together, depressingly uniform, dark and oppressive. Great if you like that sort of thing. </p> <p>Then suddenly in the next room there's the Impressionists and this fantastic explosion of color and different styles. I think gamers are increasingly willing to embrace a wider variety of distinctive art styles, and mobile and downloadable games are only accelerating this.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Last Express is available now <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-last-express/id508049561?mt=8\">on the App Store</a> for \u00a32.99</em></p>",
  "<p>We are no longer on speaking terms, however much I wish it were otherwise. But I must never see her again. She was ruining my life, clouding my judgment, dominating too much of my mental space. Without her, every long hour seems to drift without purpose. I navigate the passage of time through distraction, trying to avoid our favourite haunts. Time will heal, or so they say. But time is the enemy right now. And it's only been a few weeks.</p> <p>She felt so much like the girl for me. And, what's more, she was so damn sexy. But my love for her was unrequited. I guess I knew that all along.&#xa0;It was inevitable that this was going to end in tears. And the tears were always going to be mine.</p> <p>Why do I think of cigarettes as female? Perhaps because they so accurately limn&#xa0;the contours of my own (male and heterosexual) desire.</p> <p>We do not rationally choose to smoke. We are seduced by an idea. And then we are hooked. One long kiss \u2013 my first was on the fire escape of the Shaftesbury Theatre, aged 13 \u2013 and then nothing will ever be the same. With her, I will always be breathless. And, if we kept it up, there would come a day when my broken heart would give up under the strain.</p> <p>But for all the deathly reasons to avoid her, I know she will always be there in the back of my mind and waiting for me in the shop around the corner. I won't care what she is wearing: plain&#xa0;packet or fancy. A moment of weakness and the whole sorry dance would begin again.</p> <p><a href=\"http://smokefree.nhs.uk/stoptober/\" title=\"\">Stoptober</a> starts on Monday. It's a government campaign to persuade Britain's 10 million smokers to kick the habit. Some may find it easy.</p> <p>For others, it will be the hardest thing they have ever done. Not just because it's a chemical addiction \u2013 patches really help with that \u2013 but also because smoking is a compelling idea, impregnated with complex half-understood fantasies about sex and excitement and death.</p> <p>Which is why quitting is inevitably a battle fought out in the desert spaces of our imagination. As religious ascetics the&#xa0;world over can testify, renunciation is as much a war within the mind as it is an effort of the will.</p> <p>There is nothing immoral about smoking. And we all have to die of something. My purpose in giving up is to claim back some personal sovereignty, not to let something that has proved so callously indifferent to my welfare rule me and control me. It is a pride thing, I guess. I have sat with lung cancer patients, hooked up to their morphine drips, and still sucking on a fag. That is the desperation of unrequited love. And when presented thus, it looks so much more like self-hatred than a glamorous romantic passion.</p> <p>My own salvation has been through running. Not just because it doubles up&#xa0;the health benefit, but because it stops me thinking. Running closes down the continual chatter of the mind that is taking you back to places that you would rather not revisit. When you&#xa0;run, the demons are starved of their oxygen. That has been my liturgy of renewal. And after two weeks of no fags and lots of running I have lost a stone.</p> <p>Will I ever see her again? Will I suck once more from her dangerous perfume? I cannot say. I gave up smoking the night of the millennium and continued free for many years. I thought I was totally over her, that she had become a distant memory, under control. Then one day, I allowed her to walk back into my life. I mustn't let it happen again.</p> <p>Stoptober is a stupid word. But it is a wonderful idea. Choose life. Be free. Give up.</p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/giles_fraser\" title=\"\">@giles_fraser</a></p>",

No cause was immediately obvious, the deputy police chief at the Tribhuvan international airport, Superintendent Rabiraj Shrestha, said, but hitting a large bird may have been one possibility.</p> <p>Lawyer Ben Ogden, 27, from Buckingham, an Oxford University graduate who worked for the international law firm Allen &amp; Overy, was on the Everest Base Camp trip to celebrate just having qualified. The firm said the young lawyer, who lived in London, \"had an incredibly promising career ahead of him\".</p> <p>Vincent Kelly, 50, and his brother Darren, 45, were also part of the group, who arrived in Nepal on Wednesday and were due to begin a three-week trek in the Khumbu region around Mount Everest on Friday.</p> <p>The group were travelling with the Hampshire-based company Explore Worldwide, which said in a statement it was \"devastated by this news\".</p> <p>All those aboard the twin-propeller Dornier, operated by the domestic airline Sita Air and bound for Lukla, died when it crashed in flames shortly after takeoff. An air accident investigation was launched.</p> <p>The victims included five tourists believed to be from China, four Nepalese passengers, including Explore's local tour guide, and the crew.</p> <p>The Britons, named by local travel company Sherpa Adventures, included Timothy Oakes, 57, a married father and secondary school adviser for Lancashire county council. He loved mountaineering and was on the trip of a lifetime with an old school friend, his distraught wife, Angie Gaunt, said at the family home in Winwick, Cheshire.</p> <p>She added: \"He was going because he always wanted to see Everest. If you love the mountains, it is the ultimate.\"</p> <p>His travelling companion was understood to be Stephen Holding, 60, a retired teacher from the village of Barlaston, Staffordshire, who was also a keen mountaineer, according to Keith Finney, brother of his wife, Maggie.</p> <p>\"My sister just wants to say Stephen had gone out on a trip of a lifetime. He had been planning the trip for 18 months and was with a lifetime friend,\" he said.</p> <p>Another victim, Raymond Eagle, 58, a keen fell runner, from Macclesfield, who lived alone, worked for Cheshire East council as a support worker for disabled people. Neighbour Pauline Girdwood said he was very active and ran every day. \"This was the sort of thing he did. He did go trekking, he was a fell runner and very, very active in outdoor activities.\"</p> <p>Darren Kelly, a property developer and businessman living in the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway, was originally from Bolton but had moved to the village in recent years, where he renovated property for holiday lets. Vice-chairman of a local diving club, he was described by residents as a \"first-class guy\" who was active in the community. The club's treasurer, Chris Harrison said: \"He'll be a great loss to the club but mostly to his wife and family. He was a dynamic and enthusiastic person.\"</p> <p>His brother Vincent, a company director of Lostock, Bolton, was a \"most prolific\" and \"well respected\" supporter of Bolton Lads &amp; Girls Club \u2013 raising funds to replace its Astroturf by cycling from John O'Groats to Land's End \u2013 said the club in a statement. \"There aren't enough words to describe just how wonderful Vincent was \u2013 a dedicated family man with a generous heart of gold who was a perfect role model for all,\" said Mark Brocklehurst, a member of the club's board.</p> <p>The seventh Briton to die was named as Christopher Davey, 51, believed to be from Northampton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396877005\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/28/1348840725210/Nepal-plane-crash-008.png\" alt=\"Nepal plane crash\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map of Nepal plane crash Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eyewitnesses said a fire broke out as the plane made an emergency landing on the bank of the Manohara.

The plane was already on fire, the local people rushed with buckets and tried to put out the flames but it was too hot and people could not get close enough.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, David Cameron, on a visit to Brazil, said: \"It is an absolutely horrific incident and obviously I feel for the families concerned.

  "<p>Fewer than one in five people appearing on Radio 4's Today programme are women \u2013 a proportion that underlines why this month new BBC director general George Entwistle used his first week in the job to call for the station's early morning on-air gender imbalance to change.</p> <p>An average of 18.5% of reporters and guests appearing on Today were female, according to Guardian research, as measured over four weeks in June and July. That is only up marginally from the 16.6% recorded in a similar period in 2011, the first time the gender divide was analysed.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, said the BBC \"had more work to do\". Today insiders say their choice of guests reflects those who hold power in society, but the percentage is lower than the proportion of female judges or MPs.</p> <p>However, there was one piece of good news for Entwistle. This week, in the first full week after his comments, the proportion of female guests and contributors improved modestly \u2013 rising to an average of 24%, suggesting that Today's producers were heeding their leader's remarks.</p> <p>The BBC said improving the representation of women was a \"priority\" for Today and its programme team said it was \"making headway\" on the issue. A spokesman added that \"the figures for last week in particular are encouraging\" but said it was too early to draw any firm conclusions.</p> <p>By contrast, on four out of the 20 days sampled over the summer, men made up more than 90% of the contributors to the programme, according to the research. On one day monitored, 26 June, women accounted for just 4.5% of the guests and reporters featured.</p> <p>The survey did not include Today's presenters \u2013 James Naughtie, Justin Webb, John Humphrys, Evan Davis and its only regular female presenter, Sarah Montague \u2013 unless they featured on the programme in a reporting capacity. But it did cover guests, such as Nick Clegg, and contributors such Robert Peston as listed on the programme's website.</p> <p>Harman, who speaks on media issues for Labour, said: \"George Entwistle said he wanted to hear more women as guests and contributors on the Today programme. These figures show that he, and the BBC, still have a lot of work to do. I will definitely be raising the issue with him and expecting action.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/sep/20/george-entwistle-women-today-programme\" title=\"\">issue of the under-representation of women at the BBC</a> dominated Entwistle's first week in the corporation's top job. The new director general used interviews last week to say he wanted to see more women on air and a female presenter on the Today programme the next time a vacancy came up.</p> <p>Entwistle said that while he personally did not decide which guests appeared on air, or on screen, he believed he could change the culture of the organisation. \"I'll just make it clear to people that's what I think,\" said Entwistle, making it clear he believed an excessive use of men on air was \"just bad editing\". The BBC said that there were some factors outside the Today team's control \u2013 including the gender of reporters on a breaking news story or presenters of Thought for the Day. Excluding these elements, BBC sources claimed the proportion of women on the show was higher, between 25% and a third.</p> <p>A BBC News spokesman said: \"Everyone can agree there should be better gender balance in the media including Today but, like all broadcasters, we have to reflect the world as it is. It's a fact there are fewer women than men at senior levels in business, politics and world affairs. That is bound to be reflected in our output.\"</p> <p>However, in some areas, female representation is higher than on Today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/20/uk-female-judges-ratio-europe\" title=\"\">In England and Wales, 23% of judges are women \u2013 in Scotland it is 21%</a> \u2013 while the proportion of female MPs is 22%. But the number of women on FTSE 100 boards is 16.7%.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Sound Women, the support and lobby group for women in audio, said: \"We want to help the radio industry to better represent women on air. This research shows the female population is simply not being heard despite making up 51% of all radio audiences.\"</p> <p>It is not known when there will be a presenter vacancy on Today.</p> <p>Montague has been its only regular female presenter since Carolyn Quinn left in 2008. She was succeeded by Evan Davis with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/13/bbc-radio\" title=\"\">Justin Webb replacing Ed Stourton a year later</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's collapsing campaign is beginning to hurt Republican chances in key congressional races, risking their hopes of taking the Senate as a bastion against a second-term Barack Obama presidency.</p> <p>More and more Republican congressional candidates are distancing themselves from their party's White House ticket as they are hit by ads from their Democratic opponents linking them to Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan.</p> <p>With Romney still reeling from one bad poll after another in swing states, the Obama campaign opened up a new front on Friday, sending vice-president Joe Biden on a two-day visit to Florida to warn the elderly that a Romney-Ryan victory would mean new taxes on their social security benefits.</p> <p>Biden, in excerpts from his speech released in advance, said: \"Right now, the majority of seniors don't have to pay taxes on their social security benefits \u2026 But if governor Romney's tax plan goes into effect, it could mean everyone, everyone, would have to pay more taxes on the social security benefits they now receive.\"</p> <p>Creating fear among the elderly is a potent message not only in Florida, a state with a high proportion of retirees, but in other swing states. A new poll, by the Washington Post and the health group the Kaiser Foundation, by Ryan to reform Medicare, the healthcare programme for those 65 and over, has alienated potential Republican voters..</p> <p>The poll found that in three battlegrounds \u2013 Florida, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 the changes to Medicare proposed by Ryan have tilted the elderly towards Obama. The issue ranked with them as high as the state of the economy.</p> <p>Sixty-five percent of those polled in Florida want to keep Medicare as it is. In Ohio, Obama held a 19% advantage over Romney among voters asked who they trusted most with the health programme, 15% in Florida and 13% in Virginia.</p> <p>Romney's lacklustre campaign, compounded by the threat to social security and Medicare coming on top of last week's secret video of a Romney speech, appears to be pulling down Republicans in congressional races. Candidates can usually count on receiving a boost in their districts and states from a successful presidential campaign. </p> <p>Stu Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/romneys-drop-weakens-gop-effort-to-take-senate/article/2508803#.UGXcBbunv38\">told the Washington Examiner</a>: \"Republicans still have a chance, but it's not what it was six months ago or a year ago. And if you had to weigh the two parties' chances, you would have to say the Democrats have a better chance of holding the Senate.\" </p> <p>The Republicans hold the House and had high hopes of adding the Senate too. With control of Congress, they would be able to throw up a formidable barrier to Obama implementing new domestic policies.</p> <p>The Democrats hold only a four-seat majority in the Senate and had looked vulnerable. But the disarray in the Romney campaign has thrown those hopes into doubt. The Democrats are threatening to win seats the Republicans had been expected to win easily, such as Virginia. The Democratic candidate in Virginia, Tim Kaine, is up 3% on his Republican opponent, George Allen.</p> <p>The one remaining opportunity for Romney to turn the presidential campaign round is the first presidential debate on Wednesday in Denver, Colorado. Tens of millions are expected to tune in for the first opportunity to see Obama and Romney one-to-one in a debate in which issues such as tax, health care and the secret video of Romney disparaging 47% of the population as freeloaders are all likely to figure. </p> <p>Debates usually end in draws that are quickly forgotten, as in 2008, but they can make a difference, as in the classic one between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 and more recently George W Bush and Al Gore in 2000, in which Gore annoyed lots of voters by rolling his eyes while Bush was speaking.</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns on Friday talked up expectations for their opponents while downplaying their own candidate's chances. The Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod predicted Mitt Romney would be a \"prepared, disciplined and aggressive debater\". </p> <p>Fears that the White House may be beyond the Republican party this year has already seen fighting start among conservative commentators. </p> <p>The conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer, rounded on Romney, saying he had \"fumbled\" the opportunity offered by the Middle East crisis. </p> <p>He argued that it is not too late for Romney. \"Make the case. Go large. About a foreign policy in ruins. About an archaic, 20th century welfare state model that guarantees 21st century insolvency. And about an alternate vision of an unapologetically assertive America abroad unafraid of fundamental structural change at home. It might just work. And it's not too late,\" Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post.</p> <p>Jennifer Duffy, who covers the Senate races for the independent Cook Political Report, which had leaned a year ago to the Republicans taking the Senate, now argues that the range of possible outcomes goes from the Republicans picking up two or three seats \u2013 not enough for a majority \u2013 to actually losing a seat or two.</p> <p>Charlie Cook, <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/cook-report/the-cook-report-shades-of-1996-20120927\">writing in the National Journal</a>, said that if Romney does not pick up in the polls in the next week to 10 days, he faces \"the very real prospect that Republican donors, Super Pacs and other parts of the GOP support structure will begin to shift resources away from helping him and toward a last-ditch effort to win a Senate majority \u2013 which once seemed very likely \u2013 and to protect the party's House majority.\"</p>",
  "<p>By any measure it is a stunning reversal. Three years ago Somalia's central \"government\" controlled little more than a square mile of the capital, Mogadishu, while Islamist militants began to impose strict sharia law on most of the country.</p> <p>Today it is al-Shabaab that has not only been driven out of the capital but looks set to relinquish its last major urban stronghold, the port city of Kismayo.</p> <p>The dramatic turnaround has been achieved by a display of purpose and co-ordination from the African Union, a body long criticised as lumbering and divided. Its 17,000-strong peacekeeping force, Amisom, led by troops from Uganda, Kenya and Burundi, have turned the tide against the extremists.</p> <p>Behind the scenes is another quietly satisfied winner: the United States. Al-Shabaab is a self-declared affiliate of al-Qaida and therefore seen as fair game in the so-called war on terror. The US has carried out air strikes against suspected members and <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/somaliaNews/idAFL5E8G12Z320120501\" title=\"\">provided training and equipment to Amisom</a>. With memories of \"Black Hawk Down\" in 1993 still raw, it has arguably achieved more than in Afghanistan, without putting a boot on the ground.</p> <p>The loss of Kismayo would be a potentially terminal blow to al-Shabaab, depriving it of a key source of revenue from charcoal exports and taxes on local traders. In the meantime, Somalia has gained a new president and government, thousands of expatriates are heading home and the country has its best chance of peace for 20 years.</p> <p>However, cries of mission accomplished would be absurdly premature. First, the Kenyan \"liberators\" will not necessarily be greeted with sweets and flowers. Their naval bombardment of the port city has reportedly killed civilians, including two teenage boys and a pregnant woman, and caused thousands to flee. This week a Kenyan soldier allegedly went renegade and shot dead six civilians.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab has reportedly been distributing weapons and may count on local sympathy if it clings on, seeking to test Kenyan soldiers' stomach for battle in prolonged urban warfare. As in Mogadishu, expect more roadside and suicide bombings as the group seeks to score propaganda coups.</p> <p>It could also melt into hideouts in mountains, towns and villages in the southern countryside, while some members may seek to push across the border into Kenya.</p> <p>In July 2010, al-Shabaab carried out suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, as revenge for its involvement in Amisom. And with Kenyan troops fighting on the beaches of Kismayo, the next target for retribution could be Nairobi.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest threat is the vacuum al-Shabaab will leave behind. While Somalia's president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, has more legitimacy than his predecessors, the clan factionalism that has long tormented Somalia for so long has not gone away.</p> <p>The Kenyan army has been supported by Ras Kamboni, a local militia likely to expect a slice of Kismayo's lucrative cake. Neighbouring Ethiopia and Kenya may also agitate through proxy militias.</p> <p>\"The big danger is Ogaden retaliation against Marehan people,\" says one regional analyst, who does not wish to be named. \"Both are Darod sub-clans but the Marehan [in effect] sided with al-Shabaab's leadership to help oust the warlord Sheikh Ahmed Madobe, leader of Ras Kamboni, from Kismayo. His support is among Ogaden who might feel it is their turn to control the city and want revenge. So there is a lot of potential for inter-clan clashes and also still concern about the conduct of the Kenyan forces following last week's execution of six people.\"</p> <p>It would be churlish to deny Somalia's remarkable progress in the past year.

Nonetheless, US government lawyers regard this as tacit approval, because Pakistan responds by what is called \"de-conflicting\" its airspace \u2013 preventing aircraft from flying in the areas concerned.</p> <p>A government spokesman rejected the insinuation made in the report and reiterated Pakistan's position on drone attacks: \"Drone attacks are illegal, counterproductive, in contravention of international law and a violation of Pakistani sovereignty.\"</p> <p>Diplomats and security analysts believe Pakistan continues to give its consent for the drone strikes.</p> <p>Confidential diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks revealed that, in 2008, Pakistan's army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, asked the US for \"continuous Predator [drone] coverage\" in part of South Waziristan.</p> <p>In the same year, former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told the US ambassador that he did not care about the US programme \"as long as they get the right people\".</p> <p>Despite the history of co-operation with the US, drones are very unpopular in Pakistan where politicians, particularly the former cricketer Imran Khan, have gained support by lambasting what many see as the routine violation of Pakistani sovereignty.</p> <p>Underlining the government's delicate balancing act on the issue, the foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, said on Thursday that Pakistan supported the aims of the programme.</p> <p>\"What the drones are trying to achieve, we may not disagree\u2026 If they're going for terrorists \u2013 we do not disagree,\" she said in New York. \"But we have to find ways which are lawful, which are legal.

  "<p>This moving, 75-minute play by <a href=\"http://www.front-step.co.uk/\" title=\"\">David Greig</a> tells the true story of <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Korczak.html\" title=\"\">Janusz Korczak</a> who, in the second world war, created an orphanage for more than 200 children inside the Warsaw ghetto. Dr Korczak's emphasis on children's rights and responsibilities also clearly spoke to the young audience with whom I saw the show; they watched and listened raptly.</p> <p>What is good about Greig's play is that it suggests that, even in the ghetto in 1942, there was an element of moral choice. Dr Korczak creates a home for bereft children and instils in them a belief in tolerance and justice, allowing them to pass judgment on anyone who breaks the house rules. \"I've trained them for a perfect world,\" he says. \"How will they survive this one?\" Sadly, we learn the answer as we hear of them being marched towards the trains that will take them to Treblinka. But Greig shrewdly poses an alternative by focusing on a mutinous new arrival who, with a friendly girl, hides from the invading German troops and absconds to take his part in the Warsaw uprising.</p> <p>I wish Greig had told us a bit more about the saintly Dr Korczak's background, and Ria Parry's production begins a bit over-reverently with the unpacking of manikins, symbolising the orphans, from cardboard boxes. But the play is acted with calm assurance by Ben Caplan, Ginny Holder, Sam Swann and Kae Alexander. It informs intelligently, and ends with a powerful assertion of the children's rights that are enshrined, thanks to Dr Korczak's example, <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm\" title=\"\">in the UN charter</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Ecuador is prepared to set up an operating theatre in its London embassy if Julian Assange needs urgent medical attention and the UK is not prepared to guarantee his safe passage to a hospital and back, according to the Ecuadorean foreign minister.</p> <p>As the WikiLeaks founder spent his 100th day in the Ecuadorean embassy, where he has sought refuge from extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual crimes, the country's foreign minister met his British counterpart, William Hague, to ask about contingency plans should Assange fall ill.</p> <p>Hague told Ricardo Patino that he would consult officials and lawyers and respond within a few days, but a British official commented: \"Maybe the Ecuadoreans should have thought of that before they granted him asylum.\" The official added that British police were under obligation to arrest Assange as soon as he stepped out of the embassy.</p> <p>\"One thing we have proposed is to have an ambulance parked outside,\" Patino told the Guardian in an interview in New York. \"What we have said, if such a case should happen, we should be ready to install an operating theatre inside the premises, unless Mr Hague responds, as he promised in the next few days, that he [Assange] would be able to go to a hospital.\"</p> <p>The Ecuadorean foreign minister said that the Australian government had offered to help organise Assange's healthcare during an indefinite stay in an embassy apartment, given the diplomatic impasse over his fate. Ecuador offered him asylum last month, saying he faced political persecution in the US, but the UK insists it has a legal duty to arrest him and extradite him to Sweden to face questioning. Australian officials have not confirmed Patino's claim that Canberra had offered medical help.</p> <p>When Assange addressed diplomats at the UN general assembly this week, via a satellite link from the London embassy, he appeared pale, with dark rings under his eyes. His voice was hoarse and his sniffed frequently.</p> <p>Patino said he was not aware of any immediate health concerns for Assange but added: \"We know that anyone who lives in these conditions of confinement may easily suffer from health issues, not only physical but also psychological. Imagine you have to stay in a room for three months. Imagine if you are going to be five years in this confinement.\"</p> <p>In November 2010, a Swedish court ordered Assange be detained for questioning after allegations by two women that what had started as consensual sex had turned non-consensual.</p> <p>This week, Amnesty International called on Sweden to provide a guarantee that if Assange travelled there to answer questions over the sex-crime allegations, he would not be sent on to the US for charges connected to WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of US diplomatic and military cables.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Swedish foreign ministry said the country's legislation did not allow any judicial decision like extradition to be predetermined. The UK, which would also have to permit an extradition to the US, has given the same response but Hague stressed to Patino at their New York meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights sets strict limits on such extraditions, forbidding them, for example, if the charges in question carry the death penalty.</p> <p>\"The foreign secretary described the extensive human-rights safeguards in UK extradition law. He requested the government of Ecuador to study these provisions closely in considering the way ahead,\" a foreign office spokesman said.</p> <p>Officials said that the treatment of the alleged source of the WikiLeaks US cables, Bradley Manning \u2013 an American soldier whose lawyers say was subject to brutal and humiliating treatment and who has so far spent more than two years in jail without trial \u2013 would be taken into account if and when any future extradition decision was made.</p> <p>However, Patino said that it was too late for such assurances, since Ecuador's decision to offer asylum was irrevocable.</p> <p>\"When we hadn't yet granted asylum, we could talk about guarantees,\" the foreign minister said. \"Now that we have granted asylum we are under the obligation not to surrender Mr Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>So the white, rural gun-toting conspiracy theorists were right.<br> Put a secret Muslim president in the White House and next thing you know America's in bed with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>Except, according to Tehran's Fars news agency, it is white rural Americans who are big fans of the Iranian president.

An entire generation of young people are waking up to the truths of the world \u2013&#xa0;many of which their parents, and the older generations, refuse to see or accept, despite overwhelming evidence. Based on this new information, we see that most of the world's problems are solveable. Most of the suffering is simply a byproduct of the greed and nepotism built into virtually all models of human control. Just like in 1776, this generation is prepared to cast of the ties that bind us to a sinking ship of necrotic culture that refuses to change. </p> <h2>'We are masters of our own fate' \u2013 Bonnie Wiley, Columbus, Ohio</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870403\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/17/1305645879944/blueavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"blueavatar\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">blueavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one thing consistent about America over many other places is options. Nobody tells us where to live, what occupation to seek, what religion to believe (or not believe). Regardless of what the naysayers are now saying, we are still for the most part masters of our own fate. As you can see by the state of the economy, sometimes things don't work out. The Rolling Stones figured it out years ago: you can't always get what you want. With a little ingenuity and a willingness to improvise, adapt, and overcome, we can get what we need.</p> <h2>'A new system can replace the old' \u2013 @Eric_Bowen, North Carolina</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870404\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/30/1262172414554/avatar-purple-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar purple\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">avatar comment blue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A new economy is helping build the American dream from scratch. Patient-provider co-ops, food co-ops, locally-oriented (sometimes innovative and web-based) businesses are all part of a new system that can replace the old. Fixes to government and its intimacy with big business will remain difficult, but another crisis (like the eurozone crash) could force change.</p> <p>As more and more people join and start local co-ops, they are building a new world in the shell of the old. But two things could dramatically speed up this process: first, ending red-tape governance that strangles innovative new business structures and traditional small businesses; and second, striking down laws that help fuel speculation on Wall Street and increasingly cozy relationships between government and big business.</p> <h2>'It's still a land of great opportunity' \u2013 Subodh Jain Davis, California</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870405\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/30/1262172344336/avatar-environment-green-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar environment green\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">avatar environment green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We need leaders, media moguls and local politicians who can boldly and honestly tell us about the limits on natural resources, be realistic on economic growth, and admit the failures in education and workplace organizations.

  "<p>The way in which humans engage with, and respond to, the environment has undergone some significant developments in the last century. Major transformations in rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have continued to reinforce a sense of separation between society and nature, human and non-human worlds. It is arguably this sense of separation that has enabled society to capitalise on the fruits of science, industry and global economics. Conversely, it is also what underwrites the parallel dysfunction and destruction of our social and ecological systems.</p> <p>The world's ecological, social and economic crises are as much a crisis of spirit as a crisis of resources. Part of the crisis of spirit is because modern society and industry tends to perceive the Earth as a set of resources, and then values it as such. What scope is there for this paradigm to change in order to perceive the Earth as an animate, living system in which humans play a constructive, not destructive, part?</p> <p>In 2010 <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/\" title=\"\">The Royal Society of Arts</a> coined its new strapline: a 21st century enlightenment. Matthew Taylor, the society's director, proposes that the core ideals, values and norms that the initial Enlightenment enabled may no longer be adequate or fit for purpose for the challenges society faces. In order to live differently, he argues, we must think differently, and this relates to the way that we see ourselves in the world.</p> <p>Just as our need to transform business is now becoming apparent, so is our need to transform our engagement with, and response to, nature. Understanding our relationship with nature can help business to transform, and the patterns and principles of nature can provide insight into how best to future-proof companies for an unpredictable future.</p> <p>All organisations operate within a community \u2013 an environment of interconnections \u2013 as do the people within organisations. The age-old adage \"No man is an island\" is the same for an organisation. In fact, just like an ecosystem in nature, the more diverse the relationships and resources an organisation makes use of, the more resilient it becomes.</p> <p>In building a bridge between nature and business, we start to re-ignite our vital bond with nature.</p> <p><strong>What do organisations of the future look like?</strong></p> <p>Collaborative, innovative, networking, emergent, dynamic organisations more akin to living organisms. There are a plethora of nature's insights that can be applied to business \u2013 all that is lacking is the ability to convert these insights into a business frame. For example:</p> <p>\u2022 Mycelium networks provide insight for a responsive and adaptive organisation.</p> <p>\u2022 Nature (and business) is emergent and interconnected, not predictable and linear.</p> <p>\u2022 Nature does not do waste; waste of one is food for another.</p> <p>\u2022 Natural ecosystems develop niches where every aspect of the material throughput is used.</p> <p>A business inspired by nature is one that is resilient, optimising, adaptive, systems-based, values-led, and life supporting \u2013 these are \"nature's business principles\".</p> <p>These principles do not seek to reduce organisational behaviour to biology; rather, they suggest a set of behaviours and qualities that simply echo the law of the system \u2013 Earth \u2013 upon which our lives and our businesses depend. They recognise the complexity of human nature and nurture, and are neither a model nor a theory, but rather a philosophy that reminds us that, while humans are a special species on Earth, we are still part of nature and subject to its law. If we do not conduct our business within the constraints of the system, we will inevitably go out of business. The circular economy, industrial ecology, cradle-to-cradle, the learning organisation and bio-mimicry all share a common foundation: they take inspiration from nature.</p> <p>What is desperately lacking in today's framing of sustainable business, and for that matter wider business transformation, is a language and engagement approach for business people to unlock nature's wisdom and, in so doing, re-enchant ourselves with nature \u2013 re-establishing our vital bond with our environment.</p> <p>By framing experiences people have with nature and giving examples of business inspired by nature, we can reconnect business and nature. To do this, skills and expertise from multi-disciplines are needed: biology, eco-psychology and business change, for instance. This fusion of skillsets, with the right vision and mission, can help equip local, national and global business people with the wherewithal they need to adapt, innovate, embrace change and engage in meaningful business transformation towards a sustainable future.</p> <p><em>Giles Hutchin's new book 'The Nature of Business' can be purchased </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Nature-Business-Redesigning-Resilience/dp/0857840487\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em> <em>He has more than 15 years of business transformation experience and is embarking on a BBC/Open University documentary of the same title and subject as the book.

There's a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/28/best-android-apps-fieldtrip-zeebox\">separate post for them</a>, while Windows Phone gets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/04/best-windows-phone-apps-crackle-times\">its own monthly roundup</a>. Read on for this week's iOS selection.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/a-clockwork-orange/id562227691?mt=8\">A Clockwork Orange</a></h2> <p>Publisher Random House has given Anthony Burgess' famous novel the full works for its iPad edition, with the original text, a full reading, audio clips of Burgess himself, essays and notes, the 1961 typescript, and experts analysing what it all means in videos. Plus a nifty cog-like interface to find your way around it all.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/camera+-for-ipad/id550902799?mt=8\">Camera+ for iPad</a></h2> <p>Camera+ remains a hugely popular photography app on iPhone, offering features above and beyond the native camera app's. 9m sales later, it has spawned an iPad version. Who takes photos with their iPad? Well, some people, but the real appeal here is the use of iCloud to access photos shot using the iPhone version, with a range of editing features exclusive to the iPad version. In other words, it's looking to eat iPhoto's lunch too.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nigellissima/id556890983?mt=8\">Nigellissima</a></h2> <p>Nigella Lawson is back with another TV show and spin-off book. But this being 2012, there's also an app. Described as a \"taster\", it includes nine of the book's Italian-inspired recipes, as well as behind-the-scenes video and information on key ingredients. Oh, and Lawson's Twitter, Facebook and \"Kitchen Witter\" in the social feeds section.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fancy-nancy-ballet-school/id553383738?mt=8\">Fancy Nancy Ballet School</a></h2> <p>Fancy Nancy is the star of a popular series of HarperCollins children's books, and has already appeared in a couple of apps. This new one is less a story, and more an educational ballet app. Children can watch Nancy perform 11 moves and steps, string them together into whatever sequence they like, and then practise themselves. A video feature also allows them (or a parent) to shoot footage of their dancing, then have Nancy digitally inserted into the video.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeebox.com\">Zeebox</a></h2> <p>Zeebox isn't new for Brits, but it's just launched in the US, with the second-screen startup partnering with broadcasting big-hitters NBCUniversal and HBO, as well as cable provider Comcast. As in the UK, the app provides a souped-up TV guide, pulls in tweets about individual shows, and provides contextual links and information while you're watching them.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/espncricinfo-cricket-scores/id562352871?mt=8\">ESPNcricinfo</a></h2> <p>There was already an iPhone app for ESPN's cricket website, but now it's been upsized for iPad too. Expect global coverage of cricket leagues and tournaments, with news, fixtures, results, audio and video content, and ball-by-ball commentary for key matches. US cricket fans (yes, there are some) can also get video highlights of the ICC World Twenty20 tournament.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/insight-guides-world-cities/id547625883?mt=8\">Insight Guides World Cities</a></h2> <p>iOS travel-guide apps? It's a crowded market, but the new Insight Guides World Cities app is hoping to punch its weight against the guide-book giants. It's a free download, with 10 city guides available to buy in-app at \u00a33.99 a pop. They include listings of businesses, hotels and tourist hotspots, as well as a talking phrasebook and offline maps.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kapu-tickle-toy-camera/id556527511?mt=8\">Kapu Tickle Toy Camera</a></h2> <p>If you're a parent, would you let your child loose with your iPhone or iPad's camera? What if it had dangly virtual monsters? That's the idea behind Kapu Tickle Toy Camera, a really inventive children's app that gets them playing with virtual characters, while taking snaps of them in the real world. As a child-friendly introduction to photography, it takes some beating.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/madefire/id533379666?mt=8\">Madefire</a></h2> <p>Madefire has been available on iPad for a while, but its new version is now on iPhone and iPod touch too. The idea: rather than offer digital replicas of old print comics, it commissions new ones from a host of famous artists, adding music, sound effects, motion and panoramic views to capitalise on their \"digital-first\" nature. Whizzy comics, basically, but in a good way.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nmhmc-harvey/id555722456?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">NMHMC Harvey</a></h2> <p>Albert Einstein's brain, sliced up and splashed all over your iPad screen. Now that's a marketing slogan. This, of course, is a serious app, based on the autopsy of Einstein's brain in 1955, when it was segmented into 170 parts for study by neuroscientists. That's now been digitised, so experts (and, okay, some curious amateurs) can continue to peer at Albert's spongey matter.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disney-second-screen-personalized/id561183538?mt=8\">Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You</a></h2> <p>Or, to give it its full name: Disney Second Screen Personalized Digital Storybook: Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You. This is another second-screen app for TV viewers, but unlike Zeebox it's laser-focused on one thing: Disney's Blu-ray re-release of its classic film Cinderella. Expect \"a whole new way to experience the classic story\" (which means resisting the urge to check your tweets every five minutes). US-only for now.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streamweaver/id550620975?mt=8\">Streamweaver</a></h2> <p>Frustratingly, this is also US-only, at least for now. It's a \"multi-angle mobile video app that's social from the moment you tap record\" according to the developers, who have also coined their own \"split-screen synchronicity\" phrase for it. The basic idea being shoot video in the same place with some friends, then see the different angles played back together. Us Brits will have to content ourselves with <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vyclone/id521680614?mt=8\">Vyclone</a>, which is similar in ambition, but also edits the clips into a single video.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crayola-digitools-3-d/id562292766?mt=8\">Crayola DigiTools 3-D</a></h2> <p>Crayola may be best known for its crayons, but it makes apps too \u2013&#xa0;a succession over the last year exploring digital colouring and drawing. This latest is one of a set of three (Airbrush and Effects are the other two).

  "<p>Sieges crippling Syria's two leading cities intensified on Friday, as opposition forces mounted their most concerted push to take control of Aleppo and loyalist troops conducted a huge security sweep through anti-regime strongholds in Damascus.</p> <p>Fighting in Aleppo is reportedly heavier than at any point since rebel groups attacked the city on 19 July, with rebel leaders claiming they are nearing a \"do-or-die\" moment in their bid to claim the city.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Bashir al-Haji, commander of Tawheed brigade in Aleppo, said: \"The decisive battle for Aleppo started at 4pm local time [on Thursday]. We wanted to surprise the Syrian army, which had started to creep forward towards the southern neighbourhoods.\"</p> <p>For the first time, fighting is reported to have reached several Kurdish areas in Aleppo, where supporters of the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK), who are considered aligned to the regime, are thought to be.</p> <p>Several other fronts have also been opened in the ancient city, where fighting over much of the past eight weeks has become a grinding stalemate, with neither side able to move forward.</p> <p>Parts of north Aleppo and restive areas along an unofficial demarcation line in the centre, which separates rebel forces in the east from regime troops in the west, also saw fighting on Friday.</p> <p>A building in the Syrian town of Azaz, only kilometres from the Bab al-Salam border crossing into the Turkish town of Killis, was bombed by a jet shortly before noon. There was no immediate word on casualties. Fighter jets have wreaked destruction on a daily basis in and around Aleppo, forcing rebel groups to frequently move command centres and disrupting their supply lines.</p> <p>Ahead of the latest assault on Aleppo, the rebel leadership had tried to overcome frequent criticisms that it lacks co-ordination or even relevance on the battlefield by moving key commanders from the Turkish border to frontline areas in Syria.</p> <p>The move did not meet a warm welcome from battle-weary commanders and fighters, who had displayed open resentment to senior defectors who had stayed in Turkey, rather than joining the fray.</p> <p>Throughout the past year, as the popular uprising against the Assad regime morphed into unrestrained insurrection, the Free Syria Army has functioned more as a brand than a cohesive fighting force.</p> <p>Rebel units seek funding and weapons from different sources and do not answer to a high command. Operations are often carried out unilaterally and decisive large-scale pushes have been rare.</p> <p>The lack of co-ordination has been most evident in Damascus, where rebel groups have been on the back foot confronted by a relentless regime counterattack for the past month. Regime troops swept though the suburb of Barzeh on Friday, raiding homes and arresting suspects.</p> <p>There have been similar assaults in recent days in the Douma and Thiyabiya areas, where activists have reported scores of summary executions.</p> <p>Damascus, home to the military establishment and key leaders of the regime, was rocked by a suicide bombing that hit an army headquarters on Wednesday. CCTV footage released by the regime showed a car blowing up while it was being driven past the building.</p> <p>The attack was claimed both by the Free Syria Army and a jihadist group. Rebel leaders in the capital later acknowledged that the strike had been a \"collaborative\" effort.</p> <p>Despite the regime offensive, many businesses remain shut in Damascus and commercial life has ground to a halt in many districts.</p> <p>The United Nations has said that it expects close to 700,000 refugees to have fled Syria and registered with it by the end of the year.</p> <p>The overall figure is likely to be at least tens of thousands higher with many of those who have so far escaped to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq not registering with international organisations.</p> <p>Eastern Aleppo has largely emptied of residents. Turkish authorities say they are now dealing with up to 2,000 refugees every day.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Gilles-Eric S\u00e9ralini, professor of molecular biology at Caen university in France, knows how to inflame the GM industry and its friends. For seven years he and his team have questioned the safety standards applied to varieties of GM maize and tried to re-analyse industry-funded studies presented to governments.</p> <p>The GM industry has traditionally reacted furiously and personally. S\u00e9ralini has been widely insulted and smeared and last year, in some desperation, he sued Marc Fellous, president of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology, for defamation, <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2011/01/19/greenpeace-financed-scientist\" title=\"\">and won</a> (although he was only awarded a nominal \u20ac1 in damages).</p> <p>But last week, Seralini brought the whole scientific and corporate establishment crashing down on his head. In a peer-reviewed US journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691512005637\" title=\"\">he reported the results of a \u20ac3.2m study.</a> Fed a diet of Monsanto's Roundup-tolerant GM maize NK603 for two years, or exposed to Roundup over the same period, rats developed higher levels of cancers and died earlier than controls. S\u00e9ralini suggested that the results could be explained by the endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, and overexpression of the transgene in the GMO.</p> <p>This was scientific dynamite. It was the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/rat-study-sparks-gm-furore-1.11471\" title=\"\">first time that maize containing these specific genes had been tested on rats over two years</a> - nearly their full lifespan - as opposed to the 90-day trials demanded by regulators. Around a dozen long-term studies of different GM crops have <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691511006399?via=ihub\" title=\"\">failed to find similar effects</a>. S\u00e9ralini's study also looked at the toxicity of the Roundup herbicide when fed directly to rats.</p> <p>If the study stood up, then the consistent arguments of the industry that its GM maize is safe might be fatally undermined, with immense political, financial and social consequences.</p> <p>But barely had the paper surfaced than it was attracting <a href=\"http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/pages/press_releases/12-09-19_gm_maize_rats_tumours.htm\" title=\"\">heavyweight academic criticism</a>.</p> <p>Commentators variously claimed the study to be \"biased\", \"poorly performed\", \"bogus\", \"fraudulent\", \"sub-standard\", \"sloppy agenda-based science\", \"inadequate\" and \"unsatisfactory\". S\u00e9ralini was said to have \"sought harm\" for the rats, the experiment was dismissed as \"inhumane\" and the research group was called \"partisan\". France was outed as \"the most anti-science country in anti-science Europe\" and vociferous GM supporters such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mark_lynas/status/250151291022626817\" title=\"\">Mark Lynas urged people to sign a petition</a> demanding full disclosure of the data (only a few hundred have).</p> <p>Meanwhile, GM opponents were said to be the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/09/are_gmo_foods_safe_opponents_are_skewing_the_science_to_scare_people_.html\" title=\"\">\"climate skeptics of the left\"</a>, S\u00e9ralini and his scientists were labelled \"crafty activists\" and \"anti-science\" and the group that funded the study was accused of \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Revkin/status/250928774227578881\" title=\"\">polluting science communication</a>\" by asking for an embargo on the paper.</p> <p>S\u00e9ralini and the other authors of the study responded that they were <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/rat-study-sparks-gm-furore-1.11471\" title=\"\">surprised at the \"violence\" of their critics</a>.</p> <p>But it was a triumph for the scientific and corporate establishment which has used similar tactics to crush other scientists like Arpad Pusztai of the Rowett Institute in Scotland, who was sacked after his research suggested GM potatoes damaged the stomach lining and immune system of rats, and David Quist and Ignacio Chapela, who studied the flow of genes from illegally planted GM maize to Mexican wild maize. But now that the dust is settling, let's look at some of the criticisms and Seralini's responses.</p> <p>\"This is not an innocent scientific publication. The study was designed to produce exactly what was observed,\" said Dr <a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.org/latest-listing/1-news-items/5077-2-journals-to-review-editorial-policies\" title=\"\">Bruce Chassy</a>, professor emeritus of food science at the University of Illinois, who has worked as a consultant for GM companies and has been a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Food Advisory Council which is fully behind GM.</p> <p>\"This study appears to be without scientific merit,\" said Martina Newell-McGloughlin, director of the <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/static/live/news/projects/biotech/c3_1.html\" title=\"\">International Biotechnology Program at the University of California/Davis</a>, which has close links to Monsanto and other GM companies.</p> <p>\"Although this paper has been published in a peer\u2013reviewed journal with an [Impact Factor] of about 3, there are anomalies throughout the paper that normally should have been corrected or resolved through the peer-review process,\" said Maurice Moloney, InsChief Executive of Rothamsted Research.</p> <p>\"The control group is inadequate to make any deduction,\" said Anthony Trewavas, prominent champion of GM food and a former member of the governing council of Britain's leading plant biotech research organisation, the John Innes Centre.</p> <p>\"We have to ask whether a diet with this level of maize is normal for rats. Another control with an alternative diet should have been included,\" said Dr Wendy Harwood, senior scientist at the John Innes Centre.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/products/Documents/ProductSafety/seralini-sept-2012-monsanto-comments.pdf\" title=\"\">Monsanto was dismissive:</a> \"This study does not meet minimum acceptable standards for this type of scientific research, the findings are not supported by the data presented, and the conclusions are not relevant for the purpose of safety assessment.\"</p> <p>Here are the criticisms in a nutshell and <a href=\"http://www.gmwatch.org/latest-listing/51-2012/14217-scientists-response-to-critics-of-seralinis-study\" title=\"\">S\u00e9ralini's responses</a>:</p> <p>1. The French researchers were accused of using the Sprague Dawley rat strain which is said to be prone to developing cancers. In response S\u00e9ralini and his team say these are the <a href=\"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278691504000547\" title=\"\">same rats as used by Monsanto in the 90-day trials</a> which it used to get authorisation for its maize. This strain of rat has been used in most animal feeding trials to evaluate the safety of GM foods, and their results have long been used by the biotech industry to secure approval to market GM products.</p> <p>2. The sample size of rats was said to be too small. S\u00e9ralini responded that six is the OECD recommended protocol for GM food safety toxicology studies and he had based his study on the toxicity part of OECD protocol no. 453. This states that for a cancer trial you need a minimum of 50 animals of each sex per test group but for a toxicity trial a minimum of 10 per sex suffices. Monsanto used 20 rats of each sex per group in its feeding trials but only analysed 10, the same number as S\u00e9ralini.</p> <p>3. No data was given about the rats' food intake. Seralini says the rats were allowed to eat as much food as they liked.</p> <p>4. S\u00e9ralini has not released the raw data from the trial. In response he says he won't release it until the data underpinning Monsanto's authorisation of NK603 in Europe is also made public.</p> <p>5. His funding was provided by an anti-biotechnology organisation whose scientific board S\u00e9ralini heads. But he counters that almost all GM research is funded by corporates or by pro-biotech institutions.</p> <p>So where does that leave the public?</p> <p>Despite the concerns over S\u00e9ralini's methodological flaws, it looks as though the study will not be swept under the carpet. It is the longest study done on this variety of maize and many argue that it must be taken seriously by regulators and governments. French health and safety authorities now <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/rat-study-sparks-gm-furore-1.11471#/b3\" title=\"\">plan to investigate NK603</a> and the study's findings and the European Food Safety Agency has said it will assess the research. S\u00e9ralini is now demanding that all the data be assessed by an independent international committee, arguing that experts involved in the authorisation of the maize should not be involved.</p> <p>Equally, the study reopens questions about the regulation of GM crops. There has long been concern that these foods have been evaluated poorly and that the companies have taken advantage of lax regulation. The GM industry, which keeps its own research secret, has resisted investigation or any change.</p> <p>In fact, there is one irony that a few scientists have pointed out but who have been drowned out in the furore. S\u00e9ralini's study was not so much about the dangers of GM technology, but the toxicity of the Roundup herbicide used on the crops. Here's Ottoline Leyser, associate director of the Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge:</p> <blockquote> \"Like most of the GM debate, this work has very little to do with GM. The authors of the paper do not suggest that the effects are caused by genetic modification. They describe effects of the roundup herbicide itself and effects that they attribute to the activity of the enzyme introduced into the roundup resistant maize. There is good evidence that introducing genes into crops using GM techniques results in fewer changes to the crops than introducing them using conventional breeding.\" </blockquote>",
  "<p>Those of us hoping that the National Football League's lockout of its regular referees would end in a victory for the regular refs got our wish. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/nfl-fans-relieved-referee-lockout?intcmp=239\">The lockout, which began in June, ended with the refs in good financial shape</a>, and along the way such anti-union, Republican stalwarts as Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan came close to siding with the refs. \"It is time to get the real refs,\" Ryan told a Cincinnati town-hall audience. </p> <p>The regular refs now have an eight-year contract that will raise their average salary from $149,000 a year to $205,000 by 2019. The refs' defined pension plan (the key issue in the lockout) will remain in place for current officials through the 2016 season (or until an official earns 20 years of service), and when the NFL's defined contribution plan kicks in the annual league payment will begin at $18,000 and increase to more than $23,000 in 2019.</p> <p>The biggest downside of the agreement is that new refs will not get the defined benefit plan the veteran refs will have until 2016. A two-tier benefit system has been locked in place.</p> <p>However, if you were pulling for the regular refs, as I was, what is most worrying is why the lockout ended. The settlement did not come because fans or players threatened to boycott NFL games; nor did the settlement arise from a brilliant organizing strategy by the regular refs. The settlement came about because the replacement refs \u2013 whom nobody seemed to want to call scabs \u2013 proved to be such clowns.</p> <p>The replacement refs made Ray Anderson, the league's executive vice president for football operations, look silly when he declared: \"You've never paid for an NFL ticket to watch somebody officiate a game.\" </p> <p>The turning point in the lockout came on a nationally televised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers-replacement-officials\">Monday-night game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks</a>. On the final play of the game, a crew of replacements refs ruled a pass that Green Bay defensive back MD Jennings intercepted was a Seattle touchdown when Seattle receiver Golden Tate grabbed part of the ball after Jennings hit the ground with it.</p> <p>Fans watching the game were outraged, and soon the blown call was being shown over and over on television newscasts and sports programs around the country. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/63966/aaron-rodgers-game-is-being-tarnished\">In a Tuesday ESPN radio interview</a>, Green Bay's star quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, complained: \"The game is being tarnished by an NFL who obviously cares more about saving some money than having the integrity of the game diminished.\"</p> <p>In the normally anti-labor Wall Street Journal, Minnesota's Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton joined Rodgers in complaining about the officiating. \"We hit a new low in this week's Monday Night Football,\" Tarkenton wrote in an op-ed punningly titled <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444180004578018460285661282.html\">\"Pro Football Keeps Fumbling\"</a>.</p> <p>The larger political problem for those of us who supported regular refs is the unreliability of such turning points. Mitt Romney, with his dismissive remarks about the 47% of Americans who won't vote for him because they are government dependents, is living proof that the right in America is having trouble keeping its arrogance in check.</p> <p>Romney at least appears to be trying to back off his 47% remarks. The same cannot be said for those who run the NFL. The league's owners show no sign of believing they made a mistake in asking the refs to give up a pension plan that barely made a dent in the annual $9.3bn industry that is NFL football.</p> <p>The same clique who for years denied that repeated concussions were causing many of their players lifetime brain damage (the Alzheimer's rate among NFL players with five or more seasons is four times the national average) persist in thinking of pro football and its personnel as little more than a \"product\". </p> <p><em>Nicolaus Mills is professor of American studies at Sarah Lawrence College.

But is is also the case that only action at a collective EU - or at least Euro-area - level to boost sustainable growth, investment and employment can really be effective in confronting this debt deleveraging crisis of finance capitalism. There are signs that the German opposition parties are starting to recognise this as does the French SP (in spite of the measures announced by the Hollande government). So do most European parties on the centre left and left. The political battle is now to convert this growing awareness of the need to change course at the European level into concrete action by the EU institutions. The Commission has begun to make some timid proposals to stimulate growth. Demands for more radical action within the European Parliament are growing. The last thing we need in Britain or elsewhere now is a relapse into deeper, utterly barren, utterly passive and utterly reactionary Euro-scepticism.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18537192\"><strong>Tache</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While many people make a convincing case that austerity won't work, it's not at all clear that its opposite (call it anti-austerity) would work either.</p> <p>Consider the analogy of a company. If it's in financial difficulties, it could adopt an austerity policy of cutting back on salaries, laying people off and stopping investment in new products. A likely outcome would be a drop in revenue due to the company becoming less competitive in the marketplace, thereby increasing the financial difficulties.</p> <p>But an anti-austerity policy would also be risky. The company could invest in new products, but that by definition would worsen the financial difficulties in the short term, because of the cash outlay. Even if the new products were to prove a success, the payback period might be too long for comfort. And of course there's no guarantee that the new products would be a success.</p> <p>Companies have gone bust both because of austerity and anti-austerity ... just something to bear in mind.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18538062\">globalvillagebard </a></strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fine as far as it goes but what Elliot fails to recognise is that there just aren't any good options right now. The EU can no longer continue to act as if its primary purpose were to consume goods and service elsewhere in the world because the essential relationship between 'the west' and the rest of the world has been fundamentally altered, to the detriment of 'the west'. This has occurred at the same time as a rapidly looming resource crunch (especially in terms of fossil fuel) that cannot be separated from the environmental effects of continuing overconsumption.</p> <p>There are thus no good options and all this piece does is to point out what everybody already knows and not offer a way out of the morass.</p> <p>The basic problem is that democratic turkeys will in all likelihood continue to vote for a consumerist Christmas.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18541043\"><strong>InSpain</strong></a> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a businessman I can confirm that there are more than sufficient young people in Spain willing to work for 7\u20ac/hr.....as they dont recieve anything from Government....just from their parents if they are lucky.

  "<p>Sophie has always cursed the teacher who seduced then abused her when she was a schoolgirl. But she did not realise he had done anything potentially illegal until she read about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/28/megan-stammers-jeremy-forrest-found-france\" title=\"\">case of 15-year-old Megan Stammers,</a> who was found and taken into protective care on Friday after fleeing to France with her married maths teacher, who was arrested. Now Sophie is contemplating calling the police. In Sophie's case, the teacher is still teaching teenage girls at a prestigious private school a few miles from her house. She, on the other hand, struggles every day to cope with the effects his violence and oppression had on her teenage self.</p> <p>\"He ruined me, sexually, emotionally and in every other way possible,\" she says. \"I was naive and innocent, and he was perverse. The sex was aggressive and sickening, but I was infatuated: he was this older man. All the girls fancied him. I'll be honest: we were all after him.</p> <p>\"He told me he was in love with me, but then he crushed me until I was a&#xa0;complete emotional wreck. He was obsessively possessive and I was completely under his thumb. I had been this bubbly, strong and independent teenager. He destroyed me.\"</p> <p>When Sophie first saw the reports about Stammers and her 30-year-old teacher, Jeremy Forrest, it brought back strong feelings. Then, to her surprise, she felt relief. \"I have realised, for the first time, that my teacher was a sexual predator,\" she says. \"In one way, it&#xa0;makes me feel less mad for having suffered so much over something that happened so long ago, and for not having been able to get my life back together since.</p> <p>\"But,\" she adds, \"it can't heal me or change the consequences. Most of my relationships since then have been really awful and violent. I can't trust men in positions of authority. I was predicted four A-grades at A-level and had great plans for university. But I&#xa0;dropped out of education and have never come to anything. It all started with him. If he had not done what he did to me when I was too young to know what was going on, my life now would be very different.\"</p> <p>The teacher was 25 when he seduced Sophie, a 17-year-old student, in 1992. He was her form tutor. The relationship was intense: her parents knew about it and she frequently stayed at his house. But they had to keep it a secret in school. \"We'd ignore each other during the day,\" says Sophie. He dumped her nine days before her A-levels \u2013 and then invigilated at her exams. Sophie didn't achieve anything like the grades she had been predicted but still got into university.</p> <p>Then he rekindled the relationship. When it ended a second time, she fell apart, dropping out of university and into a life of chaos and self-destruction. \"He broke me,\" she says. \"But now I've read that he did do something genuinely wrong in the eyes of the law. All these years later, he still deserves to be punished for what he did, doesn't he? Is it my responsibility to try to protect the girls at the school he's now teaching at?\"</p> <p>Sophie, however, will not be able to see her abuser prosecuted for what he did. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 made it an offence for a person over 18 in a&#xa0;position of trust to have a sexual relationship with a child under 18, regardless of whether the relationship is consensual and even if the person does not teach the child. Prior to that act, the age of consent \u2013 16 \u2013 was the only issue.</p> <p>Teaching unions claim pupil-teacher affairs are \"very rare\". Between 1991 and 2008, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7653326.stm\" title=\"\">129 teachers were prosecuted for relationships with pupils, according to reports</a>. But a 2007 YouGov survey of 2,200 adults said one in six knew of someone who had had an \"intimate relationship\" with a teacher while at&#xa0;school.</p> <p>One school has dealt with no fewer than five incidents. When, in 2009, Christopher Reen, 31, a classroom supervisor at Headlands school in Bridlington, was jailed for three years and four months after admitting six counts of sexual activity with a 15-year-old female pupil, it emerged that four former staff at the same school had faced the courts in recent years over inappropriate sexual conduct.</p> <p>Hollie was raped and exploited by her&#xa0;teacher. There has never been a prosecution. She has, however, fought for years to get him struck off the teachers' register \u2013 something she finally achieved in August this year. \"Three years ago I started trying to put right something that happened between 1999 and 2001, while I was a pupil at a school in remote Scotland,\" she says. \"Between the ages of 15 and 17, I was groomed \u2013 though there wasn't a word for it then \u2013 and entered into a relationship with my 40-year-old male religious studies teacher. The relationship became nasty, violent, obsessive and physically and sexually abusive.\"</p> <p>Hollie's parents eventually found out about the relationship. It took just one conversation for them to make her realise she had been manipulated and abused. \"We reported him to the police, the school, the education department, the&#xa0;council and the General Teaching Council for Scotland,\" says Hollie. \"They all received a full report from me&#xa0;detailing the extent of what had happened. I moved to England where I&#xa0;was originally from. No one from these organisations contacted me. I was a mess and couldn't go through with prosecution, but I always stuck to my story. They all knew what the allegations were, but none of them did anything to investigate. Everything was brushed under the carpet. The teacher moved and continued teaching in a different part of Scotland.\"</p> <p>Hollie had a complete breakdown. \"I literally believed I was worthless,\" she said. \"I got into some not particularly healthy relationships and had problems with alcohol and self-harm.\"</p> <p>Three years ago, Hollie found the courage to address what had happened. The police investigated for more than a year and ultimately charged the teacher with, she thinks, rape and assault. \"But they were unable to prosecute because of Scotland's laws about corroboratory evidence and the accused's right to silence,\" says Hollie. \"The teacher sat through a six-hour interview, replying 'No comment' to every question.\"</p> <p>The legal case was also complicated because although it is now illegal for a teacher to have a relationship with a pupil, their relationship began eight weeks before the date this law came into effect. \"So they couldn't prosecute him for that,\" she says. Nevertheless, the teacher was suspended by the council in April 2010 and finally struck off the teaching register last month. \"He has been put on to the list of those barred from working with children as a result of my evidence and the police investigation,\" says Hollie.</p> <p>\"It hurts more, the older I get,\" she says. \"The closer I get to the age he was, the more I realise how awful it was, what he did. I see how he manipulated my 15-year-old self and I realise how someone of my age would know, absolutely, that it was completely wrong and inappropriate to get into a relationship with someone of that age.</p> <p>\"I wish that someone had told me, when I was 15, that if the teacher in question really loved me, he would never act on it. And I wish someone had told me that it was never, ever my fault.\"</p> <p>Professor Pat Sikes of the University of Sheffield has studied pupil and teacher relationships, and challenges the notion that girls are necessarily powerless or exploited in them, pointing out that a significant proportion end up marrying or living together in an enduring and solid relationship.</p> <p>She should know: Sikes first fell in love with her husband when she was 14 and he was her 22-year-old teacher. Their sexual relationship, however, did not begin until he left the school when she was 16. While stressing that girls need to be protected against predatory male teachers, her study concludes that this should not be \"through blanket laws that have the effect of making all women into weak, potential victims\".</p> <p>Others describe relationships with teachers that were on the cusp of inappropriate and caused parents and other teachers concern \u2013 but were ultimately a positive experience.</p> <p>Sapphire had an intense, albeit non-sexual, relationship with her maths teacher between the ages of 13 and 18. \"I&#xa0;don't tell people about our relationship because, looked at through the eyes of someone who wasn't there, it sounds like a clear-cut case of, at best, weirdness and at worst, manipulation and near-abuse,\" she says. \"In fact, that wasn't the case at all.\"</p> <p>Sapphire's relationship with her teacher grew during their one-to-one, after-school classes. \"I was weak in maths and he took it upon himself to teach me so well that I went on to study it at A-level,\" she says. \"After those lessons, we would talk about all sorts of intellectual and creative things. From him, I learned that the opposite sex could be gentle, empathetic, clever, interesting and interested. I never had the slightest interest in boys of my own age because, by comparison, they were sexually crass, emotionally unreliable and intellectually dull. To this day, I'm grateful for that.\"</p> <p>As Sapphire got older, however, the&#xa0;teacher became more intense. He prevented her leaving his class when her grades improved enough to move into a higher set, insisting that he would tutor her himself to pass the exams. \"I began to find it all a bit overwhelming, and backed off,\" she remembers. \"There was a parents' evening around then and my dad picked up on the atmosphere between us. He joked about it afterwards, saying it was like we'd had a lover's tiff. I think my parents were a bit confused by it all. They knew nothing explicitly wrong was going on and so they didn't quite know what do to about it.\"</p> <p>Soon afterwards, however, Sapphire's&#xa0;mother insisted she move to&#xa0;a different class. \"There were rumours in the staffroom about us and my teacher was warned to back off,\" she says. \"He did as he was told, but I missed him. He was a really important part of my life.\" She started going back to his classroom after school once a week. \"We just talked,\" she says. As she neared 18, however, the relationship shifted. She&#xa0;began to grow away from him and he became neurotic and, she says, \"slightly stalkerish\".</p> <p>\"I got the impression that things were&#xa0;nearing a climax. I had the definite feeling that he was expecting something to happen after so many years of what I&#xa0;began to suspect was what he thought of as having 'waited'. I found the thought of him waiting really creepy and&#xa0;realised I&#xa0;had potentially got into something I hadn't genuinely understood,\" she says.</p> <p>He sent Sapphire 18 red roses on her birthday and appeared at her class's leaving party. \"My friends formed a protective ring around me and every time he came near, they spirited me away,\" she says. She left school and never saw him again. Two decades on, she feels fondness and sadness for him. \"I think he was a vulnerable man,\" she said. \"I vaguely worry that he remembers our relationship with pain. I&#xa0;hope he doesn't.\"</p> <p>Katherine has even fonder memories of her relationship with a teacher. She was 15 when Tom came to teach at her girls' school. She moved to a sixth-form college at 16. A week later, Tom asked her out on a date. \"There weren't many male teachers at our school so we were all very aware of this 23-year-old new staff member,\" says Katherine. \"He never taught me, but all my friends fancied him. I wasn't particuarly taken by him until we went for that drink.\"</p> <p>Two years after their first date, they were married. They had two children and the marriage lasted for 30 years, until 2002, when Tom died.</p> <p>Katherine says laws that prevent teachers and pupils having relationships are correct. \"He must have been noticing me when I was still a pupil at his school, but we occasionally said to each other how lucky it was that he was no longer my teacher,\" she says. \"Had I stayed at that school, nothing would ever have happened between us because that would have been completely wrong.\"</p> <p>Some of the teachers at her old school, however, continued to disapprove of the relationship, refusing to go to their wedding. \"Their reaction was a complete surprise to me and meant nothing. I&#xa0;wasn't dazzled by Tom. I suppose I was flattered at first, because he was a teacher and an older man \u2013 but only for that first date,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Our relationship was completely normal. Completely ordinary.\"</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>",

  "<p>When we planned Another Space, a short visual history of political squatting in Brighton and Hove for the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.bpb.org.uk/2012/\" title=\"\">Brighton Photo Biennial</a>, we weren't to know the project would take on an additional dimension following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/squatting\" title=\"\">the criminalisation of squatting</a> in empty residential buildings. Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP for Hove, was instrumental in introducing the legislation which saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/first-squatter-jailed-new-law?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the first squatter jailed this week</a>. He is said to be keen to extend the law to vacant commercial properties.</p> <p>We have defined political squats as empty buildings opened by squatters to the public as social centres, libraries, gardens and, in particular, places to make and show art. The small publication we have produced, designed to parody the magazines used to peddle 'property porn' to Brighton residents, will be distributed free across the city in October.</p> <p>Over the course of the past six months, I have watched videos of exhibitions staged in empty buildings that were once banks, complete with a children's area and library. I have seen disused department stores, lecture theatres and long-empty flats transformed by 'conceptual architects' into creative spaces where visitors become artists. I have spoken to art college students who worked with squatters' networks to turn an empty shop into a gallery to oppose the opening of yet another branch of Sainsbury's Local.</p> <p>Most memorably, I have seen footage of an old courthouse refurbished by squatters and turned into a social centre in opposition to the 1994 Criminal Justice Bill. This played host to a series of gigs, events and performances, including the trial of a man dressed up as a demonic version of (then Home Secretary) Michael Howard and a debate including the real (Lib Dem deputy leader) Simon Hughes, arguing against the Conservative government's plans.</p> <p>The present fate of the buildings provides the squatters' short-lived occupations with an additional resonance. The courthouse is now converted into yuppie flats, which cost upwards of \u00a3800,000; the bank is a high-end cook shop; one building has become a designer tailor's, selling suits starting at \u00a3700; other squats are coffee houses. Gentrification complete.</p> <p>Why do these interventions matter? The coalition government has responded to the financial crisis through the introduction of severe austerity measures. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/arts-cuts-spending-review-council\" title=\"\">Arts Council England had its budget cut by 30%</a> and art sales have experienced a significant decrease as collectors tighten their belts. Yes, recessions are sometimes said to present opportunities for artists to negotiate short-term lets, and set up gallery spaces. The risk of this activity lies in beautifying the ugly consequences of recession, promoting a form of opportunism that reinforces the capitalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/sep/24/cultural-entrepreneurship-technology-remix-ebook\" title=\"\">ethos of entrepreneurism</a> or the Tory rhetoric of Big Society. Squatted art spaces do something different.</p> <p>In the UK, what is generally understood to represent official artistic culture is governed by the twin forces of the market and the state. Although each sometimes appears to view the other with suspicion, they share a close relationship \u2013 both look to the other for guidance and validation (note the number of curators from public museums who will be chinking champagne glasses at the Frieze Art Fair next month).</p> <p>Both use creativity for instrumental goals, whether that be as investment, prestige symbol, to heal social wounds, or 'regenerate' deprived areas. Where political squats are used for \u2013 or even understood as \u2013 a form of artistic production, they allow for an unbridled form of creativity that shows outright contempt for the controlling agenda of politicians and collectors.</p> <p>Sitting resolutely outside the art world, the squats I have been looking at are relational in their goals and interventionist in their methods. Their significance lies in the links forged between collaborative forms of creativity and the claim laid to what Henri Lefebvre memorably described as \"the right to the city\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/may/28/david-harvey-financial-crisis-urban-crisis-video\" title=\"\">For the geographer David Harvey</a>, neoliberalism has denied the right to determine how urban space is used to all but a wealthy elite. Where UK citizens are offered a say, it is through the self-same elected government that has responded to a financial crisis caused by the greed of plutocrats by cutting, closing or privatising playing fields, hospitals and social housing, art colleges, museums and galleries.</p> <p>While millionaires leave 'spare' houses empty for months on end and Tesco buy up land to be left vacant indefinitely, so called public space continues to diminish. By opening buildings to the public to make and share art, squatters create temporary autonomous spaces that radically refute this logic. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Not unlike the occupations that stretched from London to New York last year</a>, or the activities of UK Uncut, political squats use strategic forms of creativity to transform privatised space into a commons.</p> <p><em>Ben Burbridge is lecturer in art history at the </em><a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Sussex</em></a><em> and co-curator of the </em><a href=\"http://www.bpb.org.uk/2012/\" title=\"\"><em>Brighton Photo Biennial</em></a><em>, which runs from 6 October to 4 November</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In case you haven't noticed, there's a big problem in the GOP. If the primaries didn't establish this (see Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, et al), then Mitt <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57517589-503544/noonan-romney-campaign-is-a-rolling-calamity/\">Romney's so-called \"rolling calamity\"</a> of a general election campaign certainly has. In the midst of an incredibly important election to determine the future of America, the Republican party is in the throes of an identity crisis.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney is an imperfect messenger. But he's not entirely to blame for this inability to articulate a sufficiently compelling narrative beyond the \"Not-Obama\" position.&#xa0;In many ways, he's a victim of the times. The Republican party has spent years suffering from unaddressed, systemic problems.</p> <p>It boils down to a lack of leadership, vision and unity. This is, of course, interrelated: visionary leaders use rhetoric to inspire unity, and a party or movement that lacks visionary leaders will quickly spiral out of control \u2013 into a negative cycle of infighting, score-settling and petty vindictiveness. As <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ryan-were-going-to-beat-him-il6vfi7-170909701.html\">Paul Ryan lamented earlier this week to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that's just the nature of conservative punditry is to do that \u2014 to kind of complain \u2014 about any imperfection they might see.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps indicative of this remark, <a href=\"http://www.rightwingnews.com/conservatives/matt-lewis-on-the-sell-out-punditry-of-david-frum-and-michelle-malkin/\">Michelle Malkin and David Frum recently engaged</a> in precisely the kind of feud characteristic of a movement that is very unhappy about its position and looking for someone to blame. Conservative&#xa0;commentary today is essentially bifurcated between the red meat-hurling carnival barkers who pander to the base and the mainstream media quislings who cater to the Georgetown cocktail circuit and the cable TV bookers looking to book a \"token\" conservative to fill out their Sunday morning panel.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/23/no-apology/\">As I recently noted in a Daily Caller column</a>, both sides are destructive in their own ways. The quislings undermine our Republican candidates today by criticizing them, while the demagogues ensure the long-term structural changes aren't addressed. Just try to talk about comprehensive immigration reform as a Republican and see how long you last.</p> <p>But to blame Republican opinion-formers for not being positive enough about the party they inhabit is surely a case of shooting the messenger. Robust debate can be a sign of intellectual self-confidence, but this sort of divisiveness between conservative pundits is symptomatic a larger crisis of identity and ideas. It's time for Republicans to ask the big questions that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpX-5jQjQ0\">Admiral Stockdale made famous</a> in that debate so many years ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Who are we \u2013 and why are we here?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The GOP is running on fumes. Like a copy of a copy of a tape, conservatives have been living off the legacy of Ronald Reagan for decades.</p> <p>The cold war was the glue that united the conservative movement. Each leg of the stool \u2013 social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and national security conservatives \u2013 had their own reasons for uniting to defeat the Communists. Reagan benefitted from this unity, as well as from his own ability to inspire, and knew how to play it.</p> <p>But George W Bush managed to put the final nail in the coffin of the decades-long \"Reagan era\", and so it's time to start anew. Bush invented a new Republican brand, but then ensured it couldn't be used again.</p> <p>The \"compassionate conservatism\" that helped get him elected in 2000 ended up being overlooked by an administration distracted by the neoconservative overreach of two foreign wars, combined with increased spending that blew out the deficit and helped create an economic crisis for which many voters still blame President Bush, rather than President Obama. </p> <p>Today's GOP is in need of serious&#xa0;intellectual renewal.&#xa0;For one thing, it's mostly the fiscal leg that supports the three-legged stool these days. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/opinion/brooks-the-conservative-mind.html\">New York Times's&#xa0;David Brooks makes a good point</a> about the GOP's current focus on economic issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Republican party has abandoned half of its intellectual ammunition. It appeals to people as potential business owners, but not as parents, neighbors and citizens.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And this lack of inclusiveness underpins a lot of the Obama campaign's success in tagging Romney as a private equity guy who's only going to look after the prosperity of the super-rich elite. It's been hard for out-of-work \"Reagan Democrats\" in places like Ohio to identify with Mitt Romney.</p> <p>This is not to say economics can be ignored, but Republicans have to articulate the <em>moral case</em> for free markets. It can't be framed negatively, as necessary \"austerity\", or explained in purely wonkish terms. Too often that happens. As one GOP official, giving advice to Mitt Romney, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/politics/romney-ohio/index.html\">recently told CNN.com</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Don't make your campaign about marginal tax rates. Make it about your children and your grandchildren and the future of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this is messaging. But there are other not-obviously-ideological ideas that could. </p> <p>Why not support an e-Congress that would allow members of Congress to vote electronically from their districts? Republicans could carry the torch of putting a man on Mars by 2019. And pledge to pass legislation to make eradication of cancer the nation's top national health priority.&#xa0;Or how about championing the kind of education reform that we've seen in films like \"Waiting for Superman\" and \"Won't Back Down\"?</p> <p>Whether it's finding a way to fix education, deal compassionately with immigrants, or other bold and visionary conservative ideas, America can once again be that \"shining city on a hill\" Reagan famously spoke of. It's time for Republicans to once again be the party of the future \u2013 and of the middle class.</p> <p>But vision is not just about policy; it's time for conservatives to rediscover poetry. My guess is that one of the reasons speechwriters like Peggy Noonan have been so critical of Mitt Romney's campaign is that it has lacked any romance or poetry.</p> <p>Conservatives must have a leader who can inspire and can be afforded the luxury of introducing new, unorthodox ideas. In this regard, I'm partial to Senator Marco Rubio, who can eloquently talk about the American Dream, and we have a fresh crop of inspirational possible future leaders: besides Rubio, Representative Mike Pence (a gubernatorial candidate in Indiana) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to name but three.</p> <p>But leaders come and go, and leaders will be found. First, conservatives need to rediscover why it is they want to govern in the first place.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Korpolombolo, Sweden.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Christian Johansson and a cast of seven.</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Goat may not be the <a href=\"http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Greatest+of+All+Time\" title=\"\">G.O.A.T.</a>, but they are getting serious praise for their album World Music, acclaimed as one of the best of 2012. It's a heady soup (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/e82ba8db-3712-3de0-bbe5-0311b89db7e2\" title=\"\">see what we did there?</a>) of funk and tribal rhythms, kraut and prog-rock repetition/extrapolation, psych freakery and astral/acid folkisms. It's Parliament covering Can's Tago Mago with Bhundu Boys and the Incredible String Band, or a super-jam involving Faust, Funkadelic, Fairport Convention and Fela Kuti. Think Womad curated by Jerry Garcia and Holger Czukay, Edgar Broughton and George Clinton in 1973.</p> <p>It's called World Music because it bears traces of all music, from all over the world \u2013 not for them the usual, narrow (Afrocentric) definition of the term. It's pancultural as well, of course, as polyrhythmic. It's mesmeric, hypnotic stuff, which might explain the voodoo connection. Oh, didn't we say? Goat come from the tiny village of Korpilombolo in northern Sweden, which apparently has a long history of voodoo worship, after a travelling witch doctor settled there several centuries ago. The curse is said to inform the rhythmic, trance-like music played by the villagers, which, in turn, has shaped World Music. This is probably pure fiction, but the fact that the band have bothered to come up with such nonsense speaks volumes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nf5aEcUjfzs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nf5aEcUjfzs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>You can see for yourselves when they come to the UK next month \u2013 they play the <a href=\"http://www.allgigs.co.uk/view/event/491254/Goat_Teeth_Of_The_Sea_The_Lexington_London_19_October_2012.html\" title=\"\">Lexington</a> in London on 19 October, although we believe it already sold out weeks ago. You might want to stand outside and catch some of the psychotropic vibes. They are rumoured to wear masks, which adds to the air of mystery and exotica while also, perhaps, hiding the big, wide grins on their faces as the punters lap up their hooey. When asked whether they will be engaging in any black magic or strange rituals onstage, they reply: \"Only the harvesting of the souls of those attending the worship/live ritual.\" They add that they live on a commune where they enjoy \"a blissful, easeful and peaceful existence\" that involves \"24/7 transcendental and beneficial activities, nudity and worship of the GREAT one \u2026 Invocations, prayers and total rejoice! The love of death and awaiting the return of the horned one.\"</p> <p>Luckily their Satanic majesty also includes amazing music \u2013 fully expect to be deluged by low-flying tablas, fuzztone bass riffs, squalling, squealing saxes and guitars that marry wah-wah with the Watusi. Fully expect several tracks, too, with Goat in their title \u2013 World Music features Goatman, Goathead and Goatlord. Let's be honest, they love goats. They also have an irresistible urge to merge: funk and rock, east and west, the countercultural and the middle-eastern mystical, as well as US and UK psychedelia in a way that makes you ponder the difference between the Floyd's brand of interstellar overdrive and the Dead's workingman's jamming. Watch out for Goatman, which is like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXq4GlHgROQ\" title=\"\">Eddie Hazel</a> meets Eddie Van Halen, the misleadingly titled Disco Fever, whose organ solo is more Light My Fire than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F2O18cBxWk\" title=\"\">Relight My Fire</a>.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The interviewer said he was shocked that a French diplomat would criticise his homeland so publicly, but the French consul in London Edouard Braine stuck his ground. Britain was between 35 and 50 years ahead of France in its attitude and acceptance of people with a disability, he told the French radio station.</p> <p>Braine has been tetraplegic since horse-riding accident in 2002. He uses a wheelchair and can only move the thumb and index finger on his left hand.</p> <p>Braine leaves his post in London this weekend to return to Paris, where, he lamented, he will find it much more difficult, if not impossible, to get around by public transport.</p> <p>But the diplomat will return to a country where disability is high on the political and cultural agenda.</p> <p>This year three landmark films have been released: the record-breaking and highly acclaimed Intouchables (Untouchables) \u2013 the story of a wheelchair-using aristocrat and his ex-convict carer from the grim city suburbs; De Rouille et D'Os, in which Marion Cotillard plays a killer whale trainer who has her legs amputated after an accident; and Hasta La Vista, a \"comedy\" about three young men \u2013 one blind, one a wheelchair user and a third who is completely paralysed \u2013 on a trip to Spain to lose their virginity.</p> <p>So far, so fiction, but back in the real-world, the French government issued a directive to all ministries earlier this month insisting that any new laws must take into account their impact on those with disabilities.</p> <p>It was a beefing up the 2005 equality law introduced during the Chirac administration and described by those in organisations working with people with disabilities as the \"turned corner\".</p> <p>Emmanuelle Dal'Secco of the organisation Handicap.fr admitted the situation was improving for France's five million people with disabilities but only slowly.</p> <p>\"We cannot deny that things are going forward, and the Paralympic Games in London were a great boost, even if we had to fight tooth and nail for a few minutes live coverage on TV,\" she said. \"The problem is that moving forward costs money.\"</p> <p>Dal'Secco pointed out that the 2005 law gave a 2015 deadline for all public buildings to be made accessible to anyone with any disability, a costly measure at a time of economic austerity.</p> <p>\"We're just two years from that date and at the last count only around 15% of buildings are accessible, so it's hard to see that happening. Now, with the current economic problems, people are saying it's not feasible and are making excuses.\"</p> <p>Nicolas Bissardon, 30, a campaigner who was born with no arms and with his hands at shoulder level, said there had been \"enormous progress\" in France since 2005.</p> <p>\"In a global sense France has taken big steps forward in the last seven years. The country is better, more open and more mature in its approach to disability. Before it was a badly known, badly addressed issue, but today there is in general more acceptance, more integration and more opportunities,\" he said.</p> <p>Bissardon, also of Handicap.fr, based in Lyon, is the driving force behind a film festival called Dans La Bo\u00eete, aimed at employers. He said: \"I started work before 2005 and I have worked since and I can see the difference. After the 2005 law, which was a corner turned for the handicapped, I suddenly saw what was possible.</p> <p>\"Today companies make more effort to recruit handicapped people, schools are more competent to welcome disabled children and their approach is much more modern, and handicapped people feel more protected. Attitudes have also changed.\"</p> <p>Dal'Secco said films such as the Intouchables raise awareness, but she was sceptical of their ability to provoke long-term change in attitudes.</p> <p>\"It's complicated; 20 million people went to see the film in France and without doubt it will have had an impact on the way they see disability, but I'm not sure if it will have really changed their view.</p> <p>\"If it has an impact it will be minor, and once people leave the cinema.\"</p> <p>But Bissardon said: \"Intouchables was more a film about an unemployed guy from the <em>banlieue</em> [outskirts] than about someone who has a disability.</p> <p>\"What it does show is that attitudes have changed because before people didn't want to know about [those with a disability], they didn't want to see it, it was hidden.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm currently traveling around the US on a speaking tour, and as I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/16/personalizing_civil_liberties_abuses/\">written before</a>, one of the prime benefits of doing that is being able to meet people and their families whose lives have been severely harmed by the post-9/11 assault on basic liberties. Doing that prevents one from regarding these injustices as abstractions, and ensures that the very real human costs from these government abuses remain vivid.</p> <p>Such is the case with the treatment of Dr. Shakir Hamoodi, an Iraqi-American nuclear engineer who just began a three-year prison sentence at the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas penitentiary for the \"crime\" of sending sustenance money to his impoverished, sick, and suffering relatives in Iraq - including his blind mother - during the years when US sanctions (which is what caused his family's suffering) barred the sending of any money to Iraq. </p> <p>Yesterday in Columbia, Missouri, I met with Hamoodi's son, Owais, a medical student at the University of Missouri (MU) School of Medicine, and Hamoodi's son-in-law, Amir Yehia, a Master's student in MU's School of Journalism. The travesty of this case - and the havoc it has wreaked on the entire family - is repellent and genuinely infuriating. But it is sadly common in post-9/11 America, especially for American Muslim communities.</p> <p>Hamoodi came with his wife to the US in 1985 to work toward his PhD in nuclear engineering from MU and, not wanting to return to the oppression of Saddam's regime, stayed in the US. He was offered a research professor position at the university, proceeded to have five American-born children, all of whom he and his wife raised in the Columbia community, and then himself became a US citizen in 2002. </p> <p>But US-imposed sanctions after the First Gulf War had decimated the value of Iraqi currency and were causing extreme hardship for his large family who remained in Iraq. That sanctions regime caused the death of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/iraq/sanctions.html\">at least hundreds of thousands of Iraqis</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1084\">500,000 Iraqi children</a>. In 1991, the writer Chuck Sudetic visited Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2001/11/betrayal-basra\">wrote in Mother Jones</a> about the pervasive suffering, starvation and mass death he witnessed first-hand, and noted that the US-led sanctions regime \"killed more civilians than all the chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons used in human history\".</p> <p>The sanctions regime decimated Hamoodi's family. His elderly blind mother was unable to buy basic medication. His sister, one of 11 siblings back in Iraq, suffered a miscarriage because she was unable to buy $10 antibiotics. His brother, a surgeon, was earning the equivalent of $2 per month and literally unable to feed his family.</p> <p>Hamoodi was earning a very modest salary at the time of roughly $35,000 per year from the university, but - as would be true for any decent person of conscience - could not ignore the extreme and growing suffering of his family back in Iraq. Because sending money into Iraq from the US was physically impossible, he set up a bank account in Jordan and proceeded to make small deposits into it. From that account, small amounts of money - between $20 and $100 - were dispersed each month to his family members.</p> <p>When other Iraqi nationals in his Missouri community heard of his helping his family, they wanted to help theirs as well. So Hamoodi began accepting similar amounts of money from a small group of Iraqis and ensured those were disbursed to their family members suffering under the sanctions regime. From 1993 until 2003, when the sanctions regime was lifted after the US invasion, Hamoodi sent an average of $25,000 each year back to Iraq, totaling roughly $250,000 over the decade: an amount that fed and sustained the Iraqi relatives of 14 families in Columbia, Missouri, including his wife's five siblings.</p> <p>Nobody, including the US government, claims that these amounts were intended for anything other than humanitarian assistance for his family and those of others in his community. Everyone, including the US government, acknowledges that these funds were sent to and received only by the intended recipients - suffering Iraqi family members - and never got anywhere near Saddam's regime, terrorist groups, or anything illicit. As a <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/18/iraq-war-sanctions-run-amok-shakir-hamoodi-s-story.html\">Newsweek article on the Hamoodi case</a> made clear:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The cash . . . was doled out mostly in dribs and drabs, even the authorities concede; $40 a month to the son of a friend trying to eat while attending medical school, $80 to Hamoodi's blind mother. There was no suggestion that Hamoodi . . . aided terrorists, or that the money wound up in Saddam Hussein's hands; his elaborate email trail served as receipts, as tidy as his bookkeeping at the store.</p> <p>\"'I would get messages from my sisters, I have 11 siblings,' he says, as he shares a somber meal - piquant red peppers from South Africa, French cheeses, crusty baklava - with his wife and sons at the long dining room table. 'They would be starving. Starving. So I did what anyone, any American, would do.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But in 2002 and 2003, Hamoodi was not just a nuclear engineer. He was also a very outspoken critic of the Bush administration's plan to attack Iraq. And his position as a nuclear engineer made him a particularly potent threat to the case for that invasion, as he continuously insisted that Saddam did not have an active nuclear weapons program and that the case for the war was grounded in lies. In his antiwar activism, he emphasized how much already-suffering Iraqi civilians would suffer more, and how the invasion would lead to mass instability.</p> <p>On 18 September 2006, two of Hamoodi's children, Owais, then 17, and his college-aged sister Lamees, were at home when there was a knock on the door. Owais answered and saw two FBI agents who stood there, and behind them were 35 armed federal agents, many with guns drawn, from ten different federal law enforcement agencies. They told him they had a search warrant to search their home and then entered.</p> <p>\"We wanted to stay and watch what they did, but they told us we had to leave because they claimed they had nobody to keep an eye on us\", Owais told me, noting again that 35 agents were present. The agents spent 9 hours in Hamoodi's home alone and unsupervised. They took every passport they found, all identification (including the learner's permit of Owais' 15-year-old brother, who was left without any identification), family heirlooms, photo albums, and boxes of documents. They even insisted that Owais give them his calculator that he used for algebra class on the ground that it had memory potential. To date - six years later - the family has received none of those materials back.</p> <p>The massive, flamboyant FBI raid on Hamoodi's home predictably generated <a href=\"http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/sep/20060918news003.asp\">substantial media coverage in his community</a>. \"FBI agents today searched the home of a Columbia businessman and former Iraqi who has been an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq,\" read the first line of a long article in the local Columbia Daily Tribune. \"People of course automatically assumed terrorism\", said Owais.</p> <p>Several years later, Hamoodi was finally indicted and for the first time learned of his \"crime\": that, as <a href=\"http://www.insidecolumbia.net/August-2012/The-Complicated-Case-Of-Shakir-Hamoodi/index.php?cparticle=1&amp;siarticle=0#artanc\">this excellent Inside Columbia article</a> on his case put it, he \"ran afoul of a couple of Gulf War-era executive orders, an act of Congress and Treasury Department regulations\" banning the sending of any money to Iraq.</p> <p>From the start, Hamoodi fully cooperated with federal investigators. He readily admitted that he had sent the money to Iraq to help his starving family and those of other families in Columbia. Calling it a \"crime of compassion\", he pled guilty to the charge of engaging in \"a conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act\".</p> <p>Owais says his father's guilty plea was accompanied by the near certainty that he would receive no jail time. \"There were like five other cases involving much greater amounts sent to Iraq, some with accusations that the money had reached the regime, and very light sentences were given, including by the same judge in my father's case, who had just given another Iraqi national probation for having sent more money than my father.\" Moreover, delays in the proceedings meant that the sentencing hearing was not going to occur until the Summer of 2012 -- nine years after the sanctions expired, and nine years after Hamoodi had sent his last payment back to Iraq. </p> <p>But on 16 May 2012, Hamoodi stood before US District Judge Nanette Laughrey, a Clinton appointee, as she sentenced him to three years in a federal penitentiary - only two years less than the maximum sentence under federal sentencing guidelines for this offense - followed by three years probation. Hamoodi's son-in-law, Amir Yehia, was at both his father-in-law's sentencing hearing and the one of another Iraqi national who had received probation from Judge Laughrey just four months earlier for a similar offense. \"This time, it was like she was a totally different person,\" he told me. \"I don't know if she was pressured or had received pushback after the probation she gave in the other case, but it was amazing how completely different she was at his hearing.\"</p> <p>In a country that has stood by while torturers, government kidnappers, and Wall Street thieves have been completely protected - to say nothing of those who aggressively attacked Iraq - Judge Laughrey, as recounted by Inside Columbia, invoked the mandates of the \"rule of law\" to explain why Hamoodi, now 60, would have to spend the next three years in a federal prison despite having harmed absolutely nobody:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'He obviously has a model family, a lovely family, lovely children . . . I am sure it is largely as a result of your leadership in the family,' [the judge] told [Hamoodi]. 'But I have also had to take into account what you did . . . you disagreed with the law, and you decided not to comply with the law. That does not show respect for the rule of law, which is the foundation of this country.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The lawyer from the Obama justice department - the same agency that shielded all Bush-era criminals from even an iota of accountability on the ground that we must \"Look Forward, not Backward\" - invoked the same rationale for why Hamoodi must be punished for the payments he sent to his suffering family nine years ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'It's easy to say it's all in the rearview mirror, the sanctions have expired[', said Garrett M. Heenan]. 'But it is still a serious crime, and the larger United States government interests in having sanctions and, moreover, having people in the United States - citizens - abide by the requirements of [the] Treasury [Department] and not violate those sanctions is an important thing that the United States would seek to promote.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As of three weeks ago - beginning on 28 August - Hamoodi is now at Fort Leavenworth, where he just began serving his three year sentence. Yehia, his son-in-law, says that he is holding up reasonably well but is extremely worried about how his family will manage. Owais says that he's most concerned about his youngest brother, now in the tenth grade: \"That's a really vulnerable time for a kid, and now he has to live it with his father gone, in prison.\"</p> <p>As harrowing as this is, these stories are incredibly common in American Muslim communities. But what makes this case particularly horrific is that the suffering Hamoodi sought to alleviate was caused by the very same US government that is now imprisoning him for his humanitarianism. </p> <p>The reason his relatives were starving and living in abject misery was precisely because the US government enforced years of brutal sanctions. To have that same government then turn around and punish him for the \"crime\" of helping his family members survive is warped sadism. I really don't see how prosecutors and judges who participate in these sorts of travesties can live with themselves. Worse, US officials who twice completely destroyed Iraq - first with the sanctions regime, then with an aggressive war - are permitted to thrive in freedom and enrich themselves. As one local activist, Jeff Stack, <a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/aug/19/may-the-truth-set-hamoodi-free/\">wrote after Hamoodi received his shocking sentence</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Who will truly be served by incarcerating our friend Shakir Hamoodi? Certainly not his wife and their five children, who collectively exemplify what is most hopeful and encouraging about this nation. They are hard-working and high-achieving contributing citizens. Three of their children have completed undergraduate degrees. Two of them finished master's programs and one is attending medical school. The youngest two are in college and high school.</p> <p>\"Society won't benefit by his costly imprisonment, which will leave a painful void in our community. He poses no threat. . . . The [Newsweek] article notes Justice Department officials provided the reporter a list of seven individuals who have been incarcerated for violating sanctions. The 59-year-old Columbia resident stands out as the only one facing prison for undertaking purely humanitarian actions and taking nothing for himself.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Hamoodi's family has now placed all of their hopes in trying to persude President Obama, or whoever is in the Oval Office after the election, to pardon him or at least commute his sentence. A petition has been created and currently has over 3,000 signatures; you can and, I hope will, <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/president-barack-obama-commute-the-36-month-sentence-of-dr-shakir-hamoodi\">add your name here</a>. You can also donate to help his family <a href=\"http://www.helphamoodi.org/donate.html\">on this page</a>.</p> <p>The 9/11 attack was exploited to create what New York Times Editorial Page Editor Andrew Rosenthal has <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/liberty-and-justice-for-non-muslims/\">accurately described</a> as \"a separate justice system for Muslims\". These are the kinds of horrific injustices which that separate - and decidedly not equal - system routinely creates.</p> <h2>Speaking tour</h2> <p>The event in which I participated last night at the University of Missouri Law School on America's civil liberties abuses was truly excellent.

  "<p>\"We thank the military and the police for the vital roles they played in ensuring Nick Buckles could stay in his job.\" No, that's not quite right. G4S chairman John Connolly was actually thanking soldiers and police officers for ensuring \"the delivery of a safe and secure Games.\"</p> <p>But there's a link. If security arrangements at the Olympics and Paralympics had become a front-line farce, as opposed to being a mere behind-the-scenes farce, it's hard to see how Buckles could have remained as chief executive. The success of the games has instead allowed the G4S board to respond to the cries of \"heads must roll\" by serving up the resignations of the chief operating officer, David Taylor-Smith, and the divisional chief, Ian Horseman Sewell. It's a case of shooting the deputies and not the sheriff.</p> <p>Fair? The review, conducted by PwC, blamed \"a series of project management and project execution failings\" for G4S's failure to supply all the contracted staff and found no significant shortcomings in Buckles' own performance. If you accept the premise that chief executives of companies with 657,000 employees can't be everywhere and have to delegate, then, yes, the board's judgment is logical.</p> <p>On the other hand, it's hard to maintain with a straight face that \"the CEO has ultimate responsibility for the company's performance\" if he stays in his job after a cock-up that will cost shareholders \u00a350m plus the consequences of any reputational damage. This was the highest-profile contract in G4S's history \u2013 shouldn't the boss have been all over it?</p> <p>In the end, though, the will of shareholders usually prevails and it's clear that the Buckles fan club is intact. The reality of the situation is that when a chief executive wants to stay in his post and has the confidence of the owners, that's what happens.</p>",
  "<p>The flow of notable new Android apps quietened down a bit on the Google Play store this week, which is why this post has dropped down to a list of 10 rather than 20 \u2013&#xa0;see the note at the bottom for a bit more on that.</p> <p>There's some good stuff though, from Google's brand new location app to second-screen startup Zeebox's Stateside debut.</p> <p>It's worth noting, too, that it has been a cracking week for new Android games. They're not included here, because there's a separate weekly mobile/tablet games roundup. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/27/best-mobile-games-bad-piggies-fifa-13\">This week's edition</a> is well worth a read if you're an Android user, since it includes games like Bad Piggies, Pocket Planes, Bingo Bash, Kingdoms of Camelot: Battle and The Bard's Tale.</p> <p>Still, this post is all about non-game apps, so find this week's selection below \u2013&#xa0;the weekly iOS roundup will follow later in the day:</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.scout\">Field Trip</a></h2> <p>This app came out of the blue from Google itself, or at least a team \u2013&#xa0;Niantic Labs \u2013 working within the company on experimental apps. This one is a location-based recommendations app designed to run in the background. \"When you get close to something interesting, it pops up a card with details about the location,\" explains its Google Play listing. That includes local history, food/drink/shopping suggestions and music gigs. It's US-only for now, although Pocket Lint has <a href=\"http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/47756/google-field-trip-pictures-hands-on\">already discovered</a> that when sideloaded, it works in the UK too.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeebox.com\">Zeebox</a></h2> <p>Zeebox isn't new to Brits, of course, but the second-screen TV app launched in the US this week, with high-profile partners Comcast, NBCUniversal and HBO to give it an early boost. As in the UK, it's part TV Guide, helping people decide what to watch, and part social aggregator, pulling in tweets for each show, and offering related links and content. It'll be going head to head with US apps GetGlue, Miso and IntoNow, as well as fellow British firm Shazam.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appshen.frameworks.blade\">Fantasy Premier League 2012-13</a></h2> <p>Playing England's official Fantasy Premier League competition? There's now an official app for it on Android. If you've registered a team online, you can use the app to pick your team every week, check their performance, transfer players in and out, and keep tabs on mini-leagues that you're playing in with friends.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awareness.etymoticHD\">Awareness! HD for Etymotic</a></h2> <p>\"Getting lost in music, movies or games can be really anti-social,\" suggests the Google Play listing for this new audio app, which is designed to work with Etymotic's noise-isolation headsets. Tuned for Google's Nexus 7 tablet, this app uses the tablet's microphone to \"listen\" to the world around you, lowering your music/movies/games volume when it detects a noise louder than the background rumble.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skymotion.skymotion\">Sky Motion</a></h2> <p>Another North American-only app, this is a hyperlocal weather app, which makes the grand claim to know \"exactly when precipitation will start and end for your exact location\". For the next two hours at least, which is usually all the data you need to make an umbrella/taxi/etc decision. It works across the US and Canada.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cluepop.boots.google\">Puss in Boots: 3D Pop-up Book</a></h2> <p>Fancy spinning some fairy tales to your children on an Android device? CluePoint has an app for you, based on the familiar Puss in Boots story. Apeing a physical pop-up book, it has lots of tapping and dragging for interactivity, with music and a modern-rewrite of the tale. It's aimed at 2-6 year-olds.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bestnewgameapp.bitbeatbox\">8bit Beatbox</a></h2> <p>That mushroom with headphones looks familiar in the promo screenshots... Yes, 8Bit Beatbox takes its inspiration firmly from retro videogames \u2013&#xa0;not that they were retro at the time, of course. It's a music app for creating tunes using virtual sample pads and a three-octave keyboard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.odigames.musicmatrix\">Music Matrix</a></h2> <p>Music-making apps are starting to make a noise on Android, with Music Matrix the latest trying to put a friendly face (well, interface) on creating beats and melodies on the go. Working on tablets and smartphones alike, its developers freely admit that they've been inspired by Yamaha's Tenori-On device, as you tap on a grid of squares to trigger sounds.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beatronik.jugglr\">Jugglr</a></h2> <p>And more music here, this time with a DJing app that claims to be the first on Android with a \"real vinyl scratch effect\". It runs in landscape or portrait mode, but more importantly can record your mixes and upload them to SoundCloud for sharing with the wider world (i.e. not just the unlucky souls whose living room / party you've hijacked with your box of emo-dubstep swing albums).</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.gbk.loyalty\">GBK</a></h2> <p>Finally, a UK-focused app to finish off with: Gourmet Burger Kitchen. Its app is focused on challenges and rewards, copping a few features from Foursquare (like achievement badges), while promising free food and drink to customers who use it often.</p> <p><strong>And now for that apology...</strong> With no disrespect to the apps above, this week has seen very thin pickings on the Google Play store for non-game apps.

I've been working hard to ensure both platforms get their fair share of coverage on the Apps Blog, which that 80 apps is a sign of (iOS will have had 90 for the same period, because today's roundup will have 20).</p> <p>So yes, a bad week, but lots of exciting apps coming out on Android over the month. This may seem a defensive few paragraphs, but hopefully it will at least provide context for any discussion of this week's 10 Best Apps post. I'm an optimist!</p>",
  "<p>When Hong Kong property tycoon Cecil Chao offered a $65m (\u00a340m) \"marriage bounty\" to any man willing to marry his daughter, who is a lesbian, it seemed to many like the most indecent of proposals.</p> <p>Offers quickly poured in from all over the world, ranging from simple date requests to humorous bids for m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois. Around 100 would-be suitors for Chao's 33-year-old daughter Gigi have beaten a path to his office door since Wednesday's announcement, but thousands of others have resorted to letters, email and fax to proclaim their interest.</p> <p>They include \"war veterans from the US, someone from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal \u2013 really, just from all over the world,\" she said.</p> <p>According to the Hong Kong English-language daily the South China Morning Post, one man suggested his brother, a George Clooney body double, as \"the picture-perfect date that your father craves\". One Frenchman was more modest in his proposal: \"I think I can make this woman happy. I'm as soft as a woman,\" he wrote.</p> <p>An American suitor said: \"I'm interested in your offer to wed your daughter, who also happens to be gay. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay.\"</p> <p>Gigi, who serves as the executive director of the luxury property development company Cheuk Nang Holdings, of which Chao is chairman, has denied being upset by her father's offer and described it instead as his \"very interesting way of expressing his fatherly love\".</p> <p>\"I was really quite touched, very touched and very \u2013 how should I say? \u2013 moved by Daddy's announcement,\" she told the Associated Press. \"I mean, it's really his way of saying, 'Baby girl, I love you. You deserve more,' basically.\"</p> <p>Cecil Chao, 76, is said to have created the dowry after learning that his daughter had had a \"church blessing\" with her long-time partner in France earlier this year. Homosexuality has been decriminalised in Hong Kong since 1991, but same-sex marriages are not recognised in the city. Chao says Gigi is neither gay nor married and has dismissed reports of her same-sex marriage as rumours.</p> <p>\"What this whole episode really highlights,\" Gigi said, \"is that perhaps still, the Chinese \u2013 or in fact the Hong Kong mentality \u2013 can perhaps tolerate the 'don't ask, don't tell' view of sexuality. But as a social statement, it's still very much a sensitive issue.\"</p> <p>Chao's so-called bounty wields a wide net indeed: open to men of every nationality and economic background, the only stipulation, according to the Post, is that the man \"loves my daughter, and she loves him\". As for what kind of wife his daughter would make, Chao promised that \"Gigi is a very good woman with both talents and looks [who] is devoted to her parents, is generous and does volunteer work\".</p> <p>Surprised by the reaction his bounty received, which he described as \"thousands of people writing to say they want to be my in-laws\" \u2013 Chao said he only wanted to make sure his daughter had a secure future.</p> <p>\"Living a comfortable life in Hong Kong, not super-luxury, takes HK$500m (\u00a340m),\" he said, adding that a house alone costs HK$150m (\u00a312m).</p> <p>Perhaps Chao, who boasts of having slept with over 10,000 women and never married, would be better getting married himself. The sunglass-sporting tycoon has received a mere few hundred marriage proposals in the past two days.</p> <p>Whatever happens, a fairytale ending may still be had.

  "<p>David Cameron has confirmed that the British people will be given a say, possibly in a referendum, on any new EU settlement after the next general election.</p> <p>Speaking on the final day of his visit to the US and Brazil, the prime minister also announced that Britain would opt out of a series of EU law and order policies later this year.</p> <p>Cameron said that major changes to the EU would require \"fresh consent\" from the British people. But he stopped short of specifically mentioning a referendum because the timing of a new EU agreement could mean that it would make more sense to seek the consent of voters in a general election. The prime minister, who will set out his thinking in the autumn, believes a referendum is the most likely outcome after a new EU settlement is agreed in the wake of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>In a sign of a more immediate hardline approach, he said Britain would exercise its rights to stand apart from a series of justice and home affairs measures later this year.</p> <p>Asked by the BBC whether Britain would opt out of EU justice and policing powers, he said: \"That has to be done before the end of the year, and the opt-out is there. We'll be exercising that opt-out.</p> <p>\"The key thing then is, well, which of the array of things you've come out of do you actually think are good for Britain and you want to co-operate with European partners on? And that's a discussion we're having at the moment.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said voters would be consulted once a new EU settlement had been agreed.</p> <p>He told Sky News in Rio de Janeiro: \"When we achieve that new settlement I think we will be able to seek fresh consent from the British people. I will be setting that out in the autumn before the end of the year.</p> <p>\"I think that is the way the country wants to go and that is the way we should go, safeguarding Britain's interests. A new settlement and a fresh consent from the British people, that is what I believe we need.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who faces intense political pressure from the UK Independence party in the runup to the 2014 European parliamentary elections, believes voters will need to be consulted if the EU agrees a major treaty revision in the next few years. Eurozone leaders are expected to agree wide-ranging changes to the governance of the single currency, possibly by moving towards a fiscal union, to avoid a repeat of the euro crisis.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of the arrangements. But the changes will have to be agreed by all 27 EU members in a new treaty or in a revision to the Lisbon treaty.</p> <p>The prime minister would use the treaty negotiations, in which Britain would have a veto, to recast the country's relationship with the EU by repatriating powers. It is expected he would ask for the contents of the chapter on social and employment laws, which is sprinkled in various places of the Lisbon treaty, to be repatriated.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"I don't think it is in Britain's interests to leave the EU, but I do think what it is increasingly becoming the time for is a new settlement between Britain and Europe, and I think that new settlement will require fresh consent. In the next parliament, I think there will be opportunities for a fresh settlement and for new consent to that settlement.</p> <p>\"The fact is Europe is changing \u2013 and changing rapidly. The eurozone of 17 countries with one currency, I believe that one day they are going to move towards one economic policy. We are not going to be part of that and I think that will provide over time opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe.\"</p> <p>Cameron's thinking was recently set out by Sir John Major who told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the negotiations would provide Britain with a chance to recast relations with the EU. This could bring an end to what he called the long-running sore of Britain's fraught relations with the union.</p> <p>But Cameron will tread with care because Britain does not know when a major treaty revision will take place, and he does not want to undermine Britain's negotiating position by sounding too shrill about a referendum.</p> <p>Some eurozone leaders want prompt action. But Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, has called for a slower approach. In his state of the union address recently he floated the idea of using the results of elections to the European parliament in 2014 as a way of establishing a negotiating framework.</p> <p>Britain expects a slower approach because the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is focused on next year's federal elections. But Cameron feels he must speak out now because there will be three EU summits before Christmas covering a banking union for the bloc, the next seven-year EU budget and the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>In an interview with ITN, the prime minister confirmed for the first time that Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip, had damaged the government when he swore at police in Downing Street.</p> <p>Cameron told ITN: \"Well, look of course it's been damaging but the fact is that the chief whip has apologised, and apologised properly. And that needed to happen, and this must never ever happen again. And the police have said they're not taking it further, and on that basis I think we can let matters rest there.\"</p>",
  "<p>The London 2012 Olympics head of digital has warned Rio to sort out its strategy in this area quickly, with 60% of this year's Games content accessed via mobile devices.</p> <p>Alex Balfour, head of new media at the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (Locog), said that apps were only launched six months before the 2012 event and admitted that location services from Facebook and Foursquare were the only failure of the digital strategy.</p> <p>Balfour added that the organisers of the 2016 Rio Olympics can only expect an even greater multimedia challenge in four years' time.</p> <p>\"We certainly didn't spend 60% of our time thinking of mobile,\" he said, speaking at the Royal Television Society Digital World Conference in London on Friday. \"We only launched apps in the last six months, so Rio needs to get a move on.\"</p> <p>Balfour added that in the next four years there may not be a defining digital innovation, such as Twitter, but there will be much more intensive digital use and more capability.</p> <p>\"We definitely felt in mobile we could've done gone so much further but couldn't handle the capacity,\" he said, pointing out that Locog had to pull a non-sport product because it wasn't technically possible to deliver.</p> <p>He added that the one real failure in terms of digital content was the use of location-based social media services \u2013 primarily Facebook Places and Foursquare.</p> <p>Balfour said that there had been 667,000 check-ins on Facebook \u2013 to 63 official Places destinations \u2013 for Olympic venues and 100,000 on Foursquare. But the most popular check-in location during the Games was Hyde Park, which was not an official London 2012 venue.</p> <p>\"It seemed that people only did 'business as usual' updates, they were not bothered about doing location-based [check-ins],\" he added. \"It seems to be a bit of a minority sport.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Is BlackBerry maker RIM out of the woods? If all you looked at was its after-hours share price, and the forecasts by analysts, you might think so: the shares surged 18% after its results were announced; they showed losses that were less, and handset shipments greater, than analysts had forecast.</p> <p>Alas: as Benedict Evans of Enders Analysis <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/251598006976147456\" title=\"\">pointed out on Friday morning</a>, the share ramp instead looked like a classic \"short and squeeze\" pattern \u2013 where those who had short-sold the shares in expectation of dire results were forced back into the market to buy, and minimise their own losses, when the numbers were only awful.</p> <p>RIM's problems are far from over. Its market share has collapsed in the US, it has just suffered its third successive quarter of losses (and forecast at least one more), average selling prices for its handsets are down, the 7.4m handset shipments are 30% down (in a rapidly expanding market), and its PlayBook tablet shipped just 130,000 units (Apple's iPad shipped more every day of the second quarter).</p> <p>The only area showing success is emerging markets such as Indonesia, where the combination of cheap handsets and its BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) service \u2013 which doesn't need a data contract to function \u2013 appeals to a broad demographic. The other area is enterprises, which have not yet abandoned BlackBerrys, because of their security and email functionality.</p> <p>\"There's many new products coming in so the market is going to get tougher, more challenging,\" chief executive Thorsten Heins told analysts in a conference call on Thursday, adding that that will most likely force RIM to cut prices further.</p> <p>That's going to hurt profits even more. RIM's US revenues have been collapsing since mid-2010 \u2013 though fortunately for its survival, revenues from other geographical regions have grown to make up some of the difference.</p> <p>But the general trend is downward, with revenues falling 31% to $2.87bn \u2013 the fifth successive quarterly drop \u2013 and operating losses hitting $363m, the third straight quarter of losses that in total are nudging $900m. RIM's problem is that it is ill-equipped to compete at the cheaper end of the smartphone market \u2013 but that is where it has been relegated by the huge success of Apple and Samsung, which between them control half of that sector.</p> <p>\"While RIM delivered marginally better results, we believe it is still too early to get constructive,\" said Phillip Huang of UBS Investment Research, in a note titled \"Not Out of the Woods Yet; 1Q13 Key\".</p> <p>The crucial question will be how effective BB10, the upcoming version of its operating system, can be. While Heins wowed developers earlier this week by showing off BB10 handsets and promising carriers would start testing them in October, there will still be a huge delay before the new products go on sale, probably in March 2013.</p> <p>By that time, it will face renewed pressure in the low-end markets from Finland's Nokia, as well as Chinese handset makers offering cheap Android phones, says Francisco Jeronimo, smartphones analyst at researchers IDC.</p> <p>\"They're still relying on a very strong brand \u2013 that's what has been supporting them,\" says Jeronimo. \"People in those markets can't afford high-end phones like the iPhone. But if BB10 isn't as good as they have been promising, then there will be problems. Let's see what happens in the next quarter.\"</p> <p>He thinks that will put extra pressure on as RIM comes under fire from rivals. \"Nokia's Asha portfolio in emerging markets is probably the cheapest device that can provide a similar smartphone experience,\" he says.</p> <p>RIM's cash position improved despite the losses \u2013 but that came through squeezes on inventory (reduced by $233m) and the supply chain. But it will need everything it has to withstand what is sure to be a renewed attack over the next two quarters from rivals both above and below it.</p> <p>Peter Misek, at Jefferies noted that the figures released on Thursday offer little guidance to the future of the company. \"They are driving sales in emerging markets and we think they will continue to lose subscribers in developed markets,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It doesn't tell you anything about the long-term success of the platform or the company.\"</p> <p>Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial, was more blunt. \"It does give them more time. The talk of bankruptcy has probably dissipated right now,\" Gillis said. \"These are all the right moves, but does it change that their position is still bleak?\"</p>",

  "<p>I've recently been offered the first full-time permanent position of my science career. It only took 11 years. This is my story but it could belong to many others.</p> <p>After completing my PhD in 2001 I worked as a post-doc researcher in biological sciences in two different labs until 2006. Despite best efforts, the second post-doc didn't work out research wise and after two years of negative results my funding ran out. Even though I applied for other positions, by the time my contract ended I was officially unemployed. To save money I decided to move back in with my parents and claim jobseekers allowance, a galling process when you are 33 and have three higher degrees.</p> <p>The job centre staff were nice. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/03/academic-job-seeking-and-post-doc-unemployment\" title=\"\">Contrary to some experiences</a>, they understood my qualifications, that I was trying hard to find another job and that they couldn't really help me. My jobseeker priorities were simple: monitor university and science websites for vacacnies. I registered with some science-focused recruitment agencies but any positions that came up were out of my area \u2013 subject-wise or geographic \u2013 and poorly paid.</p> <p>The department for work and pensions have a professional register for specialist careers, but the only job it found in six months that even vaguely matched my qualifications was lab technician in a secondary school. The chances of getting it were slim (they knew I would up sticks and leave for a post-doc as soon as I could) so I declined an interview to many frowns from my advisor, who understood but clearly didn't approve.</p> <p>In the meantime I applied for posts. Every day. Sometimes between six to 10 in an afternoon. I was willing to move anywhere and tailored my CV and application for every position I found. Despite some good publications on my CV and a lot of science experience, I couldn't get an interview. Eventually I took on some bar work, permissable part-time while claiming jobseekers allowance. What they don't tell you is that any wages for up to 16 hours work are taken out of your dole. I might as well have sat at home and watched Bargain Hunt. I was out of work, out of money and quickly running out of hope.</p> <p>But after four months things picked up. I got two interviews in as many days, one with a company in Cambridge and another in Aberdeen. Desperate for any job by then, I travelled hundreds of miles for the appointments and got to the last two for the Cambridge job, only losing out to a more experienced research candidate from UCL. That's the thing about negative results \u2013 you can't publish them. I was offered the position in Aberdeen but they wanted to job-share the post between two people, a fact they conveniently forgot to mention during the interview and that made relocation to Scotland financially impossible.</p> <p>The job centre did pay for my interview expenses, however, and my outlook improved \u2013 maybe I wasn't so rubbish after all. I soon got another interview for a one year post at Manchester University \u2013 some long awaited breathing space \u2013 and when I was given the position it was renewed for three years. I've since switched to another university and after two and a half years there and 11 years in total as a post-doc, I've been offered that permanent full-time post.</p> <p>Finally, I can forget about that sinking feeling that comes with knowing your contract is up. Is there funding? Will my grant application go through? Will I have to apply for another job? For the first time, I can look ahead and plan for my future. I can buy a house and build some foundations in a city without worrying if I have to move on in three years.</p> <p>What people sometimes don't realise is that a career in science is about sacrifice. You are overqualified and underpaid. You work late evenings and weekends when the experiments demand it. You're never permanently employed. No grant then no job. No HEFCE funding then no job. No exciting results then \u2013 guess what? \u2013 no job.</p> <p>You have to be a dynamic researcher with contacts and grants and results and publications. And you have to do it quickly. The gun sounds as soon as they shake your hand after the viva \u2013 and you're off. You have five to 10 years to get your own funding. Otherwise you become too expensive \u2013 I have twice taken a pay-cut to get a contract. After eight to 10 years you don't even qualify for research council starter fellowships.</p> <p>I know of many friends who have given up on a science career after completing their PhDs. No wonder, when it can take up to 15 years to get a lectureship. My own situation has improved. Both my university and line manager have been very supportive and allowed me to start a PGCHEP (Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice) to improve my teaching abilities. But I am one of the lucky ones to get a permanent position.</p> <p>Anyone entering the research field should be under no illusion that it takes blood, sweat and tears to get anywhere unless you hit a magical bullseye: that truly novel find and that first Nature/Science paper from your first research project. To those lucky few, fellowships and PI grants and lectureships follow. The rest of us simply help them along the way, the faceless science post-docs trying to grind out a career and hit lucky on a project, idea or grant application before we become either too expensive or unemployed.</p> <p><em>Anonymous is a postdoctoral research associate in biological sciences at a UK university</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The bar may be set high early for this weekend, as <strong>Sporting KC</strong> and <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> kick off this week's schedule on Friday night. With the two sides competing for supremacy in the East, and Chicago in such great form, that could be a great game \u2013 or a tense and nervy tie... </p> <p>Watching in the wings for any slip-up will be <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong>, who on Saturday evening host <strong>Toronto FC</strong>, who may be the best or worst team to play after a torrid week for New York's playoff hopes. <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong> know how the Red Bulls feel, and they'll be trying to regain some ground via the visit of<strong> New England </strong>, while <strong>Columbus Crew</strong>, suddenly slipping, could do with all three points against <strong>Philadelphia</strong> to keep themselves in contention.</p> <p><strong>DC United</strong> quietly went about picking up six points last week, and while <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> aren't easy to play at home, of the three road games DC face in their remaining schedule this is probably where their best chance of picking up points lies. Speaking of tricky away trips, <strong>FC Dallas </strong>must try to keep themselves in playoff contention with a difficult trip to the Shield favorites, <strong>San Jose Earthquakes</strong>. The last team the Earthquakes beat, <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong>, have a difficult road trip to make, to Cascadia rivals <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps</strong>. That said, the 'Caps may have snapped their losing streak, and may be at home for this one, but they have yet to beat either of their Cascadia Cup rivals since entering MLS.</p> <p><strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> confirmed their fifth consecutive playoff spot last week. They now head to Los Angeles to play <strong>Chivas USA</strong> in the rubber match of their three-game series. Finally, on Sunday <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> head <em>out </em>of LA to face a <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> side who, amazingly, are not yet mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. </p> <p>Guaranteed to be mathematically safe are our collection of fan reps, bloggers, beat writers and podcasters for each of this weekend's competing teams. They consider their team's chances below, with occasionally heartbreaking honesty (it's that time of year) \u2013 and then you can have your say in the comments section. And we'll be back on Monday with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/sep/24/week-29-san-jose-earthquakes-seattle-sounders\">Five Things We Learned</a>, though as I'm traveling it may well be five things Joe and Busfield learned, as we rotate the squad with the playoffs in mind.

Sporting KC vs Chicago Fire, Fri 8.30pm, (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>The battle at the top of the East Conference continues this Friday when Sporting KC face the Chicago Fire at LSP. This is the third meeting between these two this season, the Fire having been victorious in the first two matches. With the Fire building momentum as it looks to ensure a playoff berth \u2013 its first since 2009 \u2013 and Sporting KC returning from a successful two-match road trip (featuring a 2-0 win at NYRB), I'm looking forward to a hard-fought match.</p> <p>Chicago has better coordinated its defense in its latest no-loss streak, but as we all learned from SKC v NYRB, a team cannot expect to hold off Sporting and wait for a break. There's a lot on the line here for Chicago, and though it might find some comfort in having beaten Sporting KC twice this season (one of those at LSP), Chicago will have to push forward and through SKC's more solid midfield, which is led by Roger Espinoza and Graham Zusi. Add Sinovic and Myers pushing from the back line into the midfield for additional support, and Chicago will have a difficult time breaking through what is really the only true MLS Cup contender in the East. If Chicago do get through the SKC midfield and defense, I fully expect Jimmy Nielsen to save the night with another shutout.</p> <p>Sporting KC is not giving up the chase for the Supporters Shield \u2013 Chicago is merely a stepping-stone in that chase. I expect an exciting match, with SKC victorious.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/\">Hot Time in Old Town</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>Like Manchester United about a decade ago, it seems that the 2012 Chicago Fire are more comfortable when they go a goal behind. Last Saturday's match against Columbus was no different, the Fire going down 1-0 after an uncharacteristic error by goalkeeper Sean Johnson before a couple of Chris Rolfe goals gave them a comfortable win. \"Attacking\" midfielder Alex has impressed in his new role playing as a holding midfielder, in the absence of Pavel Pardo. One of the only concerning things about Saturday's game was right-back Jalil Anibaba's tendency to stray too far forward at times, which left space in behind. </p> <p>Kansas City offer a much more difficult test on Friday night. Getting a positive result would be a big step towards the Eastern Conference crown, but a loss could derail such ambitions. KC played very defensively last week in Montreal and I expect the Fire to follow suit Friday. That being said, I expect Nyarko, Alex, Rolfe and co to constantly pressure KC when they have the ball, a tactic the Impact used to great effect last weekend. The KC team, starting with their head coach, have a tendency to lose their cool when calls don't start going their way. In this high pressure game, the Fire players will also need to keep it together and not let players like Harrington and Kamara get under their skin. Chris Rolfe will not be allowed the room he is allotted in home games, which means the team will need to rely on quick counter attacks. A point would be a great result. A clean sheet would be even better. </p> <p></p> <h2>2. New York Red Bulls vs Toronto FC, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>Last week was just about the worst of times for New York, as the Red Bulls lost their first home game of the season. It didn't help that it was to the East-leading Kansas City, giving Sporting a stronger foothold on the top spot. New York then tried to rebound from that midweek defeat with a win away at New England, and through 90 minutes and change it looked like job done when Joel Lindpere headed home the game's opening goal in a scramble, seemingly giving the visitors the win as the board went up to show four added minutes. Unfortunately the Revolution leveled at the death, robbing the Red Bulls of two vital points and ensuring another season without a win in Foxboro with a swift punch to the gut.</p> <p>Into this weekend, New York has a chance to get back on the right foot against the league's cellar dwellers, Toronto FC. They would have liked to be facing the Toronto side that barely looked like an organized team at the start of the year, but the Canadian champions are a much improved team since then. The big player news is the loss \u2013 again \u2013 of Rafa Marquez, out for another two weeks with a hamstring injury. This may be good news for New York, as they played much better in New England after the Mexican left the game, sliding Dax McCarty into the defensive midfielder role where he has excelled. The Red Bulls desperately need the full compliment of points, not only to ensure their playoff spot and chase down Kansas City, but to get the bad taste of New England out of their mouths. </p> <p><strong>Duncan Fletcher</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wakingthered.com/\">Waking the Red</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Last week things just got worse really for TFC. On a hiding to nothing going into LA, with Eric Hassli added to the injury list, TFC put in a shocking first-half performance that saw LA get a quick three-oal lead that they rode home comfortably enough. TFC got a couple against the run of play to make it closer than it should have been, but when they had to LA had another gear to make it a 4-2 final. Ten games winless now and just waiting to finally be put out of their misery, the most important thing from the LA game for Toronto may well be the status of Richard Eckersley, who left with a possible concussion. </p> <p>Toronto then went to El Salvador for the CCL and beat up on a hopeless CD Aguila side to keep their qualification hopes, and thus the season, technically if not realistically, alive before their final group game against Santos Laguna.</p> <p>After losing to the west-coast glamour boys, it's over to New York this week to take on the Eastern Conference equivalent. I'd like to come up with reasons why this one might turn out different, but if they want it New York's midfield and attack really should run riot against a weak defence and midfield. </p> <p>Paul Mariner will definitely return next year, and I think there's very few players he hasn't already made his mind up about. There's really not much point at all at this stage. Sigh.</p> <p></p> <h2>3. Columbus Crew vs Philadelphia Union, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>The Crew fell 2-1 at Chicago last weekend. Now, Chicago are the probably the hottest team in the league right now, winning seven of their last eight games. So one would think the result was not so unexpected. However, most Crew fans feel greatly dissatisfied, and for good reason. The Crew dominated nearly every stat category and even took an early lead. But a couple of defensive lapses (which are starting to become common) and an inability to put away chances doomed the Boys in Yellow. After the game, Coach Warzycha said the Crew were the better team. I have to disagree. Dominating stats doesn't make you the better side. The attributes that make your squad better include closing down attackers in your defensive third, finishing chances\u2026 basically all of the things Chicago did and Columbus failed to do.</p> <p>Now the Crew find themselves one point behind Houston for the final playoff spot with just four games to go. With matches against Eastern leaders Kansas and a trip to DC coming up, this weekend's match-up against Philadelphia is essentially a must-win. </p> <p>The Crew took care of business a month ago at Philly. But the Union have been improving the whole month of September. They're out of the playoff picture but they seem to be getting their pieces together for an improved 2013 campaign. Last week their offense started to click as Freddy Adu picked up a brace in a win against Houston. </p> <p>This game could be a trap. One team playing for pride (and players looking to keep their jobs), while the other is desperate to keep their playoff hopes alive. But there is no way the Crew loses this game at home. The Philly back line can't contain Higuain and Arrieta, and the Columbus defense will hold off the Union's new 4-4-2 attack: 3-1 Crew.</p> <p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://phillysoccerpage.com/\">Philly Soccer Page</a>:</p> <p>Philadelphia Union surprised many by pulling off a 3-1 home win Sunday over Houston. The Union came into the match with an eight-game winless streak and had scored just four goals in that stretch. Yet Houston did their best to hand Philadelphia the match, surrendering a penalty and repeatedly giving the ball away in dangerous positions. Back-up right-back Raymon Gaddis smoked Houston's defense several times, while regular right-back Sheanon Williams did the same at left-back, where he moved to fill in for the injured Gabriel Farfan. The Union even got a rare bit of luck, as Josue Martinez netted his first MLS goal from what could easily have been called an offside position.</p> <p>Now the Union hope to repeat the feat on the road against a Columbus squad fighting for the fifth playoff spot. The Union have scored just eight goals in 14 road games this year, while Columbus has won their last four home games. Union midfielder Freddy Adu may miss the match due to a quad strain suffered just after he netted the second goal Saturday against Houston, which may give Union manager John Hackworth even more justification to continue experimenting with his lineup. The Union back line is in fine form, but they face a more experienced team led by newly acquired attacking midfielder Federico Higuain, who has been spectacular in his short MLS career so far. As Higuain goes, so will go this match.</p> <p></p> <h2>4. Houston Dynamo vs New England Revolution, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>I've spent the last few minutes staring at my computer, trying to figure out how to answer the question of how the last game went without an endless stream of curse words. Wow, that sucked. From start to finish, that just sucked. The worst part about losing 3-1 to the Union was the simple fact that everyone knew how important that game was and the players simply didn't show up. Kinnear railed on them after the game, apparently \u2013 with a lot of cursing \u2013 and they deserved it. That was a big three points and the Dynamo completely sucked. </p> <p>A bounce back to rival every bounce back in the history of bounce backs... at least that better happen. The Dynamo are back at home, against New England, a team not going to the playoffs. If Houston doesn't win, not only will their playoff hopes be on life support, the fans will be liable to lose their minds. More importantly, I doubt I'll be able to answer these questions next week without cursing... a lot. </p> <p>The Dynamo are going to destroy New England, taking no prisoners. We're talking Rambo III-style blowing up everything up with explosive-tipped soccer balls... at least, they better.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>Well, Lee Nguyen is out for the season. We're pretty much just counting down the days and hoping for the highest draft pick possible. Just another Fall in Revs-Land. </p> <p>If pressed, I suppose the continued progress of Juan Toja is worth a peek. He's getting closer and closer to full fitness and looks like the real deal. Also, you could be catching one of your last glimpses of Benny Feilhaber in a Revs uniform. The former USMNT-er can't even break the first XI at the moment for the Revs and doesn't seem to care much one way or the other. </p> <p>Despite another wretched season, the Midnight Riders are planning a trip to Montreal to see the Revs play at the end of October. Should be fun.</p> <p></p> <h2>5. Vancouver Whitecaps vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 9pm (NBCSN, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>A draw! Our 2-2 draw with Colorado felt like a loss, as we gave up a late goal and the full three points, but after five straight losses a draw is a marked improvement. A listless first half forced Martin Rennie's hand and half-time sub Kenny Miller had an immediate impact, as did our switch to a 4-4-2. While we looked exposed at the back, we were far more dynamic going forward and nabbed two quick goals, including a nice one by Miller. Unfortunately that late goal means we have little breathing room heading into the final few games of the season.</p> <p>Also unfortunate is that our next opponent is Seattle, a team we struggle to beat. They aren't so hot right now, with just one win in their last five games, but they have the nasty habit of beating us or pushing us to a draw. We haven't beaten our Cascadian rivals in MLS, a record we would love to change on Saturday. </p> <p>Rennie has a difficult decision to make for his starting line-up, with no real option on the left (Camilo has been dreadful there) and a team that has created so little playing just one forward. The one bright spot from our recent horrid run is the play of goalkeeper Brad Knighton \u2013 with him in net we'll be competitive, and if our midfield can click we should have a good chance at three points against Seattle. But I would be happy with a draw. </p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Last week was a heartbreaking 2-1 loss to what has proven to be the best team in the MLS regular season, the San Jose Earthquakes. It was a serious letdown, knowing the Supporters Shield is out of reach now and our only shot at returning to CONCACAF in 2013-2014 will, more than likely, be by reaching the MLS Cup final. I still like our odds, knowing that our leading scorer (Eddie Johnson) and playmaker (Mauro Rosales) were out due to yellow card accumulation and injury respectively. The Sounders are clearly a different team without Rosales and as demonstrated last year against Real Salt Lake in the playoffs, we need him to have a legit shot at contending, so he'll need to stay healthy.</p> <p>In the meantime, Johnson and Rosales return just in time for the Sounders to defend the Cascadia Cup by taking a trip up north to Van City to take on the Whitecaps. I don't know what's going on up there or why they can't seem to win lately but it makes me very nervous. Are we a better team than them? Of course. That being said there's something about an injured animal that's fighting for playoff life that would make me prefer to play them later. A draw on the road will simply not suffice, as we need the three points to maintain home field in first round of playoffs and to keep the fate of the Cascadia Cup in our hands. I predict 2-1 Sounders, enabling a potential Clink Field sellout the following week, to defend the cup against Portland.</p> <p></p> <h2>6. Chivas USA vs Real Salt Lake, Sat 10:30PM</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last weekend, Chivas USA finished a road trip in the east with a match against DC United. Despite playing well, the Goats lost their fifth straight match when Branko Boskovic scored his first MLS goal midway through the second half. What hurt matters further was the fact that Chivas were missing three people to suspension: coach Robin Fraser for a second game after being sent off the previous weekend, Oswaldo Minda for yellow-card accumulation and James Riley, who reportedly received a red card after the midweek game. Chivas seem to be finding new ways to lose each match and morale is at a low.</p> <p>This week, Chivas host Real Salt Lake in the season series rubber match. Chivas pulled off a 1-0 upset on the road in the first meeting and then RSL evened the series with an emphatic 3-0 win. Based on form, RSL has to be a heavy favorite in this game, but this is MLS and perhaps Chivas can spring a surprise at home. Although the results have not been favorable, there has to be a little hope, as the team has played better in recent games.</p> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>Real Salt Lake, with a 2-1 win over the Portland Timbers, put paid to fears that their season was somehow spiraling out of control. With the win, the club put forward the longest active playoff streak \u2013 five years \u2013 by qualifying with a meager four matches remaining. Goals from Fabian Espindola and Javier Morales, the first set-piece goals since June, may prove vital in restoring their scoring confidence and form \u2013 and with RSL moving forward to a match against bottom-scrapers Chivas USA, they may be handed a golden opportunity to push such a resurgence further.</p> <p>Chivas USA, with the worst record in MLS's Western Conference, are 10 points back from fifth place and with five games remaining they are nearly eliminated from the playoffs. Even a win on Saturday isn't likely to prove enough, but the slight scent of a chance may give them cause for hope. The Claret-and-Cobalt will need to push forward in attack, confident that the lowest-scoring team in the league won't be too much trouble \u2013 but some real awareness from the midfield, particularly Will Johnson and Ned Grabavoy, will be needed to prevent a counterattacking goal. </p> <p>Chivas, despite their woes this season, can set up very well defensively \u2013 with coach Robin Fraser looking to prove something against his former employers, this one could well come down to the wire.</p> <p></p> <h2>7. Portland Timbers vs DC United, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Michael Orr</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.maofootball.wordpress.com\">Mao Football</a>, host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/soccer-made-in-portland/\">Soccer made in PDX</a> podcast:</p> <p>A 2-1 loss at Real Salt Lake leads the Portland Timbers into their penultimate home game of 2012. In a season where the Timbers have failed to win away from home, it was unsurprising to see the visitors fall behind early to a clearly superior RSL side. Bright Dike's headed goal made things interesting and he should have equalized, if not for the intervention of the crossbar late in the game. And yet the Timbers are very specifically in Caleb Porter mode now. Though another road loss is frustrating to players, coaches and fans, the main objective for the remainder of the season is unchanged \u2013 impress the coach-in-waiting.</p> <p>In 2011, DC United came to Portland and gave the Timbers its first home loss in MLS. Exactly 16 months later, DC is in the playoff hunt while Portland is in extended try-out mode. Apart from Cascadia Cup matches, the Timbers are trying to get as much video on those players whom Porter wants to evaluate. Jobs are on the line, either with the Timbers or elsewhere. </p> <p>That said, a win leading into matches away to Seattle and Vancouver would be a great benefit for Portland. The balance between aiming for positive results and experimenting with players in various positions will come to a head over the season's final month. This has been a poor year for the Timbers and a turbulent offseason awaits. Saturday's game will be one of the final chances for many players to perform in front of the Timbers Army. </p> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United had two matches last week, the first of which was a short ride up the highway to Philadelphia.&#xa0;Ben Olsen tried a different formation with five midfielders and Lionard Pajoy as a lone attacker.&#xa0;With the game tied at 0-0, Olsen worked his substitution magic by pulling Branko Boscovic and inserting Maicon Santos as a second attacker.&#xa0;The move paid off as Santos and Pontius combined to set up Pajoy for the decisive goal against his former team.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sunday saw Chivas USA visit RFK, and again United went with a new starting lineup.&#xa0;While United dictated play, the final third of the field just never clicked and opportunities were wasted.&#xa0;Again, though, Olsen worked his substitution magic, replacing Santos with Bosovic.&#xa0;Minutes later, Pajoy served a ball from the side of the area and Boscovic came through with a courageous diving header from eight yards out and put the ball in the far corner for his first MLS goal, giving United it's third consecutive victory and it's third hero to step up in the absence of DeRosario.</p> <p>The team has put in some very gritty performances of late, and such scratching out of victories could play out well in their psyches.&#xa0;But questions abound:&#xa0;Will United roll out yet another unique starting lineup?&#xa0;Will Olsen continue his substitution magic?&#xa0;Who will be this game's hero?&#xa0;United needs eight points in the remaining four games to guarantee a return to the playoffs, and with only one home game remaining, picking up three in Portland will go a long way towards that goal.</p> <p></p> <h2>8. San Jose Earthquakes vs FC Dallas, Sat 10:30PM</h2> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Presumably Simon Dawkins has never seen The Goonies \u2013 in what seems like a typical Earthquakes game, but played in reverse, he scored so early in Seattle that my butt had barely landed on our sofa. It was a screaming shot into the top right corner, rightly nominated for MLS Goal of the week. </p> <p>The Seattle equalizer came from Steve Zakuani in the 15th \u2013 I would rather he'd waited for his first goal since his broken leg. Earthquakes fans, fidgety that Wondo hadn't scored from open play since July, were reassured when his third goal in four days (his 22nd of the season) restored the lead. The half-time tally of 2-1 became the final score after a second half in which Coach Frank Yallop made defensive substitutions (gasps on our sofa), something unnecessary and untried so far this season. </p> <p>As the Quakes head into the playoffs, it's comforting to know that we can deflect opponents' late pressure and heartening that we could pull off a season sweep against a side as good as Seattle.</p> <p>This weekend the Quakes hope to extend their unbeaten streak in San Jose. In Dallas's favor, they are coming off a bye week, and a recent run of good results has rekindled their playoff hopes \u2013 separated by only two points from Vancouver, they will be looking to snatch that final playoff spot. FC Dallas is fighting for its playoff life, and while the Earthquakes have a place under their belt, they still want the home-field advantage that the Supporters Shield will bring. With Chavez and Salinas back in the mix, the Earthquakes resolve to defend Fortress Buck Shaw through 2012 is strong enough to keep Dallas at bay. </p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>Last week's game against Vancouver was a game I will never forget. The game was 0-0 the entire time. Both teams were giving it everything they had, and after losing George John to what seemed like a catastrophic injury, the game seemed destined to end in heartbreak. Julian de Guzman, however, felt differently and scored a gorgeous goal that would have gotten goal of the week had it not been for Thierry Henry's ridiculous corner. I am still in awe at the skill that went into de Guzman's goal \u2013 the way he chested it down and volleyed it so casually still leaves me shaking my head. He single-handedly kept us alive for that last playoff spot, and for that, I feel like he lent me money and I owe him for it.</p> <p>Next up is a road game against San Jose. We should have our full roster available with the exception of George John \u2013 meaning we'll most likely see Hedges and Pertuz starting in the center. David Ferreira suffered a broken nose in training last week, but says that he'll be ready to play \u2013 which is a relief, seeing as we need all hands on deck to even hope to contend with the conference leaders. To get out of San Jose with points that we desperately need, we're going to have to adopt the same mentality we had in 2010 that got us to our first MLS Cup: refuse to lose. </p> <p></p> <h2>9. Colorado Rapids vs LA Galaxy, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>Oh the agony! It is hard to be either impressed that the 'Pids eked out a draw against the Whitecaps or that they somehow remain alive for a playoff spot and thus will prolong my miserable hope that something will come out of this season. While I love the team I can also admit that they have no place making the playoffs this season \u2013 c'mon Garber, change the format, it's embarrassing. </p> <p>This weekend the Gals pay visit to the home of what used to the be the best dog-racing track in the state... oh and home of the Rapids, Commerce City. On paper this match should be a breeze for Hollywood, but I think the Rapids will extend their hopes of a playoff birth by comprehensibly thrashing the Galaxy. By thrashing the Gals I mean the Rapids score all four goals in the match \u2013 two own goals and two against.</p> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>The LA Galaxy continued their goal-scoring ways, picking up two wonder-strikes from Juninho and two from Robbie Keane. They dominated play going forward and for the most part limited Toronto's attack. The only blemishes, two goals from the visiting team, were more freaks of nature than dangerous goal-scoring opportunities. Nevertheless this was, at one point, a one-goal lead for the defending champions before Keane outmaneuvered TFC's back line to score his second goal in stoppage time and make the final score 4-2.<br> The Galaxy must now turn their attention to finishing this season on a much tougher road than they have traveled earlier in September. The next four games find the Galaxy facing off against Colorado (away), Real Salt Lake, San Jose (away) and Seattle.  With the altitude and the ability of Colorado to always play the Galaxy tough, both the coaching staff and players have listed the game on Saturday as the \"must win\" match of the four. David Beckham looks like he will be ready to play \u2013 back from a left-ankle injury\u2013 and this may be the first time the three designated players could be on the field at the same time since a 4-0 loss to Seattle in early August. </p> <p>Colorado, on the outside of the playoff picture, will be looking to play spoiler as they head down the stretch. It is imperative that LA gets the three road points if they are hoping to hold on to the second spot in the Western Conference.</p>",
  "<p>It's homecoming at Towson University and the Tigers, ranked 12th in the country in the NCAA's Football Championship Subdivision, or FCS, are putting a pounding on St Francis (Pa). </p> <p>St Francis has 28 players on scholarship, compared to its opponent's 63; Towson, a power in college football's second division, makes short work of its guests. By halftime Towson leads 43-14 and the final score is 46-17. Most of the 9,838 fans leave happy. This week, however, the shoe will be on the other foot.</p> <p>Louisiana State University, a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) team, third-ranked in the country and with 85 scholarship athletes and a stadium that seats more than 92,000 people, will play host to Towson, a commuter school from a suburb of Baltimore. LSU, also nicknamed the Tigers, will be an even firmer favorite than Towson was against St Francis. </p> <p>So why is LSU playing Towson? The answer, as is the case in much of college football, is money.</p> <p>Saturday's game in Baton Rouge will be what has come to be known in college football circles as a guarantee game, in which a major-conference team pays a lower-division team basically serving as Christians to be thrown to the bigger school's lions. Or in this case Tigers. </p> <p>According to Mike Waddell, athletic director at Towson, his department will receive $510,000 from LSU for the game. For Waddell's school this is a terribly significant amount of money. For LSU, it is just a drop in the bucket.</p> <p>Mismatches and lopsided scores have always been part of college football. On 7 October 1916, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/65898-georgia-tech-vs-cumberland-college-october-7-1916\">Georgia Tech squeaked by Cumberland 222-0</a>. The coach of that Tech squad was John Heisman, the man for whom the Heisman Trophy is named. </p> <p>A noticeable spike in pay-for-play games began in 2006, when the NCAA allowed teams to play a 12th regular-season game. The logic behind expanding the season was that teams could be more ambitious in scheduling non-conference games that would be appealing to fans, with major programs squaring off against each other. </p> <p>The opposite has happened. In order to be eligible for a bowl game, an FBS team must win at least six games. But one of those wins can be against an FCS team, as long as that FCS team meets certain scholarship requirements.</p> <p>Towson does, and so for each of the last four seasons its Tigers have played against an FBS team. Towson has lost those games by an average score of 42-12. Nonetheless, the Tigers added a second FBS opponent this year \u2013 producing <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8320884/kent-state-golden-flashes-andre-parker-wrong-way-run-grabs-attention\">a 41-21 loss to Kent State</a> for which the school was paid $325,000. Next season, Towson will play at Connecticut; they will take on West Virginia in 2014. </p> <p>Helping Towson's athletic department meet its financial obligations was probably not what the NCAA had in mind when it allowed the season to be expanded.</p> <p>\"When the NCAA first adopted the 12th-game exemption, the conventional wisdom was that it would allow schools greater flexibility to schedule more interesting non-conference match-ups against other top schools,\" said Paul Steinbach, a senior editor at Athletic Business magazine who has written extensively on guarantee games. \"Instead, most of these top teams have used the extra game to just give themselves another payday.\"</p> <p>A recent study by USA Today examined the athletic budgets of all the public universities that are required to release information regarding overall revenues and expenses, plus the amount of money the athletic departments receive as a result of fees paid by all students to help fund sports and state aid provided for athletics over the last five years. Private institutions, such as Notre Dame and Stanford, have no such requirements. </p> <p>The study found that only seven of the 225 public schools for which data was available were able to turn a profit and give money back to the academic mission of the university, without taking state funds or student fees. LSU was one of them \u2013 the others were the University of Texas, the University of Oklahoma, Penn State University, the University of Nebraska, Purdue University and the Ohio State University. </p> <p>From the outside, it always has seemed that a team that participates in a guarantee game is trying to win. But what LSU is really buying is the gate.</p> <p>\"We don't have student fees for athletics and we don't take state aid in the athletic program, yet we have one of the most successful athletic departments in the country,\" says Verge Ausberry, senior associate athletic director at LSU. \"We are lucky in that we have three sports [football, men's basketball and baseball] that make money, whereas most schools only have two. But it all comes down to football, and we need to play at least seven home games a year to come out ahead.\"</p> <p>According to figures that the school reported to the Department of Education, LSU football made $68.5m and reported a profit of $47m following the 2010 season. This was the fourth\u2013best figure in the country; Texas was No1. </p> <p>Games like the one against Towson are part of the reason why LSU is able to be so profitable. When scheduling a game against a school of similar stature a team like LSU would have to negotiate either a much larger payout to the opposing school or agree to return the game in an upcoming season. For example, LSU played Washington of the Pac-12 earlier this year in Baton Rouge, as the second leg of a series that saw the Tigers play the Huskies in Seattle in 2009.</p> <p>\"Tickets for a game like this [Towson] are a little bit cheaper [tickets for the Washington game were $50, while for the game against Towson they are $40], but we always sell out,\" Ausberry said. \"But the concessions and the parking, that's where the department makes its money. And this is a game that you don't have to return. This is just a one-shot deal.\"</p> <p>Towson is a public commuter school outside Baltimore, with an enrollment of over 17,000 undergraduates. The school's football stadium, Johnny Unitas Field \u2013 the Baltimore Colts legend did not attend the school but he had hoped to find it a corporate sponsor in the days before he died \u2013 has a capacity of just over 11,000, which makes it a little less than one-eighth of the size of LSU's Tiger Stadium, which seats 92,562. </p> <p>Prior to last Saturday's game against St Francis, Waddell said he was hoping to make $100,000 if the stadium was close to capacity, which most weeks it isn't. So the LSU payout represents more money than Towson would expect to make from its entire home slate. Add in the Kent State payout, and this has been a banner year \u2013 financially \u2013 for Towson football.</p> <p>\"The costs of scholarships go up, and student fees are flat,\" Waddell said. \"We have to play at least one of these games every year, and our coach has said that he's willing to play anybody, any time, anywhere. So it's off to LSU.\"</p> <p>But it's not all about dollar signs. The team will get to play on national TV, on ESPNU, which is great exposure for a school that most people still call Towson State. (LSU running back Spencer Ware admitted in this week that he didn't even know where the school is located.) Plus, it will be an opportunity for the Towson players to play in an atmosphere unlike anything they have experienced before.</p> <p>\"Everybody gets something out of these games,\" Waddell said. \"I'm not going to speak to what LSU gets, but we get a great recruiting tool and great exposure. I was at a meeting with Fortune 100 leaders for the Baltimore area, and they were talking about Towson football playing LSU. Plus, do you really think that we are going to be intimidated to play against a James Madison or a Delaware after this?\"</p> <p>Waddell speaks the truth. Everybody gets something out of this game. LSU gets an extra home game (eight of its 12 games this season will be played in Baton Rouge) and all that revenues that come with that. Towson gets a giant check and a chance to increase the school's visibility. LSU's players get what amounts to a bye week between tough conference games against Auburn and Florida. Towson's players get a chance to play in front of a gigantic crowd and an opportunity to pull off perhaps the greatest upset in college football history. </p> <p>Guarantee games have produced upsets before. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ujXsiD7AMk\">In 2007, little Appalachian State upset fifth-ranked Michigan 34-32</a>, in one of the most famous college football upsets of all time. (Everybody interviewed for this story brought up that game at least once.) And Towson's coach, Rob Ambrose, talking to his hometown radio crew after last week's game, definitely thought a win was a possibility. </p> <p>\"Hey, they will put 11 on the field, we will put 11 on the field,\" he said. \"If you don't think you are going to win, why bother playing?\"</p> <p>I think we just answered that question, Coach.</p>",
  "<p>At the Lib Dem conference this week I bumped into an old chum, a financial consultant who was as keen as Nick and Vince to blame Gordon Brown and Ed Balls for Britain's debt hangover.

Instead of the system being sponsored by the British Banking Association (BBA), an independent regulator will do the job.</p> <p>Good. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wheatley\" title=\"\">Martin Wheatley</a>, hired from Hong Kong, where he was securities regulator in that very sophisticated market, to head the new Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 part of the breakup of Brown's flawed regulatory regime \u2013 seems to have adopted a robust approach, as outsiders often find it easier to do.</p> <p>He was made redundant at the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 2004 and acquired a tough reputation chasing insider trading in Hong Kong. Now he's back, let's hope he keeps it up. This was a serious failure of cosy BBA governance \u2013 not to mention FSA and Bank of England regulation \u2013 in the face of concerns being expressed about Libor's probity.

Hence the stampede.</p> <p>For its part, Which? is warning that the \u00a310bn which the big banks \u2013 Lloyds, HSBC, RBS and Barclays, all tainted one way or another by the wave of post-bust scandals \u2013 have set aside to deal with the problem may not be enough. No wonder they're not keen to lend to small businesses and others needing funds to help keep the economy afloat.</p> <p>I recently had a minor run-in with Barclays, my own bank since 1963. The details are boring (not to me, of course), but they bounced a savings cheque I'd written on the last day of this financial year because they didn't like the look of my signature. One perfunctory check call was made to my home phone number (we still have one!) \u2013 no answer \u2013 but none made to the Barclay staffer supposed to look after my affairs who later told me the signature looked fine.</p> <p>The money which was supposed to move from Barclays to an Isa stayed with Barclays. I suppose every little counts. I got the brush-off and it wasn't a life-and-death issue as it can be for a struggling small business. At least my complaint was heard \u2013 I expect they know what I do for a living \u2013 and I was told I could take it to the FSA. \" I'd rather chop my arm off,\" I think I replied. The FSA now has 650 staff dealing with PPI claims alone, I'm not going to add to its burdens.</p> <p>Yet I have a niggling bit of sympathy for the banks here. Why? Because in most black-and-white stories with an obvious villain, someone usually escapes lightly. The media, for example, always lets itself off the hook. That's why <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-campaigner-kelvin-mackenzie-video\" title=\"\">ex-Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie is busy</a> demanding an apology from South Yorkshire police for misleading him into printing lies about the Hillsborough dead.

In 2009, the insurance company she worked for said it would not renew her contract \"because of the crisis\", one month before she gave birth to her second child. \"It was like taking the carpet from under my feet.\" The family now gets by on \u20ac600 a month, their diet supplemented by carrots, onions and fruit from her father's allotment.</p> <p>She is not the only one to have reached her limit. Two weeks ago, hundreds of thousands marched in the streets of Lisbon and other cities across the country, in the biggest protest since the end of the dictatorship in 1974. The demonstration forced the prime minister into an embarrassing U-turn over social security reform \u2013 one of the first times a government tied into austerity as part of a bailout programme responded so decisively to popular revolt.</p> <p>On Saturday, demonstrators will gather again to march against the spending cuts they believe have pushed their country deeper into recession. Meanwhile, workers have downed tools in protest over changes to working regulations. At Lisbon's usually busy port this week, the cranes were still, the containers stacked high and the lorries parked up, as dock workers staged one of a series of strikes taking place over a five-week period. Graffiti around the town calls for an end to the cuts, a general strike, and even revolution.</p> <p>The Portuguese are seen to be mild-mannered and accepting compared with their hot-headed Spanish neighbours but, as one trade union veteran noted drily: \"We had a revolution, the Spanish had a transition from dictatorship.\"</p> <p>Pedro Marques, a politician in the opposition Socialist party, sits on the cross-party budget committee and works with the \"troika\" \u2013 the European Central Bank, the EU and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 that bailed out Portugal on condition that it follow a strict programme of budgetary discipline. He wonders how they will respond to the protests in the country previously held up as a poster child for austerity.</p> <p>\"We had that huge demonstration but a week after you had the demonstration in Spain where everyone was arrested. I don't know what impresses the troika more, what is more a sense of despair. We are calm, we abide by the law, but 1 million people in the streets, it is 10% of our population. If they don't see this is a country rising against this approach, what kind of message do we have to give?\"</p> <p>The number of protesters is disputed but, in many ways, the message from Portugal could not be clearer. The rightwing coalition imposed austerity with almost religious zeal. It cut wages, raised taxes, privatised state-owned companies and overhauled labour laws. But still the deficit stays stubbornly high, while the country has sunk into the worst depression since the 1970s.</p> <p>Many of the measures simply backfired. In January, for example, the government raised VAT in restaurants from 13% to 23%, hitting sales and therefore tax revenues almost immediately. What was previously a regular outing for many became far too expensive for a population that had seen its wages cut. Restaurant owners can now be seen staring mournfully out of empty glass-fronted dining rooms as potential customers hurry past.</p> <p>Local manufacturers also suffered. Portuguese companies sell almost 70% of their goods to domestic consumers, many of whom no longer have the money for non-essential items. As companies went bust or sales slumped, so did the government's tax receipts.</p> <p>But the rise in unemployment has been the most shocking. Official figures put the jobless rate at 15.7% but that only accounts for those registered with job centres. Portugal's largest union, the CGTP, says many have given up looking for work and the jobless rate is over 20%, or 1.3 million. That puts a further strain on the public finances, as those who have never been on benefits before become reliant on the state. As a result, many of the savings made through austerity have been wiped out. What's more, Portugal is far from growing its way out of the deficit, with the economy expected to shrink by 3% this year, and another 1% next year.</p> <p>Marques says: \"It's so clear now. In the case of Greece they said that they were not fulfilling their responsibilities. In Portugal they say that we are fulfilling them, but the recession is here anyway. So it is not a problem of the way [austerity is imposed], it is also a problem of the general approach.\" His Socialist party signed up to the troika agreement but says it would implement it less harshly and would promote growth at the same time. Marques admits it is a good time to be in opposition.</p> <p>Even outside the mainstream political parties, few are calling for Portugal to default on its debts and drop out of the euro. Over at the offices of the CGTP, there is a buzz ahead of the demonstration. The phones are down and email is not working. \"This always happens before a big protest,\" says one member conspiratorially.</p> <p>Augusto Pra\u00e7a, international secretary of the union, explains their position. \"If you put the question to leave or not to leave the euro, you don't resolve the problem.\" He says it is a false choice facing the Portuguese, the equivalent of asking someone if they want to die this way, or that way. \"You say no, I don't want either. In this crisis, I think there is another way that they are not putting on the table.\" The CGTP has proposed a package of measures to increase taxes on capital, rather than employees. One of its suggestions is a financial transactions tax of 0.25%, which it says would raise \u20ac2.38bn a year.</p> <p>Pra\u00e7a seems to epitomise the Portuguese reserve. Although apparently a firebrand union leader, he is softly spoken, with a calm, determined manner. The only time he shows a flash of anger is when asked if he feels sorry for the prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho. \"He is a liar,\" he retorts. \"He promised many things he didn't do. He wouldn't raise taxes, wouldn't change salaries, wouldn't create any VAT increases. Nobody believes him today.\"</p> <p>There is a sense of complete distrust in politicians from across the political spectrum. During the protests, people chanted \"thieves\" at the presidential palace and a taxi driver joked that he would take me to \"where the burglars are\", when asked for the parliament building.</p> <p>Tucking into a plate of sushi in a restaurant opposite the gleaming white Assembleia da Rep\u00fablica, Marques agrees that people are fed up with politicians. \"It is a worrying situation, of course. I think that people elect politicians to get their problems resolved. And for about a decade people have seen almost no positive result from political activity. It is too much time with no clear response to their problems.\" But he hails the fact that Portugal has no real far-right party. The extreme left, although strong, is some way from gaining power.</p> <p>For the time being, it seems that Passos Coelho has averted a political crisis by ceding to the demands of the last protest. The demonstration was triggered by a badly thought-out, badly communicated policy, which met with almost universal opposition. Passos Coelho had proposed to raise employees' social security contributions from 11% to 18% of salaries \u2013 equivalent to the loss of a month's pay each year \u2013 while cutting the same tax for companies by almost 6%. The idea was to cut employers' costs and make them more competitive. But it was a gift to the unions who immediately claimed the government was \"robbing workers to pay their bosses\".</p> <p>Even the employers' federations opposed it, saying it would damage morale and further strangle the economy. S\u00e9rgio Silva, 41, who runs his own taxi company, put it bluntly. \"If this happens, my worker says, 'Boss you are very lucky, now you will go to the whorehouse with my money.' But actually my clients will disappear.\"</p> <p>The question now is whether that protest marked a line in the sand; whether this is the point where the mild-mannered Portuguese say enough is enough. Back in Vialonga, Marina's father thinks, if it has not arrived already, that moment is close. \"The thread is pulled very taut at the moment,\" he says. \"It may break very easily \u2013 and very quickly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whether he knows it or not, Lewis Hamilton has taken a step into history. His move to Mercedes-Benz will disappoint those who enjoyed the sight of a British driver in a British team, but he is following in some big wheeltracks.</p> <p>Some will question his motives, accusing him deserting the team that nurtured him from the age of 13 in order to benefit from a deal offering him greater control of his image rights but no guarantee of a race-winning car. From another point of view, however, his decision is potentially a stimulating one for the sport and its fans.</p> <p>Next to Ferrari, Mercedes is the most potent name in motor sport \u2013 and it goes back a lot further in the story of motor racing. A car bearing the three-pointed star won the last grand prix to be held before the first world war in 1914. British drivers have a special connection with the team and Hamilton's arrival will link him to a thread begun before the second world war by Richard Seaman and continued in the 1950s by Stirling Moss.</p> <p>In 1937, at the height of the Silver Arrows' dominance of European racing, Mercedes's management recruited Seaman, then the young star of British motor racing. The 24-year-old's decision was criticised in some quarters, not least by his mother, who did not want him to join a team then subsidised by the National Socialist government, but his victory at the N\u00fcrburgring the following year, when he beat the team's German drivers in their home race, was as significant a step for British motor racing as Bradley Wiggins's Tour de France victory this year was for British cycling.</p> <p>Educated at Rugby, Cambridge and the Brooklands track, Seaman was the very model of the debonair pre-war racing driver. In 1939, however, he was killed when his car hit a tree and caught fire during the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa. He had been leading the race when the accident occurred.</p> <p>Sixteen years later the team recruited Moss to race alongside Juan Manuel Fangio, the reigning world champion, in a team whose dominance was reflected in their ability to fill all the places on the podium. Vastly impressed by the team's unmatched attention to detail, Moss followed in the great Argentinian's tracks for much of the 1955 season but on a memorable afternoon at Aintree he became the first home driver to win the British Grand Prix, with Fangio a short head behind. In one of the legendary drives of motor racing history, Moss also won the classic Mille Miglia in a Mercedes sports car.</p> <p>The tragedy at Le Mans that year, when 82 people were killed after one of the team's cars ploughed into the crowd, prompted Mercedes to withdraw at the end of the season. Their gradual return to Formula One began in the early 1990s, when they began to supply engines to various teams \u2013 including McLaren.</p> <p>Two years ago they bought the Brawn team and renamed it, giving Michael Schumacher the opportunity to make his comeback. Although their performances to date have yet to live up to their past achievements, a top\u2011quality technical team based at Brackley in Northamptonshire and led by Ross Brawn should be capable of providing Hamilton with the equipment he needs.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten that Hamilton is not exactly stepping into unknown territory. Every one of his 20 grand prix victories has been achieved with a Mercedes engine in his car. He knows the company and is well aware of the quality of their engineering. He and his manager, Simon Fuller, will also have been influenced by the power of their marketing department to enhance his image around the world.</p> <p>Like every major manufacturer venturing into motor sport, Mercedes is subject to the fluctuations of the marketplace. A bad couple of years for worldwide sales of its saloons and 4x4s could prompt a reassessment of its involvement. But Hamilton must has been given reassurance, at the very highest level, of its commitment over the foreseeable future.</p> <p>As far as the sport's box-office appeal is concerned, a shake-up is seldom a bad thing. Hamilton gets the chance to step out of a comfortable environment and test himself in a different setting. Mercedes have a driver who will pressure them to deliver the goods.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McLaren are recruiting the bright young talent of Sergio P\u00e9rez to set alongside the experience of Jenson Button. Bernie Ecclestone will not be alone in rubbing his hands with glee at the thought of the interest that will be generated by the reshuffle at the first race of 2013.</p>",
  "<p>What is the new lord chancellor going to do about judicial pensions? That was the first question I was asked by various judges I happened to meet after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/04/chris-grayling-justice-secretary-non-lawyer\" title=\"\">Chris Grayling's appointment was announced</a> earlier this month. Would he press ahead with his predecessor's plans to reduce the real value of judges' pay and pensions?</p> <p>That question will certainly be on the minds of senior judges as they crowd into a locked courtroom to be briefed by the lord chief justice at the start of the new legal term. Members of the judiciary will be hardly be reassured by a <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article3549618.ece\" title=\"\">recent news report</a> that Grayling is unlikely to make many concessions.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, he would not want to be seen by his party as more sympathetic to the judges than Ken Clarke. And yet that's exactly the approach Grayling should be taking now. Otherwise, it will become ever more difficult to persuade the very best lawyers to become judges.</p> <p>From a constitutional point of view, the most interesting question is whether any of the judges will take the lord chancellor to court. Might they seek judicial review of his expected decision to cut the value of judges' pensions by requiring the judiciary to make further contributions?</p> <p>Legal action has been under serious consideration, even though those ruling on any such claim might be seen as judges in their own cause. It's arguable that judges had a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_expectation\" title=\"\">legitimate expectation</a>\" that their pensions would not be cut after they had joined the bench. It's even arguable that judges' remuneration is part of the \"support necessary to enable them to exercise their functions\" that the lord chancellor \"must have regard to\" under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/4/section/3\" title=\"\">Constitutional Reform Act 2005</a>.</p> <p>But how would it be possible to assemble a court whose members might not stand to benefit from their own decision? One option, I suppose, would be to bring in recently-retired judges, who are already drawing their pensions. But they would still be worse off as a result of the government's proposals. Another option would be for any claim to be brought by circuit judges or by part-time judges rather than by judges of the high court, whose colleagues would decide the case.</p> <p>Whatever the answer, it would be rash for the lord chancellor to assume that judges are the only members of society who cannot bring claims in the courts. Judges have <a href=\"http://www.thelawyer.com/daily-telegraph-apologises-to-sedley-lj-over-defamatory-allegations/1007207.article\" title=\"\">sued for libel</a> and a family judge has recently made <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2173751/Mr-Justice-Mostyn--50m-court-battle-derailed-judge-criticises-lawyers-represented-ex-wife.html\" title=\"\">full use of the divorce courts</a>. For the background to this unseemly row, we need to look at the latest <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm82/8297/8297.pdf\" title=\"\">annual report</a> of the review body on senior salaries, published in March. The <a href=\"http://www.ome.uk.com/Senior_Salaries_Review_Body.aspx\" title=\"\">SSRB</a>, as it's called, advises the lord chancellor on the remuneration to be paid to the judiciary. We see from the report that judges' salaries have not been increased since April 2009. The government has also rejected advice from the SSRB last year to correct various anomalies and ensure that judges' posts are properly graded in time for an expected pay increase of 1% next year.</p> <p>But that's nothing compared with its plans for pensions. Actuarial evidence indicates that pensions are worth between 35 and 40% of salary to individual judges. However, this was calculated before the government changed the way it uprated public-sector pensions, replacing the retail prices index (RPI) with the less-generous consumer prices index (CPI).</p> <p>Estimates received by the SSRB indicate that</p> <blockquote> \"the average gap in the long term between RPI and CPI will be 1.4 percentage points, so after the first year of retirement (when this change of uprating takes effect) pensions are likely to be worth on average 1.4 per cent less each year than if they had been uprated by RPI. This would imply that the pension is likely to be worth almost 25 per cent less after 20 years of uprating by CPI rather than RPI.\" </blockquote> <p>So the longer you live, the more you lose.</p> <p>And then there are to be higher contributions. These would work out at 6.4% of salary for full-time judges, according to the SSRB.</p> <p>What effect will this have? The heads of the judiciary in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland \"all expressed concern that changes to the pension scheme could lead to recruitment problems\", the SSRB reported.</p> <blockquote> \"In addition, evidence from across the judiciary suggested that a decrease in the value of the pension would impact adversely on motivation and that the current uncertainty was already lowering the morale and motivation of our remit group.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">judicial appointments board</a> for Scotland found itself unable to fill a vacancy at the level equivalent to the high court of England and Wales. And there were concerns in Northern Ireland that a recruitment exercise \"might fail to secure the necessary calibre of candidate\".</p> <p>The judicial appointments commission for England and Wales has always managed to attract sufficient candidates in the past, it says. However, the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, told the SSRB this year that he felt the goal should always be to \"recruit the best possible candidates\" at every level of the judiciary and that the combination of the pay freeze and the changes to the pension scheme might affect future recruitment. Judge added that the government needed to show that it valued the judiciary by at least maintaining the level of remuneration in real terms, particularly for the high court. Appropriate reward and public respect for the office were important to encourage the best candidates to apply, he explained.</p> <p>Knowing Guardian readers as I now do, I'm sure that some will respond that judges are already paid a lot of money, that they are better off than the many lawyers who have lost their jobs in the recession, and that they all should be prepared to take a pay cut in the national interest. Perhaps that's Grayling's view too.</p> <p>But the road to a full-time judicial appointment is a one-way street. By convention, you can't return to life as a solicitor or barrister. And it's simply not fair to cut people's pay by a quarter or more once they have passed the point of no return.</p> <p>Even if you don't care about the judges as individuals, ask yourself whether you care about the judiciary as the one institution in British public life that still commands a measure of respect. This is how the SSRB put it:</p> <blockquote> Our legal system \u2013 and the wider state \u2013 cannot function properly in the absence of judges with the necessary levels of skill, knowledge and motivation. This means that the total reward for judicial posts must be sufficient to ensure that suitable candidates are attracted to judicial office. We are approaching the third consecutive year of a pay freeze for the judiciary \u2026 This freeze is happening at a time when inflation is high and changes to national insurance rates and tax allowances mean that take-home pay for judges has reduced. Our evidence suggests that this, combined with the uncertainty surrounding changes to the pension scheme, could be damaging recruitment as well as retention and motivation within the judiciary. <br> </blockquote> <p>Speak to senior lawyers these days and they'll tell you how relieved they are not to have taken a judicial post. Many of those who have joined the judiciary at senior level, giving up the opportunity of much higher earnings at the bar, feel they have been double-crossed by a government that has moved the goalposts. And those who would be willing to stay on find themselves forced to retire at 70, when many appeal judges are still at the height of their powers.</p> <p>Asked at his <a href=\"http://t.co/wnFuMXgj\" title=\"\">annual news conference</a> on Thursday whether he thought he could reach agreement with Grayling on judicial pensions, the lord chief justice said he hoped so. \"I see no reason at all why we should not have a sensible discussion about these issues,\" he added. \"The proposals from the lord chancellor about judicial pensions came to us in July and there has to be a long conversation about it.\" But negotiating with the lord chancellor in public would be \"totally inappropriate and indeed somehow rather disrespectful\".</p> <p>Grayling would be well advised to have a sensible discussion with the lord chief justice and do a deal that the judges' shop steward might be able to sell to his troops. The SSRB report offers the lord chancellor an opportunity to meet some of the judges' legitimate concerns without increasing the government's overall pay-bill.</p> <p>Otherwise, there will be a long-term decline in the quality of the judiciary, with appointments going only to second-rate lawyers. Grayling will have moved on long before this becomes apparent. But he may go down in history as the lord chancellor who allowed the decline of the judiciary to begin on his watch. If that happens, we shall all be the poorer.</p>",

Only one entry is permitted per person.</p> <p>8 .The Competition commences at 9am on 1 October 2012 and closes at 11.59pm on 31 December 2012. Entries received after that date and time will not be considered. The Promoters reserve the right in their absolute discretion to extend the closing date for a reasonable period of time where an insufficient number of the entries received have satisfied the entry and judging criteria.</p> <p>9. You own the copyright to your Competition entry as its author. If another person has filmed Your entry, You warrant that you have received an assignment of all associated copyright to that entry from that person. The Promoters may ask to see evidence of that assignment at any time.</p> <p>10. By submitting an entry to the Competition, You give the Promoters:</p> <p>a. Permission for your entry to be published on guardian.co.uk (\"the GNM Site\") and grant the Promoters a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to use and publish your Competition entry in electronic format (including on the Promoters' websites) and hard copy (including in the Promoters' publications), both as a full video and as screen shots, for purposes connected with the Competition, and the GNM Student Network, and to adapt the entry to enable such publication (including to shorten or edit it for such purposes), and you hereby irrevocably waive, for the benefit of the Promoters, all moral rights in the entry to which you are entitled.</p> <p>b. The right to use your name, photograph and town or city of residence for the sole purpose of identifying You as the author of your entry and/or as a finalist or winner of the Competition.</p> <p>11. Your entry must only feature You (and, if appropriate, other people aged 16 and over with their express permission), must be Your own work, must not be copied, must not contain any third-party materials and/or content (including background music) that You do not have permission to use, must not promote Your own or third party goods or services or include any trade marks (other than those belonging to the Promoters), and must not show inappropriate or dangerous behaviour, or otherwise be obscene, defamatory, distasteful, offensive, or in breach of any applicable legislation or regulations, or in breach of any confidentiality obligations owed by you to third parties. If We have reason to believe your entry is not your own work, if a person objects to the inclusion of a video in which they are featured being included in the Competition, or if your entry otherwise breaches this paragraph 11, then We may not consider it and may disqualify it.</p> <p>12. We may also disqualify Your entry if You do not meet the entry criteria, You are not eligible to enter the Competition, You cannot be contacted or You do not respond within 5 days of being contacted by Us in relation to your entry. In the event of disqualification, we may select a new longlisted entry, runner up or winner in accordance with the selection processes below.</p> <h2>Picking the longlisted entries, runners up and winner </h2> <p>13. A panel of judges from the Promoters, including an independent judge will on 22 January 2013 choose twenty longlisted entries from all the valid Competition entries using the criteria in paragraph 17 below. The Promoters will notify the longlisted entrants within one week of that date and request verification of their eligibility to enter the competition.</p> <p>14. All longlisted entries will be posted on the GNM Site from 29 January 2013. From that date until 11.59pm on 26 February 2013, members of the public may vote for their favourite longlisted entry. Members of the public will only be allowed to vote once. The four finalists will be the four entries that have obtained the most independent votes. If two or more entries receive the same number of votes and tie for first, second, third or fourth place, all such entries will become finalists.</p> <p>15. A panel of judges, including a judge independent of the Promoters, will assess the entries of the finalists on 20 March 2013 and select the winner using the criteria in paragraph 17 below.</p> <p>16. A Live Final event will be held on 20 March 2013 at GNM's premises in London. All four finalists will be invited to attend, along with one guest each. Finalists will be given more details about the Live Final nearer the time, but at that event the finalists will be required to give a short presentation to the judges on the ideas behind their video and why they chose their topic. The overall winner will be announced at the event. The other finalists shall be the runners-up. If a finalist is unable to attend the event they will no longer be eligible to win and a new replacement finalist may be chosen who has received the next most amount of independent votes.</p> <p>17. When choosing the longlisted entries, runners up and subsequently the winner, the judges will be looking for entrants who are clearly on top of their subject, who can explain what's important about it in a very short time, who deliver with verve and passion, and who leave us wanting to find out more. The judges' decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.</p> <p>18. Full details of the judging process and the judges are available on request to students@guardian.co.uk.</p> <h2>The Prizes</h2> <p>19. One winner will win a cash prize of \u00a39,000 to pay for tertiary education fees and student living costs. This amount is currently sufficient to pay the maximum full year's fees for a UK national in a UK university; for students paying a lower tuition fee, the balance can be used for other costs directly relating to their education.</p> <p>20. Three runners up will each win a voucher for Oxford University Press books of their choice to the value of \u00a3250.</p> <p>21. The winner will be notified by The Promoters on the night of the Live Final. If a winner rejects their prize, then the winner's prize will be forfeited and The Promoters shall be entitled to select another winner.</p> <p>22. The prizes will be sent to the runners up by the Promoters by 6 April 2013. The winner's prize will be paid within 14 days of the Promoters' receipt of confirmation from the winner that s/he is either:</p> <p>a. already enrolled and participating in a course at a UK tertiary institution as at the date of the Live Final; or</p> <p>b. (in the case of a student who had applied for a place at a UK tertiary institution but was not yet enrolled) now enrolled and participating in a course at a UK tertiary institution for the autumn term 2013.</p> <p>The winner shall provide the Promoters with any reasonably required supporting evidence to this effect. If the winner does not meet this eligibility requirement, s/he shall be disqualified and the prize shall be shared in equal parts between the runners up, provided each also meets this eligibility criteria.</p> <p>23. The prize cannot be exchanged or transferred by You and cannot be redeemed by You for any other prize.</p> <p>24. We retain the right to substitute runners up prizes with other prizes of similar value in the event that the original books chosen by the runner up are not available.</p> <h2>Some other rules </h2> <p>25. Entries on behalf of another person will not be accepted and joint submissions are not allowed. Entries must be made by the authorised account holder of the email address submitted.</p> <p>26. We take no responsibility for entries that are lost, delayed, misdirected or incomplete or cannot be delivered or entered for any technical or other reason. Proof of delivery of the entry is not proof of receipt.</p> <p>27. Details of the winners can be obtained by sending a stamped addressed envelope to the following address: Very Short Film Competition, Guardian Students desk, Guardian News &amp; Media Limited, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.</p> <p>28.

  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">melting sea ice</a>, extreme weather and continued warnings from leading scientists on the need to tackle climate change, it beggars belief that the coalition government persists in pushing though policies that will increase the nation's reliance on dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels.</p> <p>But with the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/annual_conference_2012\" title=\"\">Labour party conference</a> starting on Sunday, it's also time to ask; why isn't the opposition doing more to champion the environment?</p> <p>Last week Ed Miliband \u2013 a man who really understands the issues - <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5j8Z5M4Jl4E7CHFB-N-SodVgaXnrw?docId=N0312291348225380480A\" title=\"\">made a timely and extremely welcome intervention on the debate</a>. He gave his backing to the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">government's official climate adviser</a> and said that the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill</a> must contain a clear commitment to decarbonise the UK power system by 2030.</p> <p>This is a crucial contribution that challenges government policy - championed by the chancellor, George Osborne - for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">a new dash for gas</a> that would leave the UK hooked on this costly fossil fuel for decades. It will also increase pressure on the Liberal Democrats, and help solidify <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-green-promises\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's resolve to hold the Conservatives to their promises on the environment</a>.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">David Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest government ever</a>, the past two-and-a-half years have seen environmental policies shunted into the margins of policy-making.</p> <p>The coalition would find it harder to disregard the environment and the need to build a strong low-carbon economy if Labour put the issue high on the political agenda. During the last parliament, Cameron's support for the Climate Change Act was pivotal in persuading the then Labour government to put their weight behind it. If we really are going to build the low-carbon future that we so urgently need, it's time for Labour to step up to the plate.</p> <p>For Labour, championing the environment is a real opportunity to drive an electoral juggernaut into the political space left by a right-lurching Conservative party and a Liberal Democrat party so far failing to hold the line on environmental action.</p> <p>Yet Labour's Treasury team has woefully failed to challenge Osborne's flawed economic strategy. As the chancellor has steadily undermined the green economy and shown increasing support for gas and oil, the silence from Ed Balls has frequently been deafening.</p> <p>Where has the shadow chancellor been when Osborne has pushed for policies that prop up the discredited broken carbon-dependent economy of the last century and undermine investment in a cleaner future?</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/07/green-or-growth-is-a-false-choice-%E2%80%93-cbi-chief/\" title=\"\">the CBI calculated</a> that the green economy provided one-third of all growth in 2010, and estimated that it could add 0.5% to growth in 2012 if only the government \"put the right policies in place\". With the Bank of England forecasting zero growth this year, 0.5% is not to be sniffed at.</p> <p>But that potential 0.5% is also a better type of growth \u2013 one that provides firm foundations for future prosperity. Investing in wind, waves and sun, and energy saving would create tens of thousands of new jobs and business opportunities right across the country, not just in a few favoured locations. And weaning the nation off expensive gas and reducing energy demand will help cash-strapped households struggling with rocketing fuel bills - unlike just making it easier for them to build conservatories.</p> <p>Balls would find an easy win if he used his despatch box attacks to really get Osborne on the ropes over the misleading economy versus environment narrative \u2013 and his failure to support a green economy that's currently growing in its own right at over four per cent each year. Surely, the green economy is an extraordinary political opportunity for Labour?</p> <p>But, rather astonishingly the CBI appears to be more outspoken on the need for green growth than the shadow chancellor.</p> <p>Earlier this year CBI boss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">John Cridland attacked the lack of government support for the growing green economy</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"The UK has made a great start tapping into green economic opportunities but mixed signals from the government are setting the UK back. If we can't be sure that the policies of today will still be the policies of tomorrow, we simply won't build business and consumer confidence or secure the investment we need.\" </blockquote> <p>We will never capitalise on the promise of our burgeoning green economy or avert the worst excesses on climate change, unless politicians are prepared to stand up and be counted both in opposition and in government.</p> <p>Tackling climate change isn't a luxury, it's a necessity \u2013 and with the key levers of government power in the hands of a proudly anti-green chancellor we desperately need Labour to be the greenest opposition ever.</p>",
  "<p>For four decades the economist Sir Andrew Crockett, who has died aged 69 after suffering from pancreatic cancer, sought to improve the interaction between the real economy and the financial system. A public servant working through international institutions, he made major contributions to policy analysis, to understanding global economic challenges and to harnessing co-operation in the cause of stability.</p> <p>In 1972, Andrew went to the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\" title=\"International Monetary Fund\">International Monetary Fund</a> in Washington as PA to its managing director, Johannes Witteveen (as Andrew's successor, I got to know him well). The following year, the oil-exporting countries of Opec increased their prices to such an extent that while they were amassing surpluses, the economies of Europe and North America \u2013 their principal customers \u2013 were severely threatened. Andrew helped devise the innovative recycling of petrodollars back to the countries in deficit to help maintain global activity. When, later in his 17-year stay, he became involved in research, he transformed the IMF's World Economic Outlook report into a compelling expression of the organisation's policy message.</p> <p>After four years as an executive director of the Bank of England, he went to Basel as general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (1994-2003) \u2013 the central bankers' bank. At a time when its role and influence were in question, he extended its reach from its European roots to embrace the emerging economies, consolidated its hosting of key international regulatory committees and encouraged its development of macroprudential analysis, evaluating the vulnerability to risk of the whole financial system, long before it became fashionable.</p> <p>His most lasting contribution came through the creation in 1999 of the Financial Stability Forum, enlarged in 2009 into the <a href=\"http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/\" title=\"Financial Stability Board\">Financial Stability Board</a>. This was born out of his awareness that finance ministers, supervisors and central banks held their own policy discussions in separate silos, largely ignorant of the thinking going on in other parts of the system. This resulted not only in incomplete and potentially flawed analysis, but also in the absence of follow-up and implementation, whether by the international standard-setters or by national governments, of the policy measures shown to be necessary by analysis. As its first chair (1999-2003), Andrew embedded collaborative ways of working that proved indispensable in the financial crisis later in the decade, and are now at the core of international decision-making.</p> <p>Born in Glasgow, and possessed of typically Scottish qualities of modesty, integrity and a capacity for prudent stewardship, Andrew gained degrees at Queens' College, Cambridge and Yale. In his first post, at the Bank of England (1966-72), he was a junior but key member of the team that brought about fundamental changes in the conduct of monetary policy, notably through the competition and credit control reforms of 1971. As the Bank's international director, following his return from the US, he was heavily engaged in helping craft the European exchange-rate infrastructure that culminated in the Maastricht treaty (1992). Irrespective of the political climate, and as for much of the rest of his career, he aimed to provide impartial, pragmatic advice on what would work and what would not.</p> <p>His name was mentioned both in relation to the managing directorship of the IMF and the governorship of the Bank of England, but both roles eluded him. His appointment to either job might have made a difference in the last decade, given his knowledge of the links between financial imbalances, the real economy and financial crises. From 2003, the year he was knighted, he was president of JP Morgan International, acting as an ambassador for the bank and interpreting the official and commercial worlds to each other. This ability grew more valuable as the financial crisis started to take hold.</p> <p>Highly articulate and adept at conveying complex ideas, Andrew was also a great raconteur when among friends. He was consistent in the candour, warmth, humour and personal concern he displayed to others, whether junior colleagues or heads of state.</p> <p>In 1966 he married Marjorie Hlavacek. She survives him, as do their children, Sandy, Keith and Inja.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Andrew Duncan Crockett, economist and public servant, born 23 March 1943; died 3 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Why is the Scottish Labour leadership so abysmal? Why has it struggled to adapt to post-devolution Scottish politics, and why does it keep having rings run around it by the SNP?</p> <p>For example, by any reasonable definition, Johann Lamont's <a href=\"http://news.stv.tv/politics/191807-labour-leader-johann-lamont-demands-end-to-something-for-nothing-culture/\" title=\"\">policy announcement on Tuesday</a> was a train wreck. After Iain Gray's lacklustre, <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/iain-gray-urged-to-say-sorry-after-ethnic-cleansing-gaffe-sparks-diplomatic-row-1-1523919\" title=\"\">gaffe-prone</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13312883\" title=\"\">election-losing</a> leadership, pro-Labour pundits had persuaded themselves that Lamont was quite a heavyweight Scottish Labour leader. They should be face-palming. The policy implications of Lamont's speech \u2013 ending universal benefits, raising tuition fees, cutting free prescriptions \u2013 were bad enough. The atrocious, reactionary soundbites, demanding an end to \"something for nothing\" culture, were worse. And it was all delivered in a colliding procession of clich\u00e9s and non-sequiturs, with faltering speech, and without conviction.</p> <p>Lamont's follow-up interview with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby went no better. She fluffed her lines, struggling to remember that it was NHS computer systems that were wasteful and an obvious area for cuts: naturally enough, since it is an entirely forgettable argument. Ponsonby was admiring enough to call Lamont's speech \"brave\" and \"almost Blairite in substance\". It is certainly Blairite; but if it is brave, then so are lemmings. Outside Scotland, this policy would merely be a gift to the Tories, by corroborating their arguments for welfare cuts. In Scotland, it reminds ex-Labour voters why they defected to the SNP: as a defensive shield against such policies.</p> <p>There may be some pragmatic realpolitik at work in this policy. Lamont is the latest in a sequence of weak Scottish Labour leaders, who needs the backing of her party. She cannot outflank the SNP to the left on public services and welfare. Though the SNP's policies, such as no tuition fees, and free prescriptions, are extremely moderate, they press to the limits of the neoliberal constraints accepted by all the main parties. Labour, unwilling to break these constraints, attacks the SNP on priorities. Lamont's tactic, therefore, is to imply that SNP freebies are benefits for the rich, and that they are frivolous in an age of austerity, as they deprive local government, hospitals or higher education of necessary funding.</p> <p>A cuts agenda vaguely articulated in the language of class resentment and protecting \"frontline services\" would satisfy Balls and Miliband, and play well with cash-strapped local Labour councils, thus uniting powerful sections of the party behind Lamont's leadership. But it clearly wasn't thought through even on this cynical level. You cannot stutteringly vaunt \"tough choices\" one minute, and weakly refer to cutting wasteful referendum spending the next. It gives the impression of being all mouth and trousers.</p> <p>Part of Labour's problem is that it is blinded by hostility to the SNP. In practical policy terms, it has few real differences with the SNP, with the major exception of independence. And even there, a tacit convergence around \"devo max\", devolving all powers to Scotland barring foreign and defence policy, is very plausible. Labour's hatred is so toxic because of the threat that the SNP represents to their monopolistic control of working-class heartlands. Whereas the SNP tactfully preserved some of the reforms made by the Labour-Liberal coalition, Labour consistently shoots itself in the foot by adopting the most hardline anti-SNP postures. Its lapse into belligerent, uncompromising Unionism is a case in point.</p> <p>Scottish Labour's unionism is another part of the explanation. The party doesn't just believe in the union for pragmatic reasons to do with preserving its electoral future. A post-British Labour party is a regional party in a much-diminished capitalist power. Labour's whole strategy for implementing any form of social democracy depends on the unity and power of the British state, its international competitiveness, its permanent membership of the UN security council, its role in Nato, and so on. That is how they expect to deliver the growth to pay for public services, however emaciated.&#xa0;Scottish Labour thus cannot embrace a growth formula for Scotland that is markedly different from, or detached from, that operating in Westminster. Unless it accepts the logic of independence, it must try to bring Holyrood policy into line with London.&#xa0;Ironically, the straitjacket imposed by unionism in its neoliberal phase is one of the factors boosting popular support for independence.</p> <p>Scottish Labour is thus caught in a vicious circle. The more it suffers electorally, the more it loses whatever political talent it has accumulated. It moves from disaster to disaster, from Alexander to Gray to Lamont. The more the SNP demolishes it, the more bitterly hostile Scottish Labour becomes, and the less rationally it responds to its crisis. The more it loses its working-class base and becomes dependent on an active middle-class membership, the more the Blairites gain control, and the less it seems interested in regaining its lost base. The point at which the vicious circle becomes a death spiral, however, has just moved much closer.</p>",

  "<p>Muse have revealed the extent to which US politicians and political pundits have attempted to appropriate their music. In an interview to be published in the Observer on Sunday, singer Matt Bellamy discusses Fox News presenter Glenn Beck's embrace of their 2009 album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/8411a4db-e104-4e45-995f-24b2f1849437\" title=\"\">The Resistance</a> and the use of their hit single Uprising in rightwing conspiracy videos on YouTube.</p> <p>\"In the US the conspiracy theory subculture has been hijacked by the right to try to take down people like Obama and put forward rightwing libertarianism,\" Bellamy said. Defining himself as \"a left-leaning libertarian \u2013 more in the realm of Noam Chomsky,\" he added: \"Uprising was requested by so many politicians in America for use in their rallies and we turned them down on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>Bellamy added that when writing lyrics, his motives are more therapeutic than polemical. \"When I dabble in watching the news and reading about current events I tend to get a future negative view and that's something I've dealt with through music,\" he said. \"It's quite possible I'm slightly paranoid. But I'd say making music is an expression of feelings of helplessness and lack of control that I think a lot of people can relate to.\"</p> <p>Conservative pundit Beck is <a href=\"http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/02/14/glenn-beck-muse-revolution/\" title=\"\">a long-standing fan of the Devon band</a>, despite their labelling him previously as \"a crazy rightwinger\".</p> <p>Muse's new album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/27/muse-the-2nd-law-review\" title=\"\">The 2nd Law</a> is released on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Teachers accused of committing criminal offences involving children at their school will be granted anonymity under regulations which come into force next week.</p> <p>Under the restrictions the married teacher Jeremy Forrest, who has gone <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/megan-stammers-teacher-father-appeal\" title=\"\">missing in Europe with his 15-year-old student</a> Megan Stammers, might not have been identified.</p> <p>The provisions, introduced under section 13 of the Education Act 2011, mean teachers will become the first group to receive automatic anonymity when accused of a certain category of criminal offences. Once the teacher has been charged he or she can be identified.</p> <p>Police, the media or anyone else would have to apply to a court to have the reporting restrictions lifted. Critics have warned the restrictions could hinder police appeals and searches for missing suspects.</p> <p>The anonymity relates to any complaint made by, or on behalf of, any pupil at the school at which the individual teaches. Section 13 of the act imposes reporting restrictions on \"the publication of any information that would identify a teacher who is the subject of an allegation of misconduct that would constitute a criminal offence where the alleged victim of the offence is a registered pupil at the school\". \"Such restrictions would remain in place unless or until the secretary of state or the General Teaching Council for Wales publishes information about an investigation or decision in a disciplinary case arising from the allegation, or proceedings for the offence have been instituted.\"</p> <p>Bob Satchwell, executive editor of the Society of Editors, condemned the provisions as an attack on free speech. \"It will be a criminal offence for anyone \u2013 pupil, parent, police, school, local authority, whistleblower, media \u2013 even to inform parents or the general public that an identified teacher has admitted that the allegation is true and has resigned, has been disciplined, or even cautioned for the offence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Although we acknowledge teachers' fears about false accusations, the most important issue is surely to protect children. Malicious allegations by pupils are extremely rare and, alongside this, the laws of libel, contempt and confidence already restrict newspapers from repeating and publishing unsubstantiated accusations.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It is well-meaning legislation where ministers have accepted an argument by teaching unions that some teachers' lives can be seriously damaged by inaccurate accusations. But in trying to solve that problem, they're actually causing a bigger problem. It's the law of unintended consequences. They're trying to do something which is right, but in doing so they've made the situation worse.\"</p> <p>Parents would be banned even from discussing the allegations with their neighbours or other parents with children at the school, Satchwell said.</p> <p>The accused teacher could be disciplined, sacked and move on, but unless they were charged with a criminal offence, no one could name them and the new school might not be allowed to know there had been a problem, he said.</p> <p>The penalty for breaching the anonymity is a fine of up to \u00a35,000. During the passage of the bill, the government argued that anonymity was necessary to protect teachers from the \"devastating consequences\" of malicious accusations by pupils, even though it was pointed out that only 2% of allegations against teachers turned out to be malicious, and pupils had made 15 malicious claims in the previous few years.</p>",
  "<p>In my first month <a href=\"http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2012/09/04/new-leader,-natalie-bennett,-talks-about-her-vision-for-the-green-party/\" title=\"\">as the new Green party leader</a>, I've spent lots of time talking about pressing economic and social issues - the need for the minimum wage to be a living wage, how benefits should be available to all who need them, and how costly and destructive the privatisation of the NHS will be.</p> <p>But with the government's <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill on the horizon</a>, serious questions around the coalition's wobbly-looking commitment not to subsidise new nuclear, and <a href=\"http://stophinkley.org/PressReleases/pr120917.pdf\" title=\"\">an anti-nuclear protest at Hinkley Point on 8 October</a>, I've also spent lots of my time explaining why I think renewable energy - wind, solar and, in the future, tide and wave - combined with energy conservation, provide an excellent way forward for British energy.</p> <p>I talk about the fact that the first two are technologies that are ready to scale up right now, providing jobs and affordable supplies for Britain. And about the fact that we know exactly what all of their \"fuel\" supplies will cost indefinitely into the future - ie nothing.</p> <p>I talk about the way they can provide a decentralised, resilient energy system that is able to withstand climate or other shocks. And I discuss how nuclear is a distraction from the need to promote and invest in renewables.</p> <p>Fuelled by a fierce and well-funded industry lobby claiming that nuclear would address the dire, if exaggerated, warnings about \"the lights going out\", as well as the urgent need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the nuclear idea has gained some traction recently in the UK.</p> <p>So I think it is worth spending a little time talking about why nuclear power is the Betamax of the energy world - a technology that was briefly in the hunt, but now could be ready to fade away into a museum curiosity. And you don't have to just believe me on this - consider <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ECONOMIST0915.jpg\" title=\"\">this recent front page</a> from the Economist.</p> <p>First, it is immensely and unpredictably expensive. Even a group called Supporters of Nuclear Energy is <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/9543057/No-nuclear-power-at-any-price-says-lobby-group.html\" title=\"\">now questioning</a> the cost of nuclear to the UK. Paying \u00a3165/MWh for power from Hinkley Point would make new nuclear more costly than either onshore or offshore wind - a cost that would be felt in the pockets of millions of already hard-stretched British households.</p> <p>The two European Pressurised Reactors, as proposed for Britain, now being built in Finland and France, are both already running four years behind their construction schedule, and at roughly double the original budget. The French National Audit Office recently recommended that the programme - the very one Britain is looking like signing up for - be abandoned.</p> <p>Second, it is slow to build - very, very slow. The four new nuclear reactors built by EDF since 1990 have taken on average 14 years to completion and 17.5 years to come online. That's not nearly quick enough to meet Britain's needs, either for power or for emissions reduction.</p> <p>Third, it is by its nature monopolistic. Enormously expensive and, technologically, immensely complicated, no community would be able to decide to install one even if they wanted to. Local communities aren't going to be able to install one to boost local education spending in the same way that <a href=\"http://www.inverurieherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/councillor-s-move-to-reverse-education-cuts-1-2545149\" title=\"\">a Scottish Green party councillor is suggesting with wind turbines in Aberdeenshire</a>.</p> <p>Fourth, it isn't renewable. Arguments are many and varied about the supplies of nuclear fuels and how long they might last, but whatever figures you accept, the fact is we're talking about a quite limited supply. But the wind and the sun are never going to run out - at least not in a time frame we have to worry about.</p> <p>Fifth, it is unreliable. If a handful of plants are responsible for a large percentage of Britain's power, sudden shutdowns could have hugely disruptive effects - as sweating Japanese salarymen in their suddenly non-airconditioned offices found after the Fukushima disaster. A power system reliant on nuclear can never be a reliable, resilient system.</p> <p>Then there is safety. There is, as we saw at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, the potential for enormous catastrophe. Again, you'll find lots of arguments about just how many people died or were badly affected as a result of these catastrophes. But those who like to claim figures of near zero fail to mention the loss of homes and land, tens of thousands of people displaced, and agricultural land lost to use for centuries from the small land mass of Japan (an island nation <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/rebecca-johnson/from-fukushima-to-hinkley-point\" title=\"\">pretty similar in scale to Britain).</a></p> <p>But it is difficult to weigh the risks of rare yet highly catastrophic events, such as a full nuclear meltdown. The good news is that we don't have to - it doesn't even have to be part of the argument against nuclear power. The costs, the unreliability, and the slowness of nuclear power alone mean that it can't be the answer to Britain's energy needs.</p> <p>If there weren't already a solution at hand, we'd have to be frantically hunting around for one. But the fact is that there is - renewables, combined with a serious drive for energy conservation, which would also have the added benefits of making our homes more comfortable and our air more breathable. And put money into the pockets of local communities, not export it to a multinational energy giant.</p> <p>We need to stop getting distracted by this 20th-century Betamax option, and get on with putting in place the 21st-century renewables solution.</p>",

(TONKER).</p> <p>It\u2019s a while since you\u2019ve had to clue a phrase, and several commented that it made a welcome change. Not that it was that easy to deal with effectively. It must have been tempting, as many did, to go for the AS TITCH INTIME split, but few managed to link cryptic and definition parts effectively while preserving a convincing surface reading. A number of clues submitted contained an initially mysterious reference to Dr Who, until I realized that the clue phrase contains most of the letters of Matt Smith, the actor currently playing the doctor. Given that indirect anagrams were involved, and that several actors have played the title role over the years, these were simply unacceptable as fair clues.</p> <p>I must be brief this month, to get this slip printed and despatched in reasonable time (already a week later than normal). Many of you may have met and chatted to my father at one or more of the Azed dinners and/or lunches. He and my mother attended them all. Earlier this month he died after a short illness, just four weeks short of his 98th birthday and survived by my mother, now 94. He it was who sparked my early interest in crosswords, patiently explaining the conventions of cryptic cluing while I accompanied him in the car on his round of visits to patients in their homes after morning surgery. He was immensely proud when I assumed Ximenes\u2019s mantle forty years ago, and continue solving my puzzles as long as he was able to.</p>",
  "<p>If few things are more irritating than a politician avoiding a question, what are we to make of an entire panel doing the same?</p> <p>Last night BBC Question Time took one of the more interesting questions we've heard for a while. With a mischievous glint, the questioner asked:</p> <p>\"Would the country be better served if we had more plebs and fewer poshos stalking the corridors of power.\"</p> <p>Dimbleby turned first, inevitably, to old Etonian caricature Jacob Rees-Mogg. His immediate (and only) reply was a kneejerk defence of public schools, suggesting that the important thing was that state schools produce pupils of the right calibre for the job. It's fortunate I didn't have any solid objects in my hand at that moment or it would have gone straight through the screen.</p> <p>How dare he? How dare that tubular balloon of hereditary privilege, who has sailed through life from prep school to Eton to Oxford to parliament, declare that people with a state school background are simply not up to the job of politics? Does he honestly believe that from 93% of the population we could not find a fair few with the intellect, wit, nous and talent to make the Bullingdon bullies, not to mention his good self, look like a troop of chattering gibbons?</p> <p>Private education was defended further by the honourable daughter of the 6th Baron Hindlip, Kirstie Allsopp, while Harriet Harman (St Paul's school) and Danny Alexander (rural comprehensive then PPE at Oxford) squeezed the last dregs from the Andrew Mitchell farce then indulged in some ginger rodent-related banter.</p> <p>In the midst of this carnival of rank smuggery sat one panellist who attended neither public school nor Oxbridge \u2013 Steve Coogan. In response to Rees-Mogg he said simply: \"Well, I went to a comprehensive school and it never did me any harm.\" That should have been the end to it, but up piped David Dimbleby (Charterhouse and PPE Oxford) with one of his witty interjections:</p> <p>\"Ah, but did it do you any good?\"</p> <p>Coogan gave him a momentary glance that could have boiled a canal and snapped: \"Well, I'm here aren't I?\"</p> <p>That brief exchanged captured the whole essence of the question and the problem. Yes, we need more plebs in the corridors of power, to make it less likely that a working class kid who graduated from Manchester University, and went on to become a global superstar as a writer and actor, could be asked on live TV whether his comprehensive schooling had done him any good. We need more plebs in politics so that when the Question Time panel is asked about austerity measures, one or two of them might really understand what it means to lose even a few quid a week in a benefit cut; or, when asked about dipping into the bank of Mum and Dad to buy a first home, might be able to talk about finding enough rent to stave off eviction by a landlord; or perhaps, when talking about the Rochdale grooming case, can explain from their own experience why some teenagers might be hanging out in a chip shop every evening? Those perspectives were missing from Question Time last night as they are missing from most editions, because those people are very largely excluded from the political establishment.</p> <p>Ed Miliband may not exactly be the typical comprehensive school kid, but I like to think he is absolutely right when he <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/913529-ed-miliband-as-a-state-school-boy-i-feel-your-pain\" title=\"\">told an interviewer</a>: \"I don't think I would be leader of the Labour party if it was not for my comprehensive school education.\" But this is not a party political issue. If I had to pick a couple of Tories to be on my team in an arse-to-elbow orienteering contest, I'd turn to David Davies and William Hague every time.</p> <p>If the question had been about political representation of ethnic minorities or women, the politicians would have known the script. They would have nodded seriously and agreed it is important that parliament reflects the country we have become. They would have traded boasts and excuses about their own party's performance and sworn to improve further. Not even Rees-Mogg would have implied that there just aren't enough women or black people out there with the ability to run the country. And yet when it comes to class, to education and to social background, they are oblivious, blinded by their own privilege and the myth of merit. Harman has devoted much of her career to the issue of women's representation, and yet on this she is struck mute.</p> <p>Yes, there are still some MPs from less privileged backgrounds, but few reach the front benches. Most are from older generations and will gradually be replaced by another apparatchik straight from PPE and central office. About 35% of MPs were privately educated \u2013 a minority, but vastly disproportionate to the population. The social background of Cameron's cabinet scarcely needs mentioning.</p> <p>Yes, we desperately need more plebs stalking the corridors of power. Unfortunately, we plebs look at the corridors of power and we do not see opportunity. Too often we see a parade of patronising, pompous, privileged, pricks. Take it from a proud pleb \u2013 that's not a good look.</p>",

You need to consider language and culture as well as taste and fashions.</p> <p>There are many benefits of getting started in exporting, but growing your ability to adapt and change to different market conditions is one of the most important. For example, if you're selling electrical products to the USA, you would need to make sure that they are 110-volt rather than 240-volt. Get it right with exporting and the evidence shows you will also grow your business in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Find a way to communicate locally: </strong>A famous Victorian travel guide said you only need to know how to say two things in any foreign language: \"do you speak English?\" and if the unfortunate answer is no \"then fetch me someone who does\". That sort of shout-loudly-and-slowly approach to foreign languages just won't cut it any more. Could you imagine how you would feel if a German company sent a German sales representative to you and wanted to conduct all his business in German? I predict he would be going home with no orders in his bag.</p> <p>Being able to communicate in the customer's language is therefore extremely important \u2013 but the good news is that this does not mean you have to go out and learn dozens of languages. If you have a good partner, agent or distributor in the market, they should look after this for you. For those markets where you are on your own, the services of an interpreter are worth their weight in gold. In China, for example, I've had good success with sourcing interpreters from students studying English at university. The most important thing is to have a plan for dealing with foreign languages. You could take advantage of a UKTI service, called an export communications review, where an expert will assess all your communications and help you to arrive at the best approach.</p> <p><em>Mike Cherry is national policy chairman for the </em><a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Federation of Small Businesses (FSB)</em></a></p> <p><strong>Do your research:</strong> You shouldn't rush into a new market without doing the research and thinking about the risks that you could face.

The Indian consumer has emerged as a powerful new phenomenon with greater aspirations for western products, higher disposable incomes, and a real affinity for British brands.

There are a range of ways this can be done, from letters of credit (which need not be complex or scary to use), through to insurance cover and export factoring and so on.</p> <p><strong>Funding the cashflow needed:</strong> If the payment terms are secured in the right way, then banks have a range of ways \u2013 typically referred to as trade finance \u2013 in which they can provide the finance needed. In addition, through the export support schemes provided by UK Export Finance (also known as ECGD), the banks and company can obtain additional support, typically a 50% guarantee of the amount needed, for financing the order. UK Export Finance also provides insurance cover for contracts, which can also be useful in both securing and financing orders.</p> <p><strong>Risk \u2013 especially foreign exchange:</strong> Sadly, there is no easy answer to this one. Most would start by setting a budget rate at which they set their sales price and then look to fix the actual rate in relation to that budget rate, to avoid further exchange rate risk. There are lots of ways in which this can be done, and again an early discussion with your bank on what is most appropriate for your business is the best starting point.</p> <p><strong>Payment terms can be a question of risk:</strong> In the early stages of your business relationship with your export customers, and perhaps when the sales values are lower, asking for upfront payment is not a bad place to start. As your confidence in your customers grows then you can look at alternatives \u2013 there are a number of different ways of ensuring that you get paid, which don't involve you having to given unsecured payment terms to your customers as the only alternative to upfront payment. The international specialist at your bank should be able to discuss options with you, so that you can make an informed decision about what works best for you as you build your export business.

  "<h2>1. Everton (1930-31 and 1951-52 to 1953-54)</h2> <p>Arsenal are usually the first team mentioned in dispatches when the subject of longevity in the top flight of English football crops up. No wonder in some respects: having been regulars since 1919, the aristocratic north Londoners hold the current record for unbroken membership of the division, the majority of that time spent swishing up and down the marble halls of their art-deco stands like Bertie Wooster. But, as in other walks of life, while the posh boys get most of the credit, it's the real people who have been doing the legwork. Arsenal's amazing unbroken record, and accordant establishment glamour, often obscures the fact that it's people's club Everton who hold the record for most seasons spent in the top flight. Having helped to form the Football League in the first place, they've stayed in the first division of English football for all but four seasons. All but four!</p> <p>They have only suffered relegation twice. The first relegation, in 1930, was something of a Manchester City-esque farce, coming two seasons after Everton won the title thanks to 60 goals from Dixie Dean. The striker's 23 goals in 25 games that fateful campaign couldn't help keep the Toffees up; having struggled to keep the goals out all season \u2013 they would only post three clean sheets in total \u2013 they embarked on a fatal run of six straight defeats from the start of March. Even four wins from their last five games couldn't save them, and they slipped out of the top flight for the very first time. Only Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers were still able to boast full and unbroken membership of the First.</p> <p>Dean stayed with Everton, though, and scored 39 times in 37 appearances as the Merseyside club stormed the Second Division. They opened with five straight wins, and by the turn of the year had only lost three games. At which point they put a sequence of 10 straight league wins together, effectively guaranteeing them promotion by the start of March. Having built a 13-point lead over nearest challengers Tottenham Hotspur, the team took their foot off the gas, losing six of their last 11, but still won the division by seven points from West Bromwich Albion. Conserving their energy was quite the plan: they won the league championship the following season, and the FA Cup the one after that.</p> <p>Everton's second stint in the second tier began in 1951, when a distinctly more average side \u2013 they had sold star striker Tommy Lawton after the war \u2013 slid out of the First with a shameful lack of fight. Requiring only a draw to ensure safety in their last match at fellow relegation strugglers Sheffield Wednesday, they were defenestrated 6-0. \"To abuse Everton would be too much like picking up a person badly mauled from a street accident and reading him a lecture on the folly of jaywalking,\" wrote the tinder-dry Donny Davies in this paper. (Poor Wednesday, for the record, went down with Everton anyway.)</p> <p>Despite presiding over this shambles, manager Cliff Britton kept his job, and slowly rebuilt the team. It took him three seasons to get Everton back up \u2013 the club finished in 16th spot in 1953, their lowest ebb \u2013 but his insistence on modern training methods eventually paid dividends in a physical division. Some of Britton's methods met with resistance \u2013 Norman Greenhalgh remembered that \"you hadn't to smoke, you hadn't to drink, you hadn't to go with women, it's ridiculous\", while Jimmy O'Neill habitually nipped off for a crafty fag in the bogs before the match, as well as at half-time. But Britton was a fair man, and when the team won promotion in 1954 after winning at Oldham, he took his players out for a meal at the swanky Midland Hotel in Manchester. O'Neill asked the waiter for a packet of snouts, which duly arrived on a silver salver. \"I put my hand in my pocket to pay for the cigarettes,\" O'Neill remembered years later. \"Cliff Britton said: 'Oh no no. Put that on our bill tonight.' That was my bonus for winning promotion.\"</p> <h2>2. Tottenham Hotspur (1977-78)</h2> <p>By the mid 1970s, the glory, glory days were long behind Tottenham Hotspur. Bill Nicholson, the architect of the famous double side of 1961, had enjoyed an Indian summer in the early 1970s, leading Spurs to a couple of League Cups and a Uefa Cup, but he had resigned in a righteous funk after his club's fans rioted at the 1974 Uefa Cup final (which Feyenoord had won). Meanwhile the era of Martin Chivers, Martin Peters and Alan Gilzean was over. Terry Neill, considered a worthless urchin as a result of his Arsenal background, took over as manager and presided over a gamut of nonsense. Between 14 December 1974 and 22 March 1975, his side won one league game. Deep in relegation trouble, they required five wins from their last seven games, and a 4-2 win in their last match over a Leeds side who had just come back from Barcelona where they'd just booked a place in the European Cup final, to stay up by a point.</p> <p>Neill was eventually replaced by Keith Burkenshaw, but though Spurs rallied the following season to finish in mid-table, they went down in last place in 1976-77. \"Tottenham's present troubles stem from their failure, in the late Sixties and early Seventies, to replace outstanding players,\" wrote David Lacey in the aftermath of the 5-0 loss at Manchester City which sent Spurs crashing into the Second Division. \"Burkenshaw is likely to be taking down the most promising Tottenham side, from the point of view of individual ability, for several seasons,\" he added, citing goalkeeper Barry Daines, centre back Keith Osgood and his occasional partner Steve Perryman, and especially Glenn Hoddle, who Lacey predicted \"will be a marvellous creative player once he begins to assert the authority that his skills warrant\".</p> <p>Along with young Neil McNab, all played their part as Spurs bounced back instantly. They started the season brilliantly, scoring regularly and playing some pretty football. The high point came in October, with a club-record 9-0 win over Bristol Rovers, striker Colin Lee scoring four on his debut after signing from Torquay United. It made the 21-year-old Lee an instant hero: the last time Spurs had scored nine times, against Nottingham Forest in 1962-63, the four-goal hero was Jimmy Greaves, who was not bad either. By the time March was drawing to a close, the team were clear at the top and hot favourites to win the division, but then they touched cloth, winning only two of their final eight games.</p> <p>It was still enough to win promotion, though only just. In their penultimate match, at home to already relegated Hull, Spurs required a wholly illegal 81st-minute goal by Perryman to take the points, the visiting keeper Eddie Blackburn having been barged to the ground by Chris Jones. \"There was more than a modicum of doubt about the validity of the goal,\" reported Lacey. \"It belonged firmly to the age of Ted Drake.\" The win left Spurs needing a point at Southampton, who had already won promotion and consequently had the cigar on. A \"soporific\" goalless draw having been played out, Spurs pipped Brighton &amp; Hove Albion to third spot on goal difference. That difference? The nine goals of the Bristol Rovers match. Spurs were back, with domestic and Uefa cup success to come, neatly bookending this rather inglorious period in their history.</p> <h2>3. Manchester United (1974-75)</h2> <p>United's fall from European champions to the Second Division is well documented: the lack of ambition, hunger and financial investment; the George Best affair; the sackings of Wilf McGuinness and Frank O'Farrell; the meddling of Sir Matt Busby; Denis Law's backheeled goal which relegated the club symbolically if not mathematically. So no point going into that. There's not too much to be said for the way United bounced straight back up, either. It was both predictable \u2013 no club as grand as this has gone down in the modern era \u2013 and straightforwardly brilliant. Promotion was assured; United breezed it. Look at the players at their disposal: Lou Macari, Martin Buchan, Steve Coppell, Sammy McIlroy, Stuart Pearson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Stewart Houston, Alex Stepney. No wonder Tommy Docherty's team would take a tilt at the league and cup double the following year.</p> <p>But what's interesting, and often forgotten now United's support has long been slandered with accusations of day-tripping and prawn-sandwich munching, is just how much United's season in the Second was overshadowed \u2013 and at the time very much defined \u2013 by the constant threat of ultraviolence.</p> <p>United's support was, by the mid 1970s, the most feared in the land. In 1969, during the European Cup semi-final, Milan's goalkeeper Fabio 'Carlo's Dad' Cudicini had been hit by a missile. Uefa ordered the club to erect wire fencing behind the goals. Two years later, during a match against Newcastle United, some eejit sent a knife whistling on to the field of play. When Law scored his famous/infamous backheel, United's fans stormed the pitch while setting fire to the stands, in the hope of getting the game abandoned. The last four minutes of United's 36-year stint in the top flight were never played.</p> <p>It's hard to get a sense \u2013 from the papers, anyway \u2013 of just how well Docherty's brilliant team played while slumming it in the Second. That's because most contemporary reporters used up most of their word count in describing what the hoodlum element of the United support was up to. Here's the Observer on United's opening-day 2-0 win at Leyton Orient: \"Two policemen injured, 200 spectators thrown out of the ground, a Tube train taken out of service, arrests ... the anticipated rampage by United's fans brought havoc to Orient ... terrified shopkeepers boarding up their windows, pubs closing, and the peace-loving bourgeoisie fleeing the disaster zone ... United fans responded with violent stupidity ... the Manchester mob went into action the minute they hit London, 11 young heroes in Black Marias before the main posse cleared Euston ... United's players, however, distinguished themselves.\"</p> <p>The low point came at Hillsborough, where mounted police had to restore order when fighting spilled on to the pitch, momentarily stopping an otherwise uneventful 4-4 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. \"What can we do?\" sighed Docherty. \"We have a minority of supporters who are a disgrace. Every club has one or two troublemakers, but because of the size of our following, our problem is bigger than any other club.\" Indeed, David Lacey noted that United \u2013 whose home attendances were the biggest in the country, and whose away visits ensured all-time record attendances for all-but-one club in the division \u2013 were suffering from the actions of \"youngsters who have not been within a hundred miles of Manchester\".</p> <p>When United sealed promotion with a 1-0 win at Southampton, Macari scoring the winner, the Guardian still concentrated on the off-field consequences. \"The shopkeepers of Highbury, Birmingham and Leeds will soon be snug behind their boarded-up windows on cold winter nights as the red and white motley descend from coaches marked Salford or even Sutton Coldfield. Policemen in Southampton and Oxford will be relieved of their extra judo classes.\"</p> <p>But as Docherty had implied, United's achievements were being undersold thanks to the actions of the minority. \"We're supporters, not hooligans,\" a young lad told the press box at Old Trafford on the final day of the season, as the crowd celebrated their departure from the division. The week before, during United's visit to Notts County, a police officer had been clanked upside the head by a large stone, a block of concrete and a \"kung-fu star\" (a five-inch metal disc with sharpened points). But back at home, after Blackpool had been seen off 4-0, the jubilant fans were on their best behaviour. \"Their conduct was almost angelic,\" reported the Guardian. \"Pure boisterous geniality.\"</p> <h2>4. Sunderland (1958-59 to 1963-64)</h2> <p>Anyone caring to suggest that Sunderland aren't a big club might like to note that, despite not having won a championship since 1936, they're still the sixth most successful club in the country, behind Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Everton and Aston Villa. And even if their star has faded somewhat over the past three decades, with plenty of time served in the Second Division, plus one ignominious year in the Third, they were certainly one of the game's giants back in the 1950s.</p> <p>Albeit a giant losing its grip. The war having stopped Sunderland in their tracks, the club tried to go again with a series of big money signings, including Len Shackleton, Ivor Broadis and Trevor Ford. But the investments by a club then known as The Bank of England paid no dividends. Yeovil famously dumped Sunderland out of the Cup in 1949; the team stumbled through the business end of the title race in 1950 to allow Portsmouth to make off with the spoils; they lost to Manchester City in the 1955 FA Cup semi, spurning the chance to face Cup specialists Newcastle in the final. Shackleton, perhaps apocryphally, spent most of his time imparting ludicrous amounts of spin on the ball to make Ford look inept.</p> <p>While Sunderland's status was slipping on the field, their Bank of England reputation took a huge knock off it. Then, as now, those working in the financial sector were fancy of finger and not to be trusted. In 1957, the club were found guilty of making illegal payments to players, over and above the maximum wage. The club were fined, and manager Bill Murray resigned. Alan Brown took over, got rid of the underperforming big names, and flooded the team with young talent. Sunderland were relegated within the year, the first time they had slipped out of the top flight since making it there in 1891.</p> <p>The Mackems took a while to acclimatise to their new, more modest surroundings. They finished in the lower half of the Second Division for the first two seasons of their stay \u2013 in 15th and then 16th position \u2013 and then a well-off-the-promotion-pace sixth in 1960-61. At which point the club decided to stop buggering about and purchased Brian Clough from Middlesbrough for \u00a345,000 and George Herd from Clyde for \u00a340,000. The new season started badly for Sunderland, who lost three of their opening four games, and it would cost them dearly. On the final day of the season, they needed to match the result of surprise promotion contenders Leyton Orient to be assured of promotion. But Orient won at Bury, while Sunderland \u2013 despite Clough opening the scoring in their match at Swansea with his 34th goal of the season \u2013 could only draw, a late freakish deflection pegging them back.</p> <p>Sunderland would be denied again on the final day of the following season, when Chelsea beat them at Roker Park to steal off with the second promotion spot instead. The season hinged on the fateful events of Boxing Day, when Clough's career was effectively finished in a collision with Bury keeper Chris Harker. Sunderland lost that game 1-0, then drew seven and lost four of their next 15 league games, having been robbed of the services of a player who had scored 24 in 24 games. Sunderland eventually made it up the following season, third time lucky in a comparatively uneventful campaign, one mainly remembered now for an FA Cup run which saw them knock out the league champions Everton then come within five minutes of knocking Manchester United out at Old Trafford with the semi-final in sight. Promotion would have to suffice; after a six-year exile from the top flight, incorporating so much bitter disappointment, it was more than enough.</p> <h2>5. Aston Villa (1967-68 to 1974-75)</h2> <p>At the start of the 1966-67 season, only Arsenal and the newly crowned champions Liverpool had won more English titles (seven) than Aston Villa's six. By the end of the campaign, Manchester United would join the gang at the top of that list, while Villa were on their way down to the second tier. In truth, most of the gold lettering on Villa's roll of honour had been etched before the war. The first world war, that is. They hadn't won the league since 1910, and barring three second places in the following four seasons, and a couple more during the 1930s, they rarely troubled the top end of the table. Indeed, they'd spent a year out of the top division as recently as 1959-60, but that episode had been bookended by winning the 1957 FA Cup and the first-ever League Cup in 1961. Joe Mercer, who managed Villa's young team to the latter trophy, went on to suffer a stroke in 1964, and was sacked despite making a full recovery.</p> <p>As he tottered off to bring delight to Manchester City, Villa \u2013 who had admittedly not been much cop in the league under Mercer anyway \u2013 started to seriously struggle. The sale of star striker Tony \"Mark's Dad\" Hateley to Chelsea in 1966 seems to have been the catalyst for implosion, and the team went down the season later. Their exit from the top flight was ignominious \u2013 a 6-2 thrashing at Southampton on a day when the other relegated club, Blackpool, departed with some pride thanks to a valedictory 3-1 win at the home of newly deposed champions Liverpool.</p> <p>Blackpool would have bounced straight back the season after, were it not for an increasingly hapless Villa \u2013 now a struggling Second Division side \u2013 bungling home an own goal eight minutes from time at home to Queens Park Rangers, sending the Rs up ahead of the Seasiders by one fifth of a goal. Blackpool required two more seasons to get back up, and in 1969-70 departed the division in an upwardly mobile fashion, while Villa \u2013 perhaps in karmic kickback for what they had done to the Tangerines \u2013 were dispatched in the other direction.</p> <p>Vic Crowe, who had been unable to save Villa in that relegation campaign after taking over a rock-bottom team from Tommy Docherty, could not get the grand old club out of the third tier at the first time of asking. But he did manage to lead Villa to Wembley that year, beating a Manchester United team featuring George Best, Bobby Charlton, Denis Law <em>and Jimmy Rimmer</em> in the League Cup semi-finals. Villa faced Spurs in the final, and despite the two-division chasm between the two sides, held the favourites until 78 minutes. According to the Observer, Villa \"played the more skilful and dashing soccer before Tottenham casually crushed them with two goals in three minutes ... only then was the disparity in class apparent\".</p> <p>Before that, Ian 'Chico' Hamilton had tormented the Spurs defence, even hitting a post straight from a corner. A bittersweet defeat, but a high point nonetheless in a bleak period for the club. Crowe led the club back up to the Second Division the following season as champions, but could take them no further, and was eventually sacked by chairman Doug Ellis, who brought in Ron Saunders.</p> <p>The new manager-messiah led Villa out of the wilderness at the first attempt, winning the manager of the year award, and his team were expected to go on to make a serious impression in the championship race the season after. They could only finish 16th, but they were back, and made up for the disappointments of 1971 by winning the League Cup that year, and again two seasons later. But the title, and any other attendant trinkets, would have to wait a year or two yet.</p> <h2>6. Leeds United (1982-83 to 1989-90)</h2> <p>Leeds United going down to the second tier in 2004, and then to the third for the first time in their history in 2007, was big enough news. But their demise from the top flight in 1982 was \u2013 fire up the italics, capital letters and bold \u2013 <strong>HUGE</strong>. In retrospect, the jig was up for Leeds the minute Don Revie took the England job. But an appearance in the 1975 European Cup final, followed by semi-final appearances in the FA Cup (1977) and the League Cup (1978 and 1979), kept the vultures off the scent, even if those were slim pickings compared to the glory decade of the Don.</p> <p>Leeds had nevertheless turned into a middle-of-the-road side. Having never finished outside the top four under Revie, their post-Don finishes up until the 1981-82 season had been 9-5-10-9-5-11-9. And mid-table sides are only a couple of bad decisions away from getting themselves into serious trouble. Enter new manager Allan Clarke, who told the players that Leeds would win the European Cup within two years. Uh-huh. Clarke was given a whopping \u00a31m purse to spend on a couple of players, and decided to blow the entire whack on Peter Barnes, who proceeded to spend the entire season asleep on the pitch.</p> <p>By the end of the season Barnes had scored one goal, handed in the same number of transfer requests, and had ruined his international career by slagging off Ron Greenwood. He was hardly responsible for Leeds' subsequent relegation \u2013 the defence was in tatters, and only the late-season signing of Frank Worthington offered the doomed club any hope at all \u2013 but his story was symbolic of their demise.</p> <p>As was their supporters' attempt to have their final game of the season, a 2-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion, abandoned, Manchester United style, by ripping down a 15-foot barrier and storming the pitch. They managed to get the fence down, but the referee blew the final whistle before anyone could get on to the field of play, at which point mounted bobbies led a 100-strong baton charge across the pitch and up the terraces, an \"unprecedented event on an English ground\", according to this paper.</p> <p>Clarke \u2013 who had suggested fans guilty of public order offences should be birched in the centre circle at half-time, and that he'd be quite happy to wield the big stick himself \u2013 was told to do one, and Leeds endured a couple of mid-table seasons in the Second under Eddie Gray. In 1984-85, they reigned in their inconsistency a wee bit, Gray having built a youthful side featuring the likes of Denis Irwin, Andy Linighan, Terry Phelan, Ian Snodin, John Sheridan and Scott Sellars. They entered the last day of the season with a slim chance of pipping Manchester City for the third promotion place behind Oxford United and Birmingham City. As it turned out, City thrashed Charlton 5-1 to take the matter out of Leeds' hands. Leeds lost at Birmingham 1-0 anyway, amid terrible scenes of rioting which led to the death of 15-year-old Ian Hambridge, who was attending his first-ever game.</p> <p>An earlier match that season involving Leeds, at Oxford's Manor Ground in November, had seen the away supporters rip six-foot planks from the TV gantry and hurl them on to the pitch, forcing their manager to concede defeat four minutes before full time. Leeds had gone two goals up before losing 5-2, their second goal scored by the 37-year-old veteran Peter Lorimer, who was later sent off for protesting at being smacked in the mouth by Oxford's hat-trick hero John Aldridge. These were different times all right.</p> <p>Billy Bremner replaced Gray, and got shot of most of the promising kids, yet thanks to a weak division and an easy draw in the FA Cup, took Leeds close to a promotion and Cup double in 1987. However his side were beaten by Coventry City in extra time of a classic semi-final at Hillsborough, and then bested by Charlton Athletic in a new-fangled relegation-promotion play-off. It was down to Howard Wilkinson to get Leeds back up. Slashing a symbolic line under the Revie era, he took down all the photos of the Don, signed chalk-and-cheese midfield duo Gordon Strachan and Vinnie Jones, and Leeds were back. A second glory era was on the horizon.</p> <p><em>Many thanks to Cris Freddi, Rob Smyth, Jonathan Wilson and Rob Bagchi</em></p>",
  "<p>Old Mr Fotis turned my question over in his mind while sipping his morning coffee. Below the veranda some youths had been playing noisily on the harbour wall, but now they all dived into the turquoise sea and set off on the long swim to the rocky island in the bay. It had a fragment of crenellated wall on top of it, the ruins of a Venetian fortress. Fotis watched them go, half-smiling.</p> <p>\"We do seem to attract a lot of writers,\" said the old man eventually. \"But that's a name I don't remember.\"</p> <p>\"Bruce Chatwin, Baroose Chit-win, Chaatwing.\" I tried a few variations but none struck a chord. \"His ashes are scattered somewhere in the hills.\"</p> <p>\"No, I never heard of him.\"</p> <p>\"What about Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor? You must know about him.\"</p> <p>I'd first heard of Kardamyli because of Leigh Fermor, who had made the place his home. I'd always hoped we might meet, but then the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/jun/10/patrick-leigh-fermor-obituary\" title=\"\">grand old man of British travel writing had died in June 2011</a> (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jun/12/patrick-leigh-fermor-by-jan-morris-obituary\" title=\"\">leaving the literary world praying that he had finished the final volume of his Time of Gifts trilogy</a>). I'd come to the Mani on a sort of literary homage, hoping to find a little of the magic that had attracted first Leigh Fermor and later Chatwin.</p> <p>The old man shook his head. \"No, I don't think so. There was a writer called Robert. Now he was famous \u2013 cured himself of cancer by walking around Crete. [Former South Africa cricketer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Crisp\" title=\"\">Bob Crisp</a> wrote of his walk around Crete in the 1970s.] He was very famous.\"</p> <p>This felt all wrong. Was I in the right place? How annoying that the locals should raise this unknown above the two giants of travel literature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396831965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/26/1348679320357/Mani-oranges-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mani oranges\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An orange tree in Greece's Mani region. Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fotis leaned back and shouted in Greek to his wife in the kitchen. She came through, cloth in hand. \"Robert Crisp,\" she said, smiling. \"What a wonderful man! So handsome! I remember him sitting up at Dioskouri's taverna drinking and talking with Paddy. They were always laughing.\"</p> <p>My ears pricked up. Fotis's face underwent a transformation. \"Ah Paddy! That is him \u2013 your English writer. Of course, Paddy \u2013 or Michali we called him. Yes, Paddy was here for years and years. When I was young we used to say he was a British spy and had a tunnel going out to sea where submarines would come.\"</p> <p>It didn't surprise me. Leigh Fermor had been, by all accounts, extremely old school, endlessly curious and an accomplished linguist \u2013 all well-known attributes of British spies. He produced a clutch of good books and two classics of the genre, A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water, detailing his journey as an 18-year-old on foot to Constantinople.</p> <p>\"Did you see a lot of him?\" I asked.</p> <p>Fotis shrugged. \"Sometimes. He liked to walk a lot. Now Robert Crisp \u2013 I used to see him. What a character!\"</p> <p>\"Is Paddy's house still empty?\" I persisted. \"I heard it was now a museum.\"</p> <p>Fotis shook his head. \"No, no. He left it to the Benaki Museum in Athens (<a href=\"http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?lang=en\" title=\"\">benaki.gr</a>) and they're supposed to turn it into a writers' centre. My guess is nothing will happen for a while.\"</p> <p>I could hardly complain about Greek tardiness: Leigh Fermor himself had taken 78 years over his trilogy, and even then no one seemed very sure if he had completed the task. There was, I decided, only one way to get close to the spirit of these colossi of travel-writing: to walk.</p> <p>\"Which paths did Paddy like best?\"</p> <p>Fotis fetched a map and gave me directions. It was already hot when I left him on his veranda. I could see the youths lazing on the harbour wall again, tired by their long swim. Was this really the time of year for walking?</p> <p>I headed through the ruined village, as instructed, and found a narrow steep path rising up the hillside. Before too long I came across the stone tomb that locals say is the grave of Castor and Pollux, heavenly twins and brothers to Helen of Troy. Kardamyli is mentioned in Homer's Iliad as one of the seven towns that Agamemnon gave to Achilles.</p> <p>Sweat was pouring off me now, but I kept going. Scents of thyme and sage rose from the undergrowth. Fotis had said there were lots of snakes up here, but I didn't see any. The views of the bay below, however, were becoming more and more magnificent.</p> <p>The Mani is the middle finger of the three-pronged southern Peloponnese, a 40-mile long skeletal digit that was almost inaccessible, except by sea, until recently. When Leigh Fermor first came here in 1951, it was by a marathon mountain hike across the Taygetus range, whose slopes seem always to be either burned dry by summer sun, or weighted with winter snow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396831966\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/26/1348679567613/war-tower-001.jpg\" alt=\"war tower\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">War tower in the Taygetus mountains. Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The people here were different. For a start they had turned vengeance into a lifelong passion, building war towers to threaten their neighbours and generally making life on a stony mountain even grimmer than it needed to be and clinging to weird atavistic beliefs. No wonder that in the 1950s most of the younger people abandoned it for places not as badly infested with saltwater ghouls and blood-sucking phantoms \u2013 Melbourne and Tottenham were particularly popular.</p> <p>Fotis himself had been one of them, settling in Australia for many years before coming home and opening a hotel. Nowadays some parts of the Mani are thick with holiday homes and development, but Kardamyli remains delightfully quiet and understated, the sort of Greek village where old widows in black sit out every morning watching the world go by.</p> <p>Having reached a good height on the mountain I started to follow the contours, dipping in and out of the shade of walnut trees and cypress, drinking clear cold water from a spring. Further on I came to the village of Proastio, where Fotis had told me there was a church for every family, the ancestors having been sailors, and very superstitious. At the gorgeous little basilica of Agios Nikolaos in the main street I got the priest to come and unlock the door, revealing a gallery of perfect 17th-century Byzantine murals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396831967\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/26/1348679715488/Byzantine-murals-001.jpg\" alt=\"Byzantine murals\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Byzantine murals in Proastio church. Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tried the name Chatwin on him, and wondered how to mime death, cremation and scattering of ashes. But the Orthodox Church does not approve of cremation and his face told me I would not get far.</p> <p>Returning to Kardamyli by a steep cobbled donkey trail, a <em>kalderimi</em>, I passed Fotis's veranda once again.</p> <p>\"Who was that writer?\" he called. \"My wife thinks she knows.\"</p> <p>Anna came out. \"Paddy himself scattered the ashes of a writer friend of his, up in Exochori.\"</p> <p>That was where I had just been walking, only higher. Next morning I started much earlier and with a water bottle. Fotis was already up and about when I passed his house.</p> <p>\"Exochori is my home village,\" he said. \"But what you see now is just old people up there. The old Maniati culture is gone. We used to grow silkworms and our mothers made all our underclothes from it. Can you believe it? We were peasants in the most remote part of Europe, but we wore silk.\"</p> <p>He tried to give me directions to the church, but it got so confusing that I just pretended to understand and resolved to ask along the way. As it happened, this was a useless strategy since the few old people I bumped into spoke no English, and my phrasebook was inexplicably silent on the important line, \"Where are scattered the remains of the travel writer?\"</p> <p>In the end I came across a small white-washed shrine with a view of the sea. There was just room to enter, and inside a votive candle burned on a tray with some fresh flowers. A white dog appeared. I elected to call it the Chatwin Church. After a few minutes of contemplation I set off again, southwards past one of the war towers, a gorgeous forest monastery and finally the unspoilt hamlet of Castania, where the taverna owner marched me into the kitchen, pointed out the various dishes and then served a vast quantity of delicious food with a jug of rough wine. It took several strong coffees to get me moving again for the long tramp home.</p> <p>Back in Kardamyli late that afternoon, Fotis was keen to hear of my walk, but he scoffed at my description of the Chatwin Church. \"No, no! That is not it. Come on \u2013 I'll take you there.\"</p> <p>\"I'm a bit tired.\"</p> <p>\"Good God, we're not walking! In my car.\"</p> <p>Soon we were on a longer, twisting route. Fotis pointed out landmarks and patches of land that his family owned. I asked about his ancestors.</p> <p>\"The Mani was always where people came to hide,\" he said. \"Our family are said to have arrived when Byzantium fell to the Ottomans in 1453.\"</p> <p>\"They came from Constantinople?\"</p> <p>He nodded. \"Our family tradition is that we were clowns for the Byzantine emperor.\" He smiled. \"But I've no idea if that is true.\"</p> <p>He slowed the car down. \"Look. This is where you turn off the main road, between the school and the cemetery.\"</p> <p>We pulled up in the shade of two pine trees then set off walking. We picked our way through some old stone houses, their walls overgrown with vines, their shutters closed.</p> <p>\"Holiday homes now,\" said Fotis. \"Exochori people working in Athens.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396831968\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/26/1348679888257/Sunset-above-Kardamyli-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset above Kardamyli\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset above Kardamyli. Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then we were on a grassy rill of land and I could see the church, a tiny Byzantine basilica, its rough stone walls and ancient pantiles crusted with lichens. Laid out before it was a wonderful tranquil panorama of the sea, its surface smooth as a sheet of silk. It was obvious why a traveller would want to come to rest here, overlooking the sea Homer's heroes had sailed.</p> <p>I stood there for a long time. Fotis was searching for the key to the church, normally left in a crack or niche, but there was no sign of it and we gave up. Back in the car, I asked Fotis to point out the house of Paddy Leigh Fermor and glimpsed a low pantiled roof almost submerged in trees on a crag next to the sea.</p> <p>\"Is there no way to see it?\"</p> <p>He shrugged. \"It's all shut up.\"</p> <p>\"Is there a beach?\"</p> <p>\"Yes \u2013 a tiny one.\"</p> <p>I memorised the spot. When Leigh Fermor came to the Mani he did some impressive wild swimming. To honour his adventurous spirit I felt I should swim around to his house and take a look. So next morning, before the heat of day, I entered the sea by the harbour and swam south down the rocky coast hunting for that tiny beach. I swam for what seemed a long time and had given up and turned back when I saw it: a little shingly beach with a single-storey house above. I swam closer until I could stand in the water.</p> <p>It was a lovely place: deep verandas and stone walls under a pantile roof. Mosaics of pebbles had been made on a flight of steps. I called out but got no answer. The house was shuttered and quiet as though still in mourning. I waded up the beach and sat at the foot of the pebble path. I could see a colonnade with rooms off it, then a larger living room.</p> <p>I thought of the years that Leigh Fermor had spent here: by all accounts he was a great host and storyteller. When I'd asked one old lady in the village if she had read any of his books, she'd laughed, \"Why would any of us read his books? He told us all the stories himself!\"</p> <p>The last story had been that third volume of his epic walk across Europe, but he had never finished it, perhaps never would have. And now a great peace had descended on the place, a peace I didn't want to disturb. I walked back down to the water and swam out into the bay. Without thinking, I found myself heading for the island of Meropi, the one that those youths had swum to. I would explore the ruins of that Venetian castle.</p> <p><strong>How to do it</strong><br>The trip was provided by Sunvil (020-8758 4758, <a href=\"http://www.sunvil.co.uk/holidays/greece\" title=\"\">sunvil.co.uk/greece</a>), which has seven nights self-catering in a studio at Liakoto Apartments in Kardamyli, including flights from Gatwick to Kalamata and transfers, from \u00a3699pp. Walking tours of the Mani with guide Anna Butcher can be booked through Sunvil, which also has a nine-day <a href=\"http://www.sunvil.co.uk/holiday-ideas/walking-holidays\" title=\"\">all-inclusive walking tour of the Mani</a> for \u00a31,755pp</p> <p><strong>What to read</strong><br>Artemis Cooper's biography, Patrick Leigh Fermor, An Adventure, will be published by <a href=\"http://www.johnmurray.co.uk/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">John Murray</a> on 11 October, price \u00a325.

On a bank above this busy stone disc, the rest of the family were flinging wooden shovelfuls of wheat in the air for the grain to fall on outstretched coloured blankets while the husks drifted away. Others shook large sieves. The sun which climbed behind them outlined this group with a rim of gold and each time a winnower sent up his great fan, for long seconds the floating chaff embowered him in a gold mist. <br>The sun poured into this stone casket through deep embrasures. Dust gyrated along the shafts of sunlight like plankton under a microscope, and the room was full of the aroma of decay. There was a rusty double-barrelled gun in the corner, a couple of dog-eared Orthodox missals on the shelf, and, pinned to the wall above the table, a faded oleograph of King Constantine and Queen Sophia, with King George and the Queen Mother, Olga Feodorovna, smiling with time-dimmed benevolence through wreaths of laurel. Another picture showed King Constantine's entry into re-conquered Salonika at the end of the Balkan war. On a poster, Petro Mavromichalis, the ex-war minister, between a pin-up girl cut-out from the cover of Romantzo and a 1926 calendar for the Be Smart Tailors of Madison Avenue, flashed goodwill from his paper monocle.

  "<p>Oh dear, Slutwalk London. On Saturday you're marshalling crowds of women in fishnets and bras to chant \"my dress is not a yes\" and promoting <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/uk-home-office-protect-all-rape-survivors-prosecute-rapists\" title=\"\">petitions</a> insisting that the Home Office should prosecute rapists. Come Tuesday, you're taking to Twitter to issue <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/je1eul\" title=\"\">statements</a> objecting to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/24/conversation-julian-assange-extradition\" title=\"\">extradition of Julian Assange</a> to face rape allegations in Sweden. Rapists should be prosecuted, but according to Slutwalk London, the fact that many who are accused of rape ultimately aren't convicted means that this particular accused rapist shouldn't be subject to due process. It's an awkward position to adopt, and the most awkward thing of all is the way it conscripts those who joined the march to a cause that was never part of the prospectus.</p> <p>I've squinted at the statement, lurched back and forth at my monitor, and made myself boss-eyed in the hope that the statement is the literary equivalent of a <a href=\"http://www.magiceye.com/3dfun/stwkdisp.shtml\" title=\"\">Magic Eye picture</a>: looks like a nonsensical smear on first glimpse, eventually resolves into glorious meaning. I'm going to save you some time here. Don't bother with any of that, because the statement really is nothing but a self-contradictory trainwreck. Slutwalk Toronto (the mother of all Slutwalks) has already discreetly <a href=\"http://slutwalktoronto.tumblr.com/post/32396967295/on-recent-statements-regarding-the-julian-assange\" title=\"\">expressed its concern</a> about the London branch's statement, again <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SlutWalkTO\" title=\"\">via Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Now, the legality of Assange's extradition has been done and done and done again, and I've got no desire to rehash here what's been dealt with thoroughly elsewhere \u2013 not least because I'm not a lawyer, and I think the world can do without another non-legal opinion on this business. But given that Slutwalk London has no more passed its bar exams than I have, I do wonder why on earth they felt they had to say anything.</p> <p>What did the person posting that statement think she was going to achieve? It's hard to imagine that anyone was waiting for Slutwalk London to take a stand before they decided for themselves about a matter of international law. There are things I might look to Slutwalk for guidance on: for example, does flashing my thigh mean I deserve to get raped (no) and should the police advise women against flashing their thighs for their own protection (no again), but the Assange case isn't one of them.</p> <p>And while it can't do any good, it can certainly do plenty of harm. Anyone who's ever had a vague feeling that all-out-with-our-tits-out is flawed as an anti-sexual violence strategy could point to this as evidence of Slutwalk's lack of coherence \u2013 and no one who's ill-disposed to a cause is likely to distinguish London's organisers from all the Slutwalks worldwide making a noise for women's right not to be assaulted.</p> <p>At the same time, Slutwalk London has inadvertently lined itself (and its unwitting supporters) up with an unappealing gaggle of rape apologists and victim blamers. It's all very well for the statement to stress \"We are not saying the women lied or that they should not get justice,\" but lots of people who support Assange have said that women lie. If an anti-rape campaign must intervene on this case at all, surely it should be addressing those grotesque statements, not condoning the position of those who made them.</p> <p>The revelations of how the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/rochdale-police-sex-abuse-girls\" title=\"\">Rochdale child abuse circle</a> were failed show again how prejudices about female sexuality are used to deny women and girls justice. In a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-19741302\" title=\"\">BBC interview</a>, one of the abused girls explains that social services told her parents that she was a \"prostitute\" and had made a \"life choice\" \u2013 even though she was only 15. Apparently, whatever she wore and wherever she went were seen as tokens of her own moral failings, rather than being recognised as the signs of hideous abuse. Attitudes like that are what Slutwalk was founded to counter. Co-opting supporters in defence of an alleged rapist is a betrayal of victims of sexual violence and a manipulative abuse of the backing that women have given to the Slutwalk cause. Oh dear, Slutwalk London, oh dear.</p> <p>Slutwalk London were asked for a comment but have not yet replied.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 September 2012.

  "<p>Kenyan troops have launched an amphibious assault on the port stronghold of Somalia's Islamist al-Shabaab militants, landing forces on Kismayo's beach in a long-heralded attack meant to deal a fatal blow to the rebels.</p> <p>Residents, many of whom were hunkered down in their homes as the battle continued, said the attack came from the air and sea at around 3am local time. Some expressed fears the assault would signal the start of a wider battle for control of the strategic port among rival clan militias.</p> <p>\"It was an amphibious assault, delicate and&#xa0;\u2026 meticulously planned,\" Colonel Cyrus Oguna, a spokesman for the Kenyan military, said. \"We have so far encountered minimum resistance,\" he added, saying there had been no casualties among the Kenyan troops or their Somali National Army (SNA) allies. The Kenyan army has also been supported in its campaign by Ras Kamboni, a local militia.</p> <p>Abdi Buule, an elder in Kismayo, said Kenyan and Somali forces had pushed deep into the city.</p> <p>\"The people are worried. No one could go outside this morning, even the people could not cook their breakfast. The fighting is now going on,\" he said by telephone.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al-Qaida, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/somali-troops-mogadishu-rebels-out\" title=\"\">withdrew from Mogadishu in August last year</a> after fierce fighting with the Ugandan and Burundian troops of a 17,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force \u2013 Amisom.</p> <p>Since then, the militants, who include foreign fighters as well as Somalis and who have imposed a strict form of sharia law in the areas they control, have been forced further into the south of the country.</p> <p>Kismayo is their last major stronghold, and a key source of revenue: the militants are heavily dependent on earnings from charcoal exports through the port, and taxes levied on businesses.</p> <p>\"We heard roars of heavy guns and aeroplanes flying over us. I fled from home with my two children to the other side of town,\" Aamina, 34, said by telephone from Kismayo.</p> <p>She said she had seen four bodies on Friday morning, including those of civilians. The elder, Abdi Buule, said around 160 people had been arrested by the Kenyan forces, who feared the militants would try to hide among the population.</p> <p>Oguna said Kenya used most of its naval assets in the operation, and that ground forces, which had been massing for an attack from the other side of Kismayo, were moving in, with some having already entered the city.</p> <p>He said the operation was carried out mostly by Kenyan forces and fighters from the SNA. \"The operation is dynamic. We have been there for only a couple of hours. It is too soon to predict how long it will take,\" he said. A lot of infrastructure had been destroyed, he added, and al-Shabaab fighters had been killed although he could not give a number.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said heavy fighting was continuing on Friday morning.</p> <p>\"Ships have brought Kenyan troops on our Kismayo beach last night. Fierce fighting between us and them is going on now,\" Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabaab's spokesman for military operations, told Reuters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia in October last year</a> to pursue the militants officials blamed for a series of kidnappings and cross-border raids. They joined Amisom in June.</p> <p>In the days before the beach-front assault, Kenyan jets attacked al-Shabaab logistic centres in the port, raising fears among aid groups that many civilians might be killed and injured in a final battle for the city.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported in August that <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/23/somalia-protect-civilians-kismayo\" title=\"\">at least three civilians had been killed in shelling by Kenyan navy ships</a>. HRW and the UN called on Kenyan troops to do more to protect Somalis during the military advance. Thousands of residents were reported to be fleeing the city in the past few weeks.</p> <p>The assault came less than a month after activist and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">professor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was elected president in Mogadishu</a>, the first leader to be chosen inside Somalia since the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.</p> <p>His inauguration raised hopes that Somalia might be entering a new era, although optimism was tempered by a series of deadly suicide bomb attacks in Mogadishu, including one targeting the new president.</p> <p>Analysts have pointed out that even if Kismayo falls, al-Shabaab fighters may melt into the sparsely populated countryside, harassing the Amisom forces and local population with guerrilla-style hit-and-run attacks.</p> <p>Some have also raised concerns about a possible power vacuum opening up. It is unclear who would ultimately control Kismayo, a lucrative source of income that has been fought over by Somali clans in the past.</p> <p>There have been reports of local militias arming themselves, and even of a former warlord travelling to the city from Mogadishu in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Abdi Buule, the elder in Kismayo, echoed these fears.</p> <p>\"Every person is thinking what will happen in the next days. Al-Shabaab officials escaped but their fighters are still in the town&#xa0;\u2026 People here are very worried over the militias [fighting] alongside with Kenyan forces, who can create new inter-clan rivalry&#xa0;\u2026 Kismayo&#xa0;\u2026 is a very strategic town and so now every clan militia is getting ready to have its role in the town,\" he said.</p> <p>The fall of Kismayo will also intensify fears of retaliation within Kenya where security is already very tight. Kenyan youths are known to be fighting with al-Shabaab and there have been a series of grenade attacks on bars and churches in Kenya since the country's troops crossed into Somalia.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Additional reporting by Abdalle Ahmed in Mogadishu</em></p>",
  "<p>In the middle of the night of 19 February 2005, 20-year-old Sonia T\u00e1bora went into premature labour at seven months, alone, in a coffee plantation near her home in rural El Salvador. Her family found her collapsed, haemorrhaging and in a state of shock, and took her to a health centre in search of help. T\u00e1bora explained what happened, but the doctor accused her of provoking an abortion and reported her to the police. She was shackled to her bed, presumed guilty and transferred to a hospital to remand as though she were a dangerous criminal. She was then sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder.</p> <p>Her trial fell far short of international standards: no autopsy was carried out and the prosecution presented no evidence, relying solely on the opinion of the doctor and the conjecture of the judge. T\u00e1bora suffered a mental breakdown and spent more than seven years in prison <a href=\"http://europeanprochoicenetwork.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/el-salvador-woman-jailed-for-30-years-for-miscarriage-has-been-freed/\" title=\"\">before being released on 14 August 2012</a>, following a review of her sentence. The tribunal judges did not admit there had been a judicial error, and she has not been awarded compensation or exonerated of the crime.</p> <p>T\u00e1bora's case is emblematic of women's experience under El Salvador's abortion law \u2013 one of the most restrictive in the world. Previous legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, a threat to the woman's life or health or severe foetal abnormality was repealed in 1998, and abortion was criminalised in all circumstances: even to save a woman's life. Abortion is punishable with up to eight years in prison, but if the foetus is deemed to have been viable, the charge is habitually converted to murder, which carries a sentence of 30 to 50 years.</p> <p>The effects of this criminalisation are causing widespread human rights violations and reflect systemic discrimination against women in the region. Full details of the scope and impact of abortion laws in El Salvador are documented by the Central America Women's Network (Cawn) in a <a href=\"http://cawn.org/assets/Maternal%20Health%20paper_final.pdf\" title=\"\">paper</a> on reproductive rights and abortion in Central America, published on 28 September to coincide with the <a href=\"http://www.september28.org/\" title=\"\">Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion</a>. As well as imposing criminal sanctions for accessing an essential component of reproductive healthcare, this has led to the arbitrary imprisonment of women who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth. There are at least <a href=\"http://www.contrapunto.com.sv/genero/entrevista-aborto-tortura-y-violencia-a-mujeres\" title=\"\">24 women with circumstances similar</a> to those of T\u00e1bora serving sentences of 30 years or more in El Salvador, and hundreds more who have been imprisoned for having an abortion. Young women from poor backgrounds who lose their babies come under immediate suspicion.</p> <p>The manner and speed with which reports are made \u2013 prior to any investigation or gathering of evidence \u2013 violates the right to the presumption of innocence and there is a systematic failure to uphold guarantees of judicial process, the rights to a fair trial and equal protection of the law. Women can be left to die from an ectopic pregnancy or obstetric emergency, can be denied life-saving treatment while pregnant if it could provoke a miscarriage and are reluctant to seek medical help after a miscarriage in case they are accused of procuring an abortion. Together, these issues constitute systemic discrimination against women \u2013 in particular those with a low income, rural women and adolescent girls.</p> <p>Lack of access to reproductive healthcare also affects women's ability to participate on an equal basis with men in public life. It has a particularly detrimental impact on access to work and education, perpetuating socio-economic and educational disadvantage, increasing gender inequalities and <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/persecuted1.pdf\" title=\"\">feminising poverty</a>: it shapes a society which is inherently unfair and unequal.</p> <p>It is accepted that the criminalisation of abortion <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/Sedgh-Lancet-2012-01.pdf\" title=\"\">does not stop abortions taking place</a>; it leads to unsafe, illegal abortions, which may take place in unsanitary conditions, often result in complications and death, and are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/en/index.html\" title=\"\">one of the main causes of maternal mortality</a> in countries where abortion is banned. The criminalisation of abortion translates as this: some lives are more equal than others.</p> <p>Nancy Northup, president of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, has <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-files-case-revealing-the-horrifying-reality-of-el-salvador\" title=\"\">said</a> that \"liberalising restrictive abortion laws, like El Salvador's, is essential to saving the lives and protecting the health of millions of women across the globe every year. Study after study has shown there are no positive outcomes to banning abortion outright.\"</p> <p>I'll take this further: there are only negative outcomes \u2013 not only for the individual women who are penalised or who die as a result of clandestine abortion, but also for any prospect of a fair and equal society.</p>",
  "<p>Radiohead and Ticketmaster have been accused of introducing an unfair ticket system that punishes fans who can no longer make it to the band's sell-out concerts.</p> <p>In an attempt to stop touts buying vast numbers of tickets and selling them on at a profit, Radiohead decided to use a \"paperless ticketing\" policy for their shows at Manchester Arena on 6&#xa0;October and London's O2 Arena on 8-9 October.</p> <p>Tickets for the gigs went on sale via Ticketmaster in March, and can only be collected at the venue on the day of the show by the person who bought them. The credit or debit card used to buy them must be presented on the day, as&#xa0;well as additional ID.</p> <p>However, since shelling out for tickets, many Radiohead fans have found they are unable to go because of unexpected work or other commitments, and are unable to sell the tickets back to Ticketmaster, or give them to friends or family members. Others have had tickets bought for them by well-meaning parents and are unable to collect them because they are not in their name.</p> <p>Some people who bought several tickets say that because they now can't make it, their friends won't be able to go either, because they have to arrive at the venue with the card-holder.</p> <p>Richa Manwani, a doctor, bought two tickets for the band's 8 October concert in London. \"I have found out that I am on call that day and am unable to make the event,\" she said. \"Only I can redeem the tickets on the night of the event with my credit card and photo ID. This means I have no way of selling them on for face value. Ticketmaster offers a no-refunds policy, which means I have lost my money.\"</p> <p>She added: \"I understand entirely the reason for offering paperless tickets to prevent touting and unreasonable inflation of ticket prices, but I think it is unfair and illogical to punish Radiohead fans and Ticketmaster customers who are unlucky enough not to be able to make the event.\"</p> <p>Paul Chambers wrote to Guardian Money after spending \u00a3288 on four tickets for the band's Manchester show. \"I can't go due to being away at work,\" he said. \"The tickets are in my name and I can't pick them up. My wife isn't keen on going to the concert without me but couldn't anyway due to my name and bank card being on the bill. I would gladly sell the Radiohead tickets to fans for face value but I can't due to the restrictions.\"</p> <p>Paul McCarren had tickets for the London show on 9 October, which were bought for him by his mother using her credit card. \"According to Ticketmaster, she must now be present at the concert in order [for me] to use the tickets,\" he told us. \"I live in Northern Ireland and would be flying over for the show; needless to say, she will not be coming over with me.\"</p> <p>Guardian Money first highlighted the problems that some people were experiencing back in July, when our back-page Bachelor &amp; Brignall column featured a letter from \"LC\" from Aberdeen, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/13/radiohead-ticket-refunds-policy\" title=\"\">couldn't make one of the London concerts because he was being sent overseas for work</a>. In his case, Ticketmaster agreed to refund him and sell the tickets on, but its approach to other customers appears to vary widely, depending on which of its agents deals with them.</p> <p>McCarren has now been able to get the tickets transferred into his name \u2013 but not without some effort. \"With some luck and a great deal of time spent on the phone, I was able to resolve the issue. Ticketmaster cancelled my previous order and then held the tickets for me, so I could purchase them with my own card. A great result, but not without a lot of hassle and money spent on the phone.\"</p> <p>Another fan, Victoria Spooner, was told by Ticketmaster that there was nothing it could do when she asked if she could pass her tickets on to a friend after she discovered her employer was sending her to Vancouver during the week of the concert. Yet another reader, Stephen Smith, says he was also turned down for an exchange or refund when he attempted to return his tickets for the Manchester concert.</p> <p>Jon Wiffen, a spokesman for Ticketmaster, told us the company was considering customers on a case by case basis. \"Terms and conditions relating to the purchase of paperless tickets are clearly outlined to customers at multiple stages during the purchase process, including the initial purchase page, the shipping page and the billing page. Information relating to their purchase of paperless tickets is also conveyed on the confirmation email they receive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Paperless tickets aren't transferable because this prevents those tickets being offered in the resale market. However, our dedicated customer services team are happy to work with both customers and our clients, be that the venues or promoters, if a customer's circumstances change.\"</p> <p>The inflexibility of paperless tickets is likely to become more of a problem as more bands and promoters start to use them to tackle the problem of touts. At present, Ticketmaster's UK arm is only offering paperless tickets for the Radiohead gigs and some of Michael McIntyre's shows, but it has used them for several other events during the past three years.</p> <p>In America, paperless ticketing is much more common. Fans there have set up the Fan Freedom Project, which is lobbying venues, sports teams and, in particular, Ticketmaster, about paperless ticketing. \"Paperless tickets sound convenient. But in truth, they're a nightmare for fans,\" its founders say <a href=\"http://www.fanfreedom.org/\" title=\"\">on its website</a>. \"As fans, restrictive paperless tickets mean less control, more hassles, no price competition and more fees paid to paperless ticketing companies like Ticketmaster.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government justifies a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/badger-cull-editorial\" title=\"\">badger cull</a> by claiming it's to help farmers. I have 35 years' livestock management experience, and I live in the heart of the Forest of Dean \u2013 the cull area \u2013 and I disagree. Killing badgers isn't the long-term or sustainable solution to bovine TB control that farmers so desperately need. Shooting badgers is politically motivated, not scientifically driven, and farmers need to realise they're being sold a lame duck.</p> <p>Over the years, I have managed some of the highest-yielding dairy herds in the world with consistently high levels of hygiene and disease resistance. Meticulous biosecurity and sympathetic animal husbandry are the key to stamping out TB in cattle, not shooting British wildlife.</p> <p>Farmers vilify badgers but TB is mainly transmitted cow to cow. So the solution to eradicating TB lies with farmers themselves who must accept responsibility for a disease that is all too easily spread back and forth within and between herds due to poor management, lax biosecurity and substandard animal care. A slow response in tackling the disease compounds the problem, which can therefore soon reach epidemic proportions. I have seen it many times with mad cow disease, foot and mouth and now bovine TB. Alas, the farming industry prefers to scapegoat badgers rather than tackling these fundamental problems.</p> <p>Water troughs are a reservoir for TB because they are rarely cleaned out. It's not uncommon for trough water to be left stagnating through the winter, collecting dead birds, rodents and various bacteria, only to be drunk by cattle in the spring. Badgers also use these troughs but it's unfair to isolate badgers when the culprit is the bacteria soup itself. Making troughs badger-proof is not rocket science, but more fundamental is the adoption of better hygiene standards by the agricultural industry.</p> <p>Lax biosecurity on farms is also a major factor. Cows infected with TB should be quarantined immediately, but they rarely are. Every farm should have isolation areas to separate these animals and prevent cross-infection, but they rarely do. Biosecurity is often ignored by farmers and poorly enforced by Defra. Infected cows can be left unquarantined on farms for weeks. Before a single badger is shot, the farming industry should get its house in order.</p> <p>We also need to improve cattle welfare. Farm animal stress caused by pain and suffering can reduce an animal's immunity and make it more susceptible to diseases like bovine TB. On too many farms, there are high levels of lameness, mastitis and rough animal handling. The average incidence of lameness in our national herd is a shameful 22%.</p> <p>This is lazy husbandry. We have a wealth of veterinary knowledge to eradicate disease, and in countries with more advanced control measures there are very low incidences of bovine TB.</p> <p>So as Defra ministers sign the death sentence for thousands of England's badgers, my message to them is this. Not in my name. Not in my name should you hoodwink the public into thinking that killing badgers will help struggling farmers, because you are betraying farmers with this unscientific policy. If you really wanted to help farming, you would help it reform and modernise, you'd actively support rather than hinder badger vaccination, you'd take the fight to Europe to green-light cattle vaccination. But instead, it's far cheaper and easier to just let farmers kill badgers.</p> <p>More than 120,000 people so far have signed an <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">e-petition</a> calling for the government to kill the cull. For the sake of democracy, science, animal welfare, conservation and farming, I hope they listen.</p>",

  "<p>If you are a foster carer in England, you will receive at least \u00a3114 a week to spend on each child you look after. The same applies if you foster in Northern Ireland, while in Wales it is more than \u00a3140. But if you are a foster carer in Scotland, the allowance varies widely, with one in five local authorities providing less than \u00a3100 a week for the youngest children.</p> <p>That's because in the rest of the UK, governments recommend a minimum allowance and expect all fostering services to give this amount to all foster carers. In Scotland, the government plays no such role, leaving local authorities and independent fostering providers to set their own rates.</p> <p>The absence of a national allowance in Scotland has led to foster carers receiving hugely differing amounts depending on where they live, and hundreds being out of pocket.</p> <p>Meanwhile, those fostering in England, Northern Ireland and Wales will, by law, be looking after a maximum of three unrelated fostered children at once (the exception being larger sibling groups). North of the border, foster carers might be caring for as many as seven unrelated fostered children, as well as any of their own, and struggling to give them the attention they require, meet their needs and support their education. They may also have to work with a separate social worker for each child.</p> <p>Scotland so often sets the standard for social care issues in the UK, but on fostering it has taken a back seat for too long. As the leading charity working to make foster care better across the UK, we have lobbied on the lack of minimum allowances and limits on the number of fostered children \u2013 known as placement limits \u2013 over the past decade. And now this work is bearing fruit.</p> <p>In early July the Scottish government published a consultation on its proposed <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Young-People/legislation\" title=\"\">children and young people bill</a>. From a fostering perspective, this legislation could not only bring Scotland in line with the rest of the UK, but actually mean that we are taking a lead.</p> <p>In addition to minimum allowances and placement limits, the consultation talks about pay for foster carers, something that has yet to be considered seriously by governments elsewhere. Across the UK, only half of foster carers receive any form of fee, with many of these being paid below the equivalent of the minimum wage.</p> <p>No other profession that works with children is expected to do so without pay. The <a href=\"http://www.fostering.net\" title=\"\">Fostering Network</a> believes that levels of pay must be comparable to children's residential social workers. And in our survey of children living with foster families in Scotland, released on Friday 28 September, the overwhelming majority (90%) said they were in favour of foster carers getting a wage or fee like staff in children's homes, challenging the commonly held view that children and young people in care do not think foster carers should be paid.</p> <p>Not only do we know these changes would improve the lives of fostered children and the families that care for them \u2013 thereby encouraging foster carers to foster for longer \u2013 we believe that they would help fostering services recruit the 1,000 new foster carers needed across Scotland.</p> <p>The consultation period is now closed, and we await the publication of the bill itself. Throughout its passage through the Scottish parliament, we'll be lobbying ministers and MSPs, and will be urging all those involved or interested in fostering to do the same. This is a once-in-a-decade chance to shape fostering for the next generation. This is the time to make foster care fair in Scotland.</p> <p><em>Sara Lurie is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.fostering.net/scotland\" title=\"\"><em>Fostering Network Scotland</em></a></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

Addressing an audience of City figures in London's Mansion House, Wheatley said: \"The reason we are here \u2026 is that we have been misled. The system is broken and needs a complete overhaul. The disturbing events we have uncovered in the manipulation of Libor have severely damaged our confidence and our trust \u2013 it has torn the very fabric that our financial system is built on.\"</p> <p>\"Today we press the reset button,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Governance of Libor has completely failed resulting in the sort of shameful behaviour that we have seen. This problem has been exacerbated by a lack of regulation and a comprehensive mechanism to punish those who manipulate the system\".</p> <p>Libor is set by a panel of banks asked the price at which they expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. The rates the banks submit are published on the same day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/wheatley_review.htm\" title=\"\">Wheatley proposes</a> that those 150 benchmark rates are reduced to just 20 \u2013 in five currencies and four maturities. More banks should participate in making submissions, but he is proposing that the individual rates submitted should not be published for three months to avoid a rerun of 2008 when, at the height of the banking crisis, rates were artificially reduced to avoid any stigma of appearing to be in trouble.</p> <p>The managers of the so-called submitters should be subjected to direct authorisation by the FSA, and a code of conduct drawn up for the operation of the rates.</p> <p>Wheatley's hasty review was sparked by the Barclays scandal which eventually led to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/03/bob-diamond-quits-barclays\" title=\"\">the departure of chief executive Bob Diamond</a>.</p> <p>Wheatley, who is head the Financial Conduct Authority, when it is spun out of the FSA next year, attacked the \"careless\" way the rate setting process was overseen by the British Bankers' Association, which will be stripped of any further involvement. A tender process for a new body to oversee Libor starts on Friday. Baronness Hogg will lead the panel selecting the successful bidder.</p> <p>Wheatley also wants the banks involved to \"stand up and take responsibility\".</p>",

But since her dad died, she's been shying away from everyone who wants to help her come to terms with it: friends, family, boyfriend. She's grieving, and is angry that her mum seems to want to replace her father by adopting another child.</p> <p>When she falls pregnant, Mandy has no one to turn to - her mother didn't want a child, she never knew her father. But she knows what family means and she's determined to give her child a sense of it than she had. </p> <p>As the two girls meet, both must question what family really means to them - and work out whether they can ever be part of the same one.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's private motor insurance market has been referred to the Competition Commission to investigate whether drivers are being hit with artificially high car hire and repair charges.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading announced on Friday it had asked the commission to investigate the market, after concluding that insurers were inflating costs for repairs and hire vehicles by \u00a3225m a year. The OFT believes that costs, such as supplying a rental car to a driver who is 'not at fault' for a traffic collision, are artificially high.</p> <p>Clive Maxwell, the OFT chief executive, said the regulator suspects competition in the motor insurance market is being restricted or distorted.</p> <p>\"Competition appears not to be working effectively in the private motor insurance market. The insurers of at-fault drivers appear to have little control over the bills they must pay, and this may be leading to higher costs for them and ultimately higher premiums for motorists,\" Maxwell said, suggesting the investigation could result in lower premiums.</p> <p>But Martin Andrews, the director general of the Credit Hire Organisation (CHO), which represents credit hire companies, warned the review could result in higher costs for motorists.</p> <p>\"We could see premiums soar as insurers try to make up losses as they are forced to pay out for replacement vehicles; or insurers will find ways not to provide replacement vehicles and not-at-fault drivers will be forced to make do and catch the bus,\" Andrews said.</p> <p>The Competition Commission has two years to hold an investigation and report its findings.</p> <p>Motor insurance premiums rose by 12% between 2009 and 2010, and by a further 9% in the first three quarters of 2011, according to the OFT. The latest data may be more positive for motorists.

In some cases the cost of these is more than \u00a31,000 above the going rate.</p> <p>\"Competition in this market does not appear to work well for drivers,\" said John Fingleton, chief executive of the OFT <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/31/car-insurance-industry-competition-inquiry\" title=\"\">in May when he announced a provisional decision to refer the market to the Competition Commission</a>. \"We believe the focus that insurers have on gaining the competitive edge through raising their rivals' costs means that drivers pay more than they need to for their motor insurance policies.</p> <p>\"Because insurers are distracted from competing primarily on the quality and value of service provided to insured drivers, incentives for greater efficiency may be reduced.\"</p> <p>The announcement in May followed a three-month period of evidence collection by the OFT after a previous investigation concluded drivers were being overcharged. The OFT then gave interested parties until July to submit their views on a referral to the Competition Commission before it reached its final decision.</p> <p>Among the evidence provided it discovered that, following an accident, insurers of not-at-fault drivers are adding on average \u00a3560 to the cost of a replacement car over a typical hire period.</p> <p>At the same time they are also paying referral fees of up to \u00a3400 to credit hire organisations, the businesses that provide replacement vehicles to drivers involved in accidents. They may also receive a typical \u00a3155 in referral fees from repairers, paint suppliers and parts suppliers, with that money clawed back through higher repair charges.</p> <p>The OFT also found that credit hire agreements tend to run for longer periods than direct hire arrangements, in some cases because the credit hire companies are deliberately delaying repairs.</p> <p>All these costs are passed on to the insurance company of the at-fault driver, with the end result being an increase in car insurance premiums across the board for drivers.</p>",

  "<p>Sally de la Bedoyere, the new chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.pfra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Public Fundraising Regulatory Association (PFRA)</a>, is determined to improve the UK public's perception of face-to-face fundraising.</p> <p>\"It's quite an English thing [to be so bothered by charity collectors],\" she says. \"On one hand I think the perception has got worse. It's quite an easy band wagon to jump on politically, locally or sometimes in the media,\" she says. \"An editor or writer might have had a bad experience and might have their own prejudices. But, a record number of people are signing up and there is record income coming to charities and their beneficiaries, that's the balancing act we've got to do the whole time.\"</p> <p>Following a dip in signups at the start of the recession, in 2011-2012 PFRA member charities enjoyed their most successful year of face-to-face fundraising since the regulation body was formed in 2001. It's the first time in that period that more than 800,000 new people have signed up on the doorstep and street, with people in the 18-24 age bracket most keen.</p> <p>Only 33 of the PFRA's 110 members do face-to-face collections, though de la Bedoyere would like to see more. The initial outlay can be offputting for smaller charities, but for the 110 who have made the investment, it brings in \u00a3130 million a year. \"The public, media and councils' image of face-to-face is on a rollercoaster\" says de la Bedoyere, who joined the PFRA last month after two years as director of income generation at the<a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.uk/home\" title=\"\"> RSPCA</a>. This negative image is often unfair, she adds. \"It's fine if there's terrible practice going on \u2013 that's one thing, but if people are just thinking 'I feel guilty, I don't want to know about this,' it's different isn't it.\"</p> <p>De la Bedoyere hopes new rules, checks and agreements will improve things. The Association has doubed its mystery shopping programme and has employed a full-time compliance officer. Additionally, last month it brought out a new best practice regime at the request of the<a href=\"http://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\"> Institute of Fundraising (IoF)</a>.</p> <p>The regime is more specific than the Institute's code of practice, explaining in more detail how the public can and can't be approached and states that fines will be imposed for breaches. In the hope of ensuring relations are as smooth as possible in towns and cities around the UK, the PFRA also encourages councils to work with them on what</p> <p>it calls site management agreements (SMAs). Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Fundraising/article/1111207/islington-council-seeks-ban-street-fundraising/\" title=\"\">Islington council</a> made loud noises about wanting to ban street fundraisers, but this is not legally possible at the moment. The PFRA is adamant that site agreements are the best option for councils, and has encouraged Islington to take this route. So far, this hasn't happened, but in 48 other areas, councils have signed up.</p> <p>The association introduced SMAs when it was founded in 2001. Up until January 2010, 25 agreements were signed. But the pace has quickened and in the past two years the number has doubled. Cardiff, Cheltenham Chester, Glasgow, Lancaster, Mansfield, Northampton and Richmond have all signed up this year.</p> <p>The agreements control where and when fundraisers can work and how many can work at the same time. They also consider local conditions \u2013 for example, not fundraising on market days. De la Bedoyere now wants to quicken the pace of signup. \"I don't think it's an unreasonable ambition to have doubled the number of agreements by the end of next year,\" she says optimistically. \"By 2015 we aim to have agreements or a conversation in place everywhere where there's a value.\"</p> <p>She urges charities to be accountable and clear about why and how they fundraise, too. \"It's not something that charities are used to doing \u2013 standing up and saying 'we invest in all sorts of ways of generating income, we have to, it's the only way we'll get the money we need'.</p> <p>\"I don't think we're ever going to make people love the sector. But I think it'll be less of a hot potato, less of an issue in the future with new agreements and rules,\" she says. \"I do think some charities might currently stay away or dip in and out because they're balancing a risk reputation. But, in five years' time, I think the perception will have changed somewhat and charities will feel more confident about face-to-face fundraising.\"</p> <p><em>Claudia is a freelance journalist.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The Who's Pete Townshend has explained his \"insane\" attempt to expose the spread of child abuse images on the internet, which resulted in his high-profile arrest.</p> <p>The songwriter and guitarist was eventually cleared of possessing illegal images of children in 2003, but not until after the scandal caused lasting damage to his image.</p> <p>At the time, he claimed to be looking at a website while conducting research for a campaign against images of child sex abuse on the internet. He was cautioned and placed on the sex offenders register for five years after admitting breaking the law.</p> <p>In an interview to publicise his autobiography, Who I Am, Townshend said his actions were a misguided attempt at \"white knight syndrome\" \u2013 his desire to be seen as a hero.</p> <p>\"It's a product of success. I had experienced something creepy as a child, so you imagine, what if I was a girl of nine or 10 and my uncle had raped me every week? I felt I had an understanding, and I could help. What I did was insane,\" he told the Times newspaper, which is serialising the book.</p> <p>He said he intended to reveal the financial trail of child abuse from Russian orphanages to British banks by paying a \u00a37 fee to access a child pornography site with his credit card, which he cancelled immediately, but he fell foul of officers investigating the sites as part of the FBI-led Operation Ore crackdown.</p> <p>As part of the cautioning procedure, Townshend's fingerprints, photograph and a DNA sample were taken by police and he was placed on a national register of sex offenders for five years.</p> <p>He said he felt attempts to try to clear his name following the scandal would prove futile. \"I've had the misfortune to read online comments where I'm judged as a paedophile because I've got a big nose,\" he said.</p> <p>Following a four-month investigation, the Metropolitan police said Townshend \"was not in possession of any downloaded child abuse images,\" but had accessed a site containing such images in 1999.</p> <p>Operation Ore led to almost 4,000 arrests, including those of judges, teachers, doctors, care workers, soldiers and more than 50 police officers.</p> <p>Who I Am will be released on 11 October.</p>"
