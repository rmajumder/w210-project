  "<p>Notoriously a man with little to say for himself, Kimi Raikkonen certainly made his words count as he sped to victory in Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p> <p>When his race engineer came on the radio to inform him of the gap to the pursuing Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, the Finn's reply was blunt and pointed: \"Just leave me alone. I know what I'm doing.\" Late in the race the same voice came through his earpiece, telling him to remember to warm up his new set of tyres. \"Yes, yes, yes, yes,\" he responded. \"I'm doing all the tyres. You don't have to remind me every second.\"</p> <p>I loved that. It seemed a wonderfully refreshing corrective to the phenomenon, by no means confined to motor racing, of turning sportsmen and women into robots controlled by technicians sitting on the sidelines.</p> <p>How pitiful it looks when tennis players \u2013 step forward, Maria Sharapova and the young Andy Murray \u2013 glance up at the coaches' box between every point, seeking approval or absolution, or when football managers \u2013 this means you, Rafa Ben\u00edtez and Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas \u2013 hop around their technical area, trying to micromanage the positioning and movement of their players. I want competitors to go naked into the arena, and to stand or fall by their own decisions.</p> <p>What Formula One fan has not winced at the sound of Ferrari's Felipe Massa being given advice by his race engineer, Rob Smedley? There was the famous occasion in 2010 when Smedley delivered a controversial semi-coded instruction: \"Fernando [Alonso] is faster than you. Can you confirm that you understood that message?\" Soon Massa was pulling over to let his team leader win the German Grand Prix. In Singapore the following year, when Massa and Lewis Hamilton were feuding, Smedley told his driver: \"Hold Hamilton as much as we can. Destroy his race as much as we can. Come on, boy!\"</p> <p>Should a racing driver need to be told to go faster or fight harder? But then not only does modern F1 give the drivers gimmicks to help with overtaking, it tells them exactly where on the circuit such a manoeuvre is permitted.</p> <p>It is an employee of Bernie Ecclestone's TV production company, sitting in the mobile broadcasting centre, who monitors the chatter between the teams and their drivers. He identifies what we might like to hear and brings it to the attention of the director, who pastes it into the broadcast. So we are allowed to listen to Driver A fretting about a lack of front-end grip, or Driver B being told to put in a couple of super-quick laps while a rival is stopping for a tyre change.</p> <p>While making inquiries about the protocols surrounding this form of supervised eavesdropping, I made an interesting discovery. Although the teams have no control over the selection of these snippets, they do have one weapon at their disposal: when passing information they are keen to conceal from others, they ensure that an obscenity forms a prominent part of the conversation.</p> <p>Consistent as these intercom exchanges may be with the increasingly scientific nature of the sport, they not only diminish a sense of the drivers' self-reliance but remove a precious element of uncertainty. The same is true of American football, where the quarterback and designated defensive players are allowed to wear helmets containing radio receivers, and to an even greater degree in cycling, where the UCI, in one of its more enlightened initiatives, is trying to do away with radio communication between riders and their team cars.</p> <p>Without their earpieces, Tour de France riders would return to the old-school reliance on blackboards carried by official motorbikes to inform them of the gap between a breakaway and the peloton. Such information is necessarily approximate and not quite up to the minute, meaning that the riders would need to make greater use of their experience and intuition. This is surely a good thing since it would reduce the chance of a day's racing turning into a game of two-wheeled chess and allow a brave lone break \u2013 one of the sport's principal attractions \u2013 a better chance of success.</p> <p>Ben Swift, Team Sky's gifted sprinter, had just finished this year's Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a when he gave me the pros' standard objections to removing the radio links. First, he said, it would be harder for the riders to get news of hazards up ahead. Second, the necessity for the team cars to spend more time alongside the riders would constitute a danger in itself, not just to the competitors but to the spectators on the roadsides.</p> <p>Good arguments, but not good enough. Cycling, like grand prix racing, existed and thrived for decades without remote communications. Kimi Raikkonen's unexpected outbursts were striking a blow for the past, on behalf of the future.</p> <h2><br>Alan Pardew blowing too hot and cold</h2> <p>As the final whistle went at Anfield on Sunday, Alan Pardew's instant reaction was to make straight for the referee, Anthony Taylor, with the intention of questioning him about the dismissal of Fabricio Coloccini. Interviewed later that evening, Pardew played it down and expressed sympathy for the plight of officials in the climate created by the Clattenburg affair.</p> <p>The incident and its aftermath took me back to August, and an altercation during Newcastle's home victory over Tottenham, when Pardew shoved a linesman who had failed to award a throw-in to his team. On that occasion, too, he strove to make amends with a gracious apology which may have served to keep the subsequent touchline ban down to two matches, and joked ruefully about having lectured his players before the match on the importance of following the example of sporting values set by the competitors in the London Olympics, which had finished a week earlier.</p> <p>Pardew's work at St James' Park has converted a lot of sceptics, as well as winning him an extraordinary eight-year contract. He would be even more widely admired \u2013 and save himself a lot of apologising \u2013 were he to gain control of his emotions before engaging in any future debate with match officials.</p> <p><em>richard.williams@theguardian.com twitter.com/@rwilliams1947</em></p>",
  "<p>The most political exhibition in the most political city in America currently occupies the circular galleries of <a href=\"http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/home/\" title=\"\">the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC</a>. As the US has been preparing to vote, the Hirshhorn has been showing work by Chinese artist and agitator Ai Weiwei, an exhibition that includes a load of rusty metal poles laid out on the floor, like a strange, monotonous rolling plain.</p> <p>These identical spindly struts come from schools that collapsed in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china-earthquake\" title=\"\">2008 Sichuan earthquake</a>. Ai Weiwei believes the deaths of thousands of children were caused by low-quality school buildings. On a gallery wall, he lists the&#xa0;names of the children who died.</p> <p>If you think this is a bit tangential to&#xa0;the US election, you have not been following its bitter rhetoric. In every TV debate between Republican candidate Mitt Romney and Democrat Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/final-debate-obama-romney-live\" title=\"\">the economic power of China has been an obsessive issue</a>. Television campaigns have harped on about the wickedness of the country: one, which is not officially acknowledged by either candidate, even portrays a secret meeting in China where sinister party cadres laugh at those American fools; <a href=\"http://www.artcritical.com/appel/images/mao.jpg\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol's portrait of Mao hangs in their villainous bunker</a>. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign, seeking to sow doubts among voters who credit Obama with bailing out the US auto industry, claims Chrysler now plans to outsource jobs to China. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/us-chrysler-jeep-idUSBRE89T15X20121030\" title=\"\">Chrysler vociferously denies this.</a></p> <p>Ai Weiwei's exhibition, no doubt accidentally, fits with this ramping up of anti-China sentiment. He believes in freedom. He believes in the individual. Indeed, you could almost say Ai Weiwei is more American \u2013 and more anti-China \u2013 in his politics than any of today's American artists. The ideals that he insists are universal are very much those of the country that still proudly calls itself the leader of the free world. So does this mean Ai Weiwei is in Romney's camp? Well, if that was true, he'd be just about the only major artist who was.</p> <p>A short distance from the Hirshhorn, walking through autumn leaves, I come&#xa0;to the soaring obelisk that is the Washington Monument. Not only is this dedicated to freedom but it is also, like Ai Weiwei's art, a minimalist masterpiece, despite being completed in the 19th century. Pure classical lines, no decoration, a towering truth: this is the focal point of a vast democracy that will tonight choose its leader. I can see, too, the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King made his famous \"I&#xa0;have a dream\" speech. And, hidden in the trees around the White House, I can make out firetrucks awaiting the presidential helicopter.</p> <p>American democracy is expressed in the neoclassical layout of Washington DC and its marble monuments. But what of the country's artists? Do they have any political vision to offer in 2012? Four years&#xa0;ago, US art was galvanised by Obama. He got their&#xa0;backing, financially and vocally; he also inspired them. Shepard Fairey's poster, showing the Democrat candidate's face and (in its most effective version) the word HOPE, captured the exhilaration of reborn liberal America. It is, arguably, the most recognisable image created by a US artist this century.</p> <p>But Obama has not inspired any comparable mood in the 2012 election. Back then, he was a blank slate; now he is an embattled figure whose first term can, by any standards, only be called a partial success. This does not mean he has no support in the art world \u2013 far from it. To look on the great works of modern American art in Washington's National Gallery is to see a veritable Olympus of Obama supporters.</p> <p>In its cool modern wing, I come face to face with the kind of ordinary, middle-class American both candidates are desperate to woo. Her name is Fanny and her face is 2.5m tall. <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/elements/texture/close.shtm\" title=\"\">Chuck Close painted this portrait with his fingers in 1985.</a> <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/chuck-close-makes-art-in-fund-raising-gambit-for-obama/)\" title=\"\">A supporter of Obama</a>, Close serves on the president's Committee for the Arts and Humanities, and his portrait of his late mother-in-law is an icon of US democracy, with a twist. The enlarged scale makes the face an emphatic celebration of individualism, but there's a warmth and tenderness to the work, too, a feeling of caring in no small way derived from Close's painstaking method of using a tiny-scale grid to help him build up his minute fingermarks. It gives this ordinary citizen an air of vulnerability, one that can be read across the country as a whole.</p> <p>If Americans are scared of China, it is because they are afflicted by a sense of national decline. The Republican response, articulated by Romney, is to&#xa0;reassert the \"can do\" spirit of free market America, while also promising to abolish such leftie notions as Obama's work in social health provision. <a href=\"http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Romney/Issues.php\" title=\"\">This, he says, is the American way</a>. But is that the true American character? The country's art suggests otherwise, and not just in the portraiture of Close, with its grand sense of human frailty and the implication that we must care for one another.</p> <p>Sculptor Richard Serra is another artist said to be in the Obama camp, along with the subversive self-portraitist Cindy Sherman, the visionary abstract painter Brice Marden, the performance artist Laurie Anderson, and the architect Frank Gehry \u2013 a gallery of living greats. <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Obama-wins-the-art-worlds-support/26590\" title=\"\">As a headline in the Art Newspaper put it this summer: \"Obama wins the art world's support.\"</a> Of course, these are not the sort of celebrities politicians usually crave: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9649201/US-election-Barack-Obama-is-winning-over-female-voters-with-Beyonce-and-Lena-Dunham.html\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9's endorsement of Obama</a> is worth more. In fact, American art, despite being at the forefront of the avant garde in the 20th century, currently has few household names. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture-cuts-blog/2011/may/16/art-emin\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin's vote makes the news in Britain</a> \u2013 but mention <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/20/paul-mccarthy/biography/\" title=\"\">leading US artist Paul McCarthy</a> in Los Angeles, where he lives, and people will think you mean Paul McCartney. (For what it's worth, McCarthy keeps a naked mannequin of Obama in his office. I&#xa0;don't know if that counts as an endorsement or not.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/cctp748/Serra-Five_Plates-Two_Poles-1971-NGA-MI-sm2.jpg\" title=\"\">Five Plates, Two Poles</a>, a sculpture by Richard Serra in the Washington National Gallery, looks like a call to vote Obama. The massive, dangerous-looking steel plates, balanced precariously against each other, evoke America's troubled industries; Serra uses steel mills to make his sculpture. Rust in colour and blue collar in status, this mighty sculpture suggests not the power and glory of the Republican individual making millions and bestriding the world, but the dwarfing of people by mighty machines and great cities. Running counter to the Republicans' notion of a chosen land whose people don't need a supportive state (just low taxes and free markets), Serra's work shows us the America its great artists have seen:&#xa0;a place of sorrow, suffering and&#xa0;vulnerability, chronicled with compassion. A more human America.</p> <p>Even the dead guys seem to be voting Democrat. <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/timage_f?object=55819&amp;image=13750&amp;c=20centpa\" title=\"\">Jackson Pollock's 1950 masterpiece Lavender Mist</a> keeps me coming back to the National Gallery. The skeins, strata, loops and scars on this beautiful web of colour speak of American freedom \u2013 but it is a tragic freedom, the freedom of the blues and jazz that Pollock played as he painted. Within months of creating this lovely riff of a painting, this troubled man would surrender to his old demon, booze, and in a few years he was dead in a drunken car crash. No one was more in need of help than this great American artist \u2013 and as a young man, he got it, <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/pollock/\" title=\"\">helped by the art programme of the 1930s New Deal</a>.</p> <p>Half a century before Pollock painted the blues, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens made a cast of his Shaw Memorial, portraying <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/home.shtm\" title=\"\">the Massachussetts 54th Regiment going off to die for freedom</a>. His tribute to this African-American soldiers, who fought for <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/s3000.shtm\" title=\"\">the anti-slavery cause in the civil war</a>, now sits in the National Gallery. African-American faces from a divided past bear witness to the fact that US history bears little resemblance to the Tea Party version promoted by the US right today \u2013 in which the entire American story is boiled down to (white) people versus big government. If Romney loses the vote, it will probably be put&#xa0;down to \"racial demography\" \u2013 as&#xa0;every non-white American votes for&#xa0;Obama.</p> <p>On the Shaw Memorial, you see the soldiers marching steadily towards an unknown future. It's a work that could be summed up in a single word: hope. If American art has a common theme, it is this deeply progressive impulse. It&#xa0;is why American artists, living and dead, vote Obama.</p>",
  "<p>You might be fooled into thinking that election day only features the presidential race. Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans will be voting on a whole host of local and statewide elections that will have a great effect both on their local communities and the national landscape.</p> <p>I'm not going to try to cover the House of Representatives: if you're interested in coverage of those, you can check the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political</a> or <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/\">Rothenberg Political</a> report. My own estimation, as it has been throughout this entire campaign, is that the Republicans will retain control of the House with room to spare.</p> <p>I will, however, run down some Senate races here. At the beginning of the year, Republicans looked primed to take the four seats necessary to win an outright majority in the United States Senate. That's when moderate Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine decided to retire, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/angus-king_n_2075691.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">leaving the seat open</a> for Democratic-leaning Independent former Governor Angus King. It's been all downhill since then for Republicans: poor Republican candidates who have made gaffe after gaffe, and good Democratic ones have left the GOP Senate effort staggering.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats look to split fairly equally the ten Senate seats discussed in detail in this article. All told, it looks like Democrats will maintain control of the Senate with 53 seats +/-2 (out of 100).</p> <p>To get more of an idea of how the Senate races will breakdown, including what times polls close, the polling averages and key swing counties, see below. I start with the earliest poll closing times. Keep in mind that swing counties are more difficult to pinpoint in Senate than presidential races, since swings can change from midterm (when these seats were last up for election) to presidential year and depending on whether an incumbent is running or not.</p> <p><strong>Group 1: poll closing at 7pm ET (Indiana's eastern counties close at 6pm ET)</strong></p> <h2>Indiana (incumbent Republican Richard Lugar defeated in primary)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Joe Donnelly (Democrat) +3.7 points</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008 presidential election):</em> Allen (-5.4), Madison (+5.6), Vanderburgh (+1.5)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Lake County on the Northwest Illinois Border, Marion Country (Indianapolis) in the center of the state, Monroe County (Bloomington home to Indiana University) in the southwest</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Indianapolis suburbs such as Hamilton, Hendricks, and Johnson County, rural areas that dominate the state outside the major population centers, and the South Bend (home to Notre Dame) suburb of Elkhart County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352152746697/mourdockt.jpg\" alt=\"richard mourdock\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mourdock (R-IN) Photograph: richardmourdock.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans had this seat locked with long-time GOP Senator Richard Lugar.

Donnelly is no \"progressive\", earning endorsements in the past from the National Rifle Association and called \"anti-choice\" on the issue of abortion by Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>The race had been a close battle, with Mourdock holding a small edge in this reddish state. It turned in Donnelly's favor after Mourdock made an ill-advised remark on the subject of rape and God in a recent debate. Unless the polls are wrong, expect Donnelly to win and for Democrats to gain a seat.</p> <h2>Virginia (Democratic incumbent Jim Webb retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Tim Kaine (Democrat) +2.0pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Henrico (+5.9), Loudoun (+2.0)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Northern Suburbs of Washington, DC, including Arlington, Alexandria City and Fairfax County, and Richmond City in the south-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Richmond suburbs of Chesterfield and Hanover, south-western Roanoke County and pretty much all the southern rural areas and western areas bordering the Appalachians</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352153739284/timkaine.jpg\" alt=\"tim kaine\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Kaine (D-VA) Photograph: virginiacops.org</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure you can have two more different types of politicians than George Allen and Tim Kaine. Allen, known for wearing cowboy boots and cowboy hats, is a former governor and senator who lost his re-election bid to the senate in 2006 after <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/06/george-allen-im-really-sorry-about-that-whole-1.php\">making comments towards an Indian American that were viewed as racist</a>.</p> <p>Kaine is the type of politician who would follow King Solomon's advice and divide the baby if he could. This triangulating \"middle-ground\" stance came across awkwardly during a debate earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/tim-kaine-47-percent-income-tax_n_1900567.html\">he said he would be open to federally taxing all Americans</a>, which would include the poor and elderly. He won the governor's mansion in 2005 on the strength of the new population growth in the north. He recently served as head of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>This race is very tight and either candidate could win. Kaine seems to be running a little ahead of Obama in the state. Still, there aren't many split tickets to be had in the Old Dominion. I would think whichever party wins the presidential election here is likely to win the Senate election as well.</p> <p><strong>Group 2: poll closing at 8pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Connecticut (independent Democratic incumbent Joseph Lieberman retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Chris Murphy (Democrat) +6.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Middlesex, (+0.6), New London (-1.6), Windham (+0.6)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> they do well in all the cities that dot the landscape, such as Bridgeport in Fairfield County.

McMahon is conservative on fiscal issues and a moderate on social issues (ie she's pro-choice and has an unclear position on gay rights).</p> <p>Murphy is currently a congressman from Connecticut's 5th district. In comparison to McMahon's unique background, he's a relatively boring politician. Murphy's a lawyer who's both socially and fiscally liberal. You might say he is the type of candidate you'd expect to win in a blue state such as Connecticut.</p> <p>McMahon was able to keep this race close through advertising. She hit the relatively unknown Murphy on past financial problems and a poor congressional attendance record. But like her race against the better known, current Senator Dick Blumenthal in 2010, McMahon looks to fall victim to Connecticut's blue tint. Obama won't win the state in a blowout, yet it should be enough to carry Murphy across the finish line.</p> <h2>Massachusetts (Republican incumbent Scott Brown running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) +4.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Bristol (-2.6), Hampden (-0.5), Middlesex, (+4.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Berkshire, Franklin and Hampshire County in the west, along with Suffolk (Boston) in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Barnstable and Plymouth in the south-east, along with Worcester in the center of the state</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154090928/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth warren\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Photograph: elizabethwarren.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure there has been a more fascinating race to watch unfold than this highly-financed affair.

Warren's bid to become director of the Consumer Protection Bureau <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/160900/house-gop-escalates-attack-elizabeth-warren-consumer-bureau\">failed when Republicans stalled her nomination</a>. Republicans may very well regret helping redirect this Harvard law professor's energies to winning one of their Senate seats.</p> <p>Brown and Warren bounced back and forth in the polls all year. Brown took a lead late in the summer because of questions surrounding Warren's American Indian background and how it impacted her being hired at Harvard. Warren regained the edge after being featured at the Democratic National Convention. She's held onto the lead in most polls, and is now the favorite.</p> <h2>Missouri (Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Claire McCaskill +7.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Clay (-0.5), Jefferson (+2.7)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Boone County (home to the University of Missouri in the center), Jackson (Kansas City) in the west and St Louis City and County in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere else, including Greene (Springfield) and the St Louis suburb of St Charles County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154282707/Todd_Akin.jpg\" alt=\"todd akin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Akin (R-MO) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a gimme for the Republicans.

She also faced an electorate that has become increasing Republican over the years. McCaskill's approvals had been in the toilet, and then she saw her opening.</p> <p>Republicans had a competitive primary, and the Democrat McCaskill decided to spend money pumping up Republican Congressman Todd Akin. It worked, spectacularly.</p> <p>Akin won the primary and immediately repaid the favor: in a television interview, Akin spoke of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">legitimate rape</a>\" and about the ability of the body to prevent pregnancy from rape. That turned a small Akin lead in the polls into a McCaskill edge.</p> <p>Akin refused to step down despite pleas from national Republicans.

Democrats have argued that the growing Latino population, along with a high American Indian presence, would put this state in play. It hasn't on the presidential level, but it <em>has</em> for the Senate.</p> <p>Fiscal libertarian Republican Jeff Flake had held a small lead in the polls for most of the year. He's also a Mormon in a state with a good-sized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints population. Democrat Richard Carmona brandishes bipartisan bonafides for <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/about/previous/biocarmona.html\">having served as surgeon general under President George W Bush</a>; he had actually been recruited to run as a Republican by some party leaders in Arizona. Painting Flake as an extremist, Carmona has turned his small deficit in the polls into a tie, or even slight edge.</p> <p>Flake, aided by National Republicans, fired back. They pointed to Carmona's past unflattering interactions with female co-workers, including an ad in which one former colleague called him \"scary\".

Few, including myself, thought that her liberal voting record would play in Wisconsin. It looks like we may have been wrong.</p> <p>Part of our confidence was because well-liked former Governor Tommy Thompson emerged from a very competitive Republican primary. Thompson's record of bipartisan accomplishments as governor were playing well, but analysts missed something key: Thompson's lead was built on name recognition; his edge collapsed once the general election campaign began in earnest.</p> <p>Wisconsin has a recent history of electing true progressives to the Senate. Russ Feingold served three terms before being defeated for a fourth in the Republican wave of 2010. Baldwin looks to build on this tradition.

Montana isn't one of them. Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Congressman at-large Denny Rehberg (meaning he represents the entire state in the House of Representatives) have been locked in a tight contest since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Tester won during the Democratic wave of 2006, thanks to a localized campaign that can only be described as brilliant. His flat-top haircut and farming background made voters feel like he was one of the boys, even though his political stances are slightly more liberal than the state's bent.</p> <p>Rehberg has taken pains to appear as a moderate voice in a state that may not be liberal, but isn't all that conservative either. Rehberg won't be out-done, either, on being a native Montanan. While Tester is a third-generation farmer, Rehberg is a fifth-generation rancher. Rehberg has had some issues <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927.html\">involving statements</a> made to a court regarding the role alcohol played when a friend crashed a boat in 2009.</p> <p>Tester looks to have neutralized any advantage Rehberg might have had because of Romney's expected strong showing in the state.

North Dakota is an example of when candidates truly matter, though they may not be enough. Democrat and former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp has run a campaign for the ages. Pointing to her North Dakota roots and playing on the fact that North Dakota is actually a fairly moderate state in non-presidential politics, Heitkamp has turned an expected easy Republican victory into a heart-stopper.</p> <p>Republican at-large Congressman Rick Berg isn't a disaster of a candidate. He just isn't a very good one. While Heitkamp has tried her best to localize the race and focus on issues such as farming in a state that has many agrarians, Berg has tried to nationalize the race: Super Pacs have spent millions tying Heitkamp to national Democratic positions \u2013 and that seems to have had some effect.</p> <p>Berg has open the smallest of leads in this open Senate race, according to insider information. If that's right, it just goes to show that the fundamentals do matter. One has to think that if Berg wins on Tuesday, it will hold out an example of what might have been for other red-state Republicans involved in tight races this season, such as Richard Mourdock \u2013 if they had only kept their mouths shut.</p> <h2>Nevada (Republican incumbent Dean Heller running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Dean Heller +3.8pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Clark County (Las Vegas)</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere outside Las Vegas and Reno (Washoe), including the Churchill in the west and Elko County in the north-east</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352155155283/Heller.jpg\" alt=\"dean heller\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Heller (R-NV) Photograph: Twitter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republican Dean Heller was appointed to this seat in 2011. Heller is neither a well-known brand nor a political titan. He benefits from having done little to offend and from fitting in well enough with the state's middle-of-the-road political profile. Put another way, Heller hasn't done anything to make the normal swing voter want to throw him out of office.</p> <p>Democratic Congresswoman Shelley Berkley is also moderate, but does not have the benefit of a squeaky clean profile. She's been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/09/politics/house-ethics-berkley/index.html\">subject to attacks</a> over whether she used her leverage in the House of Representatives to keep her husband's kidney transplant center open, despite Medicare officials wanting to shut it down.</p> <p>Heller would likely win this race if everything else were equal. The issue is that Berkley is going to benefit from strong Democratic turnout backing President Obama in Berkley's Las Vegas congressional district. Berkley will also be helped out by Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid's \"get out the vote\" machine, which helped him defy the pre-election polls in the 2010 midterms. Heller will be relying on a good rural turnout, including a large Mormon vote coming out to support Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Either candidate could win, but polls show a slight lean towards Heller.</p>",

  "<p>Like many Egyptian women, Nihal Saad Zaghloul is no stranger to street harassment. But it was one incident in particular that made the 26-year-old IT worker decide to do something about it. Along with some friends, she was attacked by a group of men in Cairo's Tahrir Square in June: \"They started groping me and grabbing (my) hijab. I lost my friends, I was terrified \u2013 some (other) men hid me behind a small kiosk.\"</p> <p>Traumatised and furious, Nihal <a href=\"http://zaghaleel.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/evil-vs-good/ Inbox  x\" title=\"\">blogged</a> about the incident at length, but writing wasn't enough. The following week, she formed an anti-harassment group, inviting about 60 men and women, via Facebook, to gather on Mohamed Mahmoud street, near Tahrir Square, to protest peacefully against harassment. They were set upon by \"about 50 men\", who groped the women and beat up the men. But Nihal was undeterred, setting up a website to post her blogs detailing instances of harassment. \"By July,\" she says, \"the movement had begun.\"</p> <p>Bassma, meaning imprint, because Nihal wants to \"leave a mark wherever we go\", now comprises a growing number of women and men who form street patrols, effectively preventing assaults on women in public by talking to the assailants and drawing attention to their behaviour. Wearing hi-vis jackets, the male patrollers walk the platforms of the metro in a bid to protect female passengers travelling on the women-only carriages. They form a human chain around the women and have never resorted to violence. They don't need to, says Nihal, because \"the more of us there are the more scared the harassers are to fight\".</p> <p>Bassma's presence during Eid was particularly welcome; <a href=\"http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/security-officials-727-cases-sexual-harassment-reported-over-eid\" title=\"\">727 cases of sexual harassment</a> were reported to the authorities over the religious holiday, which ended on 26 October. \"Eid, when more women take part in public events, brings with it sexual harassment. It kills the spirit of celebration for many Muslim women,\" says Nihal. She estimates that 15 individual incidents of harassment were halted during October's Eid celebrations because of Bassma's intervention. Of the 30-40 volunteers, most were men.</p> <p>Bassma's decision to seek out and intervene in actual incidents of harassment is radical even for established anti-street harassment activists.</p> <p>They have come into contact with aggression, violence and at least one incident involving a knife, and yet their numbers continue to grow. The Bassma patrollers are typical of Egypt's younger generation, weaned on the importance of protest and keen to establish a democratic, progressive society after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak.</p> <p>\"Harassment in Egypt has definitely <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/09/egyptian-women-protesters-sexually-assaulted\" title=\"\">become worse since 2011,</a>\" Nihal told the Guardian, \"because thugs can spread in the absence of state police. Women are targeted in protests to scare them off, so that fewer numbers will be prepared to go out and fight for their rights.\"</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Egyptians_Party\" title=\"\"> Free Egyptians party</a> recently called for constitutional changes to be made to end the \"the phenomenon of sexual harassment\" in their country, a call that has apparently been answered by the prime minster, Hesham Qandil, who said earlier this month that stricter sexual harassment penalties were being drafted. Currently there are <a href=\"http://www.awid.org/Library/Egypt-s-cabinet-plans-new-law-to-fight-sexual-harrassmenthttp://www.egyptindependent.com/news/pm-govt-preparing-law-stricter-sexual-harassment-penalties\" title=\"\">three laws</a> relating to verbal insults, indecent behaviour and sexual assault but rarely is an incident actually punished. \"The laws are hard to enforce,\" says Omar El Gabry, one of a growing number of men to join Bassmal. \"They require women to have enormous stamina and irrefutable evidence to prove a valid case.\"</p> <p>The position of women in Egyptian society came to the fore during the revolution when so many of them joined the protest on Tahrir Square. During this time, a number of foreign reporters, including France 24's Sonia Dridi and CBS's Lara Logan, were sexually assaulted while covering events in Cairo, bringing international focus to the kind of sexual harassment and assault that more than 83% of the country's women have at some point experienced, according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Centre_for_Women's_Rights\" title=\"\">Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights</a>.</p> <p>Professor Nadje Al-Ali, a gender specialist who has lived in Cairo, explains that just as crowd harassment has long been an issue in Egypt, so has the backlash against it. \"Egypt has a long history of feminist activity, but it was always active under the radar to avoid a political crackdown. What the events of 2011 did was allow those people to come forward and take a public stand against street harassment.\" Though Al-Ali can still recall brutal incidents of crowd harassment from decades ago, she highlights extremely high levels of youth unemployment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20053724\" title=\"\">90% of those without work are under 30</a> \u2013 as contributing to \"a crisis in masculinity that worsens the problem\".</p> <p>Anti-street harassment movements in Egypt such as Harassmap, an outreach organisation that gathers information on specific incidents of sexual harassment, is evidence of a growing unwillingness to endure street harassment. The recent case of Eman Mostafa, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/28/egypt-teen-girl-groped-spat-eman-mostafa-killed_n_1923237.html\" title=\"\">a 16-year-old girl who was shot and killed</a> by a harasser after she reproached him, so appalled the country that many Egyptians protested outside Assiut University, near where Mostafa lived.</p> <p>Omar El Gabry, a 23-year-old engineer from Cairo, was introduced to Nihal's work via Facebook. \"I am aware of the psychological consequences of sexual harassment on women and I fear that those effects might cascade to the next generation, which will be responsible for building the future Egypt.\"</p> <p>Nihal, who wants to be an educator rather than a politician, says the patrols are only the beginning. \"Patrolling is a painkiller that we use to help women walk on the streets safely. We want to expand into raising awareness in schools and universities. My ambition is to change how people view and act towards sexual harassment. I would like to see a society that genuinely understands the greatness they could achieve if only they would empower women.\"</p> <p>\u2022 In the original version of this article, Nihal's patrol group was called Zaghaleel. This is the name of the blog, which gave rise to the group, now called Bassma. A correction was made 6 November 2012 at 14.40</p>",
  "<p>This has been a great year for women in power in Africa with the election of a second female president, the appointment of the first female head of the African Union and not one, but two female Nobel prizewinners.</p> <p>In April we saw the election of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Banda\" title=\"\">Joyce Banda</a> as president of Malawi; in June, Gambia's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jun/14/fatou-bensouda-international-criminal-court\" title=\"\">Fatou Bensouda</a> was declared chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and in July <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18846210\" title=\"\">Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma </a>became the first female head of the African Union.

The magazine created the list to reflect the changes in relatively young states in Africa, where 16 countries have more female parliamentarians than the UK.</p> <p>The Rwandan parliament is made up of 56% women, while in the UK parliament women are languishing at a measly 22%. Rwanda is not a one off, in fact 16 African countries including South African (42%), Mozambique (39%) and Angola (38%) have a higher proportion of women in parliament than the UK.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the increasing visibility of African women in power translates to better prospects for women on the continent. \"The fact that we've now had three female heads of state shows that we are making progress,\" says Hadeel Ibrahim, executive director of the Mo Ibrahim foundation, whose annual Index charts good governance within Africa. \"If you look at our index, the area in which the most progress has been made is gender, but there's still clearly a long way to go,\" says Ibrahim. Lack of equality of opportunity \u2013 be it education or employment, poor maternal health, particularly in rural areas, and the fact that rape is being increasingly used as a weapon in conflict are just some of the frontline gender issues on the continent. For all the gains, women lead only two out of 54 African countries.</p> <p>It is too soon to say what difference their presence makes. A recent Gallup poll found that Rwandan women feel safer walking alone at night than UK women, for example, but in South Africa, where representation is also more equally split than in the UK, rape statistics are still shockingly high.</p> <p>More women in positions of power may lead to these issues being pushed higher up the political agenda, but for these conversations to be meaningful they must also include men. \"One of my frustrations in talking about gender on the continent is that it's always women talking about women; there aren't enough conversations about men, because in the end, women aren't beating themselves, they're not raping themselves, and we're not going to deal with these inequalities unless we understand what is frustrating and holding back our young men,\" says Ibrahim. There may be much more work to be done, but there are also many signs that the west should reconsider its image of what African power looks like.</p> <p><em>Hannah Pool is associate editor of Arise magazine</em></p>",
  "<p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has joined forces with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, to announce an international crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies.</p> <p>The intervention comes came as the business secretary, Vince Cable, weighed into the Starbucks tax affair by berating corporate behemoths for \"taking from the British economy and putting very little back\". According to a Reuters report last month, Starbucks has not paid tax in the UK for three years.</p> <p>Cable told the Guardian: \"At times of hardship, when tens of thousands of British companies are paying their basic tax, to discover that leading multinationals are getting away with it is not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Osborne said he and Sch\u00e4uble, meeting at the G20 finance ministers' summit in Mexico, had called for \"concerted international co-operation to strengthen international tax standards that at the minute may mean international companies can pay less tax than they would otherwise owe\".</p> <p>Neither was he eager to identity individual corporate culprits</p> <p>government sources said the spread of e-commerce, and the ponderous nature of international corporate tax rules had left governments trailing as multinationals shift profits around the globe.</p> <p>Osborne and Sch\u00e4uble said they would back work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to identify possible gaps in tax laws.</p> <p>Trying to balance his defence of low tax rates with the need to act against firms that repeatedly pay virtually no tax, Osborne said: \"We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.\"</p> <p>The joint statement by the two countries, a rare example of Anglo-German co-operation, admits, that \"international tax standards have had difficulty keeping up with changes in global business practices, such as the development of e-commerce in commercial activities.\"</p> <p>The two countries add: \"As a result, some multi-national businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.\"</p> <p>In the statement, Britain and Germany say they expect the first report from the OECD at the next G20 meeting in Russia in February 2013. The two men agreed their joint approach when the chancellor visited Berlin on Thursday last week.</p> <p>The co-operation comes ahead of a meeting between David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Starbucks has paid only \u00a38.6m income tax since 1998 on \u00a33.1bn sales, thanks to reporting consistent losses.

  "<p>The intensity painted on Andy Murray's face as he served to wrap up the opening match of the 2012 Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in three sets of varying quality against Tomas Berdych was, according to perspective, either mildly disconcerting or cause to celebrate.</p> <p>From the Czech's side of the net Murray \u2013 bouncing from foot to foot, swivelling his torso side to side in mid-air, eyes blazing, nostrils flared \u2013 must have looked like the original Raging Bull. But it is a fair bet that his coach Ivan Lendl, court-side for the first time since the US Open and inscrutable as ever, will have viewed Murray's body language with all the affection Al Silvani reserved for Jake LaMotta on those nights in the Garden when all was straight.</p> <p>Murray has not been this pumped up since the fifth set at Flushing Meadows this summer when he bullied an exhausted Novak Djokovic from tramline to tramline to win his first slam title. He has faltered here and there since in less glamorous surroundings but, in sight of the season's end, the adrenaline looks to be flowing again.</p> <p>In a packed arena hotter than a desert tent Murray was a ball of pugnacity when it mattered. If the crowd did not sustain the energy of the standing ovation they afforded their new hero on his entry, it was partly due, surely, to the warm air pumped into the room to kill the November chill.</p> <p>He took two hours and eight minutes to knock out Berdych, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, starting fast, losing his way, then finishing strongly, a pattern familiar to his caravan of chroniclers. Murray plays on Wednesday against Djokovic, who beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6, 6-3 in the evening match. It was tight most of the way, with sustained passages of excellence, and Murray will probably have a tougher time of it than when he rolled the Serb at the Olympics.</p> <p>Murray conceded after beating Berdych that blowing eight match points in three recent defeats concentrated his mind in the final moments on Monday.</p> <p>\"I was thinking the reasons why that had happened,\" he said. \"The match against Djokovic in Shanghai [when he lost in the final after holding five match points], I didn't feel like I did loads wrong. The one last week [losing to the 69th-ranked Pole Jerzy Janowicz in Paris], I said I was disappointed with. I rushed, didn't concentrate and focus as hard as I needed to. That was why I got broken. So today I focused on every point. I got myself pumped up. I took my time and served it out well.\"</p> <p>If there was cause to celebrate, there was room, too, for pause to analyse. While Murray's first-serve accuracy of 55% dipped below the accepted norm, he still managed to win every point on that first delivery in the deciding set, as Berdych's spirit and focus faded. Perhaps more significantly, 11 of Murray's clean winners came on the forehand, his new knockout punch, and only two from his trusty backhand.</p> <p>The first of those backhands arrived on his opening strike of the match, a devastating howitzer down the line off a second serve, and most of the subsequent signs in the early exchanges pointed to a routine win, as Murray's Czech opponent scrambled to save five break points in the first 25 minutes. But the switch went off in Murray's head. He dropped serve in the sixth game with a limp forehand into the net and let Berdych escape to 5-2 before regrouping, then coming again in the second set.</p> <p>The mood and tempo (but not the temperature) changed radically as Berdych cranked his power up in a mild panic and blew a couple of break points in the first two games. \"The biggest moment,\" Berdych said later, \"was at 1-1 when I had break point and hit a forehand just out. Who knows? An early break after winning the first set \u2026\"</p> <p>It was that indiscretion that revived Murray, who moved with conviction to 4-1. After 45 minutes, eight minutes longer than the torpor of the first set, he had drawn level. The numbers suggested Berdych might be favoured to close it out in the third; coming into the tournament, he was 12-6 this year in deciding sets, compared with Murray's 9-7 (2-3 since the US Open). Counterbalancing that statistic, this was also Murray's 12th win this year from a set down, \"comebackability\" matched only by Roger Federer.</p> <p>But this game is not all about numbers. The rhythm, disjointed as it was, favoured Murray's adaptability, invoking memories of how he made subtle shifts of power and placement to control the howling gale that roared through their semi-final at the US Open. There was not a whisper of a breeze inside the humid cauldron here, yet no lack of sweat-making moments. When Murray broke to go 2-1 up a quarter of an hour into the third set Berdych's ever-solemn features told a tale of missed opportunities. He never got back into the fight.</p>",

  "<p>Malawi has suspended anti-gay laws and ordered police not to arrest people who commit homosexual acts pending a debate on whether to repeal the legislation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/malawi-joyce-banda-discards-presidential-jet\" title=\"\">President Joyce Banda</a>'s government announced on Monday that it had imposed a moratorium on the laws until the 193-member parliament could decide on the highly contentious issue.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by Amnesty International as \"a historic step forward\", but local activists urged caution.</p> <p>Sections 153 and 156 of Malawi's penal code criminalise sexual conduct between men and anyone convicted faces up to 14 years' imprisonment, with or without corporal punishment. Section 137A of the penal code criminalises \"indecent practices between females\", with anyone found guilty liable to five years in prison.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/16/ralph-kasambara-lawyer-jailed-malawi\" title=\"\">Ralph Kasambara, the justice minister</a>, said: \"There is a moratorium on all such laws, meaning that police will not arrest or prosecute anyone based on these laws.\"</p> <p>The laws that criminalise homosexuality in the deeply conservative country will not be \"enforced until the time that parliament makes a decision\", added Kasambara, who is also attorney general.</p> <p>If the laws are found to be unconstitutional, he said, it would be an embarrassment to the government, but if they are found to be valid, police will be able to act. \"It is better to let one criminal get away with it rather than throw a lot of innocent people in jail,\" said Kasambara.</p> <p>In 2009, two men were arrested and charged with public indecency after becoming the first gay couple to marry in the former British protectorate. The prosecution drew condemnation from around the world including from Amnesty. Noel Kututwa, its southern Africa director, said: \"Amnesty International welcomes Minister Kasambara's statement and hopes it serves as the first step towards ending discrimination and persecution based on real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity in Malawi.</p> <p>\"We urge the government not to lose momentum on this basic human rights issue and to ensure the full repeal of these discriminatory and hate-filled laws.\"</p> <p>Gay rights campaigners in Malawi called for the government to go further. Gift Trapence, director of the Centre for the Development of People (CEDEP), which now openly operates in the country, said: \"This is a good stepping stone but we want a total repeal of the sodomy laws for Malawi to align itself with international human rights standards.</p> <p>\"Suspending is something else and repealing is another thing. We want the government to repeal these archaic laws.\"</p> <p>Trapence said CEDEP regarded the sodomy laws as \"still intact until they are repealed\" and said Malawians, who generally favour prohibition, should debate the issue with \"sober minds and remove all prejudices\".</p> <p>Chrispin Sibande, a rights lawyer, said the moratorium was \"very shaky\" because it was not supported by a clear legal order. He called the government move \"political goodwill\" that could change at any time.</p> <p>Michael Kaiyatsa, a programme officer with another leading rights group, the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, said the suspension was \"a welcome development and a step in the right direction\". But he said rights groups wanted a \"permanent solution \u2013 the complete repeal of sodomy laws\".</p> <p>Banda, who came to office in April following the death of President Bingu wa Mutharika, initially said her government would decriminalise homosexuality but later made a U-turn and said parliament was better placed to solve the controversial issue.</p> <p>A recent report presented to Banda recommended decriminalisation of same-sex marriages as a way of fighting the spread of HIV and Aids.</p>",
  "<p>Ask a senior academic about their PhD and they may recall their desperate scramble to break the silence by speaking to the postman in the mornings, or the supervisor who thought training meant breathing the same air as them every so often. Janice Robottom, who started her bioscience PhD at Leeds University last month, is already having a vastly different experience.</p> <p>At 33, she is embarking on a PhD researching biosensors having had children and a career in high-street banking. As well as two supervisors in different departments and a third tutor for independent advice, Robottom is relieved to know she is surrounded by lots of research students in related fields.</p> <p>Her studentship is one of 60 part-funded by a new Doctoral Training Partnership grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) spread across Leeds, York and Sheffield universities. Students will share training on science as well as softer skills like presentation. But, crucially, they are all part of a community. \"It's great to have other people in the same boat as you, whatever is going on in your research,\" Robottom says. \"It makes it all feel less isolated.\"</p> <p>There has been a decisive shift among the research councils to funding specialist doctoral training centres like this within key universities or consortia. Five of the seven councils now operate variations on this model, and the Natural Environment Research Council is set to follow suit. This echoes a clear steer from within government to concentrate pressured funds for training in areas of proven research excellence.</p> <p>This may seem uncontroversial \u2013 and the general idea of doctoral training centres has many supporters. Yet by focusing PhD training on a smaller number of top institutions, the councils are striking at the heart of the highly charged debate about what it means to be a university.</p> <p>Prof Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, says: \"I think if you've not got a doctoral training centre you're in real trouble. It's not the money so much \u2013 it's the kitemark. It's like musical chairs. The chair gets pulled away and if you've got nowhere to sit what happens?\"</p> <p>The ultimate fear is that if you are not marked as a flagship training organisation, other research grants might tail off too.&#xa0;</p> <p>Research councils are not the only supporters of PhD studentships, but universities outside of their chosen elite report that it is proving hard to find cash elsewhere. They are angry about the knock-on effect in the all-important Research Excellence Framework, which will distribute more than a billion pounds of government research funding. Data on research doctoral degrees will form a key part of their REF assessment.</p> <p>Prof Paul O'Prey, vice-chancellor of Roehampton University, says: \"What they are doing is creating a catch-22. If they limit research council studentships to the big players, that limits the scoring in the REF, and if you don't score highly in that you don't get studentships in the future.\"</p> <p>However, this is more than just a funding row. Unlike in the US, most modern British institutions remain fiercely resistant to the concept of teaching-only universities, and few are willing to give up training the next generation of researchers without a fight.</p> <p>Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the modern universities group Million+, says: &#xa0;\"It is really serious that the government is failing to track what's actually happening on doctoral training. It is not just a handful of universities who will produce the researchers of the future.\"</p> <p>The elite Russell Group fanned the flames last week with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/25/russell-group-universities-public-funding\" title=\"\">report urging the government to focus funding on the \"jewels in the crown\"</a> or risk falling behind globally. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/25/russell-group-universities-public-funding\" title=\"\">It quotes a \"strong body of evidence\" that doctoral training is best carried out in world-leading universities</a>. Million+ slammed the report as \"entirely outdated\".</p> <p>But the research councils argue that concentration was a fact of life long before their PhD policy shift \u2013 mirroring what is happening all over the world. Prof Rick Rylance, chief executive of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and chair of the councils' umbrella group RCUK, explains: \"Overall 75% of the AHRC's funding goes to 30 institutions and 39% goes to 10 institutions. That is pretty consistent across the councils. Concentration is already happening without any engineering: this is what peer review is telling us should be funded.\"</p> <p>Although the Medical Research Council hasn't officially switched to doctoral training centres, it follows the same principles \u2013 40% of its PhD funding goes to 24 universities, with automatic block grants for the 16 biggest players, including Oxford and Cambridge and University College London. Dr Peter Dukes, head of research career awards at the MRC, is unapologetic about the council's aims. \"It is all about quality over quantity,\" he says. \"We used to think it was our duty to pump out students, but now we are training the research leaders of tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Sometimes such a policy means that money is not neatly spread around the country. There is currently no BBSRC PhD training partnership in Wales, for instance. Prof Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, admits this is a concern, though he says universities like his should partner with English institutions to stem gaps. And he adds: \"I can absolutely see why people should be concerned about concentration, but keeping everyone happy can't be the priority here. We have to think about what will produce the top cadre of students to come into the sector.\"</p> <p>Sarah Worthington, professor of law at Cambridge University, and a member of a recent government taskforce on postgraduate education, agrees. \"My personal view is that the research playing field is global, not national, and the tough consequence is that training at this very top level can't be delivered by all universities,\" she says. \"Research students need more than a good supervisor; they need deep engagement in the full breadth of their discipline. That can only happen in an environment where there is a critical mass of teachers and like-qualified students.\"</p> <p>Critical mass has become a serious focus for research universities. Prof Nancy Rothwell, president of Manchester University, which has around 4,000 PhD students, says: \"I'm always concerned if a department has only two students as there is so much that needs to be done collaboratively \u2013 journal clubs, presentations. How can you justify running a workshop on intellectual property for two people?\"</p> <p>But there is a growing backlash in newer universities against the notion that volume trumps all. Prof Janet Beer, VC of Oxford Brookes University, says: \"I think critical mass is an overused phrase that doesn't really have much meaning. Scale is always raised as an issue, but modern research is very collaborative, often taking place across institutions and countries. In my field, humanities, that critical mass argument doesn't hold up at all.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's much to like about the countryside, especially at this time of the year, when it's about to come in to its own. One day soon, the hunt will come past, the racehorses will be out snorting and cantering around leaping and bounding. Women and men clad in tight jodphurs and slapping their whips against their boots will stride past, dogs at their heels. For I live in the shires, a strangely sexualised world full of innuendo \u2013 as inadvertently revealed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/04/david-cameron-texts-rebekah-brooks\" title=\"\">\"horseplay texts\"</a> between Rebekah Brooks and Cameron.</p> <p>In one of the texts, Cameron said he liked \"that fast and unpredictable ride\" \u2013 he was apparently referring to a horse lent to him by Brooks' husband Charlie, a racehorse trainer. Metropolitans have raised an eyebrow at this. But for country folk, this is exactly how it is. This is how everyone speaks here: it's all \"unpredictable rides\", \"interesting fillies\", \"stroppy mares\", \"a feisty handful\", \"a roll in the hay\", \"a good mount\".</p> <p>This is life among the horsey set in the country. It's all \"jolly good fun\", a bit Jilly Cooper's Riders meets HE Bates' Darling Buds of May. It's an outdoors life full of hip flasks and \"joshing\" around. There's a physicality in the countryside that just doesn't exist in the city. Sometimes, the outdoors can feel like one big gym, with all those hills to climb and horses to mount and muck to be moved. Horses sweat and steam and ripple with muscles. Blacksmiths do the same, always half clad, even in the winter, disrobing as the heat rises. Farmers stride around, guns slung over their shoulders, shooting pretty much anything that moves. The countryside can feel beyond rules, out of the norm, a place where the usual just doesn't apply. Politics feels a million miles away.</p> <p>Urban types tend to assume that Cameron fits right into this world, but I imagine he may still feel pretty confused by the huntin', shootin' and fishin' set in his Oxfordshire constituency. We don't do sophistication in the country. We do mucking out, bedding down. We smell of hay and straw and animals. People in the country look after their animals better than they look after each other. Horses are groomed and shone and talked about as if they were husbands or lovers or children. I have female friends who talk about \"my boy\" and they are not referring to their male children.</p> <p>There's a rather basic simple sexual energy to it. The hunting people that pass by my house wear colourful jackets (red or mustard, depending on the pack). They wear tight jodphurs, carry long whips, dig spurs in to the sides of their fiery steeds. There's lots of dashing about and drinking from stirrup cups. It's not complicated. People walk in and out of each other's kitchens, drinking, eating, boots on, no one is worrying about the state of the floor.</p> <p>Social rules don't seem to apply in the country. The polo set are constantly swapping partners and getting jiggy in horse boxes and behind the pony stalls during the long summer. The sexual innuendos behind it all are hardly subtle. Most men persist in thinking that if a girl can ride a horse, she is doing it for sexual thrills.</p> <p>There's a competitive element to it as well. Charlie Brooks obviously \"out-horsed\" David Cameron. It's like a test: \"Can you handle that beast?\" Cameron fell for it. We've all done it. I've got on and ridden horses I should have run a mile from just to prove a point. For men, it puts a question mark on their derring-do, their virility, their ability to be brave. How fast will you go? How high will you jump? People die hunting, they die eventing and yet that threat of death, paralysis or brain damage doesn't stop anyone. We all want to go faster, jump higher.</p> <p>The essence is, did David Cameron prove it? Did he pass the machismo test? \"Fast \u2026 uncontrollable \u2026 but fun.\" Well, he seems to have taken it in good humour, if nothing else.</p>",

This time-warp treasure opened in 1891 and boasts puppet shows, arts and crafts exhibits and workshops, the ruins of Crystal Pool, which once drew up to 3,000 swimmers at a time, and the Spanish Ballroom, where live bands set you to swing, salsa, waltz, or zydeco depending on the weekend. It's hard to tell whether the restored 1921 Dentzel Carousel, with its classic prancing ponies, appeals more to kids or parents, but it draws perennially big lines nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>Chesapeake ramble, Maryland: </strong>Novelist James Michener put the great Chesapeake on the map with his eponymous 1978 epic.

The 3,000-acre national battlefield \u2013 undulating farmland dotted with such landmark sites as Bloody Lane and Sunken Road \u2013 offers an introduction to one of the most violent wars ever fought.

  "<p>The Texas 25th US congressional district is not what it used to be. Once a solid Democratic constituency built around Austin, the state's liberal capital, it is now an elongated hodgepodge of urban dwellers, farmers and military families extending 180 miles north to the edge of Fort Worth. And it's about to elect a Republican.</p> <p>That is by design.</p> <p>After months of legal battles reaching to the supreme court, Texas is holding elections for the US Congress and state legislature in November based on constituency maps a federal court has described as planned by Republican lawmakers with \"discriminatory intent\".</p> <p>Democrats and civil rights groups say the intent is to neutralise a rapid expansion of the Latino vote and rig individual elections in favour of Republican candidates, strengthening the party's hand in the US Congress and helping it maintain a hold on the Texas legislature.</p> <p>\"It's a power grab,\" said Elaine Henderson, the Democratic candidate for Congress in the newly drawn 25th district. \"The Republicans are trying to stave off the inevitable. The Hispanic vote is coming, and it's with us, not them.\"</p> <p>Republicans acknowledge that they have carved up districts to dilute the impact of the swelling Latino vote, which leans strong toward the Democrats. But they balk at accusations of racism, saying it's just Texas politics as usual. But civil rights activists say that even if the intent is political, the outcome is racist.</p> <p>Democrats have told federal courts that the maps \"grossly misrepresent the demographics\" of Texas and are part of a wider attempt by conservatives in several states to turn back the gains of the civil rights era.</p> <p>According to the 2010 census, Texas's population grew by 4.2m over the previous decade \u2013 a 20% rise. That earned Texas four more seats in Congress at the expense of states in the midwest and north-east.</p> <p>But the census also showed that the bulk of that increase \u2013 63% \u2013 was Latino. That, combined with a significant rise in the number of African Americans and Asians, has for the first time made Texas a \"minority-majority\" state with a little more than half the population Hispanic, black or Asian.</p> <p>The increase in the number of white people in Texas was so small that on its own it would not be enough to qualify for a single new seat in Congress. Yet civil rights lawyers say Republican legislators have redrawn electoral maps so that not a single additional Latino or African American will be elected to Congress in Texas, while the Republican party will probably pick up two and possibly three of the new districts. Something similar is happening in elections to the state legislature.</p> <p>\"You cannot responsibly morally or legally respond to the census with the maps the Republicans drew which arguably produce zero new minority seats,\" said Harold Cook, a Democratic political strategist <a href=\"http://www.lettersfromtexas.com/\">who in 2003 organised a mass departure</a> of his party's state Senators into neighbouring New Mexico in order to prevent a quorum and block an earlier bid at gerrymandering.</p> <p>\"What the Republicans have been doing is drawing seats so that minorities cannot win them and Republicans are protected from the growing Latino vote. It's not only redistricting. There are voter ID laws, more stringent regulations on registering to vote. It's all about trying to hold off this tide of minority voters that are going to swamp the Republicans in this state. But in the end they won't be able to stop it.\"</p> <p>One of the most brazen cases of gerrymandering is the 27th congressional district on the east Texas coast. For 26 years it was held by a Latino and Democrat, Solomon Ortiz.</p> <p>In 2010, a Tea Party Republican, Blake Farenthold, took the district by just 800 votes as part of the nationwide backlash against Barack Obama that saw rightwing Republicans mobilised while much of the Latino vote stayed at home. Farenthold was almost certain to lose the seat in November, but then the Republican map designers stepped in.</p> <p>They lopped off a chunk of the south end of the constituency packed with Latino voters, including the border city of Brownsville, and then added a clutch of counties to the north and west around Corpus Christi with a sizeable chunk of white voters. </p> <p>In doing so, the 27th district went from 70% Latino to less than 50%. The result is that Farenthold is now considered a safe bet for re-election.</p> <p>Ryan Downton, a Republican lawyer who played a leading role in redrawing the congressional electoral map, admitted that was the intent at a court hearing in January. \"We drew Farenthold a more Republican district,\" he said.</p> <p>Downton conceded the same intent in manipulating the boundaries of the 23rd district, which runs from San Antonio to El Paso, to favour a Republican incumbent, Francisco Canseco \u2013 the party's only Latino congressman from Texas.</p> <p>A Republican official, who does not wish to be named because of the continuing legal action, acknowledged that boundaries were redrawn for partisan advantage.</p> <p>\"It's a political draw,\" he said. \"I certainly don't think it's undemocratic. There's an element of human nature that says to the victor goes the spoils.\"</p> <p>Texas will have 36 seats in the next US Congress. But the number of Latino representatives from the state is likely to remain static at five, the same as in the present 32-seat Texas delegation.</p> <p>Republicans say that is because Democratic primary voters have chosen white, not Latino, candidates even in districts with a substantial number of Hispanic voters. But Luis Roberto Vera, chief counsel for League of United Latin American Citizens, has argued before the supreme court that it is a result of the way Latino voters have been parcelled out to diminish their impact.</p> <p>\"How do they do it? We call it cracking and packing,\" he said.</p> <p>Cracking breaks concentrations of Latino and other minority voters and distributes them among mostly white conservative-leaning districts so they are overwhelmed by Republican voters. But that is not always possible, in which case as many minority voters as possible are packed in to a single district so the impact of their ballots is diminished.</p> <p>\"They draw districts that are packed with minorities \u2013 80 or 90% when all we need to win is 55% \u2013 or they spread us out thinly. They crack us up to divide the vote or pack us all together. Whatever they need to do to suppress the Latino vote,\" said Vera.</p> <p>For instance, in Austin \u2013 a city with a nearly 60% increase in Latinos over the past decade \u2013 voters who once lived in one of two congressional districts are now carved up between six, greatly diluting their impact because they have mostly been parcelled off to Republican constituencies where they are overwhelmed by conservative voters. Almost every other US city of similar size, such as Detroit, Memphis and San Francisco, is divided between two congressional districts.</p> <p>The breaking up of the vote in Austin appears in part to have been aimed at levering a sitting Democrat from office.</p> <p>The 25th district used to be a safe seat for a Democratic congressman, Lloyd Doggett. But it has virtually been drawn out of existence by the Republican legislature \u2013 nine years after a similar move against him was blocked by the courts. Doggett went in search of a more viable seat and fought his way through a primary to contest a district east of Austin, where he is expected to be elected. </p> <p>Henderson is now struggling against the odds in what was Doggett's old district in name if not geography. She regards the redrawing of the 25th's boundaries as a blatant Republican move to get rid of Doggett because he was popular with Latino voters and influential in Washington.</p> <p>\"I saw the redistricting as a way to divide Austin up enough that even Lloyd wouldn't have his seat anymore. They thought they could redistrict Lloyd out of a seat, the Democrat from the area,\" she said. \"This district is totally new. I don't think it's ever been like this. I think they thought they were making a nice safe district for a Republican out of this.\" </p> <p>A Republican official intimately involved in drawing the new electoral maps, who does not wish to be named because of the continuing legal action, acknowledged as much when Henderson's allegation was put to him.</p> <p>\"There are ways to draw maps that could have assured [Doggett's] election,\" he said.</p> <p>So does that mean the map was drawn to try and remove Doggett?</p> <p>\"You could certainly draw that inference,\" he said. \"It's not a stretch to believe that.\"</p> <p>The Republican official said that while the courts will strike down maps drawn to discriminate against minority voters, they will let stand politically partisan boundaries. He said the accusations of racism are unjustified and that Texas legislatures have a long history of redrawing election boundaries for partisan advantage.</p> <p>\"Nobody likes being called a racist,\" he said. \"We don't have people over there [in the legislature] who are old-school racist.\"</p> <p>The new boundaries were also drawn to move facilities such as medical centres and sports grounds to districts under Republican control, and so that some black Democratic members of Congress found their district offices were no longer in their districts. </p> <p>The Republicans have not had it all their own way. They wanted to take two mostly African American districts in Dallas and merge them into one but were prevented from doing so by a provision of the Voting Rights Act, a piece of civil rights era legislation.</p> <p>But on the whole the Republicans have got what they wanted after a series of court battles which saw federal judges substantially redraw the state legislature map earlier this year only for the supreme court to order the lower court to redraw it again based on the Texas legislature's original design. However, a federal court has ordered that the map again be revisited after next month's election. </p> <p>It is a similar picture in the state legislature. Redistricting is expected to give Republicans seven of the nine new seats there, again in the face of demographic changes that suggest movement should be in the other direction. That will help the party retain its majority and continue to gerrymander elections. </p> <p>The anonymous Republican official involved with drawing up the new maps said they are not discriminatory.</p> <p>\"If you look back at the senate map of 31 seats, when we started Latinos had seven seats. When we finished they had seven seats,\" he said.</p> <p>But Vera said that does not take account of the rapid rise in the number of Latinos living in Texas. </p> <p>Vera acknowledges that part of the reason Republicans can get away with it is the relatively low turnout of Latino voters. Of more than 4 million Hispanic Americans of voting age living in Texas, just 1 million voted in the 2010 elections, whereas much higher proportions of white and African American voters turned out.</p> <p>\"I hate these people that discriminate and they way they do it. But at the same time I realise that it's also our fault. We don't vote. The Republican party knows that when push comes to shove the Latino community votes less than anyone,\" said Vera. </p> <p>\"As long as we're not voting, that's what gives them the power to do what they do. Redistrictings are done by the groups in power. Every report shows that if the Latino community came our and voted their numbers we could easily control every election in Texas. We'd be the swing vote, the winning vote.\"</p>",
  "<p>The anti-guns campaigner Pat Regan, two of whose six sons were shot in gang violence, was stabbed to death by a mentally ill grandson, an inquest has heard.</p> <p>Rakeim Regan, who was 21 at the time of the attack, in Leeds in May 2008, suffered delusions that his grandmother, whom he had idolised, was \"conspiring with police to get him\", the city's coroners court was told.</p> <p>He was diagnosed with severe paranoid schizophrenia after the tragedy, in which he stabbed Regan, 53, many times in the head and neck at her flat, where he had spent the night after she went with him to a local hospital.</p> <p>The inquest was told his self-esteem had collapsed after a series of psychiatric problems, and he had contacted a plastic surgeon and hidden all the mirrors in his family's house.</p> <p>Rakeim, who has been detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital since the diagnosis, suffered a sharp deterioration in the days before the killing, his mother, Frances Regan, told the inquest. She said she believed he should have been sectioned under mental health legislation and required to have hospital treatment.</p> <p>He was not by nature violent but \"a sensitive boy, quiet and laid back\", she said, but he had started smoking cannabis at the age of 11 and had continued covertly. She was convinced that this had had an effect on his mental health. She had never seen him using the drug but had found a photograph of him smoking a joint at a friend's party two years after he got drunk for the first time, aged only nine.</p> <p>She said she had found cannabis in one of his pockets when he was 15, at a stage when he would light joss sticks in his bedroom, apparently to disguise the smell of the drug. He was later excluded from school because of cannabis use.</p> <p>Rakeim had suffered what his mother called a mini-breakdown when his uncle Danny was shot dead in St Helens, Merseyside, in December 2002. This was the tragedy that led to Pat Regan taking a leading role in the campaign group Mothers Against Guns.</p> <p>A school dropout, Danny was thought to have been shot by drug dealers who have never been traced. Another of her sons was then shot and wounded in a Leeds nightclub, increasing her determination to speak out.</p> <p>Tributes at her death included one from the then home secretary, Jacqui Smith, who said: \"She worked tirelessly and achieved a great deal, going into schools and educating young people on the dangers of joining gangs and carrying weapons.\"</p> <p>Her oldest surviving son, Shane, said at the time: \"She dedicated her life to stopping violence like this. She was one of the most genuine people you could ever meet. She died for what she believed in and what she was trying to stop.\"</p> <p>Frances Regan told the inquest her son had got on the wrong side of the police, and that she agreed with his belief that the police had been harrassing him. After the stabbing, he had told her he believed his grandmother was part of the conspiracy.</p> <p>She said: \"He heard her talking on the phone and felt she was colluding with the police. He felt she was talking to the police and they were coming to get him.\"</p> <p>The inquest is expected to last a fortnight.</p>",
  "<p>HSBC is braced for fines from the US authorities of at least $1.5bn (\u00a3940m) \u2013 one of the largest in the financial services industry \u2013 for laundering billions of dollars, and warned on Monday that the final penalties could be even greater.</p> <p>The scale of the potential cost of the revelations contained in <a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/media/hsbc-exposed-us-finacial-system-to-money-laundering-drug-terrorist-financing-risks\" title=\"\">a US Senate report</a>, which showed how billions of dollars were laundered into the US for drug barons and terrorists, came as the bank set aside an additional $800m in the third quarter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/30/hsbc-700m-money-laundering-apology\" title=\"\">on top of the</a> $700m set aside at the half year.</p> <p>Stuart Gulliver, the bank's chief executive, admitted even more money may be needed to cover the actions that it faces from a number of US regulators under anti-money-laundering laws covered by the Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control. The bank also warned there was a \"high degree\" of uncertainty about the fines and that it could also face \"corporate criminal as well as civil charges and the imposition of significant fines, penalties and/or monetary forfeitures\".</p> <p>\"We are actively engaged in discussions with US authorities to try to reach a resolution, but there is not yet an agreement. The US authorities have substantial discretion in deciding exactly how to resolve this matter. Indeed, the final amount of the financial penalties could be higher, possibly significantly higher, than the amount accrued,\" Gulliver said.</p> <p>He put his own reputation on the line. \"It's up to me and my team to restore the trust of the public and the reputation of the firm,\" Gulliver said, adding that a \"number of people have left the bank or had clawback according to their compensation\" but he refused to say how many.</p> <p>\"We deeply regret our past failings and we must work individually and as an industry to rebuild trust,\" said Gulliver, who was appointed 20 months ago during a boardroom reshuffle caused by Stephen Green's decision to resign as chairman, accept a peerage and become a government trade minister. He conceded the money laundering allegations, which date back to 2002 when Green was at the helm, had \"undoubtedly damaged\" the HSBC brand.</p> <p>A further provision for UK \"customer redress programmes\" \u2013 largely the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal \u2013 led to a further $353m charge, taking the total to $2.1bn. HSBC is the last of the major UK banks <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/1/2//investor-relations/financial-info\" title=\"\">to report its third-quarter results</a> during which PPI has emerged as the costliest mis-selling scandal in the UK. HSBC's PPI provision could also rise further.</p> <p>The provisions led to a fall in pre-tax profit in the third quarter to $3.5bn, compared with $7.1bn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/09/hsbc-eurozone-crisis-investment-banking-loss\" title=\"\">in the same quarter last year</a>. Some $5.8bn of the fall was due to changes in the value of the bank's debt and it stressed that underlying profits were $5bn. HSBC's shares closed 1.2% lower at 618p.</p> <p>The results were overshadowed by the damaging US Senate report that described the bank as having a \"pervasively polluted\" culture that exposed the bank to not only drug-trafficking but also financing of terrorism.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">At a hearing before the Senate in July</a>, David Bagley, HSBC's head of compliance, dramatically resigned. According <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/indivBasicDetails.do?sid=468895\" title=\"\">to the register</a> maintained by the Financial Services Authority, Bagley remains with the bank although last week the bank named his successor \u2013 only in an \"acting\" capacity \u2013 as board adviser David Shaw. It is not immediately clear what Bagley's future role will be.</p> <p>The bank, which under Gulliver has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/01/hsbc-confirms-30000-jobs-will-go\" title=\"\">embarked on a retrenchment from some of its international outposts</a>, has cut 22,000 roles so far this year to take its workforce to 267,000. Around 15,000 of these roles went when businesses were sold off, so more roles would need to go by the end of 2013 to achieve his target to cut 30,000 roles in total, Gulliver said.</p> <p>\"We have announced 24 disposals and closures this year, including eight since 30 June, making a total of 41 since the beginning of 2011, exiting non-strategic markets and selling businesses and non-core investments,\" Gulliver said.</p>",

  "<p>The Museum of London has offered a home to the Henry Moore sculpture Draped Seated Woman \u2013 affectionately known as Old Flo during her decades sitting in an East End housing estate \u2013 to save it from being sold off by Tower Hamlets council.</p> <p>The move by the museum follows protests, among them from the artist's daughter Mary, the film director Danny Boyle, the Tate gallery's director Sir Nicholas Serota, and many other artists and public figures, over a decision by Lutfur Rahman, mayor of Tower Hamlets, to sell the sculpture. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/henry-moore-sculpture-tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">The cash-strapped council believes it can raise up to \u00a320m, and save the maintenance, security and insurance costs of displaying it.</a></p> <p>The Museum of London is the second public institution to volunteer to house and display the statue: Queen Mary's College is also willing to find a place where the public can continue to enjoy it \u2013 and in London rather than the Yorkshire sculpture park where it has been on loan for more than a decade, since the council demolished the tower blocks and redeveloped the Stifford estate, its original home.</p> <p>The Museum of London believes that either of its traffic-free, CCTV-monitored and security-patrolled sites, high up in the Barbican estate or in Docklands, would give the statue a safe and fitting home.</p> <p>The museum's director, Sharon Ament, said: \"The Museum of London's offer to put Draped Seated Woman on free, public display would enable everyone to enjoy and derive meaning from this significant artwork. As the leading museum for London we would help build an enduring cultural legacy for the affectionately named Old Flo.</p> <p>\"As <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/nov/03/letters-henry-moore-tower-hamlets\" title=\"\">Henry Moore's daughter Mary said in her letter to the Observer</a>, this art work was created with 'the belief that everyone, whatever their background, should have access to works of art of the highest quality'. I firmly support this idea which echoes our purpose at the Museum of London to preserve the heritage of our capital city for everybody without prejudice.\"</p> <p>The bronze sculpture weighs 1.5 tonnes and stands almost three-metres tall. It was sold to the old London county council by Moore for \u00a36,000, a bargain even in 1962, because he wanted it displayed in a public place.</p>",
  "<p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">a woman in West Virginia asked</a> Republican House speaker John Boehner \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>But that didn't stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/republican-task-animating-romney\">Romney's handlers trying</a>. They employed his wife Ann to soften him, invoked his Mormon religion to humanise him, and even called upon Clint Eastwood to vouch for him. But in the end, Boehner was right. The American people were never going to fall in love with him. Indeed, he could <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-2-2012/indecision-2012---endless-suffrage-2012---jump-on-the-bandwagon-edition\">barely</a> get his own party to fall in love with him. Even his running mate, Paul Ryan, waited until the primaries were nearly over and his nomination inevitable, to endorse him with this warm embrace: \"I think we're entering a phase where it could become counterproductive if this drags on much longer, so that's why I think we have to coalesce as conservatives around Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Luckily for Romney, they didn't have to love him. In the six years he's been running for president, he's been reintroduced to the public several times to no avail. But when it came down to it, the public needed just 90 minutes during the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/presidential-debate-romney-winner\"> first debate </a>to change their minds. It is telling that while almost everyone concedes he won the night almost nobody can remember a single thing he said. His victory was, in no small part, a reflection of Obama's hapless, hopeless defeat. But it was more than that. He may not have been loveable. But he was plausible \u2013 as a candidate, a human being and a potential president. And that was all he needed to be. Thanks to Obama's weaknesses the bar had been set incredibly low. He didn't even have to skip over it. Just a sure-footed step in the right direction sufficed.</p> <p>From then on, as his poll numbers rose and his confidence grew, the stench of possible victory attached itself to him, overpowering concerns about his likeability and authenticity. That was the smell that permeated the amphitheatre in suburban Denver on Saturday night as several thousand gathered in high spirits to hear the Republican standard-bearer. Unlike most Republican rallies earlier this year, including the convention, they were not going through the motions. They wanted to be there. Spontaneous chants of \"three more days\" rang out among a crowd in boisterous and belligerent mood. Every time Obama's name was mentioned, a man in front shouted, to general approval: \"He's a bum\". While most have clearly warmed to Romney, most there seemed more motivated by their fervent opposition to Obama. Nonetheless, the tone of disappointment rather than anger the Romney campaign had adopted clearly resonated with some. \"Obama's a great man,\" the man behind me whispered to his partner. \"He's just a terrible leader.\"</p> <p>Polls show a narrow majority of Americans believe Obama will win. At least one bookie is already paying out on an Obama victory. But the overwhelming majority of Republicans (71%) believe <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158444/americans-give-obama-better-odds-win-election.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines\">Romney will be the victor</a>. They may be right.</p> <p>Romney is, in many ways, an inadequate conduit for all of this excitement. More comfortable with a PowerPoint presentation than a podium, his arrival on stage marks the end of expectation and the beginning of a more pedestrian affair. He appears without trace and delivers a checklist of Obama's failures and his own plans. It's a workmanlike strategy, which satisfied but hardly roused the Denver audience. The high point of the night came not with a searing indictment of Obama or a soaring projection of a Romney presidency, but with the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/a-character-in-a-romney-campaign-anecdote-appears-on-the-trail/\">introduction of a scoutmaster</a> with the American flag that survived the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986. \"That is a great flag representing the greatest nation in the history of the earth,\" Mr Romney concluded. A touching story, no doubt. But not one that will get laggards to the polls.</p> <p>But a crowd that comes with the express intention of being inspired is difficult to disappoint. He gave them what they wanted and they went home happy.</p> <p>\"Change can't be measured in speeches,\" he said. \"It is measured in achievements \u2026&#xa0;I won't just represent one party. I'll represent one nation.\"</p> <p>This, it turns out, is where the Etch-a-Sketch image has settled \u2013 one-nation Republicanism. No longer the severe conservative ideologue, but the uniter and doer. The turnaround man who can fix the country like he fixed the Olympics, and work with Democrats in Congress like he did in Massachusetts. The fact that it would be voiced to great cheers here, in Colorado, where he suffered a shock defeat to arch-conservative Rick Santorum during the primaries, is illuminating.</p> <p>For in the <a href=\" http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html \">pre-mortems</a> of Romney's candidacy, when it was widely assumed that he was going to lose, the accusation was always that his personality and his campaign were his main liabilities. There were indeed issues with both.</p> <p>Democrats had used the summer to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/29/mitt-romney-republican-nomination-win-michigan \">frame him</a> as effete and heartless corporate raider \u2013 a theme that had taken hold during the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/166810/romney-and-santorum-two-faces-gop-capitalism\">primaries</a>. Newt Gingrich branded him a \"vulture capitalist\" for his work at Bain Capital. Back in 2008, his opponent, Mike Huckabee, said: \"[Romney] looks like the guy who fires you, not the guy who hires you.\"</p> <p>By the time the Democrats got to him, the ground had been prepared. Throughout, Romney duly obliged by making $10,000 bets during debates, casually referring to his wife's couple of Cadillacs, and being caught on video disparaging almost half the country.</p> <p>\"I get the feel he's more for big business,\" one supporter in Lansing, Michigan, told me at a Santorum rally. \"I love Nascar, but he has friends who own Nascar teams, and it's difficult to relate to that.\" He emerged from the primary battles damaged and deeply scarred.</p> <p>But a far bigger problem for Romney was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/romney-us-presidential-elections-republicans \">party he sought to represent</a>. To run for the Republican nomination he had to run away from his record as a governor and a senatorial candidate. His support for abortion rights, gun control and healthcare reform and his bipartisan record all had to be denied or distorted for his nomination to stand a chance. On issues like contraception, immigration and taxation, to make sense within the Republican party was to make no sense outside it.</p> <p>Party elders watched in horror as debate crowds cheered Texas governor Rick Perry when he was introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. Rudy Giuliani said that the candidates' statements on some social issues \"make the party look like it isn't a modern party.\" Jeb Bush worried that the candidates were \"appealing to people's fears and emotion,\" and wondered if he could still count himself among them. \"I used to be a conservative,\" he said. To win, Romney had to scare away Latinos and women \u2013 and many remain scared.</p> <p>Even Romney insisted he had his limits. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments \u2026 I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting that if he couldn't blow himself up the very least he could do was light her candle. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!\" she told Fox News).</p> <p>The first debate marked the beginning of his revival because it signalled the moment he started running away from the his primary stances and back towards his record \u2013 or at least part of it. He posed as the moderate who could reach across the aisle and get things done in Massachusetts. If this has made him viable, it has left him no less vulnerable. For every position he takes, there is at least one <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgfzknYd20\">youtube clip</a> of taking a contrary position elsewhere.</p> <p>His Republican base do not seem to mind that, so long as they think it is a winning strategy. When they selected him, albeit grudgingly, they traded authenticity for viability. They preferred someone who could beat Obama to someone who was right. Now it's Romney's turn to fulfil his part of the deal. With just one day to go, the polls are so tight and close they can almost smell it.</p>",
  "<p>The government is racing to stay ahead of the swirl of allegations about child abuse in the UK by announcing two further inquiries into an alleged abuse ring in north Wales in the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>The first inquiry will look into the conduct of the original official inquiry into the child sex abuse ring and the second into the police handling of complaints at the time.</p> <p>Faced by allegations that senior Conservative politicians may have been involved in the scandal at the time, David Cameron, while on an official visit to the Middle East, announced he would establish an urgent investigation into the conduct of the official inquiry held between 1996 and 2000.</p> <p>In addition, the prime minister's spokesman in London said a separate inquiry will be held into the way in which the police handled the investigation.</p> <p>The spokesman conceded as many as five different inquiries were now underway, or imminent, looking into aspects of child abuse.</p> <p>The spokesman did not rule out an over-arching figure being asked to look at the lessons to be drawn from the inquiries now covering the BBC, the NHS, the police and government.</p> <p>Cameron rushed to act as the media threatened to identify the senior Tory figure close to Lady Thatcher alleged to have been involved in the child abuse.</p> <p>The Labour MP Tom Watson also urged the government to act after victim Steve Messham said that the Waterhouse inquiry of 2000 only covered a fraction of the alleged assaults.</p> <p>Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Cameron said: \"Child abuse is an absolutely hateful and abhorrent crime \u2026 These allegations are truly dreadful and they mustn't be left hanging in the air, so I'm taking action today.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be asking a senior independent figure to lead an urgent investigation into whether the original inquiry was properly constituted and properly did its job and to report urgently to the government.\"</p> <p>Cameron also called on anyone who knows anything about the allegations of abuse to contact police.</p> <p>Cameron said Messham would meet with the Welsh secretary, David Jones, on Tuesday.</p> <p>Cameron cannot afford to be seen to be delaying any action concerning the allegations due to their seriousness, but also because the government has been so criticial of the BBC's own failure to act on allegations about child abuse by Jimmy Savile.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.tom-watson.co.uk/2012/11/letter-to-david-cameron-regarding-child-sex-abuse-investigation\" title=\"\">In an extraordinary letter to the prime minister</a>, Tom Watson praised Cameron for acting swiftly, saying: \"You have sent an important message about how seriously you take this matter.\"</p> <p>However, he also made a series of further allegations. \"It is certainly important that government departments trawl their archives to see what documents they hold,\" said Watson. \"But my experience of uncovering massive establishment conspiracies leaves me in no doubt that what you have suggested does not go anything like far enough. Its limited scope may even slow things down, muddy waters, damage trails. What is needed is a much wider, but equally immediate, investigation.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"Since sharing my concerns with you at PMQs, a number of people have come forward to say that they raised their suspicions with the police, but investigations were not carried out. One allegation involves alleged child abuse and a former cabinet minister. We both know that many untruths are told about politicians, but this allegation was specific, informed and appeared well corroborated.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman insisted Cameron was \"very keen to ensure that everything is looked at properly and thoroughly and that no stone is left unturned\".</p> <p>The BBC's Newsnight programme on Friday night accused a senior Tory of abusing children at a care home in north Wales. According to reports at the weekend, as many as three victims have named the Tory grandee as one of their abusers.</p>",
  "<p>Barring a complete and systematic failure of pretty much every single polling organization in America, Barack Obama will be re-elected president of the United States Tuesday night.</p> <p>Still, no matter what happens on Tuesday \u2013 and even if Mitt Romney pulls off the most extraordinary political surprise in the history of American presidential campaigns \u2013 the more than 18-month slog for the White House provides us with rather clear outlines on the changing nature of the US electorate and the ideological positioning of the two parties. While it would be incomplete and, indeed, probably incorrect to call this a realignment election, there are a number of crucial takeaways from campaign 2012 \u2013 and they augur much brighter days ahead for Democrats than for Republicans.</p> <h2>The Republican party's continued descent into madness</h2> <p>The single most defining element of American politics over the last four years is that the Republican party has fallen out of the crazy tree and hit every branch on the way down. It is no longer even appropriate to say the Republican party is dominated by its conservative wing; but rather, that the GOP is controlled by its extreme, radical wing.</p> <p>The shift of the Republican to the far, far right is not a recent development. Instead, it is reflective of a four-decade shift in ideological orientation in the GOP: from a party once torn between distinct conservative and moderate wings, to one in which moderates have gone the way of dinosaurs and VCRs. But there is no question that in the past four years, the extremism of the GOP has increased dramatically \u2013 so much so that their most recent president, George W Bush, is persona non grata in the party because he is viewed as <em>too moderate</em> and not sufficiently conservative. Imagine that.</p> <p>For years, the national Republican party emboldened this wing of the GOP and made it the vanguard of its efforts to maintain national power. That group now holds ideological sway in the Republican party. In the naked pursuit of short-term partisan gain, the Republican party has unleashed forces that it can no longer fully control.</p> <p>The result is a set of policies that not only are radical, but also are out of step with the mainstream of American politics. This includes everything from efforts to privatize Medicare, eviscerating social security, rejecting any role for fiscal policy other than cutting taxes, and taking the position that illegal immigrants should not receive amnesty but rather \"self-deport\". This is not to mention the GOP's growing extremism on abortion rights and reproductive health in general.</p> <p>Republicans once aspired to, and briefly held, the mantle of a party of ideas. Today, the GOP in its deference to the ideological rigidity of its radical wing has reached a position where Republicans have no serious ideas for reforming healthcare, creating jobs, stimulating the economy, or fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. They also have no proposals for achieving energy independence and certainly no thought as to how to save the planet \u2013 particularly since they reject almost unanimously the science underpinning global warming. (Well, I take that back: Republicans have one policy for all these issues \u2013 cut taxes and trim regulation.)</p> <p>This has forced their party standard-bearer, a technocratic moderate from Massachusetts, to become a caricature of a modern conservative. In the process, Romney has adopted a host of toxic policy positions and rhetoric (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\">remember the 47%</a>) that has dramatically undermined his candidacy. It's always difficult to beat an incumbent president; it's even more difficult when you're not a very good politician. But when your own party hangs around your neck policy positions that narrow, rather than increase, your chances of being elected, it becomes a herculean task. </p> <p>To be sure, one of the most important drivers of the Republican's rightward turn has been the unceasing obstructionism toward President Obama's agenda. From early on, the GOP decided that, for political reasons, it must oppose everything he wanted to do. It was an approach that kept the economy under-performing but did help return Republicans to power in the House of Representatives in 2010. Blanket opposition to Obama's policies and, in particular, economic stimulus is pretty much the only reason this election is even close.</p> <p>If Obama is to win on 6 November, it's possible that Republicans will, at least in the near term, narrow their steadfast hostility to him. Indeed, even against their better judgment, they may find themselves compromising with the White House on the Bush tax cuts and sequestration, just as they compromised on the payroll tax cut in 2012, over the 2011 budget showdown and even on the debt limit.</p> <p>Providing Obama with the stimulus he has so desperately sought, for the past four years, might even suddenly seem acceptable, particularly if a boost in the economy helps incumbent congressional Republicans keep their constituents happy \u2013 and their jobs in place, at the next midterm elections in 2014. Of course, that doesn't mean anyone should get their hopes up: Republicans will still continue to oppose any use of government power and resources to ameliorate social inequalities. And as we get closer to midterm elections in 2014, as well as the next presidential race, it's quite possible, even likely, that GOP obstructionism and obstinacy will get worse.</p> <p>If Romney wins, congressional Republicans might be even less inclined to compromise, but it won't matter much. No one expects them to take back control of the Senate, which means the Republicans' far-right agenda will go no further than the House of Representatives (at least for the first two years of a Romney presidency). If Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2014 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014\">a possibility that can't be completely discounted</a>), this would be a very different story. One could expect them to make a desperate push to enact some variation of the Ryan budget \u2013 and probably succeed.</p> <p>Still, one of the great ironies of this election \u2013 and the capture of the GOP by its extreme wing \u2013 is that if Romney were to emerge victorious, he would be protected from having to enact a more radically conservative agenda \u2026 by Harry Reid. In fact, if Romney were to win, he might even end up being a fairly popular and successful president.</p> <h2>Demographics are destiny</h2> <p>The problem for Republicans, however, is what happens if he loses. In no area of American politics are Republicans more vulnerable and Democrats in better position to capitalize than when it comes to the country's changing demographic make-up. </p> <p>Consider, for a moment, this paradox. On Tuesday night, Barack Obama could potentially lose white voters by 20 points. He's going to get crushed among white men \u2013 and he's still likely to be re-elected, maybe even comfortably.</p> <p>The reason for this is clear: among non-whites, Obama enjoys an extraordinary advantage. Aside from winning practically the entire African-American vote, Obama is likely to prevail among Hispanic voters by considerably more than 30 points. The latest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/\">Latino Decisions poll has him up nearly 50 points</a>.</p> <p>Among younger voters, he is likely to dominate as well. In short, among the demographic groups that represent the future of the American electorate, Democrats enjoy an enormous edge \u2013 and one that will only become more pronounced.</p> <p>It's not hard to understand why this has happened. Young people who came of age in the Bush years naturally gravitated toward Obama. Moreover, these voters tend to be aligned on social issues with Democrats. On the flip side, GOP positions on immigration have alienated Hispanics and moved them toward the Democrats. Beyond young people and minorities, women voters have increasingly turned their back on the GOP because of its uncompromising stances on abortion and reproductive health, as well as the party's attitude toward poverty programs and maintaining the social safety net.</p> <p>Republicans have, for decades, relied on the support of whites, religious and cultural voters, and on rural residents. If Obama were to win Tuesday, it would provide conclusive evidence that this is no longer a 50.1% coalition \u2013 and that for Republicans to win back the presidency, they must broaden their share of the electorate.</p> <p>But here's the rub: there is no easy way for them to do it. Even if Republicans could find a way to work with Obama on an issue like immigration reform (an unlikely scenario considering the die-hard opposition of the Tea Party), a legislative victory for the president would only serve to strengthen his support in the Hispanic community. If Republicans oppose reform, however, they will only dig their hole deeper with the fastest growing demographic group in the country. In fact, if Obama were smart, he would make the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform one of his first legislative priorities in 2013.</p> <p>On abortion and reproductive health, it's virtually impossible to imagine any sort of compromise coming from the GOP. And so long as the party has Senate candidates talking about \"legitimate rape\" and children born as a result of rape being gifts from God, things are likely to get worse for the Republican party, before they get better. The same goes for gay marriage and other social issues.</p> <h2>A bluer map</h2> <p>The Democrats' evolving political coalition has also shifted the electoral map in a bluer direction. In states like <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/in-nevada-obama-ryan-and-signs-of-a-new-democratic-leaning-normal/\">Nevada</a> and New Mexico, Democrats enjoy a huge advantage because of those states' large Hispanic population. Similar trends can be seen in Colorado, Florida and even Iowa. It is not hard to imagine that Democratic dominance among Hispanic voters will soon put Arizona and even, potentially, Texas in play.</p> <p>In places like Ohio, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/in-virginia-its-tradition-versus-change/\">Virginia</a> and North Carolina, the Democrats' overwhelming advantage among minority voters and, increasingly, among college-educated whites \u2013 another key element of the emerging Democratic coalition \u2013&#xa0;has put these states into play and even leaning blue.</p> <p>Flip the map for a second to look at it from a Republican perspective and things get ugly quickly. Look, for example, at the <a href=\"http://electoralmap.net/PastElections/past_elections.php?year=2000\">2000 electoral map</a>. Of the states won by Al Gore that year, only Iowa and perhaps Wisconsin are even in play this cycle. Conversely, seven states that Bush won that year are swing states or leaning Democratic. From a starting point of 271 electoral votes (one more than the bare minimum needed to win a national election), Republicans have seen their electoral map narrow rather than widen.</p> <h2>A recovering economy</h2> <p>There is one final consideration. As the economy has steadily improved, so, too, have President Obama's approval ratings. All economic indicators indicate that this will be a continuing trend, which means that if Obama were to win Tuesday, he would see his political standing rise as unemployment continues to fall. (Of course, if Romney were to win, he would be the beneficiary of this improving economy.) Throw in the fact that as Obamacare becomes the law of the land and provides a new entitlement for middle-class Americans, the Democrat's long-term policy advantage could be strengthened even further.</p> <p>None of this is meant to suggest that Republicans won't continue to be a competitive national party. The problem, however, is similar to that faced by Democrats 20-30 years ago: when your base is shrinking, how do you appeal to a broader cross-section of the electorate?</p> <p>The fact is, there is no easy way for Republicans do it. The GOP needs desperately to reform itself, to cast aside its most radical and extreme wing, and to moderate its policies to appeal to an electorate that is dramatically changing. Democrats simply need to continue the policies \u2013 and political approach \u2013 that has given them a political advantage going into election day.</p> <p>What this means is that, should Romney lose tomorrow and Obama emerge victorious, we may be on the cusp of a dramatic shift in national politics.</p>",

It would seem they are taking the idea of Afrofuturism (a tendency in dance music that dates back to at least the days of <a href=\"http://www.georgeclinton.com/\" title=\"\">Parliament-Funkadelic</a> when George Clinton's crew wrote songs about star children and mothership connections and had lavish stage sets <a href=\"http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/story/parliament-funkadelic-donates-mothership-to-smithsonian-20110525/1000x306/main.jpg\" title=\"\">featuring alien landings and such</a>) to the next logical level. \"IROK stands for exploration, abandonment, music as a physical force to take you outside of yourself. To transcend time and space,\" runs the press release, going on to describe the sound of IROK's self-titled debut album as \"ferocious, synth-driven, psychotropic Afro-punk\".</p> <p>It isn't quite the future-facing funk we were expecting, nor is it as OTT and otherworldly. It reminds us of early-90s dance-rock, the sort purveyed by the likes of Jesus Jones and Pop Will Eat Itself, with its crude cut-ups, samples and found voices, or the yob techno of whoever it was in the noughties who purveyed a distinctly geezerish strand of dance music (their name escapes us). Forget sleek modernism: this is where shouty vocals collide with stomping beats and great big dollops of rave keyboards. It's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/18/oi-cockney-rejects-garry-bushell-interview\" title=\"\">Oi! disco</a>, like Cockney Rejects, gatecrashing <a href=\"http://www.gatecrasher.com/venues/sheffield/index.html\" title=\"\">Gatecrasher</a>, or Sham 69 in a dust-up with the <a href=\"http://www.dustbrothers.com/\" title=\"\">Dust Brothers</a>.</p> <p>The IROK concept \u2013 think <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_%28album%29\" title=\"\">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a> fronted by Garry Bushell \u2013 comes courtesy of mainman Mike Title, an east Londoner whose mother's family are Berbers from north Africa. One day he was on the stands of a Moroccan football match when it occurred to him to \"channel those feelings of chaos, ecstasy and panic felt beneath the hot sun\" and \"kick rock's rotting corpse back into life\". After immersing himself in Moroccan culture \u2013 which he talks about in magical, mystical terms \u2013 he went on a \"guerrilla-punk\" tour of his mum's homeland and envisioned a music equally influenced by Fela Kuti, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crass\" title=\"\">Crass</a>, and Sun Ra and Suicidal Tendencies. It's that old idea of a funked-up Sex Pistols that everyone from the Power Station to the Prodigy \u2013 whom incidentally IROK are supporting at the Brixton Academy in December \u2013 have dreamed of creating. It's not as fully realised as it probably appears in Title's mind, but then we're talking about someone who claims to have prophesied the Arab Spring and last summer's riots. He has something of <a href=\"http://www.dorfdisco.de/interviews/jaz-coleman.htm\" title=\"\">Jaz Coleman's pseudo-apocalyptic visionary</a> about him.</p> <p>The conceptual carapace may be solid but the music is, as we say, fairly rudimentary guitar-driven rave-rock built on shifting ancient (circa 1990) ground. All My Children features barks over bloops. Earthy Girls finds our hero fed up with women in this world and searching further afield, on distant planets. The titles are terse, direct and \"ultimate\" (Destroy, God, Sex and Violence) but the music is often mid-tempo and mundane, with lots of signifiers of tomorrow's world \u2013 whooshes and such \u2013 tacked on, and a few north African touches to convince you of its exotic provenance. Worms from Mars has the raw synth appeal of early Suicide spewed over by a member of Sham 69. There are actual \"oi!\"s on this one. In fact, our complaint would be that there aren't enough \"oi!\"s throughout, and the music could be more of a cranium-crushing assault than it is. Because at the moment IROK are all ideas and no (bondage) trousers.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Not since Bowie created Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars has there been a British band with so singular a vision\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://livemusic.fm/news/livemusic-interview-irok-and-azealia-banks-at-amsterdams-paradiso-2011\" title=\"\">livemusic.fm</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> We should Morocco-co.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to: </strong>Elicit use of the term \"mockney techno\".</p> <p><strong>Least likely to: </strong>Blast you into another dimension.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Intergalactic Republic of Kongo is released on 14 January by Acid Bath.

  "<p>The government is to review Google's pledge to downgrade illegal filesharing websites in its search results, after entertainment groups accused the internet giant of dragging its feet over the issue.</p> <p>The move comes a year after the search giant was warned by the then culture secretary Jeremy Hunt that new laws would compel it to demote such sites if it did not act first.</p> <p>Now the department for culture, media and sport (DCMS) says it will examine the technical changes promised by Google in August, when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/10/google-algorithm-hollywood-lobbyists-copyright\" title=\"\">pledged</a> to relegate sites that persistently flout copyright laws.</p> <p>A spokesman for the DCMS said the government would \"consider our options\" following the review, raising the prospect of fresh legislation that would force Google to downgrade pirated material in search results.</p> <p>Entertainment groups, comprising the film, music and publishing industries, complained that top Google search results remain dominated by pirate sites despite repeated assurances from the internet firm that it would push them down.</p> <p>Government ministers see Google as central in the fight against online piracy because it is the main portal to the web for nine out of 10 Britons.

Sites with high numbers of removal notices are now more likely to appear lower in our results, we've made it easier to report pirated material and now take down more than seven million infringing links per month.\"</p> <p>However, entertainment groups complained that Google was still not doing enough to tackle the issue.</p> <p>Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, said: \"Google said it would stop putting the worst pirate sites at the top of search results. Google's transparency report shows they know clearly which are most infringing domains. Yet three months into the much-vaunted algorithm change, many of these illegal sites are still dominating search results for music downloads.</p> <p>\"We are talking to Google to try to establish why this is the case. With the launch of music in Google Play, now is the time to build a genuine partnership and for Google to show the world that it loves music. This means Google must stop dragging its feet and giving profile to illegal sites that it knows rip off everyone working in music.\"</p> <p>Richard Mollet, chief executive of the publishing industry trade body the Publishers Association, said he welcomed Google's promise to demote infringing sites, but added: \"We are yet to see evidence for a significant reduction in their presence in search results.\"</p> <p>Kieron Sharp, director general of the Federation Against Copyright Theft, added: \"Google claims to have taken steps to make infringing websites and the pirated content they promote less accessible, yet it seems that its search engine is still promoting these sites which are often making money from advertising or other payment mechanisms.\"</p> <p>The way Google ranks piracy sites came to a head last year when Hunt told Google he would introduce new laws as part of the forthcoming Communications Act if the internet firm did not take immediate action. Hunt, now health secretary, was replaced by Maria Miller as culture secretary, as part of David Cameron's cabinet reshuffle in September.</p> <p>A spokesman for the DCMS did not rule out the prospect of fresh legislation to force Google to take urgent action on copyright.</p> <p>The DCMS said in a statement: \"The Department is aware of the concerns raised by rights holders that this has not had the impact that they hoped, and, together with industry, we now need to review the effect of the technical change made by Google and consider our options.</p> <p>\"This is part of a wider campaign to tackle online infringement, which includes working together with payment facilitators (such as credit card companies) and online advertising bodies to reduce the revenue flowing to seriously infringing \u2013 often criminal \u2013 sites.\"</p> <p>It is understood that the government will meet with Google, internet service providers, and rights holders before Christmas to discuss online piracy.</p> <p>The DCMS is due to set out its policies on the creative industries as part of the Communications Review white paper to be published in early 2013.</p> <p>Google's tough stance on its search results has been a major sticking point in its attempt to strike music licensing deals with the industry as it attempt to take on Apple's iTunes.</p> <p>The company says it received reports of 7.6m infringing web addresses in the past month \u2013 a sign of the significant scale of the problem.</p> <p>Google has fought attempts to make it remove websites that have proved to be infringing entirely from its search results, arguing that this would amount to an attack on freedom of expression. The internet firm has stressed that downgrading websites was not a \"silver bullet\" in the fight against piracy, and pointed out that there are comparatively few legal services to replace the illicit sites in search results.</p>",
  "<p>As a blizzard of lawsuits around the world shows, the battle of the tablets is heating up. Apple's recent announcement that it had sold its 100 millionth iPad emphasised its dominance thus far, but in late 2012, the company finds itself with serious competition at last.</p> <p>If you buy the theory that tablet success is about ecosystems rather than pure hardware \u2013&#xa0;iPad + iOS + iTunes + App Store as the driving force for Apple's success \u2013&#xa0;then you'll see why Amazon and Google have emerged as credible rivals with their Android devices.</p> <p>Amazon is taking its Kindle Fire line beyond the US, with its services and stores tightly integrated. Meanwhile, Google has extended its Nexus brand from smartphones to tablets, first with the Asus-made Nexus 7, and now with Samsung's Nexus 10.</p> <p>The latter is the most impressive 10in Android tablet yet, from its design and hardware specs through to its software.</p> <p>But does Nexus + Android + Google Play have a shot at tilting the tablet market towards Android, at a time when Google's OS has rampaged its way to top dog in the smartphone space? Let's see. </p> <h2>Build Quality</h2> <p>The Nexus 10 is a sleek, smooth tablet that feels solid, and sits nicely in the hands with its rounded corners \u2013&#xa0;more rounded than the iPad.</p> <p>In contrast to the Nexus 7's dimpled back, this is mostly smooth, apart from a section along the top, which can be peeled off and replaced with one that has a protective cover attached.</p> <p>That's the Nexus 10's slightly fiddlier equivalent of iPad's Smart Cover: no magnets presumably means no lawsuits winging their way towards Mountain View (or Seoul) from Cupertino. Well, over the cover, at least.</p> <p>There's an interesting contrast between the Nexus 10 and the iPad in their hardware layout, too. The iPad's emphasis is on portrait use, given the positioning of its dock and camera on the shorter sides of the device.</p> <p>The Nexus 10 has them on the longer sides, with landscape use in mind. That extends to its external speakers too, which are positioned on either side of the screen (when held in landscape orientation) as vertical strips.</p> <p>The sound quality is good: decently beefy audio when watching video, playing games or listening to music. The positioning does mean your hands will be partly over the speakers when holding the tablet, but this doesn't have a particularly noticeable effect.</p> <p>In my tablet usage over the last three years, I've tended to use headphones for films, games and music, so the quality of external speakers isn't a huge selling point for me. But if your habits are different, the Nexus 10's speakers are excellent.</p> <h2>Screen</h2> <p>Google is making a big noise about the Nexus 10's screen, and understandably so: it's rather marvellous.</p> <p>The 10in display, reinforced with Gorilla Glass 2, offers a resolution of 2560x1600 pixels: 300 pixels per inch, which as you'll read in every article about the device, is more than the iPad's 264ppi Retina display.</p> <p>Leaving the tech-spec willy-waving aside for the moment, the Nexus 10's screen is very impressive indeed: uber-sharp and bright, with a 16:9 aspect ratio that's made for movies (well, vice-versa, if you're being picky), and pixel-perfect performance for text.</p> <p>Now, back to the willy-waving. It's true: Google and Samsung have trumped Apple for pure pixels-per-inch, which may make for some marketing fun over the coming weeks and months. On a more personal level, any iPad owners who've been over-smug to Android-owning friends about their Retina display in the past will now be getting a comeuppance.</p> <p>The wider truth? Both displays are, to use the technical term, really bloody good. Even when watching the same film on the Nexus 10 and the latest iPad side-by-side, you'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference.</p> <h2>Processor and battery</h2> <p>It's safe to say the Nexus 10 isn't short of grunt when it comes to processing power, thanks to its dual-core A15 Eagle CPUs, a Mali T604 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</p> <p>AnandTech has plenty of figures and charts in its <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review\">performance preview of the Nexus 10</a>, but what does this translate to in the hands? Very fast, very smooth, very good indeed.</p> <p>3D games run like a dream on the device, and everything else feels snappy too as you move around the operating system and between apps. The quality of its screen would have been an embarrassment for the Nexus 10 if its innards weren't up to the task, but they're more than capable.</p> <p>The same is true of its battery, which lasts well beyond a day even with relatively heavy use.</p> <h2>Cameras</h2> <p>The idea of shooting photos or video using a 10in tablet's front-facing (rear-mounted) camera remains a baffling notion to many, although not all the iPads being held aloft in London's Olympic stadium earlier this summer can have belonged to ambush-marketers from Apple, so there clearly is some demand.</p> <p>Anyway, the Nexus 10 has a 5-megapixel rear camera capable of shooting video at 1080p resolution. Yes, there is a camera app to go with it: an elegantly stripped-down one, although others will undoubtedly be popping up on the Google Play store.</p> <p>Of more practical use is the 1.9-megapixel front camera for video calls, whether using third-party apps like Skype \u2013&#xa0;uncertified for the Nexus 10 at the time of writing, but it worked fine for me \u2013 or Hangout, which remains one of the best features of Google's own Google+ social network.</p> <h2>Setup experience</h2> <p>If you already use some of Google's services, setting up the Nexus 10 is a breeze. Log in to your Google account once as you fire up the device for the first time, and you'll be ready to go with your Gmail, YouTube, Calendar, Google+ and other services.</p> <p>Google accounts are also tied to the Google Play store, so if you've used an Android tablet before, you'll also have easy access to the apps you've downloaded elsewhere. Much as iCloud makes upgrading from one iPad to another a painless process, so a Google account will work well for Android users: free apps you previously downloaded are added by default, and the paid ones are available on Google Play (you'll have to fetch them). </p> <h2>Android 4.2 software</h2> <p>The Nexus 10 is the first Android tablet to ship with the latest Android 4.2 software, which falls under the same Jelly Bean title as 4.1, which was the first manifestation of Google's internal 'Project Butter' drive to improve the not just the look of Android, but its 'feel'.</p> <p>Both Jelly Bean updates show how far Android (now five years old) has come as an operating system for tablets, whether you're using fairly basic software features, or customising your homescreens to suit your needs with widgets.</p> <p>There's some new stuff in Android 4.2 that will go down well, too. Support for <strong>multiple user accounts</strong> will be a big deal: a recognition on Google's part that in many cases, 10in tablets are shared between several people in a household. The feature wasn't yet enabled in the software build on the review device, though.</p> <p><strong>Wireless display support</strong> is also a welcome inclusion if you're keen to sling entertainment from your tablet to your big-screen HDTV \u2013 if you have the relevant adapter.</p> <p>It's Android's equivalent of Apple's AirPlay + Apple TV combo, and plays into the increasingly-heard view that TVs may not need to get smarter after all: as long as they're connected, the smarts can reside in the device in their owner's hands.</p> <p><strong>Gesture Type</strong> is an interesting one: the ability to type by dragging your finger between the letters of a word, as pioneered by Swype, and recently introduced in rival SwiftKey too.</p> <p>It works well, but I suspect it will be more useful on smartphones for swipe-typing one-handed. On a 10in tablet, I still felt more comfortable typing two-handed in the traditional style. On a screen where one thumb can reach from 'Z' to 'P', it makes more sense.</p> <p>Of course, you could use one of those alternatives too, which is one of Android's selling points: the fact that apps have more licence to take over features of the OS mean that if there's something about the software you don't like, there may well be an alternative to fix it.</p> <p>Some new Android 4.2 features, like Google Now and Photo Sphere photography, are present in the Nexus 10, but are really more applicable to the new Nexus 4 smartphone, so will be covered in our upcoming review of that device.</p> <h2>Entertainment</h2> <p>The Nexus 10 is a powerful tablet with a beautiful screen and effective software, with Google's suite of cloud services neatly tied in. But if there's an Achilles heel for Android tablets to this date, it's in the third-party content and apps available.</p> <p>On the content side, Google has been working hard. You can now buy or rent films from its Google Play store in the UK, with a growing selection, and several ways to discover what's available. Ebooks are in a similar state.</p> <p>Music will follow on 13 November, complete with Google's own cloud music locker, which will scan-and-match your existing digital music collection \u2013&#xa0;ensuring you don't have to upload every single file \u2013 and store up to 20,000 songs on its servers to access from all your devices.</p> <p>Google is looking to undercut Apple's iTunes Match and Amazon's Cloud Player by making its own music cloud free.</p> <p>Google Play isn't yet up to iTunes standards when it comes to the breadth of content, but it's improving fast. And as on iOS, there are alternative sources for entertainment: Spotify, Netflix, Amazon's Kindle app, and so on. Other music download stores such as 7digital and Amazon MP3 are worth a look too. </p> <h2>Apps and games</h2> <p>It's rare to see Apple talk tablets in one of its device launches without taking a shot at the lack of high-quality apps that are optimised for Android tablets, as opposed to simply blown up from smartphone versions.</p> <p>With more than 275,000 native iPad apps, it's a barb that hits home on Android, with its small (but growing) number of tablet-optimised apps. Even some of the biggest ones that have been optimised \u2013&#xa0;step forward, Twitter \u2013lag behind their iPad versions.</p> <p>Google has work to do in encouraging more developers' efforts here, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/oct/30/google-android-great-tablet-apps\">the company itself admits</a>. Selling lots of Nexus 10s (and Nexus 7s) will help, as will continuing to improve the Google Play Store, which is already much better than it was when the first Android tablets were released in mid-2010.</p> <p>Some app categories are better than others. Android has been on something of a tear when it comes to games in recent months, and that applies to tablets too, with EA's Need for Speed: Most Wanted being this month's high-profile example of a simultaneous release across iPad and Android.</p> <p>Useful tools such as Evernote, Pocket and Instapaper; casual games such as Angry Birds Space, Cut the Rope and Temple Run; news apps such as BBC News and News 360\u2026 The basic categories are being stocked, gradually, although some (children's apps, for example) are still far behind iPad.</p> <h2>Pricing</h2> <p>The 16GB Nexus 10 costs \u00a3319, while the 32GB model costs \u00a3389, both Wi-Fi only. The comparable iPad models cost \u00a3399 and \u00a3479, so savings of \u00a380 and \u00a390 respectively compared to the Nexus 10's main rival.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>The thing about Android is that there are several distinct groups of potential buyers for a device like the Nexus 10, each with their own motivations and demands. They're best treated separately.</p> <p>\u2022 If you're a geek (I class myself in that category, so the term isn't pejorative) who definitely doesn't want an iPad: The Nexus 10 is the best 10in Android tablet available. Buy it, customise it to run exactly the way you want, enjoy it.</p> <p>\u2022 That said, if you're one of the growing number of people whose first experience of computing is a tablet \u2013&#xa0;or if you're buying it for someone like that \u2013 Android is still a bit more intimidating than iOS.</p> <p>The \u00a380/\u00a390 saving may trump that concern for a lot of people, but cost aside, iOS still beats Android when it comes the extent of your unpaid customer-service duties for a parent or grandparent (delete according to age).</p> <p>If you're somewhere in between \u2013 relatively tech-savvy, and with no particular prejudice for or against specific platforms or manufacturers \u2013 well, this is where it gets interesting.</p> <p>\u2022 If you already own an iPad and are thinking of upgrading, the Nexus 10 is a viable alternative to the fourth-generation iPad, but the headache of switching from one ecosystem to another if you've bought lots of apps, games, films, music etc via Apple may put you off.</p> <p>\u2022 If you don't own an iPad, the Nexus 10 is a convincing contender, especially if your needs revolve around more regular tasks \u2013 email, web browsing, social networking, video calls, watching films and YouTube videos, and maybe the odd casual game.</p> <p>\u2022 If you're more excited about other kinds of apps, iPad still has the quantity, but also the quality. This will still tip the balance for a lot of tablet buyers, and it's the next big area Google needs to work on.</p> <p>Most people still don't own a tablet, and that's why this area of consumer electronics is exciting going into 2013: it's all to play for. The Nexus 10 shows Google's determination to take the fight to Apple, which in turn will spur more innovation from Apple (and Microsoft, and Amazon\u2026) in the year to come.</p>",
  "<p>The \"shocking\" state of the Nigerian army has delayed plans for a military intervention in Mali, amid reports that it lacks the capability to fight on the frontline.</p> <p>A senior source in Mali told the Guardian that a lack of training and discipline among Nigerian troops \u2013 who are being heavily relied on by regional bloc Ecowas to oust Islamists in control of northern Mali \u2013 is becoming increasingly apparent.</p> <p>\"The Nigerian army is in a shocking state,\" said the source, who has seen recent assessments of Ecowas's military capability. \"In reality there is no way they are capable of forward operations in Mali \u2013 their role is more likely to be limited to manning checkpoints and loading trucks.\"</p> <p>\"The Nigerian forces lack training and kit, so they simply don't have the capability to carry out even basic military manoeuvres,\" the source added. \"They have poor discipline and support. They are more likely to play a behind-the-scenes role in logistics and providing security.\"</p> <p>News about the low capacity of Ecowas troops adds increasing pressure on the Malian army, whose lack of training and equipment led directly to the country's 22 March coup d'etat, which toppled the previous civilian government and allowed al-Qaida-linked Islamists to gain control of the country's north.</p> <p>Under plans for a UN security council-backed military intervention in Mali, now being drawn up by the Malian government with Ecowas and the African Union, as well as the EU and US, the country's military is expected to lead forward operations.</p> <p>France, Germany, the US and the EU have all backed plans to provide the Mali army with training, equipment and logistics support.</p> <p>\"The Malian army should play a substantial part in any ground operation, following their training by the EU,\" said the source. \"Once the security council gets the report it asked for, in mid to late November, the planning and co-ordination can really begin in earnest.\"</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Nigerian national security agencies admitted that the army was suffering from a lack of resources, but said it had achieved success in previous military interventions.</p> <p>\"The situation is that Nigeria has the trained personnel, what we require however is additional funding and logistic support,\" said the spokesperson. \"We are working toward a coordinated approach that at the international level includes the UN, the EU and France, as well as our regional partners.\"</p> <p>\"Nigeria has a lot of past experience in successful military and diplomatic interventions on the continent.\"</p> <p>Questions about the capability of Ecowas military forces come amid reports that a senior Malian government official has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10513270\" title=\"\">conducting talks</a> with a delegation from the Islamist extremist group Ansar Dine \u2013 the largest of the al-Qaida-linked factions that have control of the Kidal region of northern Mali \u2013 in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou, with President Blaise Compaore. Ansar Dine is under pressure to break links with al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, although some experts believe there is little to distinguish the groups, which say their goal is to impose sharia law in Mali and the whole west African subregion.</p> <p>In a recent interview with the Guardian, a senior figure from Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa \u2013 which controls the Gao and northern Mopti regions of Mali \u2013 said it would not negotiate with any group that did not accept sharia.</p> <p>Political and diplomatic figures involved in drawing up plans for a military intervention in northern Mali have said over recent weeks that the use of force seems \"unavoidable\" and is likely to commence in the new year.</p>",
  "<p>An investigation has begun after a police officer died in a shooting at a police station in Sighthill, Glasgow, on Monday morning. It is understood no one else is being sought in connection with the incident, but it is unclear whether it was accidental.In a short statement, Strathclyde police said officers from neighbouring Lothian and Borders police would oversee the investigation.</p> <p>\"We can confirm there was an incident at Baird Street police office where a firearm was discharged. This resulted in the death of a serving Strathclyde police officer,\" the force said. \"A full investigation into the circumstances is currently under way and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.\"</p> <p>Brian Docherty, chairman of Strathclyde Police Federation, said: \"It is too early to speculate as to the circumstances surrounding the tragic death and our thoughts turn immediately to his family who have lost their loved one and colleagues who have lost a friend.\" The officer was later named as Constable Rod Gellatly, 41.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: \"It is with great sadness that I have to tell you that a serving Strathclyde police officer died today in an incident where a firearm was discharged at Baird Street police office.\" <strong>Severin Carrell</strong></p>",
  "<p>It has become common to describe the first goal in a game as a <em>T\u00fcr\u00f6ffner</em>, a door-opener. Few teams are more in need of said key intervention than Bayern, a side who truly come into their own once spaces open up in the opposition half. But on Saturday night at the Imtech Arena, it wasn't so much Bastian Schweinsteiger's stooped header before the break that made the real difference but the second goal, a truly wondrous strike from Thomas M\u00fcller. There's no obvious comparison in tool box terms but if Schweinsteiger opened the door, M\u00fcller knocked up an exquisitely-shaped chaise longue for the visitors to settle down and put their feet up for good in the 3-0 win at Hamburg. \"It was important for us, it gave us the chance to take a deep breath,\" the 23-year-old said about <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/thomas-muller-bayern-munich-v-hamburg/\" title=\"\">his unlikely strike</a>.</p> <p>Chances are people in Germany will see it again and again this season. It's a dead-cert for the Goal of the Month competition and will push Marco Reus's pile-driver against Greece at the Euros all the way for the Goal of the Year prize, too.</p> <p>\"I looked up and didn't see anyone for the cross, so I tried to have a go myself,\" he explained later, \"and I had a good foot.\" The HSV keeper Ren\u00e9 Adler was anticipating a cross and admitted to getting his angles \"all wrong\" but then again, who could have expected M\u00fcller shooting past the goalie from just inside the touchline, on the turn? \"Anatoliy Tymoshchuk scores similar goals in training but not while the ball is in play,\" M\u00fcller joked later. The 2-0 ensured an ultimately comfortable evening for Bayern who mercifully slowed down after Toni Kroos had added a third. As reactions after defeats go, this was impressive stuff, Hamburg's glaring lack of quality notwithstanding. \"They were one, maybe two levels ahead of us,\" said Adler. Asked about a perceived duel for the Germany gloves with Manuel Neuer, the 27-year-old came up with a knowing smile. \"I lost that battle in glorious fashion,\" he offered.</p> <p>Franck Rib\u00e9ry's devastating performance saw the Frenchman hailed as the best Rib\u00e9ry ever; he's indeed close to his 2007 level, perhaps even better. But this was M\u00fcller's win, really. After an indifferent season and hot-and-cold Euros, many expected the gangly and somewhat erratic attacking midfielder to fall victim of Bayern's push for more depth in the squad. With Swiss \"magic cube\" (Blick) Xerdan Shaqiri coming in and Toni Kroos all but immovable in the No10 spot, M\u00fcller looked set for campaign as a bit-part player. And when (fairly spurious) rumours about interest from Arsenal surfaced in July, it's fair to assume that his departure would not have caused mass protests outside the club's HQ in S\u00e4benerstrasse.</p> <p>Instead, he has emerged as the club's most consistent midfielder, just ahead of the more cultured and technically impressive Kroos. Seven goals in the league have already equalled his tally for 2011-12. M\u00fcller has become the designated penalty-taker, too, after a series of misses from Arjen Robben, Schweinsteiger and Mario Mandzukic. And he is increasingly the spokesperson for the team as well. More interesting than the careful captain Philipp Lahm and much more open than the slightly curmudgeonly Schweinsteiger, M\u00fcller is (at last) a truly Bavarian voice, mixing humorous irreverence with healthy confidence. \"For those who thought we'd slip up, it's bad luck,\" he said with a smile, \"we can forget the debate about us having a November depression. Others drop points, we have a superb day. It'll be a nice evening for us.\"</p> <p>Ironically, a team that was supposed to be less dependent on his improvisation, has turned into more of a M\u00fcller-team, as far as the work ethic and his very disciplined kind of positional indiscipline goes. \"We are all one or two per cent more eager to win this season,\" he explained. As J\u00f6rg Kramer from Der Spiegel remarked on Sky on Sunday night, all of the attacking midfielders now follow the M\u00fcller template of popping up in the most unexpected of spaces.</p> <p>\"It's almost impossible to tell where exactly they are playing,\" Kramer noted, contrasting M\u00fcller's freedom to change sides from his nominal slot on the right with the \"positional football\" strait-jacket under Louis van Gaal. M\u00fcller, the son of a BMW engineer, once memorably described himself as \"an interpreter of space\" in a S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung interview and it's obvious that his unusual, mostly instinctive playing style is best served with a brief to go on as many exploratory runs as possible.</p> <p>It's yet to be determined whether Bayern's flexibility has come as a natural consequence of the players' willingness to cover more ground or as the result of Jupp Heynckes's new master plan. But as long Bayern combine individual talent with so much hard work, it doesn't really matter. With Rib\u00e9ry in perfect shape, Kroos playing superbly well, and Mario Gomez and Robben still to come back to regular first-team action, Bayern are unlikely to be shifted from the summit this season. And the various superstars will have to continue to find space on the team-sheet next to the accidental whizz kid on Grissini legs from the village of P\u00e4hl \u2013 not the other way round.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 \"Maybe we're too good for this world,\" said Schalke 04 sporting director, Horst Heldt, philosophically on Saturday. What he meant: the Royal Blues had neglected to kill off Hoffenheim in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, an opponent that was \"already dead on a plate,\" as Heldt put. Markus Babbel's team were indeed inferior throughout the 90 minutes but in the end, they won the game 3-2, thanks to a general lack of sharpness from the visitors in both boxes. Huub Stevens, who never needs a reason to be in a foul mood, even when everything <em>is</em> rosy, was particular miffed about Sven Schipplock's last-minute winner, eight minutes after Atsuto Uchida had equalised for the second time. \"You have to take the draw,\" grumbled Stevens, \"instead I see my defenders running forward to chase a winner.\" Heldt added: \"We were naive.\" A seven point-gap to leaders Bayern will spare him the \"Bayern-hunter\" headlines for the time being.</p> <p>As preparations for Arsenal's visit on Tuesday night go, this defeat will not hurt that much either. Schalke, who might be without the centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos (head injury) again, will only concentrate harder on doing what they do best: getting results with impeccable organisation at the back and nigh stereotypical efficiency at the other end.</p> <p>\u2022 The only goalless game of the weekend was perhaps the most entertaining and finely balanced. Stuttgart escaped with an unlikely draw that could have easily transformed into an even unlikelier win late on, but Vedad Ibisevic missed the Swabians' best chance at the home of the champions. \"We have to get used to the fact that a draw feels like a defeat for us,\" said the dejected Borussia Dortmund coach, J\u00fcrgen Klopp.</p> <p>A stray elbow from Raphael Holzhauser connected with the nose of Sebastian Kehl, sent the Black and Yellows captain into A&amp;E and naturally divided opinion. The upshot was only a yellow card for the Austrian. Kehl will play away to Real Madrid with a face mask to protect his slightly fractured nose. Regardless of the result in the Spanish capital, though, one theory will continue to gain currency. This Dortmund squad still don't look ready to challenge in the two main competitions with the same intensity. To the detriment of the Bundesliga, all their best performances seem to come in Europe this season.</p> <p>\u2022 Twenty decent opening minutes and yet another fine display from Alex Meier weren't enough for Eintracht Frankfurt to register a win against Greuther F\u00fcrth. The 1-1 draw on Friday night left Leverkusen as the biggest winners of the weekend behind Bayern. Bayer 04 were great going forward in the 3-2 win over D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 Sidney Sam's opener was particularly handsome \u2013 but less assured at the back.</p> <p>The game, however, will ultimately be remembered for the sort of problem you're more likely to encounter in the agony aunt pages of teenage magazines than on a Bundesliga pitch: Simon Rolfes only lasted 75 seconds after his introduction midway through the second half. The midfielder was sent off for a silly if not altogether terrible tackle on Adam Bodzek. Rudi V\u00f6ller, the Bayer sporting director, pleaded for clemency but knew it was pointless. \"We are Germans, we are German and bureaucratic,\" he said, quite rightly. Rolfes was suspended for one match after entering the record books with the second-fastest dismissal.</p> <p><strong>Results</strong> Frankfurt 1-1 Greuther F\u00fcrth, Dortmund 0-0 Stuttgart, Gladbach 1-1 Freiburg, Hannover 2-0 Augsburg, N\u00fcrnberg 1-0 Wolfsburg, HSV 0-3 Bayern, Hoffenheim 3-2 Schalke, Leverkusen 3-2 D\u00fcsseldorf, Bremen 2-1 Mainz.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://guardian.touch-line.com/?Lang=0&amp;CTID=12\" title=\"\">Latest Bundesliga table</a></p>",
  "<p>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico is, it's fairly uncontroversial to say, an iconic album \u2013 thanks in large part to the Andy Warhol\u2013designed sleeve, and the soundbite-friendly claim that it \"only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band\". <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/oct/30/readers-review-velvet-underground-nico\" title=\"\">Last week we asked readers</a> to write in with their thoughts on the album \u2013 and the results are below.</p> <p>Guardian.co.uk/music has more than 3m album pages, where you can submit your own review of pretty much any record. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/write-album-reviews\" title=\"\">See here for information on how to do just that.</a></p> <h2>Gestalt rock and roll</h2> <p>Tom Petty once answered a critic's complaint about rock and roll not being very good by saying, \"It's not supposed to be good \u2026 it's rock and roll.\" Taken within the context of that remark, The Velvet Underground and Nico is very good, indeed. The production is haphazard \u2013 Andy Warhol is listed as the producer, which, in this case, probably means he watched the engineer push different buttons; the songs are all over the place \u2013 from the straight pop of Sunday Morning to the anything-but-pop of Black Angel's Death Song, and everything in between; and the performances are ragged. It is truly gestalt rock and roll, the parts roll but as a whole it rocks. Heroin is nice here, but is a tour de force on 1969, done live. Timing is everything: if this album had come after White Light/White Heat or Velvet Underground, it would have been viewed as a disappointment, since nothing here matches White Light/White Heat, Sister Ray, What Goes On? or Some Kinda Love, but as a starter is was everything it should be. And Nico had the good sense to be a one-and-done.</p> <p>\u2013 deeaiden</p> <h2>You either get it, or you don't</h2> <p>Sure, call it hipsterism. Call it elitist. Call it pompous. That's what it is. It IS elitist simply because it's something that digs a bit deeper than what you might be used to. No matter how edgy you think you are - it takes a pretty seasoned fan of music and a very open-minded soul to truly take in the beauty (and at the same time, the emptiness) resonating from The Underground's music. You either connect to the farthest extremes of modern expression or you pretend it doesn't exist. You get their music, or you don't. You can't \"rate\" this. Its like assigning a numerical judgment to when man first came across fire - these guys created all the edge, all the 'cool' \u2013 everything. The fact is The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico is tapping into something as equally pointless as it is profound.</p> <p>\u2013 XenAJD</p> <h2>Degenerate rock music</h2> <p>It's good! though nowhere near the most poignant avant-garde rock at the time (that distinction goes to<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMM_%28group%29\" title=\"\"> AMM</a>, if you can even categorize them as 'rock'), on the debut Velvet Underground played it spare and honest, reduced rock to a chaotic dessicated sequencing of tension and release, and invoked pathology, in equal measure. just another group of outsiders making art, good for them. They would put the pedal to the floor next time around. here just enjoy that degenerate rock music.</p> <p>\u2013 desuevolyaw</p> <h2>Can we get over it?</h2> <p>Arguably the only band who set out not to be commercially succesfull, or didn't even care. Ironic given it's being repackaged AGAIN, this time with an earlier mix (who listens to these things?). Certainlly in the themes and topics address on the album, it's groundbreaking in some regards but - and here it is - can we GET OVER IT! It's just a record FFS. There were songs about drugs, sex, mental illness, drink, violence in the 20s and 30s, go check out some blues for some real raw life and death shit. Singers and songwriters like Robert Petway, Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly, Blind Willie McTell, Brother Montgomery etc were not part of some arthouse demi monde who 'slummed it'.</p> <p>\u2013 TonyTales</p> <h2>Nico \u2013 a great singer who can't sing</h2> <p>Some of it seems virtually unlistenable to me - Black Angel's Death Song, European Son and probably Run Run Run, which are just painful and regularly get the forward\u2013wind treatment from me. But songs like Heroin and Waiting for the Man are just brilliant as songs and scene painting \u2013 evoking just what (I imagine) it's like to be desperate for drugs. Venus in Furs is silly (but I find SM quite silly) but somehow great. Nico is one of the great singers who can't really sing and I love her contributions \u2013 I'll Be Your Mirror is a perfect, sweet and sad love song.</p> <p>\u2013 piggles</p> <h2>It always has something new to reveal</h2> <p>I instantly gravitated towards this 'old music' as soon as I heard Sunday Morning \u2013 that beautiful music box intro \u2013 this was rock music? Something that I'd written off as dull, old and built by dinosaurs a thousand years ago was slowly unwrapping before me. I'm Waiting For The Man and Femme Fatale followed \u2013 the hilarious but affectionate Heath Robinson take by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark blown away forever. And then Femme Fatale. Was this the same band?</p> <p>I'm not going to get all sixth-form poetry with you about the rest of the album, pointless really \u2013 we could be here forever. It's an album though that has changed over the years for me, and that must mean that I have changed and taken different things from it. Skipping Black Angel's Death Song because I never understood it at first / loving Black Angel's Death Song because I understood it at last. I arrived at this album from a myriad of other places, and I take it with me wherever I go.

  "<p>On a recent trip to New York, I was depressed to note further deterioration in that cursed element of Broadway theatre, the \"entry round\" \u2013 the enthusiastic and often lengthy applause at the moment when theatregoers recognise a famous actor.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/davidmamet\" title=\"\">David Mamet</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/glengarry.html\" title=\"\">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>, the 1983 play about real estate agents, is deliberately written to begin in mid-conversation, enhancing the audience's sense of eavesdropping. In the <a href=\"http://www.glengarrybroadway.com\" title=\"\">current Broadway revival</a>, the first character we meet, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv6vPJgpGHE\" title=\"\">Shelly Levene</a>, duly starts halfway through a speech, but then has to stop and resume because viewers wish to show their enthusiasm for the fact that he's being played by Al Pacino.</p> <p>Subsequently, the carefully exact rhythms of Mamet's dialogue are regularly interrupted by the desire of ticket-buyers to honour many of the star's intonations and gestures.</p> <p>At least Pacino only has to stop talking on such occasions. In another production of the new season \u2013 <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Craig Wright's Grace</a> at the Cort theatre \u2013 another film star, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/11/paul-rudd-interview\" title=\"\">Paul Rudd</a>, is incongruously forced to pause in the act of shooting two characters dead, the action of the play's opening tableau. And in another show, <a href=\"http://www.theheiressonbroadway.com/\" title=\"\">The Heiress</a>, the director's pacing in the opening scene is rendered redundant by no fewer than three bursts of applause: one each for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jessica-chastain\" title=\"\">Jessica Chastain</a>, David Strathairn and Dan Stevens.</p> <p>Such reactions remain very rare in the UK. Indeed, in London productions featuring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/judi-dench\" title=\"\">Judi Dench</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/ian-mckellen\" title=\"\">Ian McKellen</a>, it's possible to calculate precisely how many American tourists are in the house by counting the number who put their hands together for the celebrity entrance, and are then silenced by disapproving shushing from Brits.</p> <p>The entry round can be attributed to various special factors in New York theatre: the adoration of cinematic faces \u2013 a movie star on stage has become a must-have factor, particularly during the recession \u2013 and the sense of event that attends a Broadway production because of the escalating cost of tickets. At the moment, too, there's an added reason to applaud: the audience's sense of self-congratulation at making it to the theatre through the ongoing travel disruption caused by Superstorm Sandy.</p> <p>The playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/albee\" title=\"\">Edward Albee</a> is one of the many theatre professionals who have deplored the popularity of the practice in the US: in one of my interviews with him, he pointed out that, while it might be tacky but logical to applaud a star when they walked in to a restaurant, it was both vulgar and illogical on stage, where the whole point of the process is that they are walking on as someone else.</p> <p>However, Broadway audiences seem to be becoming even keener on signalling their recognition of the person the performer is trying not to be. The script of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrano_de_Bergerac_%28play%29\" title=\"\">Cyrano de Bergerac</a> calls for the actor playing the title character to undergo significant alterations through makeup and costume, but as soon as Douglas Hodge comes on in the latest New York staging, the customers can't resist showing that they know it's Dougie under there.</p> <p>And it's clearly it's not just visiting British theatregoers like me who are irritated by the practice. A suspicious number of Broadway productions now seem to start with the lead actors speaking offstage or in the dark, or coming on masked by a large group of other actors \u2013presumably to make it harder for the audience to play spot-the-star. In last year's Broadway revival of John Guare's <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">The House of Blue Leaves</a>, the director seemed to have been so concerned about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/benstiller\" title=\"\">Ben Stiller</a> stopping the show before it had started that he began the production with Stiller's character sitting with his back to the audience in low light. This strategy, however, proved futile: the front stalls immediately recognised the movie star's rear silhouette and awarded it sustained clapping and, in some parts of the audience, a standing ovation.</p> <p>More worryingly, at Glengarry Glen Ross there was evidence of another disruptive phenomenon. A group of people sitting near me had clearly come only to see Pacino, and then become grumpy at his absence from the second and third scenes of the first act. Their response to this was to chat loudly and use their mobile phones silently but flashingly until he came back on.</p> <p>Superstar casting may be useful insurance for producers but, as the new Broadway season shows, it all but guarantees nuisance to regular theatregoers.</p>",

The latter has a CBE and \"over 40 years of business experience\". Really, what's not to like?</p> <p>The fact that elections are not happening in the capital presumably explains the national media's lack of interest. But what's remarkable is the absence of support from the Conservative politicians who dreamt up this dire wheeze in the first place. In order to cut costs, there are <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9474253/Police-commissioner-elections-Independent-candidates-will-struggle-to-be-seen.html\" title=\"\">no free mailshots for candidates</a> \u2013 which, given that we're still some way from the advent of true e-democracy, means most people are barely aware that anything is happening. And precious few senior Tories seem minded to do anything to whip up public interest: give or take a quick prime ministerial trip last week around <a href=\"http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/News/PM-stirred-not-shaken-02112012.htm\" title=\"\">Bedfordshire and Leicestershire</a>, most front-rank Conservatives seem to have concluded that the elections were over before they'd even begun.</p> <p>The whole thing will cost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/10/police-commissioners-star-quality-shine\" title=\"\">\u00a375m</a>, which would pay for a lot of schools, hospitals, social workers, and, come to think of it, police officers: strange, perhaps, that the party in such a lather about wasteful public spending has created such a surreal case study in it.</p> <p>Worse still is the makeup of the candidates: 82% are men, 15 areas have no female candidates, and contrary to early claims that the elections might smoke out non-politicians who fancied overseeing the police, the vast majority of aspiring commissioners look like standard-issue political hacks: to quote the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/19/police-crime-commissioner-list-analysed]\" title=\"\">Guardian's Simon Rogers</a>, \"the majority are either former members of parliament, members of the European parliament, Welsh assembly or former councillors.\"</p> <p>And Labour's participation gives off a very questionable whiff, as a smattering of politicians of a certain age from Westminster \u2013 John Prescott, ex-solicitor-general Vera Baird, former Parliamentary Labour party chair Tony Lloyd, and Tony Blair's Welsh secretary Alun Michael \u2013 eye up new jobs in what some people call the regions, like soviet apparatchiks hurrying off to run power stations in Tajikistan and Moldavia. The party's candidate list also includes Michael's son, Tal, who's standing in North Wales: a <a href=\"http://www.choosemypcc.org.uk/candidates/tal-michael/ ]\" title=\"\">one-man advert for meritocracy</a>, pledged to make sure local people and police \"are working together to solve problems\" (who writes this stuff?).</p> <p>Such are the reasons behind predictions of turnout as low as 10%. We have the prospect of 41 hapless people taking \"power\" with no legitimacy. What, really, was so wrong with local police authorities? Isn't the washed-out language used by most of the candidates proof that electoral politics doesn't really belong here?</p> <p>And what kind of election takes place in a complete informational vacuum? \"There's no campaign here, no leaflets, no coverage,\" went one recent <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/james-forsyth/2012/11/david-cameron-tries-to-drum-up-interest-in-the-police-and-crime-commissioner-elections/\" title=\"\">post on the Spectator's Coffee House blog</a>. \"Nothing but the ballot forms. An election with no coverage is not democracy. You can't (well, I can't) vote for someone if you don't know their history, their qualifications, their plans. It should be called off.\"</p> <p>It should, but it won't. Thus far, the only halfway convincing argument for voting in these elections has revolved around the danger of woefully low turnout letting in such \"extremists\" as a <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/397382/20121023/british-freedom-edl-luton-police-commissioner.htm\" title=\"\">co-founder of the English Defence League</a>, and those saloon-bar rightwingers, the English Democrats. But in most places, the truth is simple and unavoidable: to register a preference for any candidate in these woeful, unnecessary, meaningless elections would be to run the risk of the government taking your vote as some kind of indication of approval (Not, incidentally, that approval or disapproval seems to count for much with this lot: the case for elected mayors may have been resoundingly defeated in the summer's referendums, but that staunch democrat David Cameron is now indicating that if he gets in next time, he'll just legislate to introduce them anyway).</p> <p>With some justification, the former <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20020451\" title=\"\">Met commissioner Ian Blair</a> is advocating a boycott. But the other week, I spoke to senior Welsh politician who said she could see no other option but the spoiling of her ballot paper, which struck me as by far the most sensible option: much as one must always glumly troop to the polling station thinking of the Chartists and suffragettes, the lack of convincing options and pathetic efforts at raising awareness mean that in the case, any meaningful \"x\" is impossible. So, that's what I'll be doing.</p>",
  "<p>Ahead of tonight's blazing bonfires and fireworks displays, here are some tips to protect the wildlife in your garden or local woodland:</p> <p>\u2022 Hedgehogs are not the only garden lovers who need rehousing on Guy Fawkes night. Look out for toads, frogs and newts who will also require a little redirection. The Wildlife Trust encourages us to remember amphibians as they are valued predators in the garden world.</p> <p>\u2022 Divert toads, frogs and newts away from the bonfire by creating small piles of leaves and logs as alternative shelter.</p> <p>\u2022 Always try to make the bonfire on the day of lighting it. If you've already built yours, move it tonight to a debris-free area to allow wildlife that has moved in a chance to get out.</p> <p>\u2022 Check, check and check again. Use a torch to make sure no hedgehogs, toads, frogs and newts have sneaked in just before you light the bonfire.</p> <p>\u2022 Don't burn it all!

  "<p>So, to everyone who's freaking out about the possibility of a Romney victory: I have a weird but unshakable faith in this country.</p> <p>I know both whom I want to win, and whom I want to lose: this isn't a \"lesser of two evils\" election for me. Whatever flaws scar Obama's first administration (drones, cough, drones; watered-down Wall Street reform, cough), I find them proactively superior to Romney's. And no matter who wins, an invasion of zombie hordes is a long-shot outcome. (As Joss Whedon <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/10/29/joss-whedon-warns-that-mitt-romney-could-spur-zombie-apocalypse/\">advises</a>, you might collect canned goods and practice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour\">parkour</a>, anyway; Romney's ahead of us on that score.)</p> <p>Over time, we in the US tend to do OK. We've made serious mistakes as a country, sometimes dodging apocalypse or genocide by a combination of luck and sheer bloodymindedness. We've let our government take action in gruesome ways \u2013 internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And, as citizens, we've stood by while injustices rolled over other people's lives (this individualized list is too painful and too long to articulate).</p> <p>But we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them, as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a kind of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage bring wars to an end (\"We're still in Iraq? Why?\"). Protest and disenchantment with pursuing a failing cause allow rights to expand (\"I'm not going to get up off the couch to keep gays from marrying\").</p> <p>Romney's vision of the America in the rearview mirror is a comparatively lonely one. Nostalgia only beckons those who haven't seen progress. Women don't want a return to a time when they couldn't sit in a boardroom without holding a steno pad, or only have control over their bodies if no one knew about it. Black people don't want to roll the clock back to racial double-vision and divide. Gay men and women don't want to give up the simple gift of visibility (or even the right to serve in the military).</p> <p>And however much a Romney administration might push for policies that inch us toward the past, such moves will find resistance. The No 1 force moving America forward is the inertia of tiny gains. But, by golly, those add up: there's a black man in the White House \u2013 and that can never ever be undone.</p> <p>We're stubborn about hanging on to what we have \u2013 and that's why a Romney presidency worries me but doesn't unhinge me. Bad things will happen if he becomes president, no doubt \u2013 though much depends on his being able to push through the terrible, terrible policies he's apparently in favor of (unless now Etch-a-Sketched away). In fact, that might be tricky: the whole \"repealing Obamacare\" promise is, on its own, the kind of indolent campaign <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/romneys-pledge-repeal-obamacare-elected-165418907.html\">rhetoric</a> that betrays just how little thought Romney has given to what actual governance and practical obstacles entail. </p> <p>As for those worried about an Obama victory: you chill out, too. I'm not capitalism's biggest fan, but it's proven to be pretty durable. Warnings about how regulations will keep entrepreneurs from following their dreams and how \"government handouts\" will impoverish charities and lure the poor into indolence fly in the face of history and human nature. Tax rates as high as 90% for top income earners during the Great Depression somehow didn't translate into calling each other \"comrade\" and having options as varied as Brand A and Brand A at the corner store. Our growing acknowledgment of the need for environmental stewardship produces, if nothing else, new and exciting ways to dodge such regulations. And families keep trying to better themselves. I see proof of this every day.</p> <p>The chorus of fear-mongering from the furthest right is as galling as it is rootless. The idea that Obama wants to institute socialism, or make America subservient to the rest of the world? This hyperbole indicates a lack of faith in one's own country so profound that <em>it</em> should scare people, not the warnings themselves. The people who prey on fear and hate are the ones most likely to mask atrocities with Mobius-strip logic: we had to burn the village in order to save it.</p> <p>I don't believe these warning themselves, either, and I don't think I have reason to. You folks who worry about such things? I guess I believe in America more than you.</p>",

This money doesn\u2019t come from nowhere \u2013 to introduce the living wage would cost about \u00a312bn, \u00a313bn and that has to come from somewhere.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-21614-f0.cfm\">\u2022 The TUC says many employers can afford to pay the living wage.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The TUC believes that far more companies can afford to pay the living wage. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK's biggest companies increased their cash reserves by over \u00a380bn between 2007 and 2011. There is no excuse for cash-rich employers to deny low-paid staff a decent wage, says the TUC.</p> <p>The TUC added that paying the living wage is in the interests of employers, as it improves staff motivation and productivity, and enhances corporate reputations.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/11/Livingwage051112\">\u2022 John Swinney, the Scottish finance minister, says the Scottish government will pay the living wage to Scottish public sector workers.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/11/05/the-pony-politics-of-the-living-wage/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">\u2022 John Rentoul on his blog says that Miliband's support for the living wage is irresponsible.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The basic problem is one of unequal returns in the labour market. The Labour government made important advances, such as the national minimum wage and spreading higher educational standards, although it also decided to allow free movement of low-skilled central European workers, which may have kept low wages lower. Overall, though, income inequality in the UK did not change significantly in the Labour period.</p> <p>But, yes, it would be nice if differentials were smaller. The tax system is doing its bit, even if the Coalition Government is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/how-the-tax-facts-get-in-the-way-of-the-tory-story-8229280.html\">too incompetent to collate the figures</a>. So how can the gap between high and low pre-tax pay be narrowed? Ed Miliband accepts that simply putting up the minimum wage for everyone, which would seem to be fair and fiscally expansionary, would put people out of work.</p> <p>So he takes refuge in the warm marshmallow fudge of the Living Wage. Banks, who don\u2019t employ many people on low wages, should pay it. And public-sector employers. Apart from the NHS, obviously. And any other \u201csocially responsible\u201d company that can be morally coerced into it. What about contract staff and suppliers and cleaners employed by friends of the MD\u2019s tennis partners? Do they have to pay the Living Wage too? No doubt a working party is being set up now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/11/the-living-wage-is-a-good-idea-but-we-could-and-should-do-more/\">\u2022 Mark Ferguson at LabourList says the living wage does not go far enough.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we accept that the National Minimum Wage still leaves people living in abject poverty \u2013 and it does \u2013 then why are we willing to accept that as a legal wage floor? If the Living Wage is the level at which people can be reasonably expected to live and support themselves, why don\u2019t we demand that the NMW is set at that level? To do otherwise is to tacitly accept that some will still be employed on poverty wages. I find that difficult to stomach.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/11/where-next-living-wage\">\u2022 Matthew Pennycook at the Staggers says there is still a long way to go in extending the living wage.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the success of the living wage campaign relatively few workers have secured a higher wage as a result of a living wage initiative. For example, there are an estimated 651,953 workers in London earning less than the London Living Wage, yet only around 10,341 London workers won a living wage in the six years between 2005 and 2011. This is not a cry of despair, simply a call for realism about the role that living wage initiatives can play in tackling our reliance on an extensive pool of low-paid labour and for targeting efforts where they will be most effective.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/11/how-much-would-milibands-living-wage-plans-actually-change\">\u2022 Jon Stone at the Staggers says Miliband's proposal to \"name and shame\" firms not paying the living wage may have disappointing results.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Miliband\u2019s pledge recalls the strategy of anti-tax-avoidance protest group UK Uncut, which drew attention to high profile companies that avoided large sums of tax, in the hope of shaming them into paying more. The campaign succeeded in raising the issue up the political agenda \u2013 but corporate tax avoidance is still rife, and there have so far been no major public reversals by their targets: at the height of the protests last year, companies like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/nov/08/vodafone-subscribers-profits-rise\">Vodafone</a> reported record profits, whilst spokespeople simply repeat that they are following the law.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://publicansam.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/you-get-monkeys.html\">\u2022 Publican Sam says on his blog that 85% of pub staff are paid less than the living wage.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2012/11/the-chigley-politics-of-the-living-wage.html\">\u2022 Chris Dillow on his blog says Ed Miliband is guitly of&#xa0;\"motivated reasoning\" - believing that \"something that is morally desirable is also economically efficient\".</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://hopisen.com/2012/making-the-living-wage-happen-a-modest-and-possibly-stupid-suggestion/\">\u2022 Hopi Sen on his blog suggests offering employers incentives to pay the living wage.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://order-order.com/2012/11/05/labours-living-wage-living-a-lie/\">\u2022 Guido Fawkes on his blog says Labour's support for the living wage is hypocritical because Labour MPs use unpaid interns.</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T16:17:16.515Z\">at 4.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5097dbbb95cb1506d2444921\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T15:31:07.646Z\">3.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>David Cameron</strong> has ordered an urgent review of the North Wales child abuse inquiry findings.

The Welsh Government takes these allegations very seriously.</p> <p>In the first instance, victims of abuse who feel that the abuse they suffered was not investigated properly should report their cases to the police. My officials have been in touch with North Wales Police.</p> <p>An extensive inquiry into North Wales child abuse \u2013 the so-called Waterhouse Report was published in 2000. It was commissioned - before devolution began- by the then Secretary of State for Wales William Hague and reported to Paul Murphy, as Secretary of State, in 2000. It made extensive recommendations for improving child protection, many of which were subsequently implemented by the Welsh Government. I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse Inquiry at the time when it was set up.&#xa0;</p> <p>I need to understand fully what was included in those terms of reference and what was excluded. In due course that will enable me to consider, with others, whether any further inquiry might be necessary.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the key recommendations of the Waterhouse Report was the establishment of a Children\u2019s Commissioner for Wales. I have invited Keith Towler to come in and see me tomorrow so that I can hear his thoughts directly.</p> <p>Finally, I would like to repeat that any victims of child abuse who feel their cases were not fully investigated, should come forward to the appropriate authorities which means the police or to the Children\u2019s Commissioner , not to political parties.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5097cda495cb1506d244490c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T14:31:00.751Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to the European commission, Number 10 is wrong about living wage conditions in procurement contracts being illegal.

He also said that David Cameron was in favour of the living wage.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We back the idea of a living wage and we encourage businesses to take it up.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, when asked what the government was doing to encourage firms to pay the living wage, the spokesman just cited exhortation. The spokesman said most people directly employed by the government were paid the living wage or more. He acknowledged that some people employed by contractors on behalf of government departments (ie, cleaners) were not on the living wage. The government would encourage those firms to pay the living wage, he said. But he said the government was opposed to making it mandatory because that would \"reduce business flexibility\" and \"ultimately it could be bad for jobs\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 refused to back Iain Duncan Smith's comments criticising Barack Obama's handling of the US economy.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/04/mitt-romney-uk-press_n_2073476.html\">In an interview last night, </a>Duncan Smith said that the US deficit had \"gone from something like 4-500 billion dollars to three or so trillion dollars\" under Obama.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fact that it [the US economy] hasn't bounced back from this recession, arguably for the first time since the war, makes it a very worrying picture indeed - with unemployment really historically very high in the US and really not a lot of serious new economic activity taking place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if Cameron agreed with this assessment, the spokesman said that with the American presidential election looming, it was not appropriate for him to make a comment.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street refused to say whether Cameron was embarrassed by <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227459/Camerons-horseplay-texts-Rebekah-Brooks-Intimate-messages-PM-reveal-likes-fast-unpredicatable-ride.html\">the release of fresh text messages sent between him and Rebekah Brooks.</a></strong> Asked about the emails published in the Mail on Sunday yesterday, the spokesman said the Leveson inquiry was given all the text messages that it asked to see and that it was up to the inquiry to decide what was published.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Nick Clegg is taking PMQs on Wednesday because Cameron will still be abroad.</strong> For the same reason this week's cabinet meeting (which is normally on a Tuesday) has been cancelled.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street played down <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227531/Justine-Greening-Tories-slash-UKs-280m-India-aid-HALF-amid-claims-country-rich-handouts.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490\">reports that Justine Greening is planning to announce a cut in British aid to India this week</a>.</strong> The spokesman said he did not think an announcement was planned for this week. \"Nothing has changed,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is holding a summit on tree health on Wednesday.</strong> He is chairing meetings twice a day on the ash dieback crisis, the spokesman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street rejected claims that Cameron is refusing to hold regular press conferences.</strong> The spokesman said that Cameron regularly takes questions from the press.

But I already know what he is going to say, because the party released<a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/the-living-wage-can-help-us-rebuild-britain-as-one-nation\"> a text of his remarks in advance.</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are almost five million people in Britain who aren\u2019t earning enough the living wage; people who got up early this morning, spent hours getting to work - who are putting in all the effort they can - but who often don\u2019t get paid enough to look after their families, to heat their homes, feed their kids, care for elderly relatives and plan for the future ...</p> <p>It\u2019s not how it should be in Britain, it\u2019s not how we will succeed as a country in the years ahead because we can't go on with an economy that works for a few at the top and not for most people. We need to change it ...</p> <p>Britain needs a government that will work with the best of British business to build greater prosperity and share it more fairly. That is what One Nation is about. The living wage is an important part of helping to make that happen. It is an idea whose time has come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband says that 11 Labour councils have already become living wage employers and that more are on the way to acquiring living wage status. In contrast, only one non-Labour authority is a living wage employer, and that's the GLA, where Boris Johnson inherited the policy from Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>Miliband says that, although David Cameron described the living wage as \"a good and attractive idea\" while in opposition, the Department for Business has recently said that the living wage \"does not consider any potential adverse employment effects\" and that it is \"unlikely to be a well-targeted poverty measure\".</p> <p>And he announces that Labour is considering three policy proposals that could be used to promote the living wage.</p> <p><strong>1. Forcing firms to pay the living wage if they want to bid for public sector contracts.</strong> Islington council did this when it awarded its ground maintenance contract to Enterprise, he says. All 80 Enterprise staff are now on the living wage, at a cost to the company of \u00a3150,000. Miliband says the company absorbed the entire cost, which was just a fraction of the value of the \u00a320m contract.</p> <p><strong>2. Paying firms a subsidy if they pay the living wage.</strong> Firms that pay the living wage save the taxpayer money because their employees do not require such high in-work benefits. Miliband says Labour is exploring ways of sharing this saving with employers, Here's an extract from his briefing paper.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IFS estimated in a report two years ago that for every person moved on to the LW the saving for the Treasury would be around \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation and the IPPR are looking more closely at how you might could incentivise or support the spread of living wage by allowing employers to share in some of the savings that could be made in tax credits etc as a result of them paying living wage.</p> <p>This might involve councils and big employers adopting living wage <br> policies across a city or geographical area such as a Living Wage zone or getting some transitional support for policies that would help them make the transition - eg in return for investments in skills, or support for small businesses. It would see government, employers, and local authorities working together to develop One Nation solutions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. Forcing firms to say how many of their employees are receiving less than the living wage.</strong> Miliband says that Labour has already called for more transparency in relation to pay at the top (it backs full disclosure of executive pay) and that this would be a natural extension of the transparency principle. In theory, it could \"shame\" employers into paying their staff more.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T13:24:44.053Z\">at 1.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50978e5995cb1506d24448e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T10:01:40.093Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's the full list of accredited living wage employers.

Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has already visited [the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia] since taking office and the fact that these are two of the few countries he is now returning to signals the PM's commitment to cementing long term partnerships with two of Britain\u2019s most important strategic allies in the Gulf. It follows a sustained government effort to build a reinvigorated partnership with countries in this region through the Gulf Initiative that was initiated in 2010 after a period of neglect.</p> <p>This strategic partnership is focused on delivering security, prosperity and openness in the region. A central pillar is our defence relationship with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia given our shared commitment to security and stability and defeating the threats we face in the wider Middle East region.</p> <p>On this visit, the prime minister hopes to begin the next chapter in our relationship, establishing a truly strategic defence partnership. This presents an opportunity to significantly boost the British defence industry - worth \u00a35.4 billion in annual exports and sustaining 54,000 jobs \u2013 and the prime minister will use to the trip to specifically promote the Typhoon fast jet to Gulf leaders.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman have all expressed an interest in purchasing Typhoons and the Government is aiming to secure sales of over 100 aircraft to the region in the coming year, deals that together would be directly worth over \u00a36 billion to British firms with additional benefits through supply chain work.</p> <p>Oman is already in negotiations with BAE Systems for 12 fast jets with the contract due to be signed before the end of the year. And the Saudis have signalled that they are interested in placing a second substantial order, on top of the 72 jets they have already acquired.</p> <p>On the back of this success, the government is now encouraging the United Arab Emirates to choose Typhoon as they seek to replace their current fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have shown interest in placing an order for up to 60 jets and the prime minister will fly straight into a military airbase near Dubai where he will accompany the deputy chief of staff the UAE Armed Forces and the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs to inspect the Typhoons with RAF pilots on hand to share their experiences of flying one of the best fast jets in the world. The government is currently working with the companies involved in the construction of Typhoons to ensure that the fast jets are kitted out with the latest targeting technology to increase the prospect of boosting their export sales.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b337806-e019-43cd-8d13-a57333f50309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352108053338/f745bdb1-6f1c-4f58-b6b4-9cc9739c9981-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron in Dubai\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron looks on beside Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airlines and Group, and president of Dubai's Civil Aviation Authority, during a visit to the Dubai metro.

  "<p>Government plans to enshrine the right of both divorced fathers and mothers to see their children risk putting victims of domestic violence and their children in danger, according to a report.</p> <p>The needs of victims of domestic violence in family proceedings are regularly ignored and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/13/access-rights-divorce-by-law\" title=\"\">plans to prioritise \"shared parenting\"</a> could worsen the situation for many abused partners, according to <a href=\"http://www.rightsofwomen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Rights of Women</a>, a legal rights charity.</p> <p>Victims of domestic violence often felt unsafe and sidelined in family courts and proposed new laws would compound the problem, said Emma Scott, director of Rights of Women, which carried out in-depth interviews with 34 women and 113 family law professionals.</p> <p>\"Women and children are being put at risk because of contact put in place by the court. They continue to be exposed to violence because of those decisions,\" she said. \"Women still feel their safety is not taken into consideration despite clear guidance in courts to prevent that happening.\"</p> <p>The report follows criticism last week of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police\" title=\"\">Essex police</a> over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/30/essex-police-criticised-domestic-murder\" title=\"\">failings</a> before the murder of a woman by her violent ex-partner. On the day of Jeanette Goodwin's murder police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/domestic-violence\" title=\"\">failed to make sufficient links with previous domestic violence</a> incidents and did not fully appreciate the danger she was in, a report by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ipcc\" title=\"\">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> found.</p> <p>The report concentrates on perceived failings in the family court system, stating that women are frequently placed in unsafe or intimidating positions with violent ex-partners. According to the report, 52% of women during family proceedings had been cross-examined by, or had to cross-examine, men who had been violent to them.</p> <p>One woman who spoke to researchers said: \"He said he's fired his lawyer and he would be representing himself. It's scaring the life out of me because it means he will be interrogating me, asking questions, intimidating me.\" Three-quarters of respondents said they had concerns for their safety at court. One woman, identified as Suzanne, described being in the open waiting room: \"He stood and stared at me for 15 minutes. My barrister told this to the judge, and the judge didn't take it seriously.\"</p> <p>Another woman described being forced to attend mediation sessions with her former partner, despite a restraining order against him. \"In the beginning I was saying: 'Why is he here, when there's an order that he's not to be within 5km of me?' [The answer] was that he's here because he has parental responsibility and it's a separate matter,\" she said.</p> <p>Facilities such as screens in court and separate waiting rooms were often not provided, stated the report, with almost half of the legal professionals surveyed reporting that special facilities were not advertised for intimidated court users, while 37% did not know whether they were available.</p> <p>The majority of women interviewed wanted their ex-partner to have contact with their children, said Scott. \"According to case law, where contact is possible it should happen, and we entirely agree with that as long as it is safe,\" she said. \"There was a lack of understanding of domestic violence among judges, she added. Rebecca, whose partner regularly screamed at her in front of her daughter and threatened to kill her, said: \"I was advised that in court I need to be seen as being reasonable and not obstructive, you know, not one of 'those women'. He can be as abusive as he wants, but I'm not allowed to react.\"</p> <p>The report calls for a shift in the way victims of domestic violence are treated in court, including better special facilities, more data recording from the Ministry of Justice on instances of domestic violence in the family courts, the flagging of domestic violence on family court databases and domestic violence training for all legal professionals including judges.</p> <p>But the key recommendation is for \"an urgent review of the decision to restrict legal aid in family law cases\", said Maddy Coy, co-author of the report. \"In the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/policy/moj/2011/family-justice-review-final\" title=\"\">Family Justice Review</a>, proposals around shared parenting and cuts to legal aid have a raft of implications. Legal aid is a lifeline to many domestic violence victims who rely on it. We are hoping that with this report there is a window to influence decisions currently being taken.\"</p> <p>Fathers' rights groups accused the report's authors of \"scaremongering\" and said false accusations of abuse were often used in closed family court proceedings to prevent fathers having contact with their children. \"If the abuse has been proven in a criminal court then it is a serious matter and is taken into consideration, but we see false allegations in a bid to deny contact again and again,\" said Nadine O'Connor, campaign director of <a href=\"http://www.fathers-4-justice.org/]\" title=\"\">Fathers4Justice</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this year ministers rejected the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/18/family-law-confusion-lib-dem\" title=\"\">advice from the economist David Norgrove</a>, who led an independent official review into family justice, not to enshrine \"shared parenting\" rights in law after similar laws in Australia led to a series of legal claims and counter-claims and severe delays in child custody cases.</p> <p>Nick Clegg <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/13/access-rights-divorce-by-law\" title=\"\">stated</a> that the \"proposals [will set] out that, where it is safe and in the child's best interest, the law is clear that both parents share responsibility in their upbringing\", but O'Connor argued the wording left fathers powerless and failed to satisfy either camp.</p> <p>\"It will not change anything for fathers and it is likely to make things worse. There is too much room for manoeuvre,\" she said. \"More than 3.8 million children are growing up without their fathers in this country not because they are at risk from their fathers, but because they are denied contact, more than 50% of contact orders are broken and 93% of residencies are awarded to mothers. Are we really saying that 93% of fathers are unfit to share in the parenting of their children?\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman from the Ministry of Justice said the government was committed to improving the family justice system after recommendations by the Family Justice Review: \"We are also committed to ensuring appropriate safeguards and protection is in place for victims of domestic violence. Many of the recommendations in this report accord with work already under way and the government will consider what further actions may be necessary.\"</p> <h2>'Women who have experienced domestic violence are seen as obstructive'</h2> <p>Ruth, 44, was in an abusive relationship for four and a half years and had two children with her ex-partner before she learned from police that he had served a prison sentence for raping a 14-year-old.</p> <p>\"It was a very horrible attack. He had tied her up and covered her head in duct tape,\" she said. \"He was on the sex offenders register but had lied to the police about having children. When I discovered everything I told him to leave and that's when he physically assaulted me.\"</p> <p>Ruth's ex-partner threatened to commit suicide and then attacked her with a knife. When she managed to throw the weapon out of a window he grabbed her head. \"He came across the room and put his hands around my head to try and break my neck,\" she said. \"My children were upstairs and I was utterly terrified.\" The man fled after she bit his hand and he was arrested four days later, charged with battery and released on bail.</p> <p>He then began to stalk her, serving several short prison sentences for breaking restraining orders. Ruth fled to her parents but had to flee to a refuge when her ex-partner was released from jail and moved near her home and continued to stalk her.</p> <p>Two years after the attack, after several spells in prison, he applied for a contact order with his two young children. Ruth went to the family court, receiving no legal aid because she was in work.</p> <p>\"I had to represent myself because I couldn't afford a lawyer and when I went to speak the judge told me she didn't want to hear me go on and on about why I didn't want him to have contact, because this was about what was best for our children,\" she said. She was embroiled in court proceedings for a year.</p> <p>\"He would wait for me outside the court, until I had to have a police escort,\" she said. \"I requested screens in court but each time they said it was inconvenient. It felt like they never considered the risk to me. They just weren't interested.\" Eventually social services did a section 7 report \u2013 an independent evaluation and assessment of the situation \u2013 which determined that Ruth's partner was dangerous and he finally withdrew his application, although he is free to apply again.</p> <p>\"Quite often it seems that women who have experienced domestic violence are seen as obstructive about contact,\" she said. \"They think the offender is only a risk to the mother \u2013 but that's entirely misguided. Those children are the best weapon he has.\"</p>",

Welcome to Middle East Live. Here is a round-up of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-opposition-united-qatar-conference\"><strong>Sharp disagreements have emerged at a Syrian opposition conference in Qatar meant to forge a more cohesive leadership.</strong></a> The Syrian National Council has balked at a plan backed by western powers that would dilute the SNC's influence. But with international pressure mounting, it also suggested it was willing to negotiate a compromise that would give it more influence in a new leadership team. The SNC is due to decide on Wednesday whether to accept a plan proposed by a prominent dissident, Riad Seif, to set up a new leadership group of about 50 members. The SNC would get about 15 seats, while military commanders and local leaders in rebel-held areas would win wider representation. SNC chief Abdelbaset Sieda said he and others in the group no longer trusted promises of international support linked to restructuring of the opposition. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We faced this situation before, when we formed the SNC. There were promises like that, but the international community in fact did not give us the support needed for the SNC to do its job.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/201211552650353858.html\"><strong>The UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, has called for a new UN security council resolution to formalise an declaration adopted in Geneva in June, which called for a transitional administration but did not specify what role, if any, Assad would take.</strong></a> The initiative came after Brahimi met the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrovin Cairo yesterday. Brahimi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important that the Geneva Declaration be turned into a resolution from the security council to gain the power to enable it to become an applicable political project.</p> </blockquote> <p>Al-Jazeera reported that Lavrov dismissed the need for a resolution, saying \u201csome countries which participated in Geneva don't speak with the government but only with the opposition and encourage them to fight till victory and this has very negative implications\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-syria-damascus-bombardmentbre8a409w-20121104,0,3187029.story\"><strong>The Syrian army has bombarded rebel strongholds in southern Damascus on Monday with artillery and from the air, hours after opposition fighters attacked militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, opposition activists told Reuters.</strong></a> Warplanes fired rockets and tanks and artillery pounded the neighbourhoods of Sbeineh, Yalda, Bibla, al-Tadamun and Hajar a-Aswad, they said. The working-class Sunni Muslim neighbourhoods have been at the forefront of the 19-month-old revolt against Assad</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_JAPAN_SYRIA?SECTION=HOME&amp;SITE=AP&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\"><strong>Japan is to host international talks in late November aimed at widening sanctions against Syria, it said today.</strong></a>Existing sanctions include freezing assets of the Syrian president and military leaders and an embargo on oil and arms trade with Syria.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-rebels-capture-oilfield\"><strong>Syrian rebels captured an oilfield in the east of the country on Sunday after three days of fierce fighting with government troops protecting the facility, activists said</strong></a>. The head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said rebels overran the al-Ward oilfield in the province of Deir el-Zour near the border with Iraq. About 40 soldiers were guarding the facility that the rebels had been pounding for the past three days, he said, adding that opposition fighters also captured several regime troops.</p> <h2>Kuwait</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/teargas-protesters-kuwait-city\"><strong>Kuwaiti security forces have fired teargas to disperse a banned demonstration by about 2,000 opposition supporters against new voting rules for parliamentary elections due on 1 December.</strong></a> The emir announced changes to the electoral law last month which some opposition politicians say are an attempt to give pro-government candidates an advantage in the polls.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/libya-militia-fire-central-tripoli\"><strong>Rival Libyan militias fired guns and rocket-propelled grenades at each other in Tripoli on Sunday and set fire to a former intelligence building in one of the worst breakdowns in security in the capital since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi</strong></a>. At least five people were wounded and a stray bullet entered a hospital in the city centre, where residents rushed to arm themselves, saying calls to police had gone unheeded.

  "<p>Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who stands a good chance of being the first openly gay candidate elected to the Senate, has a story she likes to tell about the event that propelled her into politics.</p> <p>\"I remember graduating from college, being very interested in public service yet wondering what I could aspire to be,\" she said in an interview. \"It was that year [1984], when I graduated from college, that Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for vice-president, and I watched in my first efficiency apartment, a little one-room place. I choked up and I thought at that moment: I can do anything. I can aspire to anything.\"</p> <p>With Baldwin on the ballot, facing Republican Tommy Thompson, and votes in four states to legalise same-sex marriage, there is a strong chance this election day could deliver a similar moment.</p> <p>It is already galvanising the movement for LGBT rights, winning Baldwin's race national attention. Barack Obama was due to hold his second campaign rally with Baldwin in 48 hours on Monday morning.</p> <p>During a brief stop at a small campaign office in a working-class area of Milwaukee on Sunday, Baldwin was thronged by volunteers from the Victory Fund, which works to get LGBT candidates to elected office.</p> <p>They had travelled from as far as Florida, New York and California to volunteer for her campaign. Outside groups poured money into the race, allowing Baldwin to pulverise Thompson's record. Al Franken, the comedian and Senator, went canvassing door-to-door.</p> <p>Polls show the Senate race virtually tied between Baldwin and Thompson, a former governor who has towered over Wisconsin politics for a quarter of a century. Ad spending on both campaigns topped $65m, making Wisconsin one of the most expensive Senate races in the country.</p> <p>But Baldwin insists her sexual orientation is rarely a topic of conversation on the campaign trail. \"It almost never comes up,\" she said. \"It's been a race that has been flat out on economic issues.\"</p> <p>To a lesser extent, a win for Baldwin \u2013 an \"ultra-liberal in the words of her opponent \u2013 would also be a slap at Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, who broke up the unions and then saw off a Democratic recall vote last summer.</p> <p>Baldwin is a strong supporter of most of the policies the Tea Party activists despise.</p> <p>She supported and even wrote part of the healthcare bill \u2013 the section enabling children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. She voted for the climate change law in 2009, and wanted to deepen investment in renewable energy. She has had doubts about sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>Thompson on the other hand wants to repeal Obama's healthcare act, expand oil drilling, and adopt Paul Ryan's deficit plan.</p> <p>Baldwin, 50, who has represented the liberal college town of Madison in the House of Representatives for 14 years, has the low-key demeanour of a technocrat or chief executive, but she espouses the politics of a populist.</p> <p>On her tour of get out the vote operations, she skipped the rousing speech for private chats with volunteers.</p> <p>Her opponent, Tommy Thompson, has been out of politics for 12 years working as a healthcare lobbyist. He was elected to four terms as governor, and served as health secretary in the Bush administration.</p> <p>But Thompson remains an old-school politician who seems unable to exit a room until he has shaken every last hand. He spent his Sunday tailgating with football fans in Green Bay, and before hopping on his red \"proven reformer\" bus to three more campaign events \u2013 with eight young grandchildren in tow. \"It's going very well,\" Thompson told the Guardian. \"There is momentum with us and I don't think the polls have picked up on this all over the state.\"</p> <p>For the most part, Thompson has not tried to use sexual orientation in his campaign. In a speech at party headquarters at Fond du Lac, north of Milwaukee, he focused his remarks on Barack Obama, whom he likened to Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>But his campaign earlier sent out pictures on Twitter of Baldwin at a gay pride event. Thompson has also tried to brand his opponent as too extreme for Wisconsin.</p> <p>\"There are big differences between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney,\" Thompson told the crowd at Sheboygan. \"But there's an ocean between Tammy Baldwin and Tommy Thompson. She's so extreme that Nancy Pelosi turns to the left to talk to (Baldwin).\"</p> <p>Baldwin fought back with ads branding Thompson as an outsourcer of jobs and a lobbyist with no interest helping in the poor.</p> <p>Most people following the race think it will go down to the last votes \u2013 Baldwin herself is predicting a much tighter finish than the last two elections. But she still dared hope out loud that her own race could make history.</p> <p>If she wins, her presence would force the Senate to engage more fully with LGBT issues.</p> <p>\"If you are not in the room, the conversation is about you. If you are in the room, the conversation is with you. We never had an openly LGBT member of the US Senate, and even though there are strong pro-equality allies who serve there, it has always been a conversation about a group of people. So this changes everything,\" she said.</p> <p>It could also change the landscape far beyond Washington, Baldwin said.</p> <p>\"I think in particular for young LGBT youth, especially those that come out in hostile communities or less supportive families and are thinking: 'what about my future?'. They can wake up to a Tammy Baldwin victory on November 7 and feel the way I did when Geraldine Ferraro accepted the nomination.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's night. Shapes that in daylight were buildings and people have become strange and amorphous. Bursts of light from street lamps and houses dominate our attention. Colours disappear. How can the photographer, whose greatest weapon is light, take a picture (or at least a picture that makes some sense) out of the dark? </p> <p>A few technical issues. Lack of light generally means a slow exposure \u2013 it could be several seconds \u2013 so unless you have hands and arms made of rock you'll need a support for your camera. A tripod or small bean bag is the obvious solution, or propping your body against a wall. In hand-held cameras a shutter speed of one-thirtieth of a second is about the minimum. Remember that vibrations from roads, railways or excited children may not be obvious at the time but can ruin a slow exposure. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398872189\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352124542825/People-watch-fireworks-010.jpg\" alt=\"People watch fireworks\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keep your camera steady ... Photograph: Petras Malukas/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petras Malukas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from light (or lack of it), your shutter speed should be influenced by the movements of your subjects. Sports photographers well know the difficulty of capturing clear images from badly lit tracks or pitches, often having to wait until the action passes through a patch of light. That's not to say a blur of movement is a bad thing, as it can add information and drama to your picture. </p> <p>With fireworks, remember that a rocket burst can take three or four seconds to achieve its maximum effect, so you will probably need a tripod. Also, the displays tend to cover an expanse of sky, so use the widest lens you have. Try incorporating skylines, landscape or people \u2013 even if they are out of focus or in silhouette. Look at the way the light from bonfires or sparklers illuminates the faces of spectators, and how a simple thing such as shooting a sparkler on a longish exposure can create patterns. Avoid using your flash because it interferes with the atmosphere \u2013 although it can be effective in, say, picking out a face in the foreground while balancing the light from a fire in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398872190\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352124904650/A-spectator-stands-under--001.jpg\" alt=\"A spectator stands under a tree to watch a fireworks display on Bonfire night\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watch the light ... Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most cameras and devices are of course digital, giving you tremendous freedom to try out ideas. The latest cameras have amazing latitude when it comes to ISO ratings (the acceptable light tolerance of an image) although at 6400 ISO and above pixels can become bunched up, resulting in an untidy effect. </p> <p>Be aware of colour. A sodium street lamp can dominate more than you think. Your eyes (but not the camera) tend to dismiss it and concentrate on shadows. These muted night-time colours can add value to a picture, but you might try avoiding colour altogether and shooting in black and white. </p> <p>Experiment with different shutter speeds, perhaps deliberately moving the camera to blur your picture. Can figures silhouetted against the light add atmosphere to your picture? What about shadows cast against a wall? Use whatever light is available and adjust your photography to it. </p> <p>And lastly, be bold. Night photography is no longer something only professionals can do, but open to anybody with a reasonably decent device and a good eye.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Now it's your turn.

  "<p>Before releasing a new album and presenting new artwork at India's first biennial, the London-born artist Mathangi Maya Arulpragasm \u2013 better known by her stage name MIA \u2013 went through a period of collection and reflection in advance of the release of her self-titled book.</p> <p>The book went out 23 October and is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/25/mia-art-book-review\">bright, art-driven survey</a> of the five years that cover the production and release of her three LPs: Arular, Kala and Maya.</p> <p>To assemble its technicolor pages, she had to dig around the relics of her career to assemble a cohesive narrative using her filmed, painted and digitized creations after years of whirlwind touring and controversy-generating.</p> <p>\"Two-thousand eleven was just a period of outputting what I already had and just sort of organizing it,\" Maya told the Guardian. \"It just felt important to me because I don't have a space that's always constant or a situation that's always constant. I don't know, I feel like I'm in therapy.\"</p> <p>Part of that organizational process involved taking 20 years of her film footage and handing it over to a producer friend who is working on a documentary about MIA. She gave the friend boxes of film without reviewing it and agreed to have no control over the project.</p> <p>\"It is what it is,\" she said. \"I'm not ashamed of that shit, and I don't feel like I've got anything to hide.\"</p> <p>The film has an indeterminate release date, courtesy her mysterious, artsy friend, and MIA has seen three minutes of a trailer. She saw that small chunk of the film so long ago that the finished documentary will be a mystery to its subject.</p> <p>\"When you see it is gonna be when I see it,\" she said.</p> <p>The film will likely examine the rapper's migratory personal life and its impact on her similarly mobile career.</p> <p>At six months old MIA left England for her parents' native Sri Lanka. She lived there and in India while her father campaigned for a separate Tamil state. His political activism forced the family back to London where Maya would eventually attend college at Saint Martins College of Art and Design. The prestigious school counts English artistic legends including Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney as alumni.</p> <p>Eleven years after entering the school mid-term, she had become a world-famous and critically adored rapper who performed with Jay-Z and Kanye West while pregnant at the Grammys. She had a period of rest in 2011, but now she is back to bouncing around the globe with the forthcoming documentary, a soon-to-be-released album and an art show at India's first biennial.</p> <p>\"I've never had a thing, a space where I collected my souvenirs or tour stage passes \u2013 I don't have any of that stuff and so when I got off the tour bus in 2011 or something, January, February, I was just like shit \u2013 I've just been going and going and going and I'm moving back to England and I still don't have anything and I am moving into a space that's a white room and completely empty and I didn't own a single thing.\"</p> <p>She said before she could advance her artistic career, it was important to study her history and assure her past work was consistent to help believe in the next steps of her career.</p> <p>\"I think it's just basically reviewing the stuff you've done in some sort of documented form and it sort of clears your mind to make space for what you want to do next,\" she said. \"It's been a really good process of cleaning out the closet, basically, and making space for some new thoughts.\"</p> <p>She is keeping most of the new thoughts under wraps as she focuses on promoting the book and the work it represents, but did say the book is not as focused on technology as her most recent studio album /\\/\\ /\\ Y /\\.</p> <p>\"This one is more about finding something beautiful in a lot of ugly stuff and that's like the basic thing, it can be done through whatever, it's not technology-dependent,\" she said. \"It's just kind of giving people the power to find beauty in just shitiness.\"</p> <p>At the cusp of the next stage of her career, she'll be presenting new art at India's Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala, on 12 December 2012 in Kerala. Whether or not she'll be performing at the biennial is still in discussion, but she definitely has a handful of shows lined up in Australia and is hoping to tour next year.</p> <p>On Sunday, a day before leaving for India, Maya spoke in New York at the Museum of Modern Art's PS1 branch in Queens to discuss the production of the book with her fans. </p> <p>Maya plugged in each of the three laptops used to produce her albums and showed previously unseen images and videos from the beginning of her career.</p> <p>She also shared an image that represents her new album, Mathangi, which has been pushed back from a previously announced December release.</p> <p>The image was a collage of internet searches, bright green imagery and icons representing the artist and was greatly influenced by her newfound spirituality, which she discovered on the internet.</p> <p>When she searched \"Mathangi,\" her first name, on Google India, the top result was a Hindu goddess she didn't know about, and then herself.</p> <p>\"She basically is the god of spoken word, or rap music, or whatever the thing was 5,000 years ago,\" she told the audience. \"So she lived on the outskirts of mainstream society and fought for information, so her whole existence is based on the purity of information.\" </p> <p>The goddess' mantra also happens to be aim, which is MIA backwards, and her mudra is the middle finger, something Maya also can relate to. She made the middle finger gesture during <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/feb/06/super-bowl-madonna-mia-outcry\">a performance at the Super Bowl in February</a>. The act was broadcast to a television audience of 152 million.</p> <p>When an audience member at PS1 asked about the incident, she said it would be addressed on the new album.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This story was updated on 6 November to correctly locate PS1 in Queens, not Brooklyn.</em></p>",
  "<p>David Willetts recently wrote that \"evidence should be the bread and butter of policy makers\" in an article <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/oct/22/evidence-based-policy-david-willetts\" title=\"\">published on this network</a>. Unfortunately his call for evidence-based policy is undermined by the lack of evidence supporting his own government's higher education reforms. The coalition's university policies have consistently neglected both evidence and research over the past two and a half years.</p> <p>Willetts wrote of the importance of putting \"more research in the hands of decision makers\" in order to improve policy. However, current higher education reforms have not been based on the thorough research that underpinned previous major changes to higher education policy. In his article, Willetts discussed the landmark 1963 <a href=\"http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/index.html\" title=\"\">Robbins report on higher education</a>. The comparison is an extremely unfavourable one.</p> <p>That major review of higher education suggested long-term principles and policies for how universities should be organised and funded. The Robbins committee examined foreign systems and presented six additional annexes of evidence alongside the report. Similarly, the 1997 Dearing report had five appendices of specifically commissioned research. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/s/10-1208-securing-sustainable-higher-education-browne-report-pdf\" title=\"\">the Browne review</a> (from which the coalition's reforms evolved) proposed major change on the basis of minimal evidence, only five pages of references. In fact, the one piece of research commissioned specifically for the Browne review was ignored in the final report.</p> <p>In supporting the introduction of for-profit-providers into the higher education sector, the government ignored the warning signs from the USA. Those private universities <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/professor-paul-curran/forprofit-higher-educatio_b_1984456.html\" title=\"\">do not have a good track record</a>: the most recent <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\" title=\"\">US Senate report</a> makes for grim reading. Of the million students enrolled with for-profit companies in 2008-9, over half had withdrawn by 2010. In the companies studied, 22.7% of revenue was spent on marketing/advertising, 19.4% went on pre-tax profit while a mere 17.2% was spent on teaching.</p> <p>Despite such a poor record, the 2011 white paper was full of praise for the benefits of competition and the need to encourage more for-profit providers to enter the system. The thrust of the government's reforms, supposedly putting students at the heart of the system', addresses the wrong problems if the aim is to improve teaching. The neglect of teaching for the past 25 years has resulted from both government cuts to university funding and government-created incentives for universities to allocate their funds to research. This government has not addressed those issues but instead opted to rely on greater competition as the solution to higher education's problems.</p> <p>The coalition's reforms have failed to address key issues related to social mobility. Again the problems derive from ignoring both evidence and research. LSE economist Nicholas Barr, actually a leading advocate of reforming higher education towards a less state-funded system, described the abolition of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) as <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9515.2012.00852.x/abstract\" title=\"\">'unspeakable'</a>. This view was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/18/coalition-child-poverty-ema-1\" title=\"\">recently echoed</a> by Alan Milburn, the coalition's child poverty adviser. EMA has been widely regarded as an extremely effective policy. Its removal will result in lost access to higher education by those who could have benefited from it.</p> <p>Perhaps the worst failures on evidence were those relating to the finances of higher education. The government clearly had no idea about its costs. It claimed initially that \u00a39000 a year would only be charged in 'exceptional' circumstances. The fact that universities have faced a mantra of 'more for less' since the early 1970s, with ever greater output expected off the back of stagnating state investment, was ignored. Soon after that claim, two-thirds of universities announced their intention to charge \u00a39000 a year. The government then resorted to creating the complicated core and margin bidding system for student places, yet another development that threatens universities with the worst of both state control and market chaos.</p> <p>Most absurdly, reforms that were presented as part of the austerity drive, actually risk increasing overall state spending levels, as the recent <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a> report and subsequent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/29/multiple-choice-higher-education-funding\" title=\"\">'unishambles' headlines</a> discussed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.if.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/False-Accounting_-Why-Higher-Education-Reforms-dont-add-up.pdf\" title=\"\">According to the Intergenerational Foundation</a> (IF), the evidence suggests \"there is likely to be no saving to the public sector finances from the reforms to higher education funding\". As student loan repayments form part of the consumer price index (CPI) inflation calculation, the rising tuition fees will force CPI inflation up. Certain government pensions and benefits are linked to the CPI. The IF estimate that this could add \u00a32.2bn to the social security budget by 2016.</p> <p>While the state will save by spending less on tuition fees, the rise in the benefit bill could outweigh this saving. The student loan book also threatens to become a dangerous liability for the state. The government's figures are based on optimistic default estimates of only 30-32% losses. The IF argued that a 40% level is more likely and should be adopted. The student loan book could become a serious liability in a similar manner to PFI deals, except on a far larger scale.</p> <p>Willetts should not talk about evidence-based policy.

  "<p>The announcement by chocolate manufacturer Hershey in October that it would source all of its cocoa from certified sources by 2020 is further evidence that certification is not a niche market activity.</p> <p>Mars, Incorporated made a similar commitment in April, 2009, while Mondeleez (Kraft's new name for its confectionery business), and Unilever (owners of the Magnum ice-cream brand) are all buying certified cocoa for their chocolate. The Rainforest Alliance system alone has 60,000 certified cocoa farms in its programme.</p> <p>Certification awards a certificate to a producer or group of producers to confirm compliance with a set of practices detailed in a standard. Well-known certification bodies differ mainly because of the differing standards on which they are based. In Rainforest Alliance's case, <a href=\"http://www.sanstandards.org\" title=\"\">the sustainable agriculture standard</a> deals with how the farmer manages the land and how people working on it are treated, including the farmer and any workers \u2013 and are subject to continuous improvement and local interpretation as our knowledge and understanding evolves..</p> <p>The cocoa industry embraced certification much later than the coffee industry, with the major growth only happening in the last few years. We have seen a steady growth in chocolate products bearing certification seals. But this is not the main driver of the expansion of certification in the cocoa industry. Most of the work is unseen by the consumer, as the industry addresses a crucial supply issue: cocoa markets are growing strongly, but cocoa farmers have generally low productivity and low incomes. With land a finite resource, and young people wanting to live better than their parents, the issue is where cocoa in the following decades is going to come from.</p> <p>Certification is part of a major push by cocoa and chocolate companies to modernise the industry. Nobody wins if cocoa farmers are so poor that their children abandon the farm and move to the city, or if the soil is so exhausted and the trees so old that they don't produce a decent harvest. No company wants illegal child labour in its supply chain and nor do the governments of the major producing countries in West Africa. It's unacceptable in today's market.</p> <p>The unseen work that is happening to address this significant supply chain risk involves training farmers in improved and sustainable management techniques, increasing their access to business and financial services, strengthening their organisations, developing more productive planting material and the nurseries to grow them, research into soil management and many other aspects affecting a farm's productivity.</p> <p>This work was included in the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/new-business-models-for-sustainable-trade\" title=\"\">new business models for sustainable trade project</a>, for which we partnered with the <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Food Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://crs.org/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> (IIED) and <a href=\"http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/Paginas/index.aspx\" title=\"\">The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture</a>.</p> <p>This project \u2013 on which <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16034IIED.pdf\" title=\"\">a new report is published by the IIED</a> \u2013 has deepened our institutional knowledge about how market systems can be coupled with critical on-the-ground services which farmers need to advance toward stability, profitability and long term sustainable practices.</p> <p>It is not just the companies with leading high street brands that are involved. Companies supplying cocoa beans and processing them into chocolate ingredients are working directly with the farmers to upgrade their skills and knowledge. It is they, alongside the Rainforest Alliance, that has trained the 60,000 certified farmers. That is how certification has grown so quickly as part of an effort to make sure there is enough cocoa produced under good environmental and ethical conditions without needing to clear forests and damaging fragile ecosystems for new planting.</p> <p>Much is made of the premium prices associated with certified products. Farmers expect to be paid more for certified products because of the effort they have made to achieve the certification. But the real gain is not in the market but on the farm. <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/publication/pdf/ra-certification-cocoa-cote-divoire-cosa_0.pdf\" title=\"\">An independent survey published in 2012</a> found that Rainforest Alliance certified farms in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire registered as much as 70% more productivity than a control group of non-certified farms. The improved earnings of the farmer do not depend on a niche market; they come directly from the farm management.</p> <p>Sustaining and further increasing these achievements will secure the cocoa supply that the world needs and provide a competitive livelihood for the next generation of cocoa farmers. Brands will continue to use certification seals but the bigger focus is, and must remain, on the farmer and the farm, which is where certification bodies started out.</p> <p><em>Edward Millard is director of sustainable landscapes for the </em><a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Rainforest Alliance</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The war has been won, peace has been reached and all is calm in the small seaside town of Norton. People are overjoyed to be living in a time of peace and prosperity.</p> <p>Well, everyone except Lizzie, who's so bored she thinks she's going mad.</p> <p>Until she meets Natalie: dark, wild, dangerous Natalie. Lizzie is drawn to the out-of-control Natalie, and as they grow closer, Natalie reveals something about her strange little brother, Philip. </p> <p>He sees things no one else can, he can see that the threat of war is not over.</p> <p>He can see the 'Left-Over Nazis' and it's up to him, and Natalie, to find them and force them out of town.</p> <p>To begin with it's all a game to Lizzie, but before long, Philip's 'gift' sparks a series of consequences that spin dangerously out of control.</p> <p>I've never read anything by Hendry before, but the moment I read the blurb of The Seeing, I knew I simply had to get my hands on it.&#xa0; It was one of those books you start reading and find you simply cannot put down, no matter how hard you try.</p> <p>It was dark, addictive, seductive and so much more than I ever thought a 170 something paged book could ever be.&#xa0;</p> <p>I don't know if you guys have read it, but something about The Seeing reminded me of The Tulip Touch by Anne Fine.&#xa0;</p> <p>It had the same darkly dangerous feel to it, the same addictiveness.&#xa0; But The Seeing was better in my eyes, much, much better.&#xa0; Incredible, actually, even if the beginning was kinda slow.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hendry's characterisation was sublime.&#xa0; All the characters were so 3D and intriguing.&#xa0; Lizzie was very much your average teenager, and perfectly embodied how easy it is to get pulled to the 'dark side' by boredom or a need for excitement. </p> <p>Natalie was just\u2026 well, intriguing. Philip was the most interesting of the lot. There was just something about him. He just knew stuff, stuff that he shouldn't \u2013 couldn't \u2013 possibly know. </p> <p>All the way through, I couldn't figure out whether maybe, just maybe, he really did have some kind of 'second sight'. Hugo was really sweet and kind and I loved getting an outsider's view of the trio, seeing them all through his eyes. </p> <p>The writing was just \u2026 whoa. It was atmospheric, creepy and so much darker than I thought it could be. I loved that we got to read from each of the main characters' POV's: it meant we got the whole picture. </p> <p>As for the story line, I was hooked from the prologue. I mean, talk about gripping openings! The plot was fast-paced, thrilling, with the perfect amounts of suspense, description and dramatic pauses. </p> <p>As for the ending\u2026 Just\u2026 whoa\u2026</p> <p>I loved doing post-war Britain in history and have always been fascinated by historical fiction set in that time period.&#xa0; It intrigued me to see the two sides of post-war UK: the rich, prosperous side and the financially struggling, hard-done-by side.&#xa0; </p> <p>The post-war pain and fear and damage was palpable throughout the book, especially whenever Lizzie's mum was involved.&#xa0; The Seeing was like a little time machine back to 1956. </p> <p>I must say, all the themes in this were so much darker than I thought they'd be. One example was the way Natalie and co went about ridding the world of \"LONs\". It was simply bullying, and if there's one thing I truly hate, it's bullying. </p> <p>I actually felt sick to the stomach at some of the things they did. But that just made the book even better, even more powerful. </p> <p>This book literally blew me away. I can't tell you how powerful and shocking The Seeing was, how addictive it was. </p> <p>As I neared the end, I found myself reading faster and faster and faster, totally hooked, unable to put the book down, not even for a second.</p> <p>This was such a hard-hitting book, so much so it hurt.</p> <p>Read it, have your mind blown, and you'll see what I'm talking about.</p> <p>Star Rating: <br>4\u00be Out of 5</p> <p>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</p>",
  "<p>Eve-of-poll voter surveys mostly point to a narrow US presidential election victory for Barack Obama. But with the contest finely balanced in a few key states, it would not take much to shift the advantage to Mitt Romney. A last-minute slip, a neglected minority voter bloc, or simply a piece of bad luck could be enough to ditch Obama and send the Republican to the White House.</p> <p>Here's one possible example: Obama's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZHMsivjr04\" title=\"\">unguarded suggestion in Springfield, Ohio</a> last Friday that \"voting is the best revenge\" has been seized on by Republicans. Romney exploited it in a speech later that same day. \"He [Obama] asked his supporters to vote \u2013 to vote for revenge. Instead, I ask the American people to vote for love of country,\" Romney said \u2013 and then aired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/mitt-romney-vote-for-revenge-rumpus\" title=\"\">a TV attack ad</a> featuring the exchange.</p> <p>\"'Revenge' is not something sought by most American voters, and 2008 Obama voters who are disappointed in his performance \u2026 Voters want someone who will serve the country. The moment when Obama said \"revenge\" could turn out to be a pivotal moment in the campaign\", said Beltway Confidential commentator <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/the-problem-with-obamas-revenge/article/2512567#.UJea4I7cLH1\" title=\"\">Michael Barone</a>. Obama faces plenty of other possible last-minute pitfalls as he reaches for the finishing line.</p> <h2><strong>The Bradley effect</strong></h2> <p>Named after a former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\" title=\"\">black mayor of Los Angeles</a>, this phenomenon involves voters telling pollsters they intend to support a black candidate, and then not doing so because of his or her ethnicity. In 2008 Obama enjoyed an 8-9% lead in most polls, but his actual margin of victory was 6%. If today's polls are overestimating his backing by a similar margin, <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/reporting-that-makes-you-stupid/\" title=\"\">Romney will win</a>.</p> <p>Racial prejudice, covert or otherwise, also partly explains why a majority of white males will vote against Obama. In 2008, 57% backed Republican John McCain. The anti-Obama totals among both white men and women may be higher this time, polls suggest. It is also a fact that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-usa-campaign-whites-idUSBRE89A07C20121011\" title=\"\">white males prefer Republicans to Democrats</a>, whatever their colour.</p> <h2><strong>Turnout</strong></h2> <p>The Democrats need a big turnout to secure victory but most estimates suggest Obama's support, particularly among younger voters, blacks and Hispanics, will fall well below 2008 levels, partly as a result of disappointment with his performance in office.</p> <p>\"In 2008, voters 18 to 29 went for Obama 2-1 over McCain; turnout among these young voters was the second-largest ever recorded. But in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-young-voters-arent-feeling-obama-mania-this-time/2012/11/02/e9a97024-1c5a-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html?wprss=rss_opinions\" title=\"\">that youthful Obamamania seems to have faded</a>. Alex Wirth of the Harvard Public Opinion Project has forecast that turnout for voters under 30 will be 34 to 40%, compared with 51% four years ago,\" said Fast Company's Anya Kamenetz.</p> <h2><strong>Swingers</strong></h2> <p>At the heart of American pollsters' electoral map lies an awkward little secret. Presidential elections are increasingly decided by an ever-smaller group of swing voters within an ever-smaller number of swing states. Nobody really knows exactly who or where these people are, and that makes for severe unpredictability. But Republicans are claiming independent voters (neither Republican nor Democrat registered) are breaking 2-1 for Romney in toss-up states and that early voting turnout shows the <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/sunday-reflection-the-ground-glass-election/article/2512449#.UJemFY7cLH1\" title=\"\">Republican base is more energised</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Acts of God</strong></h2> <p>Religiously-inclined voters could also give Obama a scare. \"I expect Mitt Romney to maximise the white religious vote \u2026 The major push Obama made in 2008 among white Catholics is completely absent this cycle \u2026 Anti-Mormon sentiment has never caught on among the Christian community to the degree some feared. And Obama's contraception and abortion message has caused a great deal of concern among religious groups, Protestant and Catholic alike,\" said <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/11/03/obamas_failure_with_whites_independents_will_sink_him.html\" title=\"\">analyst Ben Domenech</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Perfect storm</strong></h2> <p>Despite suspicions about Hurricane Sandy, Obama does not control the weather. Forecasters say election day will be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/20189531\" title=\"\">cold, wet and windy in the north and east</a> \u2013 not good for the needed high Democrat turnout.</p> <h2><strong>Cock-up or conspiracy?</strong></h2> <p>Comparisons are already being made with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/06/uselections2000.usa\" title=\"\">2000 presidential election</a> that saw George Bush installed as president after numerous recounts, legal challenges, and myriad balloting irregularities gave rise to <a href=\"http://www.michaelparenti.org/stolenelections.html\" title=\"\">claims of widespread fraud and rigging</a>. Today's election is supposed to be better organised. But Americans are a sceptical lot. If the vote is as close as predicted, and the result is not immediately clear, claims that sinister forces are at work will not be long in coming.</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian appears to be agonising about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/leveson-inquiry-prejudging-the-judge\" title=\"\">whether it can share yet another drink in the last chance saloon of self-regulation</a> or whether it should support <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/10/lord-justice-leveson-regulatory-reform\" title=\"\">what Lord Justice Leveson might propose</a> if that was independent regulation underpinned by statute.</p> <p>In doing this, the newspaper has performed a service to its readers just as its journalism helping to expose the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/04/milly-dowler-voicemail-hacked-news-of-world\" title=\"\">hacking scandal</a> performed a service for the whole country in exposing the scale of the cover-up of widespread illegal practices by journalists.</p> <p>Yet the Guardian first ought to frame the debate fairly.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/leveson-inquiry-prejudging-the-judge\" title=\"\">Friday's editorial</a> describes \"furious lobbying \u2026 by those who wish Lord Justice Leveson to turn the statutory thumbscrews on journalists\". It is unclear where this is derived from. <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>, for instance, is not even calling for statutory regulation (far less thumbscrews). We are looking for independent regulation, underpinned by just enough statute to make it effective. This position is set out <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/everybodys-hacked-off/\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8743851/what-im-fighting-for/\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/news/poll-shows-public-support-for-independent-regulator/\" title=\"\">here</a> and countless other places, so it is hard to see where the Guardian has found the lobbying for straight \"statutory regulation\", with or without thumbscrews. Perhaps a spectre is being conjured up, in comparison to which another \u2013 voluntary \u2013 system somehow looks better?</p> <p>The editorial then describes lobbying \"on the other side, by those who believe that the judge may be set on sweeping away 200 years or more of press freedom\". This is exactly what the so-called <a href=\"http://www.freespeechnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Speech Network</a> claims in a voice of thunder. So talk of \"two extremes\" seems unjustified. In contrast, the victims of the press have been pretty dignified in calling for an end to voluntary self-regulation. But every single one \u2013 from Hugh Grant to the Dowlers \u2013 have rejected government regulation. Just because one side of an argument is extreme, that does not justify talking glibly of \"two extremes being urged on him\".</p> <p>The central problem with the editorial was the suggestion that \"Sir Brian [Leveson] can build on the real progress made by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Black,_Baron_Black_of_Brentwood\" title=\"\">Lord Black</a> in outlining a new system of regulation that enjoys widespread support across the press\".</p> <p>The problem with the press at the moment is not just about breaches of the criminal law (hacking, bribing) or civil law (libel, intrusion). It includes stuff that is unacceptable without being unlawful. Telling a celebrity that unless they co-operate with a paper, the paper will publish another story about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15925515\" title=\"\">their mentally ill mother</a>. Conspiring to cover up industrial scale law-breaking. Exercising a perfidious and secret hold over politicians at the top of government. There is no way that all this can be tackled by a plan cooked up by a Conservative peer, who <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/guy-black/47111\" title=\"\">is executive director of the Telegraph</a> and has been the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">top man and the main defender of the discredited PCC</a>.</p> <p>But taking it purely on its merits, we are implored by the editorial to believe that the Black proposal is not the status quo. But it is self-regulation and described as such and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/26/lord-black-press-self-regulation\" title=\"\">promoted as such by its proponents</a>. We are told that it promises \"real investigations, tough sanctions and a commitment to the enforcement of standards that its predecessor, the PCC, did not have\". Yet when the PCC was established \u2013 back there in the last chance saloon \u2013 the industry claimed the PCC had all these qualities and <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzA2MQ==\" title=\"\">was doing so until recently</a>.</p> <p>The most curious argument of the editorial comes next. \"But there is still merit in the outline Black plan, which goes some way to solving the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/16/richard-desmond-mediaguardian-100-2012\" title=\"\">so-called Richard Desmond problem</a> \u2013 the fear that major publishers could undermine the system by simply leaving it \u2013 by requiring all publishers over a certain size to sign a five\u2013year contract.\" The Desmond problem is not just about people leaving after two years of a five-year term. It is about people not returning for another term in the contract.</p> <p>It is also about people never joining in the first place, and no fair and legal contract can of itself compel parties into it. So to truly \"require\" publishers to join the system would need at least a dab of statute. Ergo an underpinning statute is needed. This is the allegedly extreme position put by Hacked Off. It is also something that the proponents of Lord Black's scheme have never accepted and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">say they never will</a>.</p> <p>The editorial then espouses an arbitral arm of this self-regulatory, non-statutory, contractual system \u2013 to deal with legal press complaints.</p> <p>For such a parallel system of justice to stand a chance of being legal, it would require parliament to pass a law authorising a different standard and a different penalty as the editorial concedes. Friday's editorial rightly judges that \"For the press to oppose such a limited use of statute as a matter of principle would seem to be counter-productive\". Quite. For Lord Black's not-a-hint-of-statute-required, totally-self-regulatory plan to work, we require not only an underpinning statute to compel newspaper proprietors to sign the contract and more statute to establish a parallel legal system of press complaints for those signed up.</p> <p>But all that Rubicon-crossing underpinning new statute would itself amount to more new legislation than that required for the effective system of independent regulation that Hacked Off supports.</p> <p>The editorial goes on to say that the \"trouble with compulsory regulation is that, in the wrong hands, it could edge us back towards something that looks like the licensing of the press and of journalists \u2013 something that was abolished in the late 17th century and which has no place in a free society\". The article <a href=\"http://inforrm.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/hacked-off-the-ft-and-the-campaign-for-no-change/\" title=\"\">concedes that</a> \"some counter that this is a baseless fear, claiming that it would be possible to enshrine in law the regulator's independence from both government and the newspaper industry\". But if there was a valid fear about press freedom, the question should be \u2013 what is the problem facing Britain that we need to edge away from? The prospect of our media being run by a fascist state? Or the prospect of our state being run or over-influenced by a small number of powerful and corrupting media groups and their top executives?</p> <p>You only need to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/search?q=rebekah+brooks+murdoch+cameron+blair&amp;target=guardian\" title=\"\">read the Guardian</a> to see that the former is absurd while the latter was and remains the clearer danger, especially if the press escape effective regulation yet again.</p> <p>In support of the \"fascist regime might be just round the corner\" justification for supporting a purely voluntary system, the editorial asks \"whether, having once conceded parliament's right to lay down the law about the regulation of the press, a Rubicon has been crossed \u2013 at least politically.\"</p> <p>But our elected parliament has always has the right to legislate in ways that constrain the press. And has used it in respect of defamation laws, data protection, RIPA, computer misuse, contempt of court, bribery etc. Even our self-serving tabloid press, when a politician used statutory powers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/daily-mail-mirror-fined-contempt-court\" title=\"\">obtain a conviction against the Mirror and the Mail</a>, did not argue that our contempt of court laws were being used by a hostile government to muzzle them. And this vengeful parliament is currently passing a <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/defamation.html\" title=\"\">defamation bill </a> which \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.libelreform.org/news/531-report-and-third-reading-of-defamation-bill-2012\" title=\"\">insufficiently I would say</a> \u2013 liberalises the law for the media. If statute somehow begets statute, one would expect multiple amendments to these laws. There have been very few amendments to the original acts and most amendments have been liberalising.</p> <p>Then we had \"Europe may be on the brink of a period of social turbulence \u2013 with all the authoritarian responses that will almost inevitably follow. See this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/29/press-freedom-greece?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">arrest of the Greek journalist Kostas Vaxevanis</a> for publishing the names of alleged tax evaders\". This \"Greeks under the bed\" argument seems a bit unworthy of the Guardian, more like the preserve of the Daily Mail, as it <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2227131/The-new-dark-age-Across-Europe-free-speech-democracy-face-biggest-threat-Thirties.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">duly confirmed with a blast</a> on Friday.</p> <p>Self-regulation in good old Blighty has been the bedrock for the justifiable arrest of scores of senior UK journalists, by a police force that cannot be claimed to be hostile to the employer of those journalists, under a government that spent more time socialising with those arrested than running the country.</p> <p>Next exhibit: \"And look at the fury recently directed by the press and MPs at the BBC's news operation and see how ugly the mood can turn against even the most ethical and professional news organisations.\" This is a quite bizarre argument. Because a self-serving press can <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2215946/Jimmy-Savile-BBC-inquiry-Lord-Leveson-look-cesspit.html\" title=\"\">bully and victimise a public service competitor</a>, we should back off from effective press regulation?</p> <p>The editorial ends by repeating its central inconsistency. \"We do believe in a contract system \u2013 not the use of statute \u2013 to secure participation\". Someone needs explains how, without underpinning statute, a voluntary contract can secure participation \u2013 a problem identified by everyone at the inquiry from Lord Justice Leveson, through Robert Jay QC, up to the court usher.</p> <p>Until then, Hacked Off will be arguing that the recommendations of the judge \u2013 if a bit of statute is used to secure participation of the press in a system of regulation independent of both government and the industry \u2013 is the right way forward, and that even a more independent-looking son of the PCC, based on a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/14/guy-black-pressbof-chairman\" title=\"\">blueprint from the boss of the PCC</a> is the wrong way.</p>",
  "<p>A morning with David Millar is like no other interview in sport. Time reels past in a vivid blur of words for this is a conversation fuelled less by the cups of coffee lining the table in a cafe on High Street Kensington than by a tumultuous year in professional cycling. Of course, with Millar, the tangled mess of corruption and courage is best approached via circuitous and sometimes strikingly beautiful routes.</p> <p>In his elusive accent, echoing all the places he has lived in the world, the 35-year-old Scot talks about writing books and riding bikes, about growing old and inevitable endings, about the familiar rhythms of the seasons and the sharp surprises of fatherhood. But his conversation is bolted down by riveting insights into a damaged sport that could only come from an insider.</p> <p>Millar sometimes sounds trapped inside the dark maze of cycling. Yet his penetrating gaze as a former doper turned patron of the peloton keeps turning, as if on a rooted plinth, while Millar explains the past, reveals the present and anticipates the future of cycling with a mix of foreboding and relish. Confronting the certainty that new storms are about to break, his words frame the collapse of a diseased old regime.</p> <p>\"It's gone beyond some guys cheating and taking drugs,\" Millar says of cycling's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/22/uci-wada-armstrong-drugs\" title=\"\">ongoing crisis</a>. \"Cycling has been exposed as a fraudulent sport. It was, until recently, a deeply criminal business. We're facing the darkness of that period, and it is so necessary. This is the only way that cycling is going to climb out of the abyss \u2013 by confronting the past just as we have cleaned up the current state of the sport. It has to be done and that's why the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/22/doping-crisis-uci-pat-mcquaid\" title=\"\">UCI needs to take responsibility</a> now.\"</p> <p>Millar takes another sip of cold coffee and thinks hard about the coming days. \"The UCI need to be very careful,\" he says, \"because the momentum is rolling too fast for them to control it. Just as with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">Lance Armstrong</a>, we'll reach another tipping point soon. I sense the same looming crash with the UCI \u2013 unless they act decisively.</p> <p>\"I don't think they realise what everyone needs is immediate action. They're trying to go through the usual sports-politics way of trying to ride this out until people forget about it. These are career sports-politicians. But they cannot evade this any longer. They have to act quickly or they're going to face a total revolt and they'll be out anyway.\"</p> <p>Millar has long led the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/19931026\" title=\"\">call for Hein Verbruggen to step down</a> from his tainted role as honorary president of the UCI. But he now turns his scrutiny on to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/22/uci-mcquaid-usada-armstrong\" title=\"\">Pat McQuaid</a> \u2013 who succeeded Verbruggen as president in 2006. \"Pat has to show volition to change the UCI. I've said to him before that the first step is to show complete recognition of the past and assume responsibility for it. But, with the UCI, there still seems to be a sense of denial and an 'us and them' approach. They still claim that they did everything they could to stop doping. Well, they didn't \u2013 that's obvious to everyone.</p> <p>\"The more people get educated about the past the more precarious the UCI's position becomes. Within the sport, we had in-depth knowledge of cheating. Now there is a public awakening and the UCI will be in real trouble unless they make a full apology. There seems to be some unbreakable alliance between McQuaid and Verbruggen. Pat needs to cut that cord and move forward. He needs to wake up to the fact that some revolutions become unstoppable.\"</p> <p>On the outside, the latest conflict between harassed administrators and anti-doping campaigners might seem just another bewildering spat. But Millar points to the legal wrangle between the <a href=\"http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/12904/UCI-court-action-sees-Kimmage-summoned-to-appear-before-Swiss-court-in-December.aspx\" title=\"\">UCI and Paul Kimmage</a>, the renowned anti-doping journalist, as another potential tipping point. The roots of this story run deep for McQuaid and Kimmage knew each other for decades in Ireland. McQuaid said recently: \"I've known Paul since he was in his pram. I managed his amateur career.\"</p> <p>And yet, to the disbelief of anyone who has a passing acquaintance with the depth of Kimmage's resolve in uncovering the truth about doping, McQuaid and the UCI chose to sue him. McQuaid used the word \"scumbags\" to describe former cyclists who testified against Armstrong and then said he would not allow Kimmage to call him and the UCI \"corrupt\". A furious reaction was unleashed on Twitter and, on 26 October, the Paul Kimmage Defence Fund sailed past $86,000 (\u00a354,000). Coincidentally or not, the UCI \"<a href=\"http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/13155/UCI-suspends-legal-action-against-Paul-Kimmage-during-independent-commission-review.aspx\" title=\"\">suspended</a>\" its legal action that same day.</p> <p>Kimmage responded on Twitter \"How do I feel? I feel like Maximus as he prepared for battle.\" His next tweet was even pithier: \"On my signal, unleash hell.\"</p> <p>Millar rocks with mirth. \"That was pure Kimmage. But the bottom line is this: don't piss off Paul. So Verbruggen and McQuaid made a huge mistake. It says so much about them. When I heard about their legal action I wanted to say: 'You do realise this is Paul Kimmage?' I'm incredulous that Pat and Hein could be stupid enough to go after him. He'll literally hunt them down. Don't fuck with fanatics.\"</p> <p>He says that last loaded word gently; for Millar understands how the commitment of Kimmage and David Walsh, who stood up to Armstrong, is fuelled by terrible pain and injustice. \"The sport has made Paul a fanatic because it absolutely <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZgns7CXeUI\" title=\"\">vilified him</a>. Paul loves cycling. He grew up with the sport but it burned him so badly. He was ostracised and got treated like a cunt by so many people \u2013 me included \u2013 for 20 years. Now all this stuff about Armstrong came out and, suddenly, he was right all along. He's right to still be angry. I'm not sure it's good for him but maybe Paul will be the one to make a difference with the UCI. And here's the beautiful irony. That fanatical voice has been the voice of reason through all this.\"</p> <p>What did Millar think when, last Thursday, Kimmage announced he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/01/paul-kimmage-pat-mcquaid-criminal-complaint\" title=\"\">suing the UCI</a>? Millar laughs: \"I thought, 'Brilliant. Good old Paul.' The moment McQuaid and Verbruggen sued Paul they were unleashing the dogs of hell on themselves. They then suspend their case against Paul? Another mistake. Suspending the case looks hesitant and weak again. This could be another tipping point for the UCI because Paul's going to come at them now \u2013 no holds barred. Verbruggen and McQuaid could fall.\"</p> <p>Armstrong has already fallen by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/24/how-lance-armstrong-strongarmed-cycling\" title=\"\">finally conceding defeat</a> after Usada's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/11/armstrong-usada-sophisticated-doping-scheme\" title=\"\">devastating account</a> of his cheating. \"I don't think any of us expected the rapidity of his downfall,\" Millar says, \"just the sheer speed and how hard he has fallen. The revelations have been shocking to the public and his fans \u2013 but in cycling what has been shocking is that, 'Wow, he's been caught.' Most of us thought, 'Oh, well, it's Lance, he's gonna get away with it.' We've learned to change the sport from within, and make it better. But we always thought we'd have to live with this elephant in the room \u2013 Armstrong and the past. Although it is detrimental to young riders, who don't deserve to be tainted by the past, we need these investigations for the sport to survive.\"</p> <p>How will it end for Armstrong? \"The optimist in me hopes he'll come out and tell the truth. But it's not so simple now. I think that, behind the scenes, he will be striking deals. Lance has to move forward with his life because he's still a father and a husband and a leader of a charity. So he has to face the truth. The moment he tells his story it will add to the tapestry of that period and stop it being just the Armstrong era. But the longer he waits the more it'll ruin him.\"</p> <p>Alberto Contador and Miguel Indurain have recently, and bizarrely, defended Armstrong. \"I've thought a lot about them\", Millar says of the former Tour de France winners, \"because I know Contador and Indurain. I was so disappointed when I read those comments. But I live in Spain and have lots of Spanish friends. Our Anglo-Saxon mentality is puritanical \u2013 'Punish 'em forever, they did wrong.' But the Spanish say: 'He's a father of five, he works for charity, he rides a bike \u2026 let's move on.' It was incredibly inappropriate what they said and, believe me, they went 'Oh shit!' when it broke. But they had no idea that what they said was wrong because their mentality is so different.\"</p> <p>Bradley Wiggins, in contrast, had spoken out against doping for years. And yet his glorious 2012 has been undermined by criticism that, since winning the Tour, he has not been vocal enough. Millar provides a staunch defence. \"Why the fuck should Brad be empathetic to the critics. He spent most of his career thinking that winning the Tour de France was a dream that would never happen because you have to dope. And then the last four years the sport has changed. Basically he got to where he is now through hard work and sacrifice. So when he wins the Tour and people doubt him? No wonder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/24/bradley-wiggins-lance-armstrong\" title=\"\">he's angry</a>. He's thinking: 'Fuck you \u2013 you haven't worked like I did. How dare you be on your phone in a caf\u00e9 critiquing me?'</p> <p>\"Brad had every right to lash out. It's what any clean guy would do. I'm different. I made mistakes. I doped. I cheated. I have an obligation to be vocal and transparent. But I honestly don't think it's the duty of the clean guys.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/nov/02/bradley-wiggins-interview-tour\" title=\"\">toll of an incredible year</a> on Wiggins is already apparent. Last month he suggested he is unlikely to pursue the 2013 Tour and, instead, will target the Giro d'Italia. \"It's sensible,\" Millar says. \"The work he put into this year's Tour was incredible. The only way you dedicate yourself with that drive is by doing it once. The stars aligned. Contador wasn't there, the course was perfect, his team was incredibly strong and Brad was on fire. Why would he want to go through that again? He would love a pink jersey [for winning the Giro] on his wall next to the yellow one. He's already got one yellow. Why would he want seven?\"</p> <p>Considering next year's Tour, Millar offers an intriguing insight. \"I don't think anyone can beat Contador. He's just so good. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/chris-froome\" title=\"\">Chris Froome</a> is the only guy Contador is scared of. I've spoken to Contador about it and that's good because he's never been scared of anyone. He watched Chris climb at the Tour and you saw how hard <a href=\"http://c-cycling.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/vuelta-exclusive-froome-ready-to-take.html\" title=\"\">Contador raced</a> from the start at the Vuelta [Tour of Spain]. He was racing to get rid of Chris because he was scared of him. That's going to make it a great race.</p> <p>\"Chris is old-school. He's a quirky, brilliant, eccentric character and I love him. He's got a heart of gold but he's also got a mean streak. With Sky around him, Chris could challenge Contador for real. I think they'll put so much work into Chris, like with Brad, and it's just unfortunate they're having to weather this Armstrong storm because they're losing momentum and energy. But [Dave] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/dave-brailsford\" title=\"\">Brailsford</a> will fix it. And thank God we've got Froome and Sky because it'll make the race interesting.</p> <p>\"There's still a sad irony here. Sky won the Tour clean and they have become another flag-bearer for the future. But they're <a href=\"http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/535255/questions-hang-over-team-sky-s-zero-tolerance-approach.html\" title=\"\">getting vilified because their zero-tolerance policy</a> has been questioned. Yet they were still clean. They never doped. There's room for Sky's zero-tolerance aim but there should be flexibility. Teams like ours [Garmin-Sharp \u2013 which Millar leads alongside Jonathan Vaughters, his team manager and another former drug-using cyclist turned redoubtable anti-doping campaigner] work by including those of us who made past mistakes.\"</p> <p>Vaughters rode with Armstrong <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/24/tyler-hamilton-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">and his evidence, alongside that of other former team-mates such as Tyler Hamilton</a>, helped Usada expose \"the most sophisticated and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\". Millar and Vaughters have been working against drugs a long time and, while stressing the need to address the past, there is exasperation that the sport's changed culture has been overshadowed.</p> <p>\"Doping is just a non-subject to the young guys,\" Millar says. \"To them it's the dark ages of the sport. It's easy to forget that, when I turned pro, it was everywhere. That's what we mustn't forget. Jonathan and I have this sense of history but we want to change things in the future. We think it carries so much more weight and power to work with people who have learnt from the past and want to make a difference. But it's also easy for others to move away from the fact that we cleaned up the sport \u2013 from the ground. You can win the biggest races clean now and that's a seismic change.</p> <p>\"Tyler doesn't know what the sport is like today. He hasn't spent time with us and seen what we've done to clean up their mess. I think it's great what Tyler has done, with the book, and coming to terms with the past. But can we put it into context please? It's such a shame Sky and us are talking points because we're both clean teams and putting ourselves on a soap box in different ways. We both want to acknowledge the past by cleaning up the present and creating a better future for cycling.\"</p> <p>It seemed especially moving when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/13/tour-de-france-2012-stage-12\" title=\"\">Millar won a stage of the Tour</a> this year on a July day which marked the 45th anniversary of Tom Simpson's drug-fuelled death on Mont Ventoux. The past, present and future wrapped around a deeply personal moment. \"Once I was over the line I found a spot where I could just lie down and look up at the clouds and feel happy for a few minutes. I knew that the poignant connection with Tom Simpson gave me the chance to be sanctimonious and on my soap box in all my post-race interviews. It was perfect to have the link. Instead of just jumping into it and being holier than thou I could use the past to talk about the present.\"</p> <p>This Friday, the day after he returns to Spain, Millar will climb on his training bike for the first time in five weeks. Seventeen years have passed since he first started racing. Yet Millar will rekindle \"the slow-burning fire\" that should carry him through at least another two years of competitive cycling while, simultaneously, pointing a new way forward for a sport that still consumes him. His reflective yet animated mind keeps whirring even as we say goodbye.</p> <p>\"Maybe next year it will be important for Brad to assume a new role,\" he suggests. \"He will have had time to come to terms with what he has achieved. It would be good for him to take the patron role. And it would be good for Sky. Our two teams could send a really powerful message because, beyond the UCI, we need to be proactive and make people believe in us. That's the responsibility of all who want the sport to continue. We can't let anyone else take the lead. It's up to us to make people believe.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's Gulf mission is a conspicuous attempt to calm relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both vital trading partners, after spats caused by the changes during the Arab spring and fears over the growing strength of Islamist groups in the Middle East.</p> <p>The trip is part of an ongoing effort to smooth recently ruffled feathers in the two autocratic states and ensure that billions of pounds worth of defence sales and other UK economic interests are not affected.</p> <p>Problems on the prime minister's agenda include sudden difficulties over renewing a key BP oil concession in Abu Dhabi, the largest of the Arab emirates, and worries about a \u00a37bn fighter aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia. Both countries are bristling over criticism of their human rights records \u2013 though little of it is from the British government. UK trade with the Gulf is worth \u00a317bn a year.</p> <p>Cameron's trip was arranged some time ago, but follows last month's extraordinary outburst by the Saudi ambassador to London, who said the kingdom felt \"insulted\" by a planned parliamentary investigation into Britain's relations with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Saudi sources warned the BBC that there could be a retaliatory \"review\" of the country's ties with the UK. British officials have subsequently been scrambling to explain that the government cannot control the Commons foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>One view was that the ambassador may have been covering his back, rather than acting with the authority of the foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal, who has been ill.</p> <p>Saudi officials complained that the foreign affairs committee had been \"manipulated\" by members of the vocal Bahraini opposition, some of them with links to Iran, who are keen to stress the Saudi role in helping to crush the unrest in Bahrain in March 2011.</p> <p>Friends and critics of Saudi Arabia agree that the parliamentary move had damaged the country's already poor image in the UK. William Hague, the foreign secretary, and Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, are planning separate Gulf tours.</p> <p>Compounding tensions with the Saudis is what regular visitors describe as a sense of drift in Riyadh, where 88-year-old King Abdullah is ailing, reforms are moving at a glacial pace and the future is uncertain. Another part of the problem is a London embassy that is notoriously prickly and uncommunicative.</p> <p>Little damage has been felt so far, but there is palpable nervousness regarding the future. Cameron will push for the completion of the BAE Systems deal for 72 Typhoon jets, maintenance and missiles, and for lucrative business with the UAE, where the defence manufacturer has \"huge ambitions,\" in the words of its chairman Dick Olver.</p> <p>\"The Saudis will play Russian roulette with payments which could be quite exciting given BAE's current problems,\" predicted a businessman with long experience of the region. \"They will use political stuff as a point of leverage \u2013 whatever tools they have at their disposal.\"</p> <p>Precedent is worrying. In 2006 the Saudis threatened to end counter-terrorist cooperation with the UK unless the serious fraud office dropped its investigation into BAE Systems over the al-Yamamah arms deal.</p> <p>Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, ambassador to Saudi Arabia at time, assessed that the threat was real and the investigation was shelved on national security grounds. He is now BAE's international business development director.</p> <p>Unrest in the eastern provinces, home to the country's Shia minority, is another highly sensitive issue, with Gulf officials warning that the Saudis will not countenance interference in their internal affairs.</p> <p>The Foreign Office categorises the kingdom as a \"country of concern\" in terms of human rights, but its criticism is discreet. \"Saudi Arabia \u2026 gets a comparatively easy ride given the scale of the human rights violations in the kingdom,\" Amnesty International said last week.</p> <p>Uncertainty over the BP concession suggests pressure is already being applied by the UAE, brooding over regional and local issues. Like the Saudis, the Emiratis were devastated by the west's abandonment of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt last year and the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East. The UAE is also notably hawkish on Iran, whose nuclear programme is at the centre of regional tensions.</p> <p>Emirati leaders have been angrily expressing their concerns to the UK, diplomats say. Tempers flared recently over coverage of Islamists and human rights issues by the Guardian and BBC, triggering a Twitter campaign accusing Britain of backing \"traitors\".</p> <p>Independent observers are pleased that the UK is becoming more critical of the status quo in Bahrain, where the British government criticised a ban on demonstrations as \"excessive\" last week. \"People are surprised that the British are taking such a critical role in assessing the situation in a way that might have a negative impact on trade,\" said Mansour al-Jamri, editor of the Bahraini newspaper al-Wasat.</p> <p>But others see more continuity than change in the region as a whole. \"The Gulf states are unnerved by the ease with which the US and UK have shifted towards engaging with the Muslim Brotherhood in North Africa,\" said Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House.</p> <p>\"They don't want what happened to Mubarak to happen to them. Elsewhere in the Middle East things are different, but I struggle to see any difference in policies towards the Gulf. Britain is doing business as usual in Bahrain despite the protests. That's a signal that will not be lost on the Saudis as they deal with unrest in their eastern provinces.\"</p> <p>If the Saudis are now silent, their British friends are speaking out. Daniel Kawczynski, the Tory MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia, says the row over the foreign affairs committee inquiry has been \"extremely unhelpful and damaging\" to relations between the two countries.</p> <p>\"Every time I take an MP to Saudi Arabia their views are radically changed,\" Kawczynski said. \"There is a huge amount of prejudice in the House of Commons as there is in the country as a whole, because you only ever hear negative press reports. People have a very distorted view of the kingdom. I would be very put out if the Saudis came to this country and challenged and berated me about all our social ills \u2013 whether neglect of the elderly or drug abuse or inner city crime. But we constantly criticise the Saudis in a quasi-colonialist and condescending and derogatory manner. You have to consider what would happen if Saudi Arabia was in the hands of an extremist Muslim government.\"</p>",

  "<p>Another round number, so it's time for another iconic series. The Wire is one of those shows that can be used as social shorthand. If you've seen it, and you don't like it, we probably won't ever be friends. If you've seen it, and blithely said you didn't get it till you watched it with subtitles, we also won't be friends. The Wire requires you to concentrate on it. That's not a weakness, it's a demand.</p> <p>Set in Baltimore, The Wire follows an epic cast of characters, of police officers (or po-lice, as they tend to describe themselves), junkies, dealers, politicians, killers, and more. It never talks down to its audience, but rather works on the premise that all great drama does: don't patronise or explain, just tell the story, and your audience will jump to reach you.</p> <p>It's tough to choose which detective to write about from The Wire: the self-destructively handsome McNulty, the spectacularly sweary Bunk, the insanely-buff-for-the-boss Daniels? Badass Kima, bull-headed Herc, streetwise Carver? They're all worthy of a column in their own right, and if this blog runs for long enough, they'll get one each. But for now, my focus falls on the quiet man: Lester Freamon.</p> <p>The joy of The Wire is that almost no one is stupid. The cops are smart, the crooks are smart, and everyone has an agenda. As with all the best tragedies (and much of The Wire is a tragedy), the rights of each individual are in direct contradiction with one another. Death, often violent death, is frequently the only solution.</p> <p>But there is also a symbiotic quality to the gangs in The Wire, only some of which are criminal. The cops only exist to catch the drug dealers. The drug-dealers exist to feed the addicts, and keep the other dealers in check. The addicts scrape by on a few bucks from the police in exchange for a little information on the dealers. Everyone feeds off everyone else.</p> <p>It's that rarest thing: a detective show where the police are as morally flawed as the criminals, and the criminals are as morally complex as the investigators. If this blog covered iconic TV villains, The Wire would provide easily the best ones (Stringer, Omar, Avon, D'Angelo, Marlo). It would also produce the most pathos-riddled victims, who I won't name, in case you're about to watch the show for the first time.</p> <p>But even in this dog-eat-dog world, Freamon is unique, because he is a man of almost limitless patience. He understands the difference between right and wrong, even when it costs him 13 years of his police career (dumped behind a desk after catching a well-connected perp). He used the time carving dollhouse furniture, because that is what men of limitless patience tend to do. It's all down to Clarke Peters' lovely, contained performance that this makes Freamon oddly more attractive rather than less.</p> <p>He also understands how to bend the rules, but never too far (you hear that, McNulty? This means you, in season five). He knows that following the money will always lead you to the criminal. If it pains him to give up on a case which isn't fully and entirely completed, we don't think of him as obsessive, we simply think of him as right.</p> <p>McNulty is the heart of the wire-tapping detective squad, and Freamon is the brains. He's always thinking, because he knows he's as smart as the criminals they're trying to catch. Since they have an enormous incentive to be one step ahead of the police, Lester realises that he has to try harder, think more creatively, persist beyond common sense and self-preservation if he is ever going to make a difference.</p> <p><strong>Iconic?</strong> You're surely joking. Not having watched The Wire is qualitatively the same as having spent the past five years hitting yourself in the face with a stick once a day. What are you doing? Stop it. And Freamon is the most iconic of the bunch: a man who will subpoena you into oblivion if you have the audacity to cross him. Threaten him, punish him, force him to retire, but he will never give in.</p> <p><strong>Duffers?</strong> I hear you: Season five isn't the strongest, unless you have a passionate interest in the survival of print media in a digital age.</p>",
  "<p>With its glamorous presenter, primetime slot, nervous participants and eager crowd \u2013 brandishing smiling or frowning cardboard faces to indicate approval or disdain \u2013 it might sound like another of China's glitzy dating shows.

On Thursday, China opens its 18th party congress, designed to usher in the new generation of Communist party officials who will govern the world's most populous country into the 2020s. The process will be choreographed to within an inch of its life. Its outcomes, decided in advance by the leadership, will not be properly known until the middle of November. But the men (there almost certainly will not be any women) who file on to the stage for collective approbation face a public that increasingly demands the right to hold its government to account. The party is seeking new ways to respond without undermining its rule.</p> <p>Officials are adopting additional methods of observing and channelling the public mood, whether that be using <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/16/internet-china-censorship-weibo-microblogs\" title=\"Guardian: Microblogs\">microblogs</a> \u2013 there are 80,000 government accounts, according to state media \u2013 or television shows such as Wuhan's.</p> <p>Citizens expect more from their officials, and stories of malfeasance or incompetence spread quickly online. Governance problems are given a face by figures such as \"Uncle House\" - a Nanjing official under investigation after internet users revealed he and his family owned more than 20 properties, despite his modest monthly salary of around 10,000 yuan (\u00a31000).</p> <p>Authorities have repeatedly vowed to crack down on corruption. State media have reported that 600,000 officials faced punishment for disciplinary violations over the last five years.</p> <p>Yet in 2008, just under 40% of Chinese people deemed corrupt officials a very big problem. That has risen to 50%, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project.</p> <p>The Chinese leadership \"knows the legitimacy of the party now depends on performance, in terms of delivering services and improvements in living standards\", said Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham.</p> <p>The result is what he calls \"a consultative Leninist system \u2026 They want to know what people think so they can take away the causes of discontent and potential challenges to the party. That's not the same as the accountability we would talk about and expect in Europe or North America; it's more of a safety valve and has an element of [the Maoist injunction] 'from the masses, to the masses'.\"</p> <p>The Wuhan show, which aired this summer and is due to return next month, is limited both in the subjects it tackles and in the personnel taking part. While vice-mayors appeared this summer, the city's most senior leaders were absent. It touched on issues such as food safety, but steered well clear of sensitive topics such as birth control.</p> <p>Even so, the questioning was pointed at times. \"I'm still sweating,\" vice-mayor Hu Lishan told the Global Times after appearing on the show.</p> <p>Both Wuhan Television and government officials declined to respond to queries from the Guardian.</p> <p>Zhao Zhenyu, a scholar at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology who also participated, said: \"Because it's live, the officials can't prepare; you can tell they are nervous during the show. They have to fix the problem after appearing on the programme, as people are watching them, and they have pressure.</p> <p>\"There are many ways to supervise the government. This TV show is just one of them.\"</p> <p>In one programme, a disgruntled resident complained: \"You always ask us ordinary people to report it if the lake is getting filled [up with stuff], but actually even if we report it we're just wasting our time. You said you would ask people to take responsibility. You just cheat people.\"</p> <p>An official's promise to clear up the rubbish quickly met with short shrift from the presenter: \"Next month? You said 'as soon as possible',\" she reminded him.</p> <p>\"By the end of this month,\" he responded.</p> <p>\"There are only a few days left,\" she said.</p> <p>\"In a week,\" he added, with a nervous smile. In another show, not available online, the head of the industry and commerce administration was reportedly confronted with footage showing his workers asking businesses to give them cash-filled envelopes - then was handed an empty letter by a presenter.</p> <p>Mao Yushi, a leading economist who has pushed hard to improve governance, said improving communication with the public was a positive step, but warned: \"If it becomes propaganda, it will be meaningless.\"</p> <p>Critics see such projects as essentially tokenistic and argue they do little to tackle the problems at their roots. They say what is needed are measures to improve transparency, such as publishing officials' assets, and, ultimately, democratic reforms.</p> <p>\"These new programmes sanitise and normalise the 'trials by internet' of corrupt and incompetent government officials which has already been going on for some years in China,\" said Dr Anne-Marie Brady, an expert on propaganda at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch.</p> <p>Those had developed, she argued, because the justice system cannot be relied on to resolve such problems and the Chinese media is muzzled and shackled.</p> <p>\"These programmes represent an attempt to appease the popular desire to hold officials accountable and will also likely attract a wide audience - meeting both the Party line and the bottom line,\" she added.</p> <p>\u2022 What better way to prepare to ring in the new, than to clean out the old? And so the week began with the formal expulsion of Bo Xilai, the erstwhile rising star who fell from grace, accused of numerous crimes including corruption and bending the law to hush up the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood by his wife, Gu Kailai.</p> <p>Once his wife was convicted, Bo's fate was never seriously in doubt. The only surprise, perhaps, was that it took a four-day closed-door meeting to ratify it.</p> <p>\u2022 Few things encapsulate the authorities' approach to the 18th congress \u2013 the simultaneous desire for fanfare and secrecy \u2013 better than state news agency Xinhua's report on plans to update the party's constitution. It announced that the central committee had approved an amendment, which can only be made at the congress, and that the heir apparent, Xi Jinping, had elaborated on it.</p> <p>It said that the amendment had been decided at a Politburo meeting last month \u2013 and that it would reflect the party's latest theoretical achievements in localising Marxism and practical experience. Is that clear?</p>",
  "<p>The last three down clues in the new (November) Genius puzzle by Crucible (No 113) were initially uploaded wrongly (despite which several of you somehow managed to solve it correctly before breakfast on the first day). My apologies. Those of you who downloaded it on Monday morning will wish to check what you have against the correct version, which is now on the website.<br>_____</p> <p>My recommendation last month of David Crystal's new book on the origins of English spelling (Spell It Out, Profile Books, \u00a312.99 hardback) provoked a lively correspondence, correcting some of my assumptions on the subject. Someone once told me that most of the differences between American English and English English mainly reflected the fact that the Pilgrim Fathers and the other early English settlers took with them English as it was spoken and written in the 17th century and that its forms were preserved on that side of the Atlantic to an extent that was not the case with us. 'Gotten' as the past participle of 'get', which survives in English English only in a word like 'ill-gotten' was cited as evidence.</p> <p>It is clear, though, that American spelling is to a large extent the result of the deliberate attempt by modernist reformers to simplify and make more logical the hybrid jumble that is English English spelling, an exercise that was never systematically attempted here. And the giant amongst these self-appointed reformers was Noah Webster, the New England lexicographer who followed in the footsteps of Samuel Johnson, producing the first American dictionary on 1806 and his magisterial An American Dictionary of the English Language in 1828. What was to become the revered Oxford English Dictionary did not get even its first volume of entries for the letter A published until 1888.</p> <p>It was largely Webster who persuaded Americans that it was right to take the 'u' out of 'colour' and one 'l' out of 'traveller', though he failed with his more ambitious efforts to substitute 'tung' for 'tongue' or 'wimmen' for 'women'.</p> <p>I had also assumed that the relationship between English English and American English was pretty much a one-way flow in our direction. In volume terms Americanisms in modern English are clearly much greater than the reverse but there is an interesting article in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19670686\">online BBC News Magazine by Cordelia Hebblethwaite</a>, which shows how the traffic today is by no means all in one direction.<br>_____</p> <p>I was asked a crossword question last month to which I should know the answer but don't.

Last week, a pigeon skeleton <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/nov/02/carrier-pigeon-coded-message-video\" title=\"\">was found down a chimney</a> in Surrey. The bird had been carrying a coded message during the second world war, and code-breakers are currently at work trying to decipher the missive; one thought is that the pigeon had been released to report the D-Day landing. Until the code is cracked, we're left wondering if the undelivered message could have changed the course of history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398855966\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352117323091/pigeon.jpg\" alt=\"pigeon \" width=\"200\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the author's pigeons Photograph: Alexandra Lockett </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_%28pigeon%29\" title=\"\">Pigeon Paddy</a> was the first pigeon to arrive back to England with news of of the D-Day invasion success. Paddy is one of 32 pigeons that received the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickin_Medal\" title=\"\">Dickin Medal</a> \u2013 the equivalent of the Victoria Cross \u2013 for bravery. Indeed, more medals have been awarded to pigeons than to any other animal. Countless pigeons successfully delivered messages and saved thousands of lives during war times. It is therefore sad that today, their contribution to both world wars has been forgotten, and that pigeons these days are often regarded as vermin.</p> <p>In wartime, messenger pigeons faced many dangers: they were away from their home loft for long periods, shot at by enemy marksmen, had to fly enormous distances, and were a source of food for starving soldiers who couldn't resist a meal (at least in England, authorities helped them by shooting falcons \u2013 so pigeons could get through with their messages without threat of predator attack). It looks like the Surrey pigeon got through the worst of it but was overcome by exhaustion. Many pigeon-fanciers who gave their beloved birds to serve the country never saw them again.</p> <p>Eccentric ideas for the use of pigeons during war include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Pigeon\" title=\"\">Project Pigeon</a>, which was an attempt to make pigeon-guided missiles. Pigeons were put inside a missile, where they pecked at a screen showing images of the targets they had been trained to recognise, and thereby steered the missile towards the target. Pigeons have also been used as spies. Cameras were attached to them and the pigeons flew across areas of interest, collecting footage.</p> <p>In China pigeons are still used by the army, which has 10,000 pigeons ready to be used if modern communications collapse. Indeed, the use of pigeon-aided communication in today's world should not be underestimated: I've used pigeons to deliver videos and data on USB sticks \u2013 download time three hours, pigeon delivery time 32 minutes \u2013 better bandwidth!</p> <p>But pigeons are not only useful in times of war. Their ability to carry news, financial information and post has been exploited to our benefit for a very long time. In the Bible, it is a white pigeon (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae\" title=\"\">or dove</a>) which brought Noah the news that the flood was over. The Greeks used them to carry information about the Olympic Games: every athlete taking part would take a pigeon from their own village, which would be released carrying the results of their event back to their home.</p> <p>In the early 1800s the Rothschild family set up a network of pigeon lofts around Europe. The speed with which pigeons could carry information enabled the family to make informed financial decisions before anyone else; they are said to have profited by learning of Wellington's victory at Waterloo before the British government.</p> <p>And it doesn't stop there: the news agency Reuters has used pigeons to transport news from remote places \u2013 <a href=\"http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/the-foreign-correspondent-and-the-carrier-pigeon/\" title=\"\">most recently in 1980</a>, when Alan Cowell was reporting on Zimbabwe's independence. Cowell was in a remote encampment in Matabeleland where there was no radio, phone, fax or other way of sending stories to the news agency ... but there were pigeons. He took a basket of pigeons from a fancier in Bulawayo which he released from Matabeleland to fly back to the loft with news for Reuters.</p> <p>Those who grumble about pigeons proliferating in our city centres should realise that we owe them more than we ever thought. I hope the discovery of the Surrey messenger pigeon will remind us all of the importance of these amazing creatures.</p>",
  "<p>Cases of a deadly tree disease that causes ash trees to die back have been found in Kent and Essex, the government said on Monday.</p> <p>The infected trees are the first found in the wild outside of Norfolk and Suffolk, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">first cases outside of nurseries and recent plantings were confirmed two weeks ago</a>.</p> <p>Tree experts have warned that the fungus, <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, threatens 95% of the UK's estimated 80 million ash trees. David Cameron's spokesman today said the government was \"taking this issue very seriously\", and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is convening a summit on Wednesday on proposals to tackle the disease.</p> <p>The confirmation of infections in Kent and Essex follows a weekend where volunteers looked for cases of the disease, which causes the crown of the tree to die back and leaves to turn brown. There are now a total of 82 confirmed sites, up from 52 as recently as this weekend.</p> <p>However, Defra stressed that it did not believe the new cases had necessarily spread from East Anglia, but may have been present in the environment already, with the spores born on the wind from the continent, where the disease is widespread.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"We're doing everything we can to identify where the disease is so that we can focus our efforts on those areas. Once we had the scientific advice that the disease in mature trees had probably arrived here by wind from Europe, it was always likely that we'd find it in coastal areas. Sadly that's the case with the confirmation today of the disease in Kent and Essex. I would expect even more cases to be confirmed as our urgent survey of ash trees continues.\"</p> <p>A crowdsourced effort to map the spread of the disease in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/ashtag-app-tree-disease-dieback\" title=\"\">AshTag</a>, is expected to release details later today of public sightings verified by a tree expert.</p> <p>But a shortage of botanists is adding to the problem of dealing with ash dieback. Diane Hird of the University of Bristol, who led a report into plant pathology education and training in the UK, said there had been a \"serious decline\" in the teaching of and research into plant diseases in the UK, going back for two decades.</p> <p>British universities have appointed very few new plant pathologists since 1990, and many of the number still at UK universities were appointed more than three decades ago. Only one in seven universities now provide practical courses for trainee botanists in looking at plant disease.</p> <p>Plant disease is a wider problem than the ash dieback disease, serious though that is. Farmers are battling with new and variant diseases, and globalisation has meant a huge increase in the risk of new plant diseases, affecting everything from crops to people's herbaceous borders. As some herbicides have lost their edge, the number of diseases spread by weeds has also increased. The UK's forests are under \"unprecedented threat\" from foreign pests and diseases, the Forestry Commission <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease\" title=\"\">said last week</a>.</p> <p>Prof James Brown, president of the British Society of Plant Pathology, said the job losses in plant science were \"severe\". He said: \"Britain is not producing graduates with the expertise needed to identify and control plant diseases in our farms and woodlands.\"</p> <p>A plant nursery forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/05/ash-dieback-government-legal-action\" title=\"\">said today it was suing the government</a> for failing to block imports of the tree sooner. A ban on imports of live ash trees was imposed on 29 October.</p> <p>Paterson is holding twice daily meetings on the threat of ash dieback disease, and is focused on the future rather than criticising any previous government failure, the prime minister's spokesman added.</p> <p>He refused to be drawn into responding threats of claims for compensation over past failure of government policy, saying: \"If people are going to demand compensation that is something that will be decided in the courts.\" But he pointed out that other countries across Europe have struggled to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>",
  "<p>The Department of Health's study into <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_092042\" title=\"\">gender and access to health services</a> (2008) shows that men tend to leave their wellbeing to chance, with shattering consequences.</p> <p>Where pharmacy is concerned, research shows that men visit a pharmacy less \u2013 four times a year compared to 18 times for a woman \u2013 and they are less likely to access disease screening or to seek professional support for healthy living such as NHS stop smoking schemes.</p> <p>To coincide with the start of <a href=\"http://www.npa.co.uk/askyourpharmacist\" title=\"\">Ask Your Pharmacist Week</a>, which focuses on tackling men's poor health, (5 \u201312th November) the <a href=\"http://www.npa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Pharmacy Association</a> surveyed 1,700 UK adults to look into medicines behaviours. The survey showed that nine in 10 men say they don't like to trouble a doctor or a pharmacist unless they have a serious problem.</p> <p>They delay seeking advice if they have side effects from medicines, and they often get their wives to collect their prescriptions for them. This means they're less likely to have a face-to-face discussion with pharmacy staff and to benefit from lifestyle advice.</p> <p>The research is worrying considering that by almost all measures of physical health, men have poorer outcomes than women. The most obvious indicator for this is that men do not live as long. The mortality rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) is much higher in men, and men are more likely to die from CHD prematurely.</p> <p>Morbidity and mortality are consistently higher in men for virtually all cancers that are not sex-specific. Alcohol disorders are twice as common in men. In England, 38% of men and 16% of women are thought to have an alcohol use disorder.</p> <p>The million dollar question is, how can we get men to be more engaged in their health and wellbeing?</p> <p>There are various examples of community pharmacies in the UK where men have been specifically targeted.

Feedback from those who participated showed that 96% of men made lifestyle changes as a result.</p> <p>In Telford, the <a href=\"http://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Men's Health Forum</a> project had three primary objectives: increase men's awareness of Chlamydia, promote the adoption of safer sexual practices, encourage men to seek screening and treatment where appropriate. The project was conducted in factories, colleges and a young person drop in centre.

  "<p>Monsanto and other agribusiness and food companies <a href=\"http://votersedge.org/california/ballot-measures/2012/november/prop-37/funding\" title=\"\">have spent more than $45m (\u00a328m) to defeat a California ballot measure</a> that would require labelling of some GM foods.</p> <p>The measure, <a href=\"http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/37/\" title=\"\">proposition 37</a>, is one of the most contentious initiatives on California's election ballot on Tuesday.</p> <p>If it passes, it would require labels on GM food sold in supermarkets, but would not cover restaurants. It also has a number of gaping loopholes.

Opponents \u2013 overwhelmingly corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont, Pepsico and Nestle \u2013 say the labels would be burdensome to retailers, and would force prices to rise.</p> <p>Others support the idea of labels in general but argue that this particular initiative is poorly written.</p> <p>A label requirement could have a sweeping effect on the American foods industry.

  "<p>New to Hotline Miami? Reader, meet a five-star neon-soaked death machine of a video game. Released on PC a fortnight ago, Hotline Miami's a little bit of stealth and strategy mixed with a whole lot of doors and shooting. An exhilarating and cartoonishly gory arcade game at heart, it's also a stylish and atmospheric take on 1980s Miami. </p> <p>Dennis Wedin and Jonatan S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m are the creative brains behind Hotline Miami, and work together as <a href=\"http://www.dennaton.com\" title=\"\">Dennaton</a>. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m has a higher profile, an indie development darling better known as <a href=\"http://cactusquid.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/quick-update.html\" title=\"\">Cactus</a>. But the two shared overall design duties on Hotline Miami, before they got down to coding (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m) and working on the visuals (Wedin). \"We realised we worked together really well,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, \"So we decided to start something bigger.\"</p> <p>Hotline Miami is Dennaton's debut, but not the first game it worked on. \"After we did [previous collaboration] <a href=\"http://cactusquid.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/keyboard-drumset-fucking-werewolf.html\" title=\"\">Keyboard Drumset Fucking Werewolf </a>we started on a really big, how do you say, role-playing zombie game,\" says Wedin. \"But it got too big for us. We were looking through some of Jonatan's old prototypes and he showed me one of a guy in a top-down action game, really bloody. I love top-down games and I thought we should do something with it because it was so funny.\"</p> <p>Hotline Miami is funny indeed, with every single kill splattering enemies in OTT ways and a different animation for every melee weapon's \"finisher\". The fact that it's a violent video game, of course, tends to overshadow everything else. Is that annoying? \"No, not really,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. \"We made it violent. There's more to it than that, but people can choose to ignore the story or think what they want and that's fine with us.\"</p> <p>The story is hard to follow, to be fair, a riddling narrative that switches between freaky and confusing. At points your character is clearly hallucinating \u2013 during other sequences, he may well be. Piecing it together is a puzzle. \"Mostly it's because I don't like a lot of storytelling that explains everything,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. \"Making sure that everyone understands. That takes away a mysteriousness from the plot, and that's something I appreciate almost more than plot itself. So with Hotline Miami, it's up to the player to decide how they want to see the story.\"</p> <p>Hotline Miami has more obvious attractions, anyway. Its pixels reek of 1980s pastel suits, a meaner Miami Vice brought to pulsing life. The nightclub level has to be played to be believed. It makes you sad that the default description for a style like this is retro. \"Yeah I don't like that label at all,\" says Wedin. \"When people say we use pixel art to make people nostalgic, for me that's \u2026 Just because we have 3D graphics, pixel art shouldn't be seen as outdated. For me, I love pixel art more and it suits my aesthetic to use it. It's nothing to do with retro or anything like that.\"</p> <p>Hotline Miami's done well enough to earn at least one future portion of downloadable content (\"We want to do more story stuff and delve more into the side characters and things like that,\" says Wedin), and despite its low price has been widely torrented. So far, so usual. But S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m's attitude towards the torrenters is not \u2013 he <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-26-hotline-miami-creator-helps-pirates-play-his-game\" title=\"\">popped up on the Pirate Bay to answer some questions</a>, and asked that the torrent be kept updated with the game's latest version. I ask what Wedin makes of his partner's stance.</p> <p>\"I loved it!\" laughs Wedin. \"I agree a lot with him. He didn't even tell me about it, I saw it when I was Googling 'Hotline Miami' and I laughed my ass off. It was good. I'm totally with him on that one.\" Have you any idea how many people have pirated it? \"No,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. \"I took a brief look at how many were seeding and leeching on the torrent, but I didn't see download stats. Some have said they've bought it after pirating it, but that's a much smaller number than you'd like.\"</p> <p>So what does the future hold for Dennaton? \"We're actually looking at old prototypes again, we're thinking about Shotgun Ninja 2,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. The original's a devilish platformer made in 48 hours, available free <a href=\"http://cactusquid.com/games.htm\" title=\"\">here</a>, and feels as if it might suit an upgrade very nicely. \"Jonatan's prototype I really liked as well,\" says Wedin. \"So we've started doing some sprites and stuff and hopefully we'll move on to it full time next year.\"</p> <p>Which makes you wonder \u2013 does Hotline Miami mark a permanent shift towards bigger projects for Cactus? \"Not permanent,\" says S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m. \"But I want to work on larger projects more. Before the next big game I'll release some smaller stuff as well, so hopefully both.\"</p> <p>It's no secret that, despite S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m's profile and many years of productivity, he's never really found a way to make game development pay. I ask how Hotline Miami's done. \"It sold pretty good,\" he says. \"The important thing,\" Wedin adds, \"is that we got enough to make another game.\" Is that two thumbs up or one? S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m laughs. \"Somewhere in between.\"</p>",
  "<p>New jobs and financial investment in the energy sector are at risk if the government does not ensure its imminent energy bill supports low-carbon power, an unusual coalition of the trade bodies representing the renewable energy, nuclear power and carbon capture industries has warned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2012/nov/05/letter-renewableuk-ccs-nuclear-carbon\" title=\"\">letter</a> to the energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, strongly backs the call from the government's climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), to include a reference in the bill for the power sector to be almost entirely decarbonised by 2030.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/03/uk-dash-gas\" title=\"\">the Observer revealed</a> that the amount of power expected to be generated from gas by 2030 has quadrupled in the last year, raising fears that carbon targets will be missed and low-carbon generation crowded out. The final version of the energy bill, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/22/government-announces-energy-reforms\" title=\"\">due to bring in the biggest reforms to the energy market in two decades</a>, is expected towards the end of November. The draft version <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">was published in May</a>.</p> <p>The letter signed by the heads of RenewableUK, the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and the Nuclear Industry Association says that a decarbonisation reference would lower \"the perceived political risks, but could also reduce the cost of capital for decarbonising the power sector. We therefore believe that this could be very important for investment going forward.\"</p> <p>The CCC has recommended electricity in 2030 be produced at no more than 50g of CO<sub>2</sub>/kW by 2030; gas power stations emit around 350g of CO<sub>2</sub>/kW. The current energy bill draft has no such target.</p> <p>The trade body chiefs, who represent more than 1,000 companies between them, say that any significant delay in the bill \"could result in investment being postponed, with major implications for associated new industrial development and jobs in a high-tech, high growth sector.\"</p> <p>John Sauven, the executive director at Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, took the surprising step of welcoming the letter, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nuclear-wind-and-wave-power-chiefs-in-joint-appeal-on-green-energy-8281122.html\" title=\"\">saying</a>: \"This letter shows that whilst different industries will have differing preferences for the exact mix of energy technologies, there is unity from across huge swathes of the business community on the need for a clear goal in the energy bill to take carbon almost completely out of the electricity system by 2030.\"</p>",
  "<p>The author of this week's poem, <a href=\"http://www.poetrykit.org/iv00/gallagher.htm\">Katherine Gallagher</a>, was born in 1935 in Maldon, a gold-mining town in central Victoria, Australia, and grew up on a farm in nearby Eastville. She lived in Paris for a number of years before settling in the UK in 1979. The journey in \"The Year of the Tree\" is, by contrast, a modest one, confined to the London Underground. But it seems to have larger journeys, like tree rings, wrapped and compressed inside it.</p> <p>The narrative, laid out in spare, short-lined couplets, begins with an arresting hook. As in some of those <a href=\"http://bryantmcgill.com/wiki/poetry/vasko_popa/hide-and-seek\">parables written by eastern European poets in the past century</a> there's a faintly surreal scenario (\"I carried a tree/ through the underground\") presented in a simple, deadpan style. But while plain, the diction is pointed. \"It was hard\" immediately describes the effort of carrying the tree, but extends to the tree's texture and rigidity. The picture we first imagine \u2013 of a whole tree being carried \u2013 is intended: at least, this tree doesn't turn out to be a sapling tucked away in a plastic bag. It's \"heavier than a suitcase\" and possibly human-size, as seems borne out by the use of the pronoun \"we\" at the beginning of stanza five.</p> <p>Typical commuter behaviour is observed as part of the background story. People \"scarcely noticed\" the unusual duo at first \u2013 or perhaps, being seasoned Tube-travellers, they quietly pretended to scarcely notice. Then a few bold spirits venture the reader's own question: \"Why a tree?\"</p> <p>The little vision of tree carrying as a daily \"rite\" may be a tease, but it adds a dimension and further direction to the poem. The answer to \"Why a tree?\" is deliberately humorous. That prim, Latinate abstract noun \"edification\" has grabbed a whole line, mocking its own self-importance. Yet the word is far from hollow: it expands on the existing potential of the tree for building, with a notion of self-building. The following stanza is less tongue-in-cheek: \"A tree always/ has something to teach.\" This may nod towards Gallagher's Irish heritage, and the Celtic tradition of the oak as a source of wisdom. Also, despite its un-fussed and coolly playful tone, by evoking the difficulty of \"lugging\" the tree along, the poem is inevitably a reminder of the Christian significance of tree-carrying.</p> <p>New sounds occur in the next stanza: the \"sharp gusts\" which \"whirred\" (an unusual verb choice) along the Underground's corridors, making the branches rustle. The rustling here is a good detail, and a little ambiguous because, while the tree is destined for replanting (and living foliage, of course, can rustle) the verb is usually associated with autumn and dead, dried-out leaves. The observation that the sweepers are picking up \"scraps of paper\" \u2013 one of the end-products of the timber industry \u2013 enhances this idea. The sweepers, nicely in character, are polite but anxious that the tree shouldn't be left behind \u2013 the image of the tree as unwanted litter is not far away.</p> <p>There doesn't seem to have been a Year of the Tree in the UK, though the UN declared 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2011/jun/03/united-nations-forests-david-attenborough\">International Year of Forests</a>. Gallagher's poem was written considerably earlier. However, her title alerts us to the irony in such well-meaning designations. A mere year of tree awareness would hardly save the planet's forests. It's a mark of the poet's tact and gentle humour that an environmental message is present: potent but not preached. Her oak tree retains an older, mythical resonance.</p> <p>We never see the speaker emerging into daylight so as to fulfil her intention of starting a forest in her garden. We don't even see her boarding a train. At the end of the poem, speaker and tree are still in transit, and the curiosity shown by the other travellers has edged towards paranoia, judging by the comment \"Relax\u2026/ it's a tree, not a gun\".</p> <p>The poem's story has characteristics of a quest, as corridors and escalators are endlessly traversed and questions posed and answered. The shadowy setting hints at a deeper underground, perhaps: the underworld.</p> <p>Descents into the underworld recall <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus\">the Orpheus myth</a>, among others. Oaks were the trees that tore up their roots so as to follow the singer-poet's music to the seashore, and Euridice herself was an oak-tree nymph. Orpheus's music is a kind of peaceable weapon, calming and taming (\"\u2026 a tree, not a gun\"). Though one of the charms of \"The Year of the Tree\" is its light touch, its mythical elements form a strong underpinning. The oak tree seems a fitting symbol of both the natural and inner worlds we neglect at our own risk, of the past lives and journeys we carry with us as we travel, and the importance of holding on to these riches, though they may single us out for scrutiny or be otherwise heavy and \"difficult to balance\".</p> <p>\u2022 \"The Year of the Tree\" appears in Gallagher's fifth full-length collection <a href=\"http://www.arcpublications.co.uk/book.php?description_id=403\">Carnival Edge: New and Selected Poems</a>, published by Arc, who will bring out a new volume of her work in 2014.</p> <h2>The Year of the Tree</h2> <p>I carried a tree<br>through the Underground. </p> <p>It was hard. At first,<br>people scarcely noticed me</p> <p>and the oak I was lugging<br>along the platforms \u2013</p> <p>heavier than a suitcase<br>and difficult to balance.</p> <p>We threaded through corridors,<br>changing lines: up and down stairs,</p> <p>escalators, and for a moment<br>I imagined everyone on the planet</p> <p>taking turns<br>to carry a tree as daily rite.</p> <p>A few people asked<br>Why a tree?</p> <p>I said it was for my own<br>edification \u2013</p> <p>a tree always<br>has something to teach.</p> <p> \u2022 </p> <p>Sharp gusts<br>whirred through the corridors</p> <p>rustling the branches<br>as I hurried on</p> <p>past the sweepers<br>picking up rubbish, scraps of paper.</p> <p><em>Be sure to take the tree<br>with you</em>, they said.</p> <p><em>Don't worry, I'm taking it<br>to my garden,</em></p> <p><em>the start of a forest.</em><br>When people stared,</p> <p><em>Relax</em>, I said,<br><em>it's a tree, not a gun.</em></p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Savile's estate, the BBC and five other institutions including Stoke Mandeville hospital have been issued with formal notice that they face legal action from 43 victims seeking damages for alleged sexual abuse.</p> <p>Separately, the BBC confirmed on Monday that the number of current staff facing internal allegations of sexual misconduct has risen to 20.</p> <p>One of those making a civil damages claim is a woman who was just eight years old \u2013 believed to be the youngest known victim so far \u2013 when she claimed she was molested by Savile while recovering from surgery at Stoke Mandeville hospital.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a solicitor at law firm Russell Jones Walking which is acting for 36 claimants including the woman, said \"letters before action\" have been issued to the executors of the Savile estate, the BBC, Stoke Mandeville, Leeds general infirmary, Broadmoor and unnamed another care institution.</p> <p>Alan Collins, of law firm Pannone, said he had now sent seven letters before action on behalf of Savile victims. Six of these claims are against the Savile estate, and one is against the BBC.</p> <p>Collins, a solicitor who acted on behalf of Jersey child abuse victims in the Haut de la Garenne scandal, said he would visit at least another 20 victims in November with a view to lodging further personal injury claims.</p> <p>\"The youngest victim we have was eight when it happened, the oldest 23.

  "<p>Whatever our worries about coalition policies, let's be grateful to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> for one thing \u2013 his General Motors approach to education (\"what was good for me is good for everyone\") has mobilised a national debate about the purpose of learning. The previous government, despite the rainbows and manic policymaking, never really got this conversation going.</p> <p>Central to this debate has been some new-old thinking about assessment. The way in which pupils are assessed and subsequent data-driven judgements made on schools are the most important control mechanisms of all. Regardless of rhetoric about freedom, it's assessment that underpins or undermines the liberties that schools might enjoy.</p> <p>This is not an attack on assessment. At its best, assessment is a wonderful part of the creative process we call learning. It enables reflection and critical analysis, offers an external eye and helps students understand where they are and how to progress. Despite teachers' best intentions, various political and managerial forces have turned assessment into a reductive shell of what it could be.</p> <p>Of all this government's proposed changes to assessment, the most controversial by far is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/nov/02/arts-leaders-concerns-ebacc-schools\" title=\"\">the introduction of an English Baccalaureate</a> as a 'gold standard' for students. Although Gove claims that the Ebacc should not limit choice, he is too canny not to realise the consequences of the publication of this data. Some GCSEs are now more equal than others.</p> <p>Even more depressing than the Ebacc has been the reaction of many schools to it, rapidly changing options regardless of students' interests; and the responses from various interest groups, campaigning that their subject be included, rather than challenging the legitimacy of what is a flawed concept. The religious education and music lobbies have been especially vocal.</p> <p>The Ebacc has a reasonable rationale, misapplied. Some academically able students are given poor advice about course options, hugely reducing their chances of a place at a Russell Group university. They are not the only ones. <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/standard/publicationDetail/Page1/DFE-00031-2011\" title=\"\">The Wolf Report</a> argues that many young people choosing vocational routes are being guided towards qualifications that nobody values. The Ebacc is a partial solution to a much bigger problem.</p> <p>My alternative proposal is for a baccalaureate that supports all students, not only the most academically able, and also brings others into the assessment process: a MeBacc. The idea deliberately goes with the grain of current assessment processes. More radical alternatives rarely gain sufficient currency across a critical mass of schools.</p> <p>To gain a MeBacc, a student would need to gain 5 A* to C or equivalent (with proper rigour over what is really 'equivalent') at GCSE, including English and maths. In addition, each student would need to create one or more artifacts (an essay, film or other product) that justifies learning choices. Why did I take these particular courses? What am I planning to do next with them? What are the skills and interests that I am developing outside of school, formally or informally?</p> <p>Each young person would need to show some clear ambitions for the future, not only career related, and demonstrate creativity, reflectiveness, metacognition \u2013 all of the skills we know are crucial for success in 21st-century societies, workplaces and relationships.</p> <p>This work would then be assessed through a presentation process that involves peers, parents, teachers and an external assessor: someone from within or beyond the local community who, if possible, has some expertise in that young person's possible career path, and might have time to mentor them. </p> <p>In many ways, this meeting would resemble a PhD viva. A 16 year-old would need to defend his/her 'thesis' about their future and how to get there. Yes, it would consume time, and would require a voluntary commitment from thousands of parents and other adults. But the process would also create energy from existing expertise.</p> <p>This is a partly stolen idea. Kingstone School of Creativity in Barnsley (now <a href=\"http://www.horizoncc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Horizon Community College</a>) ran a successful 'assessment for living' programme for five years \u2013 culminating in an alternative parents' evening where each young person presents to peers, parents and others on their progress and future plans. Headteacher Matthew Milburn aimed to \"create a curriculum and assessment process that genuinely nurtures human development and enables young people to come to terms with who they are and how they relate to others\".</p> <p>A MeBacc could formalise this process, giving it a national status that employers, colleges and universities would value. Kingstone interviewed parents on film: their eyes and body language showed they knew and loved their children like no others can. A MeBacc could harness that love and the love of others \u2013 whether love for the student, the subject matter or the future \u2013 and thaw out an assessment process that is often unnecessarily frozen and harsh. As Rinaldi has argued, a meaningful assessment process is itself an \"act of love\".</p> <p><em>This essay originally appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://ccskills.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Creative &amp; Cultural Skills </em></a><em>publication </em><a href=\"http://creative-blueprint.co.uk/thinkpieces/item/from-an-ebacc-to-a-mebacc\" title=\"\"><em>Creativity Money Love: Learning for the 21st Century</em></a><em>, which you can download </em><a href=\"http://creative-blueprint.co.uk/thinkpieces/creativity-money-love\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a></p> <p><em>Joe Hallgarten is </em><a href=\"http://www.rsablogs.org.uk/category/education/\" title=\"\"><em>director of education at the RSA</em></a><em>, policy analyst and programme leader \u2013 follow him on Twitter</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joehallg\" title=\"\"><em> @joehallg</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The Financial Times has thrown its weight behind a second term in the White House for Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f11742fa-2501-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2BHaUclbb\" title=\"\">endorsing the incumbent</a> as \"the better choice\" for a country still struggling to recover from the economic crisis.</p> <p>While bemoaning a lacklustre campaign in which both candidates displayed \"a poverty of ambition\", the British newspaper on Monday cited the president's handling of the recent east coast storm as an illustration of why he, rather than Mitt Romney, deserved Americans' votes.</p> <p>\"As in his response to hurricane Sandy, Mr Obama has shown that purposeful government can be part of the solution rather than the problem,\" it remarked. \"Four years on from the financial crisis, with extreme inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance. Mr Obama, his presidency defined by the economic crisis, looks the better choice.\"</p> <p>But the endorsement, which comes soon after similar backing from the London-based current affairs magazine the Economist, was far from ringing. While documenting some of the high points of Obama's first term \u2013 including healthcare reform, for instance, and a $787bn (\u00a3490bn) stimulus package \"that saved the country from another Great Depression\" \u2013 the FT also detailed several weaknesses, such as his \"notably cool\" stance on business. \"The self-proclaimed agent of change,\" it said, \"has at crucial points failed to exercise leadership.\"</p> <p>But the FT shows little ambivalence towards Obama's opponent. While commenting that Romney appears \"a man comfortable with exercising executive power\", it noted a \"needlessly belligerent\" foreign policy and, more importantly, it said, an economic strategy that raised as many questions as it answered.</p> <p>\"[Romney] \u2026 has gone through so many contortions to win his party's nomination that it is hard to see how he would govern in practice. His wishlist includes an aspiration to raise Pentagon spending by a fifth while cutting everyone's taxes and still somehow balancing the books. Such fiscal alchemy is an exercise in evasion, not a recipe for sustainable economic recovery.\"</p> <h2>What the papers say</h2> <p><strong>The Economist (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21565623-america-could-do-better-barack-obama-sadly-mitt-romney-does-not-fit-bill-which-one\" title=\"\">\"A man who once personified hope and centrism</a> set a new low by unleashing attacks on Mitt Romney even before the first Republican primary. Yet elections are about choosing somebody to run a country. And this choice turns on two questions: how good a president has Mr Obama been, especially on the main issues of the economy and foreign policy? And can America really trust the ever-changing Mitt Romney to do a better job? On that basis, the Democrat narrowly deserves to be re-elected \u2026 For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p><strong>The New York Times (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/barack-obama-for-president.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=opinion\" title=\"\">\"President Obama has shown a firm commitment</a> to using government to help foster growth.

Mr Obama has impressive achievements despite the implacable wall of refusal erected by congressional Republicans so intent on stopping him that they risked pushing the nation into depression, held its credit rating hostage, and hobbled economic recovery. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr Romney's true identity, but they know the Republican party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda. Mr Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate says volumes about that.\"</p> <p><strong>The Los Angeles Times (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-end-president-20121021,0,5490210.story\" title=\"\">\"The most troubling aspect of Romney's candidacy</a> is that we still don't know what his principles are.

His modulating positions on his own tax plan, healthcare reform, financial regulation, Medicare, immigration and the national safety net add to the impression that the only thing he really stands for is his own election. Voters face a momentous choice in November between two candidates offering sharply different prescriptions for what ails the country. Obama's recalls the successful formula of the 1990s, when the government raised taxes and slowed spending to close the deficit. The alternative offered by Romney would neglect the country's infrastructure and human resources for the sake of yet another tax cut and a larger defence budget than even the Pentagon is seeking.

When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate \u2026 Barack Obama rocketed to the presidency from relative obscurity with a theme of hope and change. A different reality has marked his presidency. His record on the economy in the past four years does not suggest he would lead in the direction the nation must go in the next four years.

Linguist <a href=\"http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/\">Suzanne Kemmer</a> <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qzhJ3KpLpQUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22schemas+and+lexical+blends%22&amp;ots=sT_YNq7aWJ&amp;sig=RzqbdfybiHrRxwcRbjk-r--MllQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">notes</a> that mentions of LITERATI exceeded those of GLITTERATI in the Times in 1990, with the situation reversed by 1996 and the gap widening. That may reflect a greater interest among journalists in showbiz than in writers, even when the latter engage in publicity-friendly feuds and become members of what some call the BELLIGERATI.</p> <p>As Kemmer says, the many other -ATI words that have sprung up - she spots BRITERATI, FLITTERATI and DIGERATI among others - may now be influenced as much by GLITTERATI as by the original term. And in all of them, there's a note of disparagement, illustrated by the Simpsons exchange where Carl yells \"Let's make litter out of these literati!\" and Lenny replies \"That's too clever - you're one of them,\" before felling his friend.</p> <p>Some coinages are downright clumsy, particularly those that aren't made out of a word with an \"it\" sound: SOCCERATI, LUNCHERATI and DESIGNERATI have an especially clunky feel. Others are offensive for their meaning rather than their sound. In 2004, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3872675.stm\">David Blunkett told the Today programme</a> of his impatience with the LIBERATI and their pesky obsession with freedom of speech. And you don't often hear today the term used in the 1930s for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\">Harlem intellectuals</a>, the NIGGERATI, an awkward word apparently coined by Wallace Thurman, a black author critical of black culture. </p> <p>Of the newer -ATI words, my least favourite, APPARATI, describes fervent users of smartphones, but there's one which is based around an \"it\" and which maintains the hint of disdain and accusations of cliquery common to most coinages. Reader, how would you clue TWITTERATI?</p> <h2>Misdirection of the week</h2> <p>Time and again I'm tripped up and slowed down by a setter making me think a plural is a singular, or vice versa.

  "<p>Lest it gets overlooked, the letters page in today's Guardian carries this riposte, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/04/guardian-surrender-on-self-regulation\">Guardian 'surrender' on self-regulation</a>, to an editorial published on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/leveson-inquiry-prejudging-the-judge\">Leveson inquiry: prejudging the judge</a>.</p> <p>Here is the letter, which was signed by 20 academics\u2026 </p> <blockquote> <p>We are disappointed that the Guardian now appears to accept the \"merit\" of the new system of press self-regulation being proposed by David Hunt of the Press Complaints Commission and Guy Black of the Telegraph. </p> <p>You admit yourselves that their plan \"vests too much power in an industry funding body which retains key powers over the regulator\", but you fail to take this to its logical conclusion: that it is little more than a reinvention of the same system of self-regulation which has failed the public and journalism for the last 60 years.</p> <p>We share your commitment to \"independent regulation, both from politicians and the press itself\". This cannot be achieved by a system controlled by the same press interests which have dominated the failed PCC. </p> <p>Moreover, as so far described, the Hunt-Black plan has no means of ensuring that all major press companies sign up (the so-called \"Desmond problem\"), nor any foolproof method of enforcing its rulings. Civil contracts can be challenged in the courts, and the worst offenders are no strangers to litigating their way out of trouble.</p> <p>Were it not for the Guardian's commitment to courageous and outstanding investigative journalism \u2013 in the teeth of bitter resistance by the PCC and its controlling press interests \u2013 we would never have discovered the true scale of abuse and corruption in parts of the press. </p> <p>This is surely the moment to push for a genuinely independent regulator, founded in law, which could command real public trust and reinvigorate public interest journalism.

  "<p>Football is usually all about the big guns: for Manchester United, Chelsea or Manchester City in the Premier League, read FIFA or Football Manager Handheld on the app stores.</p> <p>Yet the latter is sprouting some intriguing giant-killers too: independently-developed football games giving the established franchises something to think about. Two British examples from the last year: <a href=\"http://www.newstarsoccer.com/nssmobile.php\">New Star Soccer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.appynation.com/apps/fluid-football/\">Fluid Football</a>.</p> <p>The latter has just hit a notable milestone: \"We're up to half a million downloads on iOS and are on course to replicate that on Android before the end of the year,\" says Robin Clarke from Fluid Football's publisher <a href=\"http://www.appynation.com/\">AppyNation</a>.</p> <p>\"The half million is only on iOS, from 16 August until now. Android has only been out a bit over a week, but is already doing tens of thousands of downloads a day, and still climbing.\"</p> <p>The game involves drawing lines on a pitch viewed from above to send players on runs in and around the penalty box, before switching to a 3D view to shoot. It's presented as a series of challenges where the aim is to score: as much a puzzle game as a football simulation.</p> <p>Fluid Football was developed by independent studio <a href=\"http://www.chromativity.com/\">Chromativity</a>, whose chief executive Simon Prytherch says that the game currently has around 20k daily active users, with iOS accounting for 40% of them, and Android the other 60%.</p> <p>Prytherch and his colleagues had form in the area of football games, with this background helping attract football pundits Andy Gray and Richard Keys to work with Chromativity on the tactical elements to Fluid Football.</p> <p>\"People know me for my tactical awareness and knowledge of football, but I really wanted to work on a game that could combine the two,\" says Gray.</p> <p>\"Keysie and I met with Simon Prytherch through our business<br>partner Jason Cooper. Simon has made loads of great football games in his career, including LMA Manager and Club Football. Working closely with Simon and his team has been great fun, and it has allowed us to make the game we wanted.\"</p> <p>Fluid Football's popularity owes much to the tactical side, although its release at the start of the new football season gave it a running start too. Since then, though, word-of-mouth has been a big driver of its downloads.</p> <p>\"I genuinely believe the biggest reason for Fluid Football's success is the fact that it's the first football game designed from the ground up for touchscreen devices,\" says AppyNation's Andrew Smith.</p> <p>\"It meant that we fill a hole in the footy market \u2013 the tactical focus of the play \u2013&nbsp;but we feel it also proves how strongly the games-playing public will respond to games that suit the platform.\"</p> <p>Clarke says AppyNation \"haven't spent a penny\" on traditional advertising, with the investment going instead into PR, video trailers and presences at games exhibitions like Eurogamer.</p> <p>It's important to note that most of these downloads were not paid: Fluid Football is only available for free on Android, and in a choice of free and \"Pro\" paid versions on iOS. The money comes from in-app purchases of gameplay packs and virtual coins.</p> <p>\"The conversion rate is broadly in line with what you'd expect for a free-to-play game,\" says Clarke, who explains that AppyNation and Chromativity are working hard on honing their model: what's available for free versus what's sold in-app.</p> <p>On Android, distributing the game for free then charging for in-game content means Fluid Football sidesteps the complaints of some developers \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Sports+Interactive+news/news.asp?c=45919\">including Football Manager Handheld maker Sports Interactive</a> \u2013&nbsp;about high levels of piracy on Android.</p> <p>\"There's no point losing sleep over piracy: it'll always be there,\" says Clarke. \"Make a game that speaks to the players who ARE willing to pay is the only sane way to approach it. Also, being out on both iOS and Android has meant that the visibility of one has spurred on the other, which is nice.\"</p> <p>More platforms are on the way, with ambitious plans on Prytherch's part to look beyond iOS and Android.</p> <p>\"The ones planned already are Amazon, Kindle Fire, Nook, BlackBerry and Windows 8 tablets,\" he says. \"With our background, we are also looking at consoles, PC and Mac for a bigger, enhanced version of the game.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, a major update for iOS and Android will be released before Christmas, which Prytherch says will herald \"a huge change\" in the way people play Fluid Football, and boost that daily active users figure.</p> <p>\"It will give you compelling reasons to return every day and play with your friends,\" he says. \"Fluid Football will start to build a real community\u2026 This is just the start.\"</p> <p>He's also keen to partner with developers of other football games, and promote one another's titles.</p> <p>\"I think this will be seen as a benefit to our customers, as we will be recommending a game that they would be interested in playing,\" he says. \"With four or five quality titles with regular updates, we could keep a football fan happy all year round.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scientists may be reluctant to link <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a> with climate change, but extreme events could be the tipping point that wakes America up to the seriousness of global warming, according to Tom Steyer, probably the richest climate change champion in the US, and arguably the most effective.</p> <p>\"The connection between extreme weather events and climate change is like that between steroids and home runs: you can't tie any one home run to steroid usage, but the number and distance sure increase,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether Hurricane Sandy is enough to trigger change in public pressure and political action on climate change remains to be seen, but the hedge fund manager has previously compared America's inaction on climate change to those who buried their heads in the sand in 1938 when they knew something awful was happening in Europe.</p> <p>\"I believe that there will be some event that changes the way we think about this,\" he said at a Hamilton Group forum at Stanford University earlier this year.</p> <p>Steyer founded <a href=\"http://www.faralloncapital.com/\" title=\"\">Farallon Capital</a> in 1986, which now has $20 billion under management.

Unlike many hedge fund managers though, Steyer is extremely outspoken and has ploughed a great deal of his own fortune into social and environmental causes.</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer fronted $5m to fund the campaign to defeat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/03/prop-23-climate-california\" title=\"\">Prop 23</a>, an aggressive ballot measure put forward by California's oil refiners which would have left the state's climate change AB32 legislation in tatters.</p> <p>\"My support for Prop 23 was considered a stupid thing to do and a foolish waste of time and money. In struggles at the polls between oil companies and environmentalists, traditionally the thinking was that environmentalists were poor and stupider, and less ruthless.\"</p> <p>Many investors and business leaders would be reluctant to take a political stand over such a high-octane issue for fear it would hurt their company, but the campaign defeated the measure, also partly thanks to high-profile support from Robert Redford, Bill Gates and Leonardo Di Caprio.</p> <p>In this election, Steyer has spent $21.9m on a ballot initiative when California goes to the polls on 6 November. <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_39,_Income_Tax_Increase_for_Multistate_Businesses_%282012%29\" title=\"\">Prop 39</a> aims to close a corporate tax loophole worth $1bn a year, money that Steyer believes could be re-appropriated for alternative energy investments.</p> <p>\"I am committed to trying to get stuff done in the areas where I am passionate, one of them is energy,\" he said. \"I don't expect to stop working in energy and I want California to be well governed.\"</p> <p>Steyer added again to his pugnacious reputation by launching an all-out attack on Mitt Romney at the Democratic National Convention. Romney's energy plan, largely dependent on oil sands from Canada, is \"mindblowing\", he said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney and I share the same income bracket,\" he told delegates in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"[But] Romney and I don't share the same vision for the future, especially when it comes to energy.</p> <p>\"Romney would do nothing to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and much to increase it. He would gut President Obama's investments in clean energy. He wants to keep giving four billion taxpayer dollars to oil companies every year \u2013 the very same oil companies pouring millions into the outside groups backing his campaign.\"</p> <p>Often described as a bulwark against the corporate carbon heavyweights such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Koch brothers</a> in the US, Steyer has had to increase his political clout since the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations could give unlimited donations to campaign. Koch-affiliated groups are estimated to have spent $400m on Romney's campaign.</p> <p>\"I disagree with many of the things that the Koch brothers have done,\" he said. \"There's definitely concern in the US about the ability of corporations to effect the policy especially in light of the Supreme Court ruling. That was one which enables purely economic thinking to have a disproportionate impact.\"</p> <p>\"I have gotten myself convinced that this is an area that is important and where there is a vacuum in terms of pushing for what I think are important changes. I've been compelled to fill the vacuum ... I am really intent on making a difference in areas where I think we're off the rails,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite his involvement in politics so far, including fundraising for Barack Obama, Steyer said that he remains \"agnostic\" about taking office himself or the 'climate champion' mantle as former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had done.</p> <p>Large chunks of his wealth have also been spent on academic institutes, including the establishment of the <a href=\"http://www.tcng.org/\" title=\"\">Center for the Next Generation</a>, a non-profit dealing with children's issues and the environment run by his brother James. In 2009, he and his wife, Kat Taylor, helped establish the <a href=\"http://tomkat.stanford.edu/\" title=\"\">TomKat Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> at Stanford University.</p> <p>\"I was just trying to help them get the resources to apply their incredible capability to what I think is going to be the biggest problem in the world. The opposite of living in a sustainable world is living in an unsustainable world. That seems to me to be an overwhelming problem.\"</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer and his wife signed the <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\" title=\"\">Giving Pledge</a> started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage American billionaires to give half their fortune to charity.</p> <p>\"Even the richest Americans have a responsibility to their society and their fellow citizens. We are all tied to each other's success or failure. We are one society that will rise and fall together. It's not an atomised group of people in a Darwinian struggle. It's a collective society trying to move forward.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The deals could be worth more than \u00a36bn to Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister landed in Dubai on a mission to patch up relations with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where major British businesses such as BP and BAE have important interests.</p> <p>Cameron, who is irritated by claims that he uses his overseas trips to sell defence equipment to countries with questionable human rights records, has made arrangements to minimise the media coverage of the trip.</p> <p>But, speaking in Dubai on Monday, he insisted he would not shy away from raising concerns. \"On human rights, there are no no-go areas in this relationship. We discuss all of these things but we also show respect and friendship to a very old ally and partner,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"We have one of the strictest regimes anywhere in the world for sales of defence equipment but we do believe that countries have a right to self-defence and we do believe that Britain has important defence industries that employ over 300,000 people so that sort of business is completely legitimate and right.\"</p> <p>While in the UAE, Cameron will join forces with some of the country's senior political and military figures to inspect Typhoons at al-Minhad airbase, which is used as an air bridge for British forces flying between the UK and Afghanistan. Britain hopes to persuade Gulf leaders to buy 100 Typhoons on top of the 72 bought by Saudi Arabia, where he will arrive on Tuesday.</p> <p>The looming confrontation between Iran and its regional adversaries will also feature heavily in Cameron's talks with leaders in the Sunni-dominated Gulf countries. Britain could base Typhoons, built by a European consortium that includes BAE Systems, in the UAE if relations with Tehran deteriorate.</p> <p>Reflecting these wider concerns in Dubai, Cameron said: \"It is not just about trade and investment. We are also partners in defence and security; we worked together in Libya and Afghanistan and we will be talking about all the key regional and global issues.\"</p> <p>While in the Gulf, the prime minister will be accompanied by only a small pool of two newswire reporters, a broadcast camera person, a broadcast producer and a photographer. Other journalists, making their own travel arrangements, are invited to attend a limited number of events, though it is impossible for those outside the pool to report on any aspect of Cameron's short visit to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>No 10 is restricting media coverage partly out of sensitivity to Saudi Arabia, which has been upset by Britain's response to the Arab spring. Prince Mohammed Bin Nawaf Al Saud, the ambassador to London, recently broke with diplomatic protocol to say that Saudi Arabia was \"insulted\" by the decision of the Commons foreign affairs committee to investigate Britain's relations with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. British ministers have made clear that they have no control over a parliamentary committee.</p> <p>But Daniel Kawczynski, the Tory chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia, rallied to the kingdom's defence. He said: \"There is a huge amount of prejudice in the House of Commons, as there is in the country as a whole, because you only ever hear negative press reports. People have a very distorted view of the kingdom. I would be very put out if the Saudis came to this country and challenged and berated me about all our social ills \u2013 whether neglect of the elderly or drug abuse or inner city crime.\"</p> <p>Downing Street denied that the prime minister was seeking to limit press coverage of the trip. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \"This is not a secretive trip in any shape or form. We have the media travelling on the plane with the prime minister \u2013 they will have access to the events he is doing in country.</p> <p>\"The prime minister will take part in a debate with Emirati students on Monday which will be broadcast in full and is open to the press. There is a complicated programme and there are logistical challenges as a result. But this is striking a balance between getting out there and helping British companies and giving the media access.\"</p> <p>But No 10 has been trying for two years to restrict media access to the prime minister's overseas visits. This would make him the only leader of a G7 country who is not accompanied abroad by a full press corps.</p> <p>Andy Coulson, the former Downing Street communications director, tried in Cameron's first months in office to recreate the arrangements in opposition when the Tory leader would take just one broadcaster with him on trips. Coulson failed but his successor Craig Oliver, a former BBC editor, is trying to reimpose the restrictions.</p> <p>No 10 aides have complained that the prime minister is often asked questions unrelated to his official programme during overseas trips. There was irritation in No 10 during the prime minister's recent visit to New York and Brazil when journalists persisted in asking questions about the embattled chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who subsequently resigned.</p> <p>Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, the trade minister, is taking a parallel trade delegation whose members will meet David Cameron in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The prime minister will attend a trade fair in Abu Dhabi which will be attended by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.</p> <p>Cameron wants to persuade the UAE to buy the Typhoons to replace their ageing fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have expressed interest in ordering 60 of the jets. Oman has expressed interest in 12, while Saudi Arabia is considering placing a second order on top of the 72 it has already bought.</p>",
  "<p>I entered my first betting shop at the age of 16. Despite the <a href=\"http://www.think21.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Think 21 policy</a>, I was allowed in without having to prove my age. I went in to put a bet on the football, and I'll always remember the day. It was the first time I ever played a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_odds_betting_terminal\" title=\"\">fixed-odds betting terminal</a>. An FOBT is a touch-screen machine with a variety of different games, but the most popular is roulette. I remember feeding \u00a310 into the machine, placing \u00a32 bets on either red or black, and quickly doubling my money. From that day on, I played FOBTs every single day for the next four years.</p> <p>At the time, I had a part-time job while I was in the sixth form. I earned about \u00a3650 a month, which, for a 16-year-old with no bills to pay, is a small fortune. I used to work 20 hours a week, and I once worked out that during each shift I made \u00a332.44, but I would always go to the bookie's before, and sometimes after, I went to work \u2013 and bet \u00a330 to \u00a340 a spin. This soon increased to the maximum. The time between spins on FOBT roulette is about 20 seconds, and it's possible to bet up to \u00a3100 each time.</p> <p>I neglected just about every aspect of my life during that time. I scraped into my second-choice university and there was a betting shop next to the campus. I used to go in there every single day, before lectures, after lectures, every spare minute I had. I had no savings, despite having worked for two years while in the sixth form, so I was gambling with my student loan, and constantly extending my overdraft.</p> <p>After four years, when I was 20 and halfway through my second year, I hit rock-bottom. I had no money, and no possible access to credit. I worked out that I had lost \u00a316,000 \u2013 all the savings I might have had, all the money I had earned and all the money I had borrowed.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to receive cognitive behavioural therapy to help me overcome my addiction but, with only one <a href=\"http://www.cnwl.nhs.uk/cnwl-national-problem-gambling-clinic/\" title=\"\">NHS clinic for problem gambling</a> in the country, it's imperative that the government limits FOBTs. Otherwise, it's inevitable that even more will become addicted to what have been described as \"the crack cocaine of gambling\".</p> <p>It's for this reason that I'm now part of the <a href=\"http://fairergambling.org/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Fairer Gambling</a>, which advocates a reduction in the maximum stake from \u00a3100 to \u00a32; an increase in the time between spins; the removal of casino table game content from FOBTs; and a reduction from four FOBTs per shop to one. These recommendations would make the machines less addictive and create significantly fewer problem gamblers.</p> <p>The DCMS select committee recently recommended lifting the cap on the number of FOBTs per shop as an \"anti-clustering\" measure, as bookies leapfrog regulations by opening up as many shops as possible, and usually in deprived areas. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/05/labour-mistake-gambling-law-harman\" title=\"\">Research commissioned by Channel 4's Dispatches</a> found there to be more than twice as many betting shops in areas of high unemployment than in areas of low unemployment.</p> <p>The government is due to respond to those recommendations this month, but both the Campaign for Fairer Gambling and <a href=\"http://www.community-tu.org/\" title=\"\">Community</a>, the union that represents betting shop staff, will be hoping they are rejected. Ryan Slaughter from Community said recently: \"Our members want to be bookies, not bouncers. Betting shop workers up and down the country will look upon this report with dismay and outrage, because they experience physical and verbal violence on a daily basis owing to the presence of FOBTs.\"</p> <p>Tonight's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t14n\" title=\"\">Panorama</a>, which investigates the destructive rise of FOBTs, will more than substantiate Ryan's claims. The government needs to act quickly. The last British Gambling Prevalence Survey in 2010 showed that problem gambling in the UK had increased by 50% in three years and, while the proliferation of FOBTs is not entirely responsible for this, better regulation of these machines could help bring the numbers down.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 November 2012. The original claimed that FOBTs had doubled the number of problem gamblers in the UK to nearly half a million. This has been corrected.</p>",

Gregg looks on with a mixture of admiration and lust as telly's greatest woman Monica Galetti butterflies a sardine and whips up a <em>pommes dauphine</em>. No one's heard of it, so what chance have they got to cook it with the pair looking on with their critical eyebrows? Just when they think the hard bit's over, they must then poach chicken in front of Michel Roux Jr. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Richard Hammond's Miracles of Nature<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Miracles Of Nature is boys' toys meets nature, pointing out where science has taken its cues from the animal kingdom. Richard Hammond flits from one impossibly exotic location to the next, diving in a submarine driven by technology inspired, oddly, by the flight of the vulture, and looking at a fighter pilot suit that has been designed to mimic the way giraffes control their blood pressure. It's fascinating, despite its charmless, post-Partridge host. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Churchill's Desert War: The Road To El Alamein<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Jonathan Dimbleby tells the story of the battle for North Africa during the second world war. Starting in September 1940, when an opportunistic Mussolini sent 80,000 troops in an attempt to carve out an African empire, the conflict lasted for over two years, as British and Axis forces swept back and forth across the desert. Hitler sent in General Rommel and the Afrika Corps with orders to push the British out of Egypt, while Churchill became fanatical about saving the Middle East. Dimbleby pops up around the region to narrate a punchy history. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Border Wars: Stacey Dooley In The USA<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>The last of Stacey Dooley's reports from her American visit finds her at the US/Mexico border, facing firsthand the desperation that drives people to make the perilous and expensive journey towards what they hope will be a better life north of the border. Dooley's chirpy manner and cherubic face ensure people instantly open up to her, even in the dangerous, cartel-run border town of Altar, south of Tucson. She charms migrants and US border patrol officers alike, so it's almost physically impossible to dislike her, despite the journalistic shortcomings. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Nigel Slater: Life Is Sweets<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Sweets, says Nigel Slater, are like \"a roadmap through my life\". It's the starting point for a documentary that in other hands could easily be a dull exercise in Chopper-bikes-and-Grange-Hill-yay! reportage. Instead, the food writer, while delighting in retro packaging and adverts, movingly uses his nostalgia for confectionary past as a way to explore the relationship between taste and memory. Followed by Toast, a welcome re-run for the dramatisation of Slater's acclaimed memoir. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Girls<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Hannah finally decides to dump Adam, the simian succubus she can't seem to stop emotionally investing in even though he treats her like a home-delivery pizza. Shoshanna desperately tries to ditch her virginity but finds it more of a stigma than even she had realised. And Jessa misplaces the children she is looking after, calling for some quick dad-mollifying, which isn't a problem if you look like Jessa. If you can get past the fact they're all being excruciating, just like you were/are in your 20s, this is superbly well-written, horrifically honest and seriously funny.<em> Julia Raeside</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816729\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351870872551/Zawe-Ashton-as-Vod-in-Fre-010.jpg\" alt=\"Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat (Channel 4).

He obviously has a scientific brain, as demonstrated in his previous show, School Of Hard Sums, which was a batty mix of comic banter and puzzle solving. With this new series, he has a team of scientists to help him tackle a different subject each week (sex, Einstein and brain chemistry, to name a few), with in-depth discussion, exploratory reports and, worryingly, a lively studio audience. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Heston's Fantastical Food<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>When Jamie Oliver sought to change the eating habits of British schoolchildren, it resulted in motions being passed through Parliament. In this new series opener, Heston says he wants to remind us that breakfast is more important than a lie-in \u2013 although he's unlikely to get the Commons debating gigantic boiled eggs, supersized Shreddies, and general George's Marvellous Medicine-style tomfoolery. Fantastical Food is best consumed at face value: a fun CBeebies-style romp \"to make us feel like kids again\", presented by a bloke who looks like Brains from the Weetabix gang. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Josie coaxes Heather into a boozy girls' night out just before their first practical exam, and the resulting carnage results in the house getting burgled. Most things are replaceable, except JP's dad's ashes. There's worse to come for Josie whose hungover, shaking hands cause a horrific dentistry mishap. Elsewhere, Vod has designs on handyman Al, who comes to fix the locks and ends up becoming JP's \"local\" friend \u2013 and a suspect in Howard's investigation into the burglary. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Britain On Film: A Woman's Place<br>8.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Between 1959 and 1969, the Special Features Division of Rank produced short documentaries to serve as curtain-raisers for the main feature at their cinemas. They were called the Look At Life series and, taken as a whole, now amount to an invaluably guileless contemporary record of Britain in the 60s. This episode focuses on the depictions of women in the films which, given the period chronicled, were equal parts the early stirrings of feminism, and the strictures and stereotypes the movement sought to overturn. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Some Girls<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>\"Just because we live on an estate, doesn't mean we're all single mums with drug problems ... I mean, obviously some of us are,\" says Viva, pointing at her friend Mel. Amber is the dizzy one. Holly is violent and Saz is sarcastic. They all play for the same school football team and banter for England. It's that brand of jaunty depravity made popular by Shameless but Febrezed thoroughly and nicely delivered by the young cast. Plus Dolly Wells is brilliant as their sadistic New Zealand PE teacher. In this opening episode Viva storms out when her dad and his new girlfriend make an announcement. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Romanzo Criminale<br>10pm, Sky Arts 1</h2> <p>The conclusion to the second series, and you can be assured that there will not be a third. A shame for those who have acquired the nicotine-like habit of this drama about a band of impetuous gangsters who made a good fist of trying to extort the entire city of Rome. It's 1989 \u2013 Buffoni and Scrocchiazeppi are out of prison, while Dandi is now the slicked-back top dog who has fared the best, but at whose expense? Scores are settled in an elegantly grim endgame set against the context of the Berlin Wall's collapse and a cheesy Euro-soundtrack. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816730\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871019428/Brazil-with-Michael-Palin-010.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil with Michael Palin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil with Michael Palin (BBC1) Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions/Basil</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions/Basil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Great British Property Scandal: Every Empty Counts<br>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>George Clarke is back, crusading to get Britain's empty homes back into use. After he started his campaign last year, thousands have reported vacant properties and even more have signed his online petition, but there are still one million homes lying empty. George isn't happy \u2013 you can tell by the fact that his whole script seems to be written in an angry upper case. There is good news, though, as the government has coughed up money to help, and war veterans are renovating empties in Mansfield. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Brazil With Michael Palin<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Third instalment of Palin's yomp around the titular South American nation. He's certainly got his jaunt in early; as hosts of both the next World Cup and Olympics, Brazil will become the most over-analysed country on earth during the next four years. It merits the scrutiny \u2013 Brazil's emergence is one of the more under-discussed phenomena of this century. Tonight, Palin visits the Brazilian city everyone knows something about: Rio. Among the questions asked: why are Brazilians such consistently superior footballers? <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Secret State<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>At the start of this four-part series, we arrive in the afterrmath of an explosion at a US-owned chemical plant in north-east England. Nineteen people are dead, the community is in uproar, and the deputy prime minister (Gabriel Byrne) isn't having much luck pouring oil, so to speak, on troubled waters. When a helpful investigative journalist (Gina McKee) directs him to a confidential report on the company, it highlights the first steps on a murky trail of cover-ups. A well-cast, well-played conspiracy drama which, somewhat inevitably, goes \"right to the very top\". <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Breakfast, Lunch And Dinner<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Clarissa Dickson Wright is one of the few TV naturals, someone whose charisma suggests a person briefly contained by the medium rather than gearing their whole life towards appearing in it. In this enjoyable new series, she considers our three main meals and discovers the social, technological and health histories behind them. First, the most important meal of the day, breakfast, and to a bikers' caf\u00e9 where a \"full English\" may be ordered alongside a pint of lager on a Friday night. A far cry from the middle ages, where bacon and eggs came to be combined on \"Collop Monday\" \u2013 when they would be used up before Lent. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Comic Strip Presents: Five Go To Rehab<br>9pm, GOLD</h2> <p>Marking 30 years since inaugural Strip offering Five Go Mad in Dorset, Peter Richardson reunites the team in cosy Middle England. Original cast members Jennifer Saunders, Adrian Edmondson and Dawn French (and canine Timmy) star again as the Five, back together after 30 years apart, a spell that has forced four-fifths of the quintet to confront the grim reality of modern life. Following last year's weak Hunt For Tony Blair, this is a pleasing return to form \u2013 funny, thrilling and a little touching. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816731\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871185062/Great-Continental-Railway-010.jpg\" alt=\"Great Continental Railway Journeys\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Portillo presents Great Continental Railway Journeys.

The choice of year is, of course, not accidental, as the politician-turned-journo (whose fondness for pale blues and pinks at times calls to mind a walking Liquorice Allsort) hunts for evidence of a world about to be swept away by the first world war. Portillo begins with a journey through France in search of La Belle \u00c9poque, a trip that takes in Montmartre, absinthe, and the Monte Carlo casino. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Hatfields &amp; McCoys<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The fightin' and a-feudin' moves up a notch or two tonight as the town is visited by bounty hunters looking to spill Hatfield blood. But strangers are no match for the local family who know the region too well, so the only blood these gunmen end up spilling is their own. It becomes clear to the McCoys that they're going to have to find help closer to home in the shape of the well-named Bad Frank \u2013 who has thus far been observing and even laughing at all the carnage. There's also a Hatfield/McCoy wedding that fails to bring the families closer. Quite the opposite, in fact. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>Hebburn<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Jack's off for an interview at the Barnsley Gazette and his sister Vicki, who gets all the best lines, has a new car so she can give him a lift. \"I feel like when Cheryl drove that tank in Afghanistan,\" she muses, stroking her new steering wheel. Her enthusiasm soon subsides when she and Granny Dot get lost and risk missing their appointment at the Wax Hatch. Back at home, Joe (with Vic Reeves in his surprisingly normal dad role) lends Sarah his special fork to clean the hairs out of the plughole. Later, Jack and Sarah break some big news. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>How Tech Works<br>7pm, Discovery Science</h2> <p>Science as imagined by the lads' mag reader, How Tech Works is a Clarksonesque mixture of the fatuous and fairly interesting. In the former camp this week, a German man who has become a YouTube sensation via his innovative slingshot designs (he fires iPhones! And machetes!). Then a piece about Cotswold Airport, where Jumbo jets go to die. Or rather, be salvaged: a moribund Boeing 747 is worth $10m, but individually, the windows, the engines, even the seats ($10,000 each) are worth so much, the stripped plane can net $20m in spare parts. Interesting for the entrepreneur, terrifying for the nervous flier. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Year the Town Hall Shrank<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>The series focused on spending cuts in Stoke-on-Trent continues with the run-up to the May 2011 local elections. It's a campaign we see, in great part, from the perspective of the British National party, which had previously made inroads in the area. Contrasting with the idiocy of far-right politics, cameras also follow something important: the closure of an old people's home. Staff worry that moving elderly residents will lead to premature deaths but can't do much except offer care and compassion: \"It's lovely where you're going \u2026 D'ya need a cuddle?\" <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9pm, Dave</h2> <p>Time to bid a fond farewell to the Red Dwarf crew again as their well-received comeback concludes. It doesn't quite end with a bang but it does have several big explosions as the boredom of deep space gets the gang into trouble with the deadly Simulants. It's up to Rimmer to save the day. A holographic message from his overbearing father gives him newfound inner strength in a very unexpected way as the shameful truth about his lineage is finally revealed. <em>PO'N </em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871329771/Attenboroughs-Ark---A-Nat-010.jpg\" alt=\"Attenborough's Ark - A Natural World Special\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attenborough's Ark - A Natural World Special (BBC2). Photograph: BBC/Emily Garner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Emily Garner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Unreported World<br>7.30pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Wretchedly depressing dispatch focusing on Indonesia's addiction to nicotine, encouraged by manufacturers and barely regulated advertisers. The costs are monstrous: 90 million Indonesians smoke, and 200,000 of them die of tobacco-related illnesses every year. The case studies here are even more grim, from a six-year-old who has been smoking for four years to the children who are barely paid to pick the stuff. If you were already baffled as to how tobacco execs sleep nights, this will do little to ameliorate your puzzlement. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan<br>8pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Ex-Hobbit and apparent wildlife nut Dominic Monaghan presents Wild Things, an indulgence of a programme, the first episode of which takes him to the jungles outside the Venezuelan capital of Caracas to hunt a venomous centipede called the scolopendra. However venomous it might be, and it is pretty venomous, it's an underwhelming creature to kick things off with. The search for the insect is paired with sub-Palin travel footage punctuated by Monaghan's annoying mid-Atlantic accent. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Attenborough's Ark: Natural World Special<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>We wouldn't want many more species to go the way of the Dodo. So how about appointing David Attenborough as our television Noah, and asking which 10 species on Earth he would insure against future extinction? Cue a return to the warm, knowledgeable presenting that his safari-suited younger self specialized in in the 1970s. What follows is cute interaction, and an examination of the painstaking conservation projects that will help creatures such as the Sumatran rhino to survive. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Full Metal Jousting<br>9pm, History</h2> <p>It's the $100k final of the show where beefy men with a preference for pony tails and dodgy facial hair bash the hell out of each other with poles. With testosterone oozing through the screen, there's plenty of trash talk from the contenders \u2013 knightly chivalry is thin on the ground here. Each jousting pass only lasts five seconds, so there's a lot of filler and more replay angles than the Premier League, while the riders often miss each other completely. But in downturn America, it's probably not a bad way for a tough guy to earn a living. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Vegas Police<br>9pm, Really</h2> <p>In a twist on the age-old adage, what happens in Vegas is broadcast on UKTV. You'd think that in a city as sinful as Sin City there would be some eye-popping criminal action, but if Vegas Police is to be in any way believed, the level of misdemeanour is on a par with Norwich city centre on a Tuesday evening. One man is arrested for doing jazzercise while seemingly high, while another is busted for buying baking powder on the strip. Then two chump-witted fratboys get shaken down for being drunk. For a city this glitzy, the crime is dull as dishwater. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Songs of Sandy Denny at the Barbican<br>10.05pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Back in 2010, the Barbican hosted a tribute to Nick Drake. One of the performers, Green Gartside, is back there again tonight for this concert showcasing the music of another fallen folk legend, Sandy Denny, that most powerful of singers (and songwriters). Gartside tackles Denny's North Star Grassman And The Ravens and is joined by luminaries such as Maddy Prior, PP Arnold and Dave Swarbrick (as Thea Gilmore says by way of introduction, \"There are fiddle players \u2013 and then there's this guy\"). Really lovely. <em>AJC</em></p>",
  "<p>In the first ever episode of Yes, Minister, cabinet secretary Sir Arnold Robinson famously summarises why new minister Jim Hacker's flagship policy won't work: \"It's a contradiction in terms \u2013 you can be open or you can have government.\"</p> <p>Robinson cynically explains that the public doesn't really want to know what government is doing, since then they would have to take some responsibility for it. Inevitably, through various civil service machinations, Jim Hacker's plans are defeated and his commitment to open government is quietly forgotten.</p> <p>The mandarins of Yes, Minister would have been especially alarmed by the current government. The civil service reform <a href=\"http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform\" title=\"\">white paper</a> published in June declared that \"open policy making will become the default. Whitehall does not have a monopoly on policy making expertise. We will establish a clear model of open policy making.\"</p> <p>As we understand it, this means opening up the way government makes decisions, by improving consultation processes and opening up the evidence and information on which decisions are taken. It is the natural corollary of open data and transparency, allowing public participation at every stage of decision-making and implementation.</p> <p>Despite this announcement, there's still a lot of detail to be filled in on what open policy will mean in practice. This is why <a href=\"http://www.demsoc.org\" title=\"\">the Democratic Society</a> (Demsoc), in <a href=\"http://www.guerillapolicy.org\" title=\"\">collaboration</a> with the Cabinet Office, Guerilla Policy and <a href=\"http://www.involve.org.uk\" title=\"\">Involve, </a>has started a six-month project on how public involvement and new forms of consultation might work in an open policy future.</p> <p>Between now and February we want to answer three questions:</p> <p>\u2022 What does the best consultation and open policy making look like today, and what tools are available that government can use to meet its goals?</p> <p>\u2022 What will the best consultation and open policy making look like in five years' time?</p> <p>\u2022 What does government need to do today, in terms of technology or organisational change, to make that five-year vision happen?</p> <p>In the spirit of the subject, Demsoc has established an <a href=\"http://openpolicy.demsoc.org/\" title=\"\">online discussion space</a> to bring together a range of contributions from citizens, campaigning organisations, businesses, academics and officials. We'll be examining the benefits and disadvantages of different approaches to engagement, talking to policy makers and many others about the principles of open policy making and what is needed to develop the approach, and developing a vision for where open policy making could be in five years \u2013 including how digital technology can play a crucial role. We're particularly keen to hear about the best approaches to open policy from around the world.</p> <p>In the same episode of Yes, Minister, Sir Arnold explains his Law of Inverse Relevance: \"The less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it.\" In the case of open policy, we disagree. The more we talk now, the greater chance we have of developing open policy as a practical and meaningful way of improving government and enhance public participation.</p> <p>Take part in the discussion <a href=\"http://openpolicy.demsoc.org/\" title=\"\">here</a> and follow the contributions via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/demsoc\" title=\"\">@demsoc</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openpolicy&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#openpolicy</a></p> <p><em>Mike Harris is the chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://blog.guerillapolicy.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Guerilla Policy </em></a></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>Electronic record systems are among the most important healthcare advances of our times.</p> <p>They bring better, more sustainable healthcare and offer the NHS the opportunity to make large savings \u2013 allowing more public money to be invested in improving patient outcomes.</p> <p>However, a recent survey of more than 1,000 UK citizens revealed that 86.5% of respondents believed a serious breach of personal data would do considerable damage to a hospital's reputation, while 87.2% thought the NHS should monitor who looks at their patient records.</p> <p>Despite this, many NHS hospitals do not have systems in place to proactively detect privacy violation \u2013 and remain vulnerable to breaches, litigation and regulator fines.</p> <p>Until it becomes mandatory for trusts to build patient privacy into NHS IT systems, the risk of major data breaches will remain, and patients will not fully realise the benefits of electronic healthcare systems.</p> <h2>Disclosure and notification</h2> <p>Recent data from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) reveals that data security breaches within the NHS have increased by 935% in the past five years. Yet there remains no legal requirement in the UK for providers to disclose to the patient when a privacy breach has taken place.</p> <p>This must be addressed. UK citizens have a basic right to know when their records have been inappropriately accessed and their privacy compromised.</p> <p>When a breach has occurred, providers must be mandated to disclose this to patients, and notify the ICO. This would bring a level of accountability to care providers that cannot be achieved by other measures such as random audits and fines.</p> <p>Healthcare privacy laws in the rest of the world are being significantly strengthened \u2013 and the NHS cannot afford to be left behind. In the US, <a href=\"http://www.arrahitechsolutions.com/Home_Page.php\" title=\"\">Arra Hitech</a> privacy legislation (2009) introduced \u2013 and enforced \u2013 strict guidelines around breach disclosure and notification.</p> <p>Similarly, in Europe, pending legislation in the General Data Protection Regulation will mandate the disclosure and notification of privacy breaches to individual patients and governmental organisations respectively. The NHS should rigorously enforce this legislation.</p> <h2>Mandatory audit trails</h2> <p>At present, there is no legal requirement for electronic health record vendors or applications used in healthcare to produce a robust audit trail.</p> <p>This means that when a privacy breach has occurred, the care provider, enforcement agencies and patient do not have the ability to reconstruct who has been affected, to what extent damage has been done or how long it has been occurring.</p> <p>Furthermore, the majority of providers are unable to identify where privacy breaches have taken place \u2013 other than to wait until a patient reports concern.</p> <p>Mandating the use of audit trails across all electronic health records would be the most important step towards protecting patient privacy.</p> <p>Furthermore, sharing infromation increases the risk of security breaches and, as such, underlines the need for common and robust standards for audit trails.</p> <h2>The culture of change </h2> <p>Effecting meaningful change is as much a cultural challenge as it is a technological one.</p> <p>I agree with the wider healthcare technology community that education, training and awareness of patient privacy within the NHS need to be improved. The implications of security breaches must be fully understood across the health sector.</p> <p>Clear guidelines are needed on information sharing and privacy in order to help healthcare providers put the right practical measures in place.</p> <p>Encouragement is also required to reinforce a culture of privacy. This can only be achieved if all organisations involved with NHS care implement three basic safeguards: secure electronic communications with patients and carers, security of data in and across systems and assurance of only appropriate access to data.</p> <p>I believe that undertaking these changes will help to transform data security within the NHS, building levels of trust between patients and providers and enhancing patient care.</p> <p><em>Kurt Long is founder and CEO of </em><a href=\"http://www.fairwarning.com/\" title=\"\"><em>FairWarning</em></a><em>, a company specialising in solutions for privacy breaches. </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>So far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clare-carlisle\" title=\"\">in this series</a> I've considered evil as if it were an individual matter \u2013 a question of personal virtue, or the lack of it. In emphasising the relationship between sin and freedom, Christian philosophers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/does-freedom-make-us-evil\" title=\"\">Augustine and Kierkegaard</a> seem to assume that if we look hard enough at the human condition we will gain insight into evil. This attitude implies that evil has nothing to do with history or culture \u2013 as if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man\" title=\"\">the fall</a> is the only historical event that matters, at least as far as evil is concerned.</p> <p>In the 20th century, a series of scientific experiments on the psychology of evil told a very different story. Among the most infamous of these are the experiments at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\" title=\"\">Yale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/41\" title=\"\">Stanford</a> universities conducted in the 1970s by Stanley Milgram and Philip Zimbardo. Both Milgram and Zimbardo found that, under certain conditions, well-educated and apparently ordinary university students were capable of immense cruelty. Under the instructions of an authority-figure, Milgram's students were prepared to administer painful electric shocks as a penalty for poor memory: two-thirds of them increased the voltage to lethal levels as their \"subjects\" cried in agony. These results demonstrated how dangerous and immoral obedience can be. In his experiment, Zimbardo created a prison environment in the psychology department at Stanford, assigning roles of guard and prisoner to his group of undergraduates. Within a few days guards were treating prisoners with such cruelty and contempt that the experiment had to be terminated early.</p> <p>Reflecting on his Stanford prison experiment <a href=\"http://www.prisonexp.org/pdf/evil.pdf\" title=\"\">in 2004</a>, Zimbardo wrote eloquently about the conditions that make good people do evil things. The prison, he suggested, is an institution set apart from normal society in which brutality can be legitimised. Wearing uniforms and sunglasses, identifying prisoners by numbers and guards by official titles and removing clocks and blocking natural light all helped to dehumanise and deindividualise the participants. In this \"totally authoritarian situation\", says Zimbardo, most of the guards became sadistic, while many of the prisoners \"showed signs of emotional breakdown\". Perhaps most interestingly, Zimbardo found that he himself, in the role of prison superintendent, rapidly underwent a transformation: \"I began to talk, walk and act like a rigid institutional authority figure more concerned about the security of \"my prison\" than the needs of the young men entrusted to my care as a psychological researcher.\"</p> <p>Although Zimbardo insists that \"there were no lasting negative consequences of this powerful experience\", his conclusions raise ethical questions about scientific experimentation itself. Does the laboratory, like the prison, provide a special kind of environment in which pain can be inflicted with approval? Do the white coats and the impersonal manner of recording results dehumanise both scientists and their subjects?</p> <p>These questions point to a larger philosophical issue. Does contemporary society give rise to conditions more conducive to evil than in the past? Do science and technology, in particular, dehumanise us? Modern technology has certainly created forms of communication that allow people to remain more safely anonymous. Take the internet, for example; it's right here. In recent years the malevolent online behaviour of internet trolls and vitriolic commentators, hiding behind their pseudonyms, has become a much-discussed cultural phenomenon. Maybe it's quite natural that we have a delicious taste of freedom and power when given the opportunity to go undercover \u2013 like Stevenson's Jekyll-turned-Hyde as he runs gleefully through the night to the wrong side of town, stamping on children as he goes. But in such circumstances are we really in control? Milgram's electrocutors thought they were in control, and so did Philip Zimbardo. It turned out, of course, that they too were part of the experiment.</p> <p>As usual, Plato has something to contribute to this debate. In <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html\" title=\"\">the Republic</a> Socrates' pupil Glaucon recounts the story of a shepherd, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges\" title=\"\">Gyges</a>, who fell into the earth during an earthquake and found a ring that made him invisible. \"Having made this discovery,\" says Glaucon, \"he managed to get himself included in the party that was to report to the king, and when he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help attacked and murdered the king and seized the throne.\"</p> <p>Plato uses this story to depict the prevailing immorality within his own Athenian society \u2013 a society which had, after all, sentenced to death its wisest and most virtuous citizen. Plato suggests that his contemporaries regard hypocrisy and deceit as the surest route to happiness, since they seek all the benefits of a reputation for virtue, or \"justice\", while promoting their own interest by vice, or \"injustice\", wherever possible. In the Republic he argues, through the voice of Socrates, that this view is not only morally wrong but misguided, since true happiness and freedom can only come from living virtuously.</p> <p>The story of Gyges's ring seems to suggest that evil is a simply a fact of human nature. When anonymity releases us from responsibility for our actions, we will gladly abandon morality and harm anyone who obstructs our pursuit of what we think will make us happy. In this way, we might point to Gyges in arguing that there is nothing particularly modern about evil. On the other hand, though, Plato had to resort to a myth, and a magic ring, to illustrate the conditions under which our tendency to evil manifests itself. In our own time, technology has worked its magic, and the fantasy of invisibility has become an everyday reality.</p>",
  "<p>Senior public managers are overwhelmingly opposed to the government's plans to outsource policy-making, a Guardian survey reveals.</p> <p>A survey of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\">public leaders network</a> members shows a big majority - 81.6% - of senior managers are against the move, while a mere 9.9% agree with the policy. More than 500 public leaders network members took part in the survey, most of whom were senior public managers.</p> <p>\"Policy should be made through the civil service as directed by government \u2013 is that not democracy?\" according to one response. Managers also expressed concern about undue influence over policy-making from private companies with vested interests or thinktanks with their own political views. \"It is crucial that the process is transparent and based on evidence, not just the latest fashionable thinktank idea,\" said one manager. \"We would see what has already tended to happen with the NHS, namely that vested interests would take over,\" said another.</p> <p>Managers were not opposed to more open policy-making, however, and many welcomed a more collaborative approach, taking specialist advice on board. \"The civil service does not and should not have a monopoly of wisdom here and outsourcing can be energising,\" noted one senior manager. But the overwhelming view was that policy-making should remain firmly part of an independent, democratic process. \"There needs to be a core interface that is not outsourced,\" said one manager. \"It is essential that the formal process of policy-making is done by civil servants whose job it is to make sure it is done properly - and who work for a non-political organisation with a long-term remit,\" said another.</p> <p>Guardian public leaders network members also firmly rejected the idea of greater political control over Whitehall: 65.8% of the survey respondents said ministers should not have more responsibility over hiring their senior officials. \"This seems like the worst of all worlds - apparent impartiality, but a political selection process,\" commented one manager.</p> <p>Although a significant minority \u2013 almost a quarter (22.8%) \u2013 of respondents thought ministers could have more control over senior Whitehall appointments, those views came with clear caveats. One manager said that while people at the top of the civil service should be political appointees, their pay should be limited and they should be \"prohibited from working in any private sector employment related for their government work for at least 10 years\".</p> <p>There was also little appetite among senior managers for \"spinning out\" public services into mutuals. More than two-thirds of the survey respondents (62.5%) do not think their workforce has the right skills and appetite to consider an employee mutual or co-operative service delivery model. A mere 18.9% think staff could spin out their services into a mutual or co-op - one of the government's cherished alternative delivery models.</p> <p>The results will be disappointing for Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who is keen to promote alternative models of policy-making and service delivery as part of the civil service reform plans. In mid-August, Maude <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/03/tender-outsourced-policy-thinktanks-decline?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">announced the commission of a review into the workings of overseas civil services</a>, the first piece of work under the government's contestable policy fund.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<p>In April of this year, Saadiq Long, a 43-year-old African-American Muslim who now lives in Qatar, purchased a ticket on KLM Airlines to travel to Oklahoma, the state where he grew up. Long, a 10-year veteran of the US Air Force, had learned that the congestive heart failure from which his mother suffers had worsened, and she was eager to see her son. He had last seen his mother and siblings more than a decade ago, when he returned to the US in 2001, and spent months saving the money to purchase the ticket and arranging to be away from work.</p> <p>The day before he was to travel, a KLM representative called Long and informed him that the airlines could not allow him to board the flight. That, she explained, was because the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had placed Long on its \"no-fly list\", which bars him from flying into his own country.</p> <p>Long has now spent the last six months trying to find out why he was placed on this list and what he can do to get off of it. He has had no success, unable to obtain even the most basic information about what caused his own government to deprive him of this right to travel. </p> <p>He has no idea when he was put on this list, who decided to put him on it, or the reasons for his inclusion. He has never been convicted of any crime, never been indicted or charged with a crime, and until he was less than 24 hours away from boarding that KLM flight back to his childhood home, had received no notice that his own government prohibited him from flying.</p> <p>As his mother's health declines, he remains effectively barred from returning to see her. \"My mother is much too sick to come visit me, as she has difficulty now even walking very short distances,\" Long told me in an interview Sunday in Doha, the sleek, booming capital city of America's close Gulf ally, where the former Senior Airman and Staff Sergeant has lived for several years. </p> <p>\"I don't understand how the government can take away my right to travel without even telling me,\" he said. What is most mystifying to him is that he has spent the last decade living and working, usually teaching English, in three countries that have been very close and compliant US allies: Egypt, United Arab Emirates, and now Qatar. \"If the US government wanted me to question or arrest or prosecute me, they could have had me in a minute. But there are no charges, no accusations, nothing.\"</p> <p>As compelling as Long's story is, it is extremely common. Last year in Washington, I met a 19-year-old Somali-American Muslim, born and raised in the US, who saved money from a summer job to purchase a ticket to travel for the first time to Somalia to visit family members he had never met. When he went to the ticket counter to check-in, he was informed that he was barred from flying and suffered the humiliation of having to return home with his luggage and then trying to explain to his employer, family and friends why he did not travel.</p> <p>Like Long, that American teenager was never convicted or even charged with any crime, and was mystified and angry that his own government secretly placed him on this list, though he remains too afraid to speak out without anonymity. \"I'm scared that if I do, it'll only get worse,\" he told me.</p> <p>Like so many post-9/11 civil liberties abridgments aimed primarily at Muslims, this no-fly-list abuse has worsened considerably during the Obama presidency. In February, Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/no-fly-list-doubles_n_1249014.html\">learned that</a> \"the Obama administration has more than doubled, to about 21,000 names, its secret list of suspected terrorists who are banned from flying to or within the United States, including about 500 Americans.\" </p> <p>Worse, the Obama administration \"lowered the bar for being added to the list\". As a result, reported AP, \"now a person doesn't have to be considered only a threat to aviation to be placed on the no-fly list\" but can be included if they \"are considered a broader threat to domestic or international security\", a vague status determined in the sole and unchecked discretion of unseen DHS bureaucrats.</p> <p>But the worst cases are those like Long's: when the person is suddenly barred from flying when they are outside of the US, often on the other side of the world. As a practical matter, that government act effectively exiles them from their own country. \"Obviously, I can't get to Oklahoma from Qatar if I can't fly,\" said Long. \"Trying to take a boat would take weeks away from work just for the travel alone, and it's not affordable. If I can't fly, then I can't go back home.\"</p> <p>Gadeir Abbas, a lawyer with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) now working on Long's case, told me: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is happening to Saadiq happens to American Muslims with alarming regularity. Every few weeks I hear of another Muslim citizen who cannot return to the country of which he is a citizen.</p> <p>\"It is as if the US has created a system of secret law whereby certain behaviors - being Muslim seems to be one of them - trigger one's placement on government watch lists that separate people from their families, end careers, and poison personal relationships. All of this done without any due process.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The ACLU has <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/latif-et-al-v-holder-et-al-aclu-challenges-government-no-fly-list\">spent years</a> challenging the constitutionality of the no-fly list in court. Representing 15 US citizens and permanent residents who have been placed on the list, including four military veterans, the civil liberties group scored a possibly significant victory this June when the 9th Circuit of Appeals <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/no-fly-list\">reinstated their lawsuit</a>, which a lower court judge had dismissed, and allowed the case to proceed. ACLU lawyer Nusrat Choudhury, who argued the case, told me:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The No Fly List bars thousands of people from commercial air travel without any opportunity to learn about or refute the basis for their inclusion on the list. The result is a vast and growing list of individuals who, on the basis of error or innuendo, have been deemed too dangerous to fly but who are too harmless to arrest. Some have been stranded abroad when they suddenly found themselves unable to board planes. </p> <p>\"None of these Americans have ever been told why they are on the No Fly List or given a reasonable opportunity to get off it. But, the Constitution requires the government to provide our clients a fair chance to clear their names.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Long's case is both typical yet particularly compelling. Strictly on humanitarian grounds, it is outright cruel to deny a person who has been convicted of no crime the ability to see his ailing mother.</p> <p>Beyond the constitutional and humanitarian questions, Long was confounded by what seems to be the utterly irrational reasoning on which the no-fly list is based. As it bars him only from flying, he remains technically free to board a cruise ship to the US, one that would be filled with American civilians. Every US citizen has the constitutional right to enter the country, so he is technically free to visit the US or return there to live if he is able to get back, to visit crowded streets and shopping malls, to board trains, in essence to do anything but fly.</p> <p>\"It makes no sense, so it's obvious this is meant as some kind of punishment, but for what?\", he asked. \"If they are so afraid of me, they can just put a law enforcement agent on the plane to escort me back home.\"</p> <p>After learning he had been barred from flying, Long sought assistance from the US Embassy in Doha. \"After many follow-up calls to the embassy,\" he recounted, \"they finally gave me 'assistance' in the form of the website to DHS and instructions to file a complaint.\" On 15 May, he filed a formal complaint with DHS and received a so-called \"redress control number\" with a promise to review his case within 7-10 business days. Almost six months later, he is still in Doha waiting for an answer, still harboring hope that he will receive clearance to return home to visit his sick mother.</p> <p>Abbas, the CAIR lawyer, told me: \"It makes my stomach churn what the US does to American Muslims while they travel.\" Unfortunately, he said, the political reality of this issue tracks the familiar pattern of Muslims being denied the most basic rights: \"there is zero political will to alter the use of endless secret watchlists that terrorize the Muslim community and make none of us any safer.\"</p> <p>Abbas worked last year on the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/01/06/kuwait_2/\">truly wrenching case</a> of Gulet Mohamed, the then-18-year-old Somali-American who, while visiting Kuwait, was detained <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/proxy-detention-gulet-mohamed\">at the behest of the Obama administration</a>, and beaten and tortured by Kuwaiti authorities while he was interrogated for two weeks. Once the Kuwaitis were done with him and wanted to release him, Mohamed - who, to date, has never been charged with any crime - faced a horrible dilemma: at some point when he was traveling, the US government placed him on a no-fly list, meaning that he could no longer stay in Kuwait, but also could not return to the US, stuck in lawless limbo.</p> <p>When he was in Kuwaiti detention, Gulet was able to use a cell phone illicitly obtained by a fellow detainee, and his family arranged for him to call me and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/world/middleeast/06detain.html?_r=0\">New York Times' Mark Mazzetti</a> to recount his story. I spent an hour on the phone with him, and still vividly recall the terror and visceral fear of the American teenager as he tried to understand why his own government first arranged for his detention and beating, and then barred him from returning to the country where he was born and had lived his whole life, even when the Kuwaitis were eager to release him. That is the tyranny of the no-fly list.</p> <p>\"Our litigation in Gulet Mohamed's case seeks to establish what I think is the very modest proposition that the US cannot actively obstruct a citizen's movement into the US from abroad,\" said Abbas. As modest - and self-evident - a proposition as that is, it is one the US courts have not recognized in the context of no-fly lists.</p> <p>Saddiq Long has now purchased another ticket to travel to the US on 8 November, less than a week from now, in the hope that the US government will allow him to fly. \"If he isn't allowed to fly home on the 8th,\" said Abbas, \"we will plan on mobilizing people to contact the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI field office in Oklahoma City. The FBI controls these lists and his intervention could end Saadiq's predicament.\"</p> <p>For now, Long can do nothing other than wait and hope that his own country, which he served for a decade in the armed forces, will deign to allow him to return. Secret deprivation of core rights, no recourse, no due process, no right even to learn what has been done to you despite zero evidence of wrongdoing: that is the life of many American Muslims in the post-9/11 world. Most significantly, it gets progressively worse, not better, as the temporal distance from 9/11 grows.</p>",
  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Randi Mellman Oze, 54, printed off her absentee ballot paper, marked a cross next to Mitt Romney's name, sealed the envelope and took it to the post office to send it back to the US.</p> <p>A lifelong Democrat voter until she came to live in Israel five years ago, changing her political stance had been \"a very big deal\" to her.</p> <p>\"I was always a Democrat, and my family are all Democrats. But I don't feel Obama has Israel's best interests at heart,\" she said. \"Instead of concentrating on sanctions against Iran in the first two years of his presidency, he made nice to them and he put pressure on Israel. If he hadn't followed this policy, we would not now be on the brink of war with Iran.\"</p> <p>She is among up to 250,000 American-Israelis entitled to vote in Tuesday's US presidential election, the majority of whom are believed to be backing the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Polls of all Israelis, not just immigrants from the US, have shown a majority in favour of ousting Obama and installing Romney in the White House.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is widely perceived to be rooting for a Romney victory, against all protocol. Many commentators have accused him of interfering in internal US politics in his eagerness to see an ideological soulmate in the White House.</p> <p>Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been severely strained by the Israeli leader's insistence on a tougher US stance on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the US has resisted. Romney is seen as more hawkish on this issue. But he is also even less inclined to push Israel towards allowing the Palestinians an independent state \u2013 another factor endearing him to Netanyahu.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Shaul Mofaz, publicly accused the prime minister of trying to influence the outcome of the election. \"Israeli meddling in internal US affairs and turning the US administration from an ally to an enemy has caused us severe damage,\" he told the Israeli parliament.</p> <p>Some commentators have warned that a re-elected Obama could seek a payback for what is regarded as Netanyahu's transparent support for his opponent. Netanyahu rejected accusations of interference, saying they were \"completely groundless\".</p> <p>Israel has figured strongly in the candidates' own campaigns. According to Eytan Gilboa, a specialist in US-Israel elections at Bar-Ilan University, \"never in the history of US presidential elections has Israel occupied such a prominent place\".</p> <p>This, he said, had been largely driven by Republicans, who \"thought if they can move a few percent [of Jewish voters] into their camp it could have a positive result in a very close election\".</p> <p>He added: \"Some in Israel are happy that the candidates are competing over who is the biggest supporter of Israel. But this is a negative development. It would be much better for Israel to enjoy bi-partisan high level support.\"</p> <p>Palestinians are watching the election campaign with cynicism. Many feel badly let down by Obama's failure to force progress towards a Palestinian state, but they also know that Romney is unlikely to be a friend to their cause.</p> <p>\"Obama is not a saviour, and Romney will not be a devil,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee. \"Neither one is a free agent; there is a US policy of bias and support for Israel.\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee.</p> <p>Those who expected a re-elected Obama to \"suddenly develop a backbone and stand up to pressure\" were likely to be disappointed, she said. <br><strong>Harriet Sherwood, Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>Obama's election provoked euphoria in his ancestral village in Kenya, as well as among African governments who scented a chance to move up the US's list of priorities.</p> <p>Four years later, there is largely a sense of deflation and, judging by column inches in the press, somewhat less enthusiasm for this year's presidential race. Sub-Saharan Africa has barely been mentioned in the campaign and the feeling of apathy is mostly mutual.</p> <p>Yet residual loyalty to Obama remains deep and, if Africa's billion citizens got to vote, it seems likely he would win by a landslide.</p> <p>\"Four years ago there was so much hope in this country,\" said Boniface Mwangi, a photographer and political activist whose office in Nairobi, Kenya, is decorated with Obama's image in life-size cardboard replica. \"Now we're no longer that hopeful and asking where did we go wrong. I thought Barack Obama would do well for Africa but I'm ashamed to say that George Bush did more. Obama has done nothing for us. People are very mad, especially in Kogelo, his family village: they're still expecting some kind of handout from [him]. I hope his second term plans will include Africa; otherwise he's a hoax.\"</p> <p>Kenya is preoccupied with its own elections. Yet despite everything, Mwangi, who took out a bank loan to be in America for Obama's historic 2008 win, hopes that he will repeat the feat. \"He's more progressive than Romney in every way. Romney will be bad for America and the world. He's shallow and slimy, like a car salesman selling junk.\"</p> <p>Obama, who once hailed the \"blood of Africa within me\", has spent only 20 hours on sub-Saharan African soil since becoming president (it was a stopover in Ghana in between summits elsewhere).</p> <p>By contrast, the president of China, Hu Jintao, has made seven trips to Africa, five as head of state, and visited at least 17 countries, according to the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>But the Democrat remains way ahead of Romney in terms of brand recognition. Shehu Sani, an author and human rights activist in Nigeria, said: \"Not many people in Africa know who Romney is and what he stands for and what he is capable of doing.</p> <p>\"Almost everyone knows who Obama is for the very fact that he is partly an African and there is still hope he will do something for Africa as far as peace, stability and economic development is concerned. There is a saying, 'better the devil you know'. If we haven't seen the actions, we have seen the intentions, so we give him the benefit of the doubt. We hope the second term will be better.\"</p> <p>Commentators note that Obama's principal African focus has been security, for example in combating Islamist militancy in Somalia, with pragmatism based on American self interest.</p> <p>Ousseynou Bissichi, a guide at the African Renaissance Monument, in Dakar, Senegal, who points out to tourists that his workplace is taller than the Statue of Liberty, said: \"A lot of people in Africa thought Obama would be the president of Africa. Go to any centre in Africa four years ago and people were celebrating.</p> <p>\"Later we realised he's an American president, not an African president. Even George Bush did more for Africa and he's a white man. Bill Clinton did, too.\"</p> <p>Yet Bissichi also remains loyal to Obama. \"In Africa, we like the Democrats more than the Republicans. We think they have more humanity than the Republicans. Mitt Romney is a very rich guy. Even in America, people think he knows nothing about poverty and misery.\"</p> <p>Some admit that Africa's hopes for the president were impossibly high. Asked if he had lived up to expectations, Michael Amankwa, an entrepreneur in Accra, Ghana, said: \"I think he has to a large extent, even though some might have been a bit disappointed. He came in with too much star power, which raised the bar very high for him. Some also understand that he inherited a bad situation with the economy and so on.\"</p> <p>South Africa, the continent's \"superpower\", has hosted the US's first lady, Michelle Obama, but still awaits the photo opportunity of America's first black president meeting Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>Karabo Kgoleng, a radio presenter in Johannesburg, said: \"I think it is disingenuous for Africans to expect anything from any American president. He is not African. He is American and his most important priority is the American people not the Africans.</p> <p>\"I think Africans rejoicing at his making it to office came from the need for a psychological boost as well as an indication of Africans buying into the American dream \u2013 that one's roots can be African and one can succeed in life, with those roots. Africans need to hold their own leaders to account before pinning their hopes on anyone else. Obama owes Africa nothing.\" <br><strong>David Smith, Africa correspondent</strong></p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>The Obama-mania that swept Europe four years ago has faded fast amid transatlantic rows over the euro crisis, the administration's failure to deliver on its promise to close down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the waning attention paid to Europe by the US.</p> <p>But despite the fact that the centre-right remains in the ascendancy across most of Europe, disaffection with Barack Obama is not translating into support for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Quite the opposite. There is strikingly little support for the Republican contender whose gaffe-prone visit to Europe in July won him few friends and who regularly turns European welfarism and \"entitlement societies\" into points of mockery in his campaign speeches.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, European diplomats in Washington have been discreetly lodging complaints with the Romney camp about the candidate's criticism.</p> <p>An opinion poll last month showed widespread dislike of Romney, and residual, if no longer starry-eyed, support for Obama among Europeans.</p> <p>Just 5% of those polled in France, Germany, and Britain had a good opinion of Romney. Only 4% of Germans polled said a President Romney would make them better-disposed towards the US, while 12 times that figure took the opposite view. Two in five French people said a Romney victory would turn them more against the US, while only 5% said they would be happier with him in the White House.</p> <p>By contrast 87% of Germans said they would vote for Obama, while in France 67% described him as their president of choice.</p> <p>The ongoing German love affair with Obama started in July 2008 when the would-be president was famously denied the chance to speak at Berlin's Brandenburg gate by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and opted instead for the roundabout at the Victory column where thousands gathered to hear him speak, cementing his celebrity status in Berlin at least.</p> <p>Exploring why Obama's popularity had endured despite certain disappointments, Friedrich Mielke, said the president was viewed by Germans as a \"dove of peace\".</p> <p>The publicist and American expert said: \"We love him because we can project our own hopes and desires on to him,\" he said. Most people here see him as a leader of the free world, who combines intelligence and strength of character with charm and rhetorical lustre.\"</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was viewed as a \"locust capitalist\", he said, who \"spreads social frigidity and egoism\".</p> <p>It appears that Europeans see Romney as a return to the days of George W Bush who was hugely unpopular on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Romney has hardly sought to endear himself with Europeans, holding the EU up as a failed model and implicitly accusing Obama of being a closet \"European\" \u2013 big government, social welfare, and \"entitlement\" culture. <br><strong>Ian Traynor, Europe editor, and Kate Connolly in Berlin</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"<br><strong> Tania Branigan, Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>\"Which one is better for Iran, Obama or Romney?\" asked Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a political activist and leader behind the US embassy hostage-taking after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>\"The answer is not very difficult,\" he said, during the television debate. He was insinuating that Iran should be worried about the prospect of Romney winning.</p> <p>Asgharzadeh, who is now sympathetic to reformists, suggested Iran should play a role in helping Obama stay in office. \"We influenced American elections back at the time of Reagan [with negotiations over hostage crisis] and we can do it now. Iran can influence with a surprise.\"</p> <p>Iranians are closely following the election. There is concern that a Romney victory will significantly increase the possibility of an Israeli military strike against the regime's nuclear facilities, and weaken the prospect of a possible breakthrough in negotiations between Tehran and the west. The Obama administration, by contrast, is keen to give sanctions more time to bite.</p> <p>\"The US election results can potentially change the fate of my country,\" said an Iranian journalist based in Tehran. \"Many activists and those with access to internet or [illegal] satellite dishes are watching it closely.\"</p> <p>Iranian state agencies are reporting the developments of Obama-Romney campaigns but with little commentary. Iranian officials, however, say that the outcome is immaterial to Iran.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, while speaking among to reporters in New York during a visit to the UN general assembly last month, refused to show support to either candidate.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, Iran's speaker in parliament, said a Romney win would not be a threat. In his view, the governor's support for Israel's possible attack amounted to little more than campaign rhetoric. <br><strong>Saeed Kamali Dehghan</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>With anti-Americanism creeping back to the forefront of political rhetoric in Moscow, many in Russia slyly smiled when Romney this year called Russia \"our No 1 geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, said the remark showed Romney was \"open and sincere\". He added: \"That Romney considers us enemy No 1 and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, [this] means he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus</p> <p>\"We will be oriented toward pluses, not minuses. And I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>The statement harked back to Soviet times, when Russia's leaders preferred dealing with Republicans \u2013 who were seen as straight-talking, if tough \u2013 to Democrats, seen here as masking their anti-Russian stance behind talk of human and civil rights, viewed with suspicion inside Russia.</p> <p>Maria Lipman, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said: \"Particularly after the expulsion of the USAid, Washington's international aid agency, the Kremlin is now too committed to a path of using its old cold war foe as a bogeyman to consolidate wavering domestic support. Anti-American rhetoric in Russia has gone too far to shift easily now.\"</p> <p>Nor has there been much effort from the US presidential candidates to address policy towards Russia except for cheap point scoring, she added, and the next occupant of the White House was unlikely to seek to introduce any significant changes.</p> <p>Romney even appears in private to be backpedalling on his \"number one geopolitical foe\" comment. He used his son, Matt Romney, to pass a placatory message to Putin last month during a business trip to Moscow, according to a recent report in the New York Times.</p> <p>Many Russians have little interest in the race going on in the US, remaining sceptical that it can influence their lives.</p> <p>In a suburban train heading into Moscow on Friday evening, there was widespread indifference. \"Honestly, I don't care,\" said Sergei Chernenko, a 23-year old barman, adding that the election's outcome was irrelevant.</p> <p>Irina Kaidina, an accountant, concurred. Her son lived in New York, she said, but she couldn't remember the name of Barack Obama's challenger.</p> <p>Assistant engineer Nikolai Kuprianov, 32, however, said he had been following the presidential campaign. \"Obama would, of course, be a better choice in terms of attitudes towards Russia but Americans have never loved Russia and they only want us for our natural resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama had made the \"reset\" in relations with Russia an early foreign policy priority, but with recent disagreements over Syria, plus Moscow's accusation that the US stands behind opposition protests against Putin, what was once hailed as a success is now seen as dead.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said as much in an interview published this week: \"If we talk about the 'reset', it is clear that, using computer terminology, it cannot last forever. Otherwise it would not be a 'reset' but a program failure\".</p> <p>Among Russia's chief concerns are energy policy \u2013 Putin's ability to govern rests on a high oil price, analysts say \u2013 and US plans for missile defence in Europe, which it opposes but both candidates support. <br><strong>Miriam Elder and Howard Amos</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>The US elections have serious implications for Pakistan and policy making, but that is not reflected in popular debate or discussion.</p> <p>While government officials complain that there is little chance of key issues, such as efforts to draw the Taliban into a political process, being dealt with before the the election, public interest in the contest is virtually nil.</p> <p>Perhaps that is not surprising with anti-Americanism appearing to be at an all-time high in Pakistan.</p> <p>There has been little media interest in the campaign, with some of the most recent reports about the US president concerning the burning of effigies of him to protest against a blasphemous anti-Islam film posted on YouTube.</p> <p>There is certainly none of the enthusiasm Obama mustered in the Muslim world in 2008, said Munawar Hasan, president of the conservative Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami.</p> <p>\"After the last four years people now know that Americans are Americans and George Bush and Barack Obama are two sides of the same coin,\" he said, damning US policy on the region, including the sharp increase in drone strikes and the troop surge in Afghanistan. No one is interested in this election because, whoever wins, US foreign policy is not going to change.\"</p> <p>Some suspect the country's military establishment may harbour a stronger desire to see the back of Obama as his administration, in sharp contrast to that of George Bush (and Republican governments in general), was not afraid of playing rough with Pakistan, even at the expense of humiliating its armed forces.</p> <p>The May 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden within Pakistani territory still haunts the army and the country has struggled to cope with the massive increase in US drone attacks on its tribal areas.</p> <p>Even worse was the accidental US airstrike on the Afghan border last year which killed 24 troops and prompted months of acrimony between Islamabad and Washington. <br><strong>Jon Boone, Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>The US election has been watched with no little self-interest in Latin America, where many politicians and commentators partly define themselves by their admiration or rejection of US values.</p> <p>While most national leaders have remained diplomatically quiet about their preferences, the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who recently won re-election, has bucked the trend by stating his preference for Obama.</p> <p>\"I hope this doesn't harm Obama, but if I was from the US, I'd vote for Obama,\" Chavez said on state TV and indicated that he felt the admiration was mutual. \"Obama is a good guy \u2026 I think that if Obama was from Barlovento or some Caracas neighborhood, he'd vote for Chavez.\"</p> <p>The US president is likely to pick up more Hispanic votes from the endorsement of the Mexican band Man\u00e1, who played a set at an Obama rally in Las Vegas this month. \"We have the conviction that Obama is the best candidate for all Latinos,\" said Man\u00e1 frontman Fher Olvera. \"Vote for the president who has cared most for Latinos and minorities.\"</p> <p>In Brazil, which is in the midst of a municipal election campaign, the president, Dilma Rousseff, does not appear to see any political advantage in allying herself to either US candidate, partly because of differences in foreign policy.</p> <p>Regarding Obama's speech on the handling of the crisis in Syria at the UN late last month, Rousseff said: \"He has his position, I have mine.\"</p> <p>Brazilian media commentators have been underwhelmed by the performance of the two US candidates.</p> <p>\"The speech in which US president Barack Obama, formally accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party to run for a new mandate caused an anticlimax, even for his most excited voters,\" noted Folha de S. Paulo in one of the few Brazilian editorials on the US election. <br><strong>Jonathan Watts, Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Arab world</h2> <p>Arabs watching the US presidential race are mainly interested in how the next administration will deal with the Arab spring \u2013 as well as the perennial question of the unresolved Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Barack Obama has, in significant ways, failed to live up to the expectations he created in his long-awaited Cairo speech in June 2009. Many in the region say they see little difference between him and Romney, but Obama is probably still the preferred candidate.</p> <p>Obama was criticised initially for reacting slowly to the revolution in Egypt but has been measured since the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi became president and hopes to encourage a shift toward pragmatism and moderation.</p> <p>Following the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Washington also signalled continued support for the new government in Tripoli.</p> <p>Syrian and Arab opponents of Bashar al-Assad hope that in a second term Obama would be more openly supportive than he has been so far.</p> <p>Romney's policies reflect a more conservative world view that appeals to Saudis and their Gulf allies, who believe Obama has been too soft on Iran. Saudis hope that a Romney administration, with a neoconservative element, might be more aggressive on Syria. The Republican has expressed \"disappointment\" at the rise of Islamists. </p> <p>He is also likely to give greater weight to Israel's regional views, for example as they pertain to policy towards Egypt. Both candidates would likely remain muted in response to the ongoing protests and crackdown in Bahrain, a key US ally in the Gulf. </p> <p>The novelty for the next president will be that public opinion is now a more significant factor in the Arab world than it was when Obama entered the White House. It did not inspire confidence when Romney referred to the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin as taking place at a \"sheikh\" temple. <br><strong>Ian Black, Middle East editor</strong></p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>For a place where US troops are still dying in their hundreds and for which billions of dollars are spent each year, Afghanistan has garnered very little attention over the election.</p> <p>With a strange kind of symmetry Afghanistan might be dependent on US cash to keep its government afloat, and the US military to keep the Taliban at bay, but there is very little focus on the presidential race on the streets or in the TV studios of Kabul.</p> <p>This lack of interest is in large part because most people in Kabul feel the broad outlines of US policy have already been set. The timeline for the departure of US and other foreign forces will not alter, regardless of who wins.</p> <p>\"The Afghan people are not paying a lot of attention to the US election, because as we heard during the campaign, both candidates are agreed about taking their troops home from Afghanistan,\" said Najibullah Hosseini, a 32-year-old 32, a professor at a private university.</p> <p>Newspapers and television channels are running stories about the election, but there is little debate on popular chat shows or in the opinion pages.</p> <p>In one report, the popular newspaper 8am underlined that the US had already made a long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"Both candidates said there should be no worries about US and international aid to the country,\" the report said, before adding that it was in Washington's interest to ensure the country did not become a haven for terrorists, regardless of who was in the White House.</p> <p>Diplomats are similarly sanguine about the election results. The winner will have to decide exactly how fast they want to bring the rest of US forces home, but neither Romney nor Obama is likely to deviate from a 2014 deadline agreed with Nato allies and the Afghan government.</p> <p>\"A review of policy will take place any way, irrespective of who wins, and the overall mood in the US is very much focused on the honourable exit,\" said one senior diplomat in Kabul. \"If Romney wins, there may be more of a deep dive. He may be more critical in assessing what is under the surface of the positive narrative \u2026 but overall I don't think the election result will have a major impact here.\"</p> <p>Some Afghans, however, are still hopeful the election will bring change, with aspirations not far different from those of US voters weary with the steady flow of young men and women returning home in coffins, and the steep cost of a war amid a struggling economy.</p> <p>\"I want to ask the US voters to select a man who will talk with the Taliban to end the war. We don't want any more people to be killed, we want the economy to be fixed,\" said 50-year-old Shah Agha Nazari, head of a local council in Kabul's Neka Khana area. <br><strong>Emma Graham-Harrison and Mokhtar Amiri</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012.

  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident of retaining control of the Senate \u2013 achieving a target that looked all but beyond them earlier this year \u2013 with polls suggesting the Republicans will be punished for their conservative views on rape and abortion.</p> <p>The Republicans had been expecting to overturn the Democrats' slim 53-47 majority, adding the Senate to the already Republican-controlled House, providing them with a powerful base to challenge Barack Obama or support a Mitt Romney presidency.</p> <p>But these hopes have receded. One of the biggest blows is in Indiana, a state the Republicans have held since 1976. The latest poll shows the Republican Richard Mourdock trailing 11 points behind Democrat Joe Donnelly. The Tea Party-backed Mourdock is suffering from his comment that pregnancy from rape was \"something God intended\".</p> <p>A senior Republican, former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, admitted on Sunday that the Grand Old Party was unlikely to take the Senate. Interviewed on CNN, he predicted it would be close. Pushed on what he meant by this, he went further: \"Means no cigar.\"</p> <p>Polls suggest that Congress will emerge from Tuesday's elections almost unchanged. The prospect of status quo means Washington faces at least another two years of deadlock, with the Democratic Senate and Republican House cancelling each other out and the chances of significant new legislation poor.</p> <p>It will also mean that if Obama is re-elected, more standoffs between the White House and the Republican-led House, beginning with the impending deadline for dealing with the deficit and massive spending cuts \u2013 the so-called 'fiscal cliff'.</p> <p>The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, warned Romney last week that if he became president, he could expect little in the way of co-operation from the Democrats. He dismissed as \"fantasy\" his claim that he was better placed than Obama to bring back bipartisan co-operation.</p> <p>Thirty-three of the senate's 100 seats are being fought over, with at least 10 of them regarded as toss-ups. All 435 House seats are also being contested.</p> <p>The Republicans hold 241 seats in the House to the Democrats' 194. The Republican majority could be reduced but the chance of the Democrats retaking control remains extremely remote.</p> <p>The races have produced a colourful array of candidates and offer the prospect of a number of firsts, from the first \u2013 at least to be open about it \u2013 lesbian senator, Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin, to the first Republican black congresswoman, Mia Love. There are minor historical footnotes, too, such as the almost certain return of a Kennedy to Congress: Joseph P Kennedy, the grandson of Robert Kennedy.</p> <p>The Republican party has been in self-destruct mode in recent months, facing the prospect of failing in states that should have been easy gains, as it did in the 2010 mid-term elections when it fielded a disastrous set of Tea Party candidates.</p> <p>As well as the prospect of losing an Indiana Senate seat, the Republicans have made it difficult for themselves in what was the Democrats' most vulnerable seat, Missouri. Republican Todd Akin's suggestion that some rapes were \"legitimate\" turned a near-certain gain into a toss-up race.</p> <p>The Democrat Claire McCaskill had been struggling in Missouri, trailing Akin up until that remark. According to Real Clear Politics, she now holds a five-point lead. Republicans, after initially distancing themselves from Akin over the rape remark, are pouring money in behind him and polls show him eating into McCaskill's poll lead.</p> <p>With a moderate in place instead of a Tea Party-backed one, the Republicans would have been almost guaranteed victory instead of sweating over the outcome.</p> <p>The Republicans are almost certain to lose Maine, again as a result of the party's move to the right. It was held for the party by Olympia Snowe, an old-fashioned Republican moderate who believed in bipartisanship and became dismayed with polarised politics and the resulting Washington deadlock.</p> <p>An independent, Angus King, is in line to take Maine and is expected to caucus alongside the Democrats. The Republicans ended up in the bizarre position of spending money on ads supporting the Democratic candidate in Maine, hoping to split the Democratic and independent vote, allowing the Republican to slip through.</p> <p>Crossroads GPS, a super-political action committee co-founded by George W Bush's strategist Karl Rove, has spent almost $1m (\u00a3620,000) in attacks on King.</p> <p>The Democrats are hopeful of taking back the normally solidly Democratic state of Massachusetts where Republican Scott Brown is battling to hold on against a strong push from one of the Democratic party's most prominent liberals, Elizabeth Warren. The Real Clear Politics average shows Warren ahead by five points.</p> <p>Even if the Democrats were to lose their majority, they would still be able to block legislation from a Republican-controlled House. The Republicans would need a 60-40 majority in order to overcome any Democratic filibustering.</p> <p>There is a small chance that when all the results are in on Wednesday that the Senate could be tied on 50-50. The casting vote would then rest with whoever is vice-president.</p> <h2>The key House races</h2> <p><strong>Minnesota: </strong>A classic example of how fast political fortunes can change. ln August 2011, Michele Bachmann won the Iowa straw poll of Republican candidates, giving rise to a slew of media stories that she might be the party's presidential candidate. But that proved an illusion for the high-profile congresswoman, who is backed by the Tea Party. She is now battling to hold her seat in the House. A poll for the Minneapolis Star Tribune has her ahead in the polls but not enough for comfort, 51-45.</p> <p><strong>Utah: </strong>Mia Love could become the first Republican black congresswoman. Polls show her with a slight edge over the Democrat Jim Matheson.</p> <p><strong>Illinois: </strong>Tammy Duckworth, who lost two limbs as a helicopter pilot in Iraq, is the Democratic candidate battling to take a House seat from Republican Joe Walsh.</p> <h2>The key Senate races</h2> <p><strong>Connecticut: </strong>One of the biggest-spending races in the country other than the White House. Linda McMahon, the Republican candidate who made a fortune as an executive promoting wrestling, is taking on Democrat Chris Murphy. She has spent more than $42m of her own money. But Connecticut is traditionally Democratic territory even if the previous incumbent Joe Lieberman, who is retiring, was an independent.</p> <p><strong>Missouri: </strong>One of the most widely watched races to see if Republican Todd Akin will be punished for his views on rape and abortion, summed up in his remark about \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Republican Scott Brown took normally solidly Democratic Massachusetts after the death of Ted Kennedy. The victory was a shock to the Democrats who hope that Elizabeth Warren can take it back.</p> <p><strong>Indiana: </strong>Repubican candidate Richard Mourdock, like Akin in Missouri, is on the defensive after explaining his opposition to abortion. \"And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, could become the first lesbian \u2013 or at least the first to be open about it \u2013 elected to the Senate.</p>",

  "<p>Depending upon the sector you operate in, payment-by-results (PBR) contracts may be at the top of your agenda, or somewhere lower. With funding lines dwindling, many charities are competing for government contracts, and with recently mooted plans that the government may launch an 'outcomes fund' to make it easier for public bodies to issue PBR contracts and social impact bonds, it looks like they are set to be a feature of the charity landscape.</p> <p>That said, in recent weeks PBR contracts have come to the fore as concerns around up-front funding versus end-loading are making themselves heard. While navigating these issues will be a complex and extensive process, there is a lot that charities can do, in the meantime, to put themselves in the best possible position to benefit from these contracts.</p> <p>While there is no single PBR model, and schemes will differ considerably, the basic premise is to switch responsibility and risk from government to the private sector, creating incentives to drive improved performance from providers.</p> <p>The best way to explain this is to use a live example. The most publicised trial so far is the social impact bond for HM Prison Peterborough, where there is an agreed level of remuneration for the contract over a number of years, with a return for investors linked to the re-offending rate for prison leavers. The re-offending rate needs to fall by at least 7.5% to trigger the payment of returns to investors.&#xa0;Clearly, this is highly simplified, but the key here is that charities have to commit to multi-year contracts on which the financial output is uncertain, so whether large or small, it is vitally important to ensure that you do everything possible to minimise the risk of that final payment not being made.</p> <p>Charities may not necessarily have in-house experience of managing such long-term contracts, but the key is to ensure that once the contract has been signed it is not left on the shelf to gather dust, but is instead an active part of the charity's strategy.</p> <p>It shouldn't become an onerous task, but it will require on-going action. From the outset, time will need to be invested to ensure you understand and agree with all the definitions and parameters in the contract. It may sound obvious, but it's so easy to overlook and you will have to live with these criteria, and importantly, be judged by them for the life of the contract, so it's imperative you know what you're signing up to.</p> <p>Next comes monitoring and control. By putting in place regular checks and balances you will not only be able to monitor your on-going performance but keep track of how you're performing against the metrics defined in your contract. Engaging senior executives will be crucial to this, as they will be able to help facilitate fast corrective action should this ever show that you're off track.</p> <p>Such a monitoring system, as well as the associated audit trail of information, will help you and your team not only keep up to speed on how the contract is performing, but also ensure that if at any time your regulator, a board member, or perhaps your bank asks where you are with the contract, you can easily and quickly evidence that you are on track and complying with the terms.&#xa0;</p> <p>Of course integral within all of this is having clear lines of communication, not just internally, but with all your stakeholders.

Both defenders were huge for their teams all night, and with Frank Yallop having played his hand of subs early, the sight of Bernardez down on the turf with 15 minutes to go was a real worry for the coach. But the big man got up and when he got the final chance he made the most of it, with a little help from Gonzalez' foot and Saunders' mistake in handling his shot as it squirmed under his body.</p> <p>LA have made it hard on themselves - Keane did everything but score and was constantly proactive and looking for openings, while Donovan played constant simple sharp passes off him all night. The players around them struggled for clear openings though, and those that they got were shut down quickly for the most part by Bernardez and Hernandez.</p> <p>Bernardez could yet play a big part in the next match too, depending on what the news is on the injury he sustained near the end. Forget the forwards - he was San Jose's mainstay tonight and the reason they're taking the Galaxy back to Buck Shaw with a lead. The Galaxy have to attack there now - that game could be a much livelier affair.</p> <p>Thanks for joing me for both games today and thanks for all your tweets and emails. We'll be back in the morning with 5 things - for now, good night.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T04:15:56.345Z\">at 4.15am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50973b46b579f74bac764ab9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T04:06:31.102Z\">4.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FINAL SCORE: LA 0 SAN JOSE 1</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Final thoughts in a minute.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T04:06:37.355Z\">at 4.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50973ac795cb1506d24448d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T04:04:24.204Z\">4.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">GOAL!

Both sides will feel that their defenders have done what's asked of them, particularly their central pairings - though Meyer almost got skinned for pace by Wondolowski early on. Towards the end of the half San Jose had a decent chance instigated by the hold-up play and knockdowns of Lenhart, that just emphasized how they'd been missing early, with Gonzalez keeping him quiet.</p> <p>LA for their part may think they should have scored on the stroke of half time, and indeed a few minutes earlier, when Keane and Donovan, whose understanding has blossomed this year, were not on the same page in the six yard box.</p> <p>As things stand you can see the Galaxy creating more chances behind this San Jose defense and probably taking at least one of them. For San Jose you get the feeling that the substitutions they choose to make, and the timing of them, will be crucial. Will Yallop risk Dawkins at half-time? Will we see Gordon show up for one of his late cameos? What San Jose will we see in the last 20 minutes? The last question might determine the trajectory of this tie.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T03:07:13.586Z\">at 3.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50972bb0b579f74bac764aa4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T03:00:01.239Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">HALF TIME: LA GALAXY 0 SAN JOSE 0</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Half time thoughts in a moment...</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T03:00:19.067Z\">at 3.00am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50972b9895cb1506d24448c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T02:59:36.588Z\">2.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">45 mins +2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One last chance for LA ends with Keane doing a sharp little turn to get the ball past his man, but physics intervenes when he tries to follow, much to his disgust, as he appeals for a penalty for Hernandez blocking him.

Perhaps because in Chavez, Baca, Dawkins etc., San Jose have less celebrated players than their free-scoring attackers, who have nonetheless made sterling contributions of their own to the style of the Quakes this year, particularly running the supply lines for those attackers.</p> <p>One note on this though, is that the comments made by Omar Gonzalez were made after he\u2019d played his first game of the year against the Quakes, and his contest with Steven Lenhart will be one of the key match ups tonight. In that 2-2 draw, the giant central defender was generally felt to have closed Lenhart down, especially in the first half. So Frank Yallop might be tempted to pair Lenhart with Alan Gordon at some stage tonight to help dominate that central area. That will depend on the fitness levels of Gordon and a possibly doubtful Simon Dawkins (whose left-sided role would likely be occupied by Wondolowski were Yallop to push his big men up front).</p> <p>Another side question might be how many times on their quest for MLS Cup San Jose can fall behind and recover in games. Despite their enormous recuperative powers at the end of games, San Jose won\u2019t want to go through too many scenarios like this one...</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gs1_D5O93E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gs1_D5O93E?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Not that those neutrals of us watching would mind.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50971994b579f74bac764a98\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T01:42:44.486Z\">1.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">LA Galaxy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Galaxy beat Vancouver Whitecaps in the Western Conference wild-card game, in order to host tonight\u2019s game. To do so they had to overcome a determined Whitecaps team that did everything they were supposed to do - they remained organized, scored early and got men behind the ball to thwart the Galaxy, and while the home team dominated possession, for most of the first hour there was a sense that the Galaxy players were going through the motions a little, with very few shifts of tempo to create an opening.</p> <p>The exception was Robbie Keane, who is completing his first full season in MLS in the best form since he got here and who was one of the few players looking to force the issue, while still trying to bring team mates into the game. It\u2019s the latter part of his game that has become increasingly important to the Galaxy - in the last home game of the season, it was his cool set up that allowed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/29/los-angeles-galaxy-seattle-sounders-live\">Mike Magee to take the points against possible Western final opponents Seattle</a>, while his constant running and inventive movement continually makes space for his team mates to move into.&#xa0;</p> <p>In hindsight, after Magee\u2019s equalizer and Donovan\u2019s immediate penalty winner, it\u2019s easy to say that the Galaxy controlled the game and eased to the win, but they were still trailing with 20 minutes to go, and while Keane was making his moves and his fellow star players looking to pick their passes, there was the sense that Vancouver were coping comfortably enough. The Caps\u2019 loss of DeMerit during the build up to the first goal was huge in that respect.</p> <p>Other than the 2-2 draw a couple of weeks ago, the Galaxy have lost twice against San Jose this season. They won\u2019t have the time on the ball Vancouver granted them, and they\u2019ll need everybody to move sharply and anticipate more quickly if they\u2019re to progress against the Quakes. Man for man they have the players to beat San Jose, but none of those players can rely on others to take the initiative. Let's see how they come out for this home leg.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5097175a95cb1506d24448ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T01:33:15.103Z\">1.33am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So here's Omar Gonzalez, of LA Galaxy, making his pitch to become San Jose head of tourism, after the two teams played out a bruising 2-2 draw a couple of weeks ago:&#xa0;</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, this game wasn\u2019t even fun. I think those guys are a bunch of jokes, the way they play the game. It was just obnoxious. And, you know, it wasn\u2019t even fun out there. It was terrible.\u201d</p> <p>These two teams, and their fans, really don\u2019t like each other. And now they must play over two legs to determine who goes to the Western Conference final, who holds California bragging rights, and if Gonzales\u2019 comments are any indication (he also called the Supporters Shield winners \u201cembarrassing\u201d), who has the ideological upper hand on how the game should be played.</p> <p>In the home corner we have LA Galaxy, the Designated-Player-studded reigning MLS Cup holders, and their adherence to patient, possession soccer - as exemplified by their ultimate prevailing over Vancouver Whitecaps in Thursday\u2019s wild-card game.</p> <p>In the other corner we have San Jose Earthquakes and their collection of nicknames in lieu of star names. Where the Galaxy have Beckham, Donovan and Keane, the Earthquakes have Wondo, \u201cThe Bash Brothers\u201d and a collective identity as \u201cThe Goonies\u201d. They do of course have the league\u2019s leading goalscorer in the record-equalling Chris Wondolowski (27), as well as the tender ministrations of Alan Gordon and Steven Lenhart, who have chipped in a further 23 goals between them, in a physical and direct San Jose offense.</p> <p>It\u2019s a rivalry that has intensified this year, with the Quakes\u2019 recent success putting their rivals\u2019 nose out of joint (insert joke here), but in truth this has never been a contest that needs much encouragement. As I said, these two teams, and their fans, really don\u2019t like each other.</p> <p>I like everyone of course, and I\u2019d like to hear from you tonight, with your thoughts on the game.

  "<p>David Cameron will embark on a low-key arms trip to the Gulf on Monday in an attempt to persuade regional powers upset by Britain's response to the Arab spring to buy more than 100 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets. The deals could be worth more than \u00a36bn to Britain.</p> <p>The prime minister will fly to a major UAE military airbase on a mission to patch up relations with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where major British businesses such as BP and BAE have important interests.</p> <p>Cameron will join forces with senior political and military figures from the UAE to inspect Typhoons at Al Minhad airbase, which is used as an air bridge for British forces flying between the UK and Afghanistan. Britain hopes to persuade Gulf leaders to buy 100 Typhoons on top of the 72 bought by Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The looming confrontation between Iran and its regional adversaries will also feature heavily in Cameron's talks with leaders in the Sunni-dominated Gulf countries. Britain could base Typhoons, built by a European consortium that includes BAE Systems, in the UAE if relations with Tehran deteriorate.</p> <p>The prime minister, who is irritated by claims that he uses his overseas trips to sell defence equipment to countries with questionable human rights records, has made arrangements to minimise the media coverage of the trip.</p> <p>Cameron will be accompanied by only a small pool of two newswire reporters, a broadcast camera person, a broadcast producer and a photographer. Other journalists, making their own travel arrangements, are invited to attend a limited number of events, though it is impossible for those outside the pool to report on any aspect of Cameron's short visit to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.</p> <p>No 10 is restricting media coverage partly out of sensitivity to Saudi Arabia, which has been upset by Britain's response to the Arab spring. Prince Mohammed Bin Nawaf al-Saud, the ambassador to London, recently broke with diplomatic protocol to say that Saudi Arabia was \"insulted\" by the decision of the commons foreign affairs committee to investigate Britain's relations with Saudi and Bahrain. British ministers have made clear that they have no control over a parliamentary committee.</p> <p>But Daniel Kawczynski, the Tory chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia, rallied to the kingdom's defence. He said: \"There is a huge amount of prejudice in the House of Commons, as there is in the country as a whole, because you only ever hear negative press reports. People have a very distorted view of the kingdom. I would be very put out if the Saudis came to this country and challenged and berated me about all our social ills \u2013 whether neglect of the elderly or drug abuse or inner city crime.\"</p> <p>Downing Street denied that the prime minister was seeking to limit press coverage of the trip. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \"This is not a secretive trip in any shape or form. We have the media travelling on the plane with the prime minister \u2013 they will have access to the events he is doing in country.</p> <p>\"The prime minister will take part in a debate with Emirati students on Monday which will be broadcast in full and is open to the press. There is a complicated programme and there are logistical challenges as a result. But this is striking a balance between getting out there and helping British companies and giving the media access.\"</p> <p>But No 10 has been trying for two years to restrict media access to the prime minister's overseas visits. This would make him the only leader of a G7 country who is not accompanied abroad by a full press corps.</p> <p>Andy Coulson, the former Downing Street communications director, tried in Cameron's first months in office to recreate the arrangements in opposition when the Tory leader would just take one broadcaster with him on trips. Coulson failed but his successor Craig Oliver, a former BBC editor, is trying to reimpose the restrictions.</p> <p>No 10 aides have complained that the prime minister is often asked questions unrelated to his official programme during overseas trips. There was irritation in No 10 during the prime minister's recent visit to New York and Brazil when journalists persisted in asking questions about the embattled chief whip Andrew Mitchell, who subsequently resigned.</p> <p>Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, the trade minister, is taking a parallel trade delegation whose members will meet the prime minister in Saudi and the UAE. The prime minister will attend a trade fair in Abu Dhabi which will be attended by BAE Systems and Rolls Royce.</p> <p>Cameron wants to persuade the UAE to buy the Typhoons to replace their ageing fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have expressed interest in ordering 60 of the jets. Oman has expressed interest in 12, while Saudi Arabia is considering placing a second order on top of the 72 they have already bought.</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger\" title=\"\">failed \u00a325bn merger with the Franco-German owner of Airbus, EADS</a>, BAE Systems and its investors are looking beyond the western world.</p> <p>The UK's largest defence contractor sees the Middle East as an important growth market, building on the substantial position it has established on the back of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/05/bae-saudi-yamamah-deal-background\" title=\"\">controversial al-Yamamah arms deal</a>.</p> <p>That contract with the Saudi Arabian government brought BAE more than \u00a340bn of revenue, as well as a Serious Fraud Office investigation that ended abruptly under government orders in 2006.</p> <p>BAE is close to securing an order for 12 Typhoon jets from Oman, a Gulf state with which it has a decades-long relationship. Further down the track, multibillion-pound aircraft deals in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar beckon.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia will play an important role following the collapse of the merger, which has led to BAE's largest shareholder calling for the resignation of the company's chairman, Dick Olver. Investors and market analysts are hoping that BAE will soften the blow of the EADS failure, and buy the firm's management more time, by returning the proceeds from a renegotiation of a Saudi contract for 72 Typhoons. BAE is expected to receive up to \u00a3600m and shareholders hope it will be diverted towards them by way of a special dividend or share buyback.</p> <p>In the longer-term, however, the Arab spring could alter a business environment that has been a consistent earner for BAE and other western defence contractors.</p> <p>Indeed, a list of defence suppliers to Saudi Arabia throws up some powerful multinationals: Boeing, Microsoft and Rolls-Royce are among the blue-chip names. According to analysis by IHS Jane's, Arab states may seek to reduce their reliance on individual defence contractors in case an internal crackdown leads to an arms embargo that would deny access to maintenance, upgrades and spare parts for military equipment.</p> <p>\"There is a fear that if there is an uprising and states go too far in terms of controlling it, they will have their wrists slapped by their friends in the west,\" says Guy Anderson, chief analyst at IHS Jane's, who estimates that the Middle East and Africa account for around 15% of BAE's revenues. If this leads to reliance on a broader array of suppliers or deeper relationships with countries that have fewer qualms about supplying controversial regimes, the likes of BAE could suffer.</p> <p>Anderson adds that Britain can no longer treat certain Middle Eastern states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, as guaranteed customers because of a general trend towards broader supplier ties. \"The UK is going to face a bit of a struggle. Many parts of the Middle East were guaranteed markets in past years. You could almost take it for granted that Oman would buy British, or that Saudi Arabia would alternate between the US and the UK. But now it will be harder to take them for granted.\"</p> <p>IHS Jane's adds that Middle Eastern states, including Saudi Arabia, have pumped billions of dollars into social programmes and employment schemes in the wake of the Arab spring, which could lead to cutbacks in defence procurement.</p> <p>But the political upheaval over the past year contains opportunities for BAE, which has a burgeoning cybersecurity business. After all, the Egyptian uprising was fuelled by a Google employee and social media played a role elsewhere. \"The security services were, in many cases, caught on the hop,\" says Anderson. \"So expect them to beef up on cybersecurity.\"</p>"
