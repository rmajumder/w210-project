  "<p> A Kenyan man who was paralysed after being shot by carjackers nine years ago has caught the imagination of the nation by embarking on a 2,485-mile journey to South Africa on a manual wheelchair to seek treatment for his spinal injuries. Zachary Kimotho, a 44-year-old veterinarian, began the journey in June with the aim of raising \u00a31.9m to build a spinal injury treatment unit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>On the first phase of his journey, Kimotho raised \u00a3650,000 and covered 78 miles of the route to South Africa, where the nearest spinal cord injury rehabilitation centre is. In a telephone interview on Friday with the <em>Observer</em>, Kimotho, who was near the border of Tanzania and Kenya, said he had continued despite cold and wet weather and he had blisters on his hands from turning the wheels.</p> <p>\"It has been a very cold season in Kenya and I also have to contend with speeding motorists. I have faced so many challenges but I don't want them to deter me from the goal,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was selected in June to be the face of the campaign organised by the <a href=\"http://www.kenyanparaplegic.or.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation</a> to raise awareness of the suffering of spinal injury patients in Kenya. They appealed for the public to help <a href=\"http://www.bringzackbackhome.com/\" title=\"\">\"Bring Zack Back Home\"</a>, urging Kenyans to each contribute a Kenyan shilling (about a penny) in the hope that enough money would be raised to build the unit, saving Kimotho from having to complete his arduous journey. Kenyans took to social media to spread the word and the hashtag #BringZackBackHome became a top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Kimotho was paralysed in 2004 after he was shot in his car in Nairobi. \"All of a sudden, a vehicle stopped in front of me and through the windscreen, I could see a man raising both hands. Momentarily, I thought I had caused an accident,\" he said. A man with a gun then told him to open the door and to move to the passenger seat. He then felt a sharp pain in his shoulder. \"A bullet pierced through my shoulder, through my spine all the way to the other shoulder,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was in Kenyatta National Hospital for three months. Six months before the incident his wife had died, leaving him to bring up their son, now 10, alone. He had also lost his job as a vet a few months before. When he was discharged he was in a wheelchair, but he believes that his circumstances would have been greatly different had he received better care. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/08/kenyan-dangerous-drivers-twitter-roads\" title=\"\">With 20,000 people injured in road accidents each year</a>, the spinal injury wing of the Kenyatta hospital is overstretched. Kimotho now hopes to help others avoid his fate. \"I would like other spinal injury patients to benefit from proper treatment and rehabilitation \u2013 treatment I never got,\" he said.</p> <p>But Kimotho's journey has now been halted by bureaucracy. \"We had to stop because we had [only] applied for a [fundraising] licence of 60 days,\" he said. The Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation has acquired 12 acres of land in Nairobi to build the new spinal care unit. \"In early September, we'll lay a foundation with the amount raised so far for all to see how their money has been spent. Then we'll launch phase two of the initiative,\" Kimotho said.</p>",
  "<p>The family of a man left in a vegetative state after a heart attack has made an eleventh hour appeal for doctors to do all they can to keep him alive as they await a vital court ruling.</p> <p>Tomorrow, the court of protection in London will be asked to rule in a dispute over whether it is in \"the best interests\" of the severely brain-damaged man, who is from the Greater Manchester area, to continue to receive life-saving treatment if his condition deteriorates.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pat.nhs.uk/PortalVBVS/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust </a>claim it is not in the best interests to offer the man, known only as L, ventilation or resuscitation if his condition worsens and he suffers \"a life-threatening event\", such as another heart attack. But his family disagree and say they, not the trust, must be given the right to decide on his care.</p> <p>\"L's wife and other family members believe that it is too early to give up and hope that his condition will improve,\" said Helen Lewis, a specialist in clinical negligence at Manchester law firm Pannone, who is representing the family. \"It has been less than five weeks since L developed brain damage following a cardiac arrest and the family want to ensure that he is given all possible life-saving medical treatment.</p> <p>\"They want to be fully involved in the decision-making process so proper regard can be given to how L lived his life and what they believe he would have wanted\".</p> <p>Debra Powell, appearing for the trust, said it was unclear how long L could be expected to live, adding that it could be months or even longer.</p> <p>Mr Justice Ryder, the judge hearing the initial case, described L as a vulnerable adult who lacked the capacity to make decisions about his treatment.</p> <p>\"L's family do not agree with the trust's position and wish all possible life-saving medical care to be provided,\" Ryder said, adding that because the case raises important issues \"of serious medical treatment\" it should be heard in public. However, court orders prevent the identification of L, his family members, the hospital treating him and clinicians looking after him.</p> <p>The trust had sought an interim declaration from the courts that it was not in L's best interests to receive life-saving treatment if it became necessary before tomorrow's hearing. But an agreement was reached that clinicians would attempt to resuscitate L and use ventilation if required, pending a ruling in the courts. Legal experts are drawing comparisons between L's case, hingeing on his family's appeal for his right to life, and that brought by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/16/locked-in-syndrome-right-die\" title=\"\"> Locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson,</a> who last week lost his high court battle for the legal right to end his life when he chooses.</p> <p>A second victim of Locked-in syndrome, referred to as \"Martin\", 47, who could not be identified, said through his lawyers that he felt \"even more frustrated and angry\" after losing his challenge to the legal ban.</p> <p>Three judges referred to the \"terrible predicament\" of the two men and described their cases as \"deeply moving and tragic\". The ruling in L's case is expected on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Three years ago, I came across the victims of a drone strike about an hour after it occurred. It was in Gaza \u2013 although the location for the purposes of this piece does not matter; only the fact of the weapons system. The drone had fired a missile at a militant commander. Standing close by at that moment was a group of children waiting for a lift to school, three of whom were wounded.</p> <p>All injury and death is horrible, that suffered by innocents doubly so. Having seen so much of the human consequences of war, I tend not to distinguish which weapon has been responsible but try to see the intent behind the attack that caused the injury and death. In conflict, within the existing framework of international humanitarian law, whether an attack is justifiable and legal is defined both by the nature of the target and proper consideration of whether there will be civilian casualties and whether they are avoidable.</p> <p>For this reason, I find the notion of drone warfare no more horrible than a Tomahawk cruise missile fired from a distant ship or a bomb dropped indiscriminately on a village by a high-flying F-22 or MiG. What did bother me about that drone strike three years ago \u2013 about all drone strikes that cause civilian injuries and death \u2013 was the knowledge that, unlike a jet pilot or artilleryman firing a shell on to co-ordinates where he cannot see who is nearby, this aircraft's remote pilot must have been able to see the children who would be injured.</p> <p>The use of drones to conduct lethal strikes, particularly by the US and often causing civilian casualties, has come to be one of the most deeply controversial moral issues in the development of modern conflict, driven by the fourfold escalation in the use of drones by President Barack Obama in the global \"war on terror\" from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Yemen and Somalia. The most recent incident occurred yesterday in northern Pakistan \u2013 the first in over a month \u2013 when five alleged militants were killed in a drone strike on the compound of a local warlord. So controversial indeed is the subject that last month Congress indicated it was seeking the internal White House memos used to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/02/drone-wars-secrecy-barack-obama\" title=\"\">authorise drone strikes</a> where US citizens fighting with militants had been killed. The UK, too, has been drawn in through a court case brought by a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9289127/Court-case-over-drone-strike-could-force-Britain-to-reveal-intelligence-exchanges-with-US.html\" title=\"\">Pakistani student</a> demanding to know whether this country has provided intelligence for a suspected US drone strike that killed his father.</p> <p>Despite genuine concerns over drone warfare, much of what has been written on both sides of the debate on the surrounding moral and legal issues has been ill-informed and confused. In part, this is because for some the issue has become conflated with broader geopolitical concerns, not least a critique of US military power. While how we understand the use of military power by a state should serve as an important context, it does not assist in understanding whether the use of drones is legitimate.</p> <p>For many, the nature of drone warfare itself has become central. The operators' very remoteness, it is claimed, leads to desensitisation. But throughout the history of weapons, designers have always sought to maximise lethality while reducing the vulnerability of those using the weapons. And while it has long been accepted that there is a relationship between increased distance from a target and the ability to kill with reduced feelings of guilt, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some drone operators, because they spend so long intimately observing their targets, experience the same emotional damage as those who kill at close quarters.</p> <p>What then of the issue of international legality? As Joshua Foust and Ashley Boyle argue in a new paper, <a href=\"http://americansecurityproject.org/featured-items/2012/the-strategic-context-of-lethal-drones-a-framework-for-discussion/\" title=\"\">The Strategic Context of Lethal Drones</a> for the American Security Project, this, too, is more complex than some have assumed. The use of force against countries in peacetime, as they point out, is governed by Article 51 of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/\" title=\"\">UN Charter</a>. This permits \"the right of individual or collective defence\" across borders in peacetime if either one of two requirements is satisfied: that the group or individuals being targeted poses a threat or if the country, where the strike takes place, \"consents\". While Pakistan has complained that drone strikes \"infringe its sovereignty\", strong evidence exists that suggests it is heavily involved in providing the intelligence and other participation for strikes.</p> <p>A case can be made too that drones might be \"more ethical\" than other older systems because they can be more discriminate, lingering over their target for hours or returning for days to the location, giving those authorising the operations the opportunity to minimise noncombatant casualties.</p> <p>Paradoxically, it is precisely because of this potential for discrimination, in the context of the execution of the US drone war, that their use has become more morally problematic because it brings us back to the subject of intent, not least in the way in which the US has drawn up its \"kill lists\" and in its definition of when civilian casualties are acceptable and how those casualties are counted. When Thomas Aquinas condoned killing in self-defence, he defined the moral \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/euthanasia/overview/doubleeffect.shtml\" title=\"\">doctrine of double effect</a>\", a key concept in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/war/just/what.shtml\" title=\"\">Just War </a>theory from Francisco de Vitoria in the 16th century to Michael Walzer in the modern era.</p> <p>In this context, it sets the killing of civilians, or the risk of killing them, as \"a bad effect\" against what might be viewed as moral within the bounds of self-defence. For while there are very few who would try to deny that a militant threat exists in areas where strikes take place, the central issue comes down to how those combatants are identified and what efforts are being made to protect civilians. One of the most shocking disclosures about the details of Obama's decision-making process is the use of the definition \"militant\" for all males of military age within a drone strike zone, regardless of whether they are combatants or not.</p> <p>This definition is a deliberate evasion of the moral responsibility supposed to be built into the targeting process. Add to that the often wild vagaries of the US intelligence that nominates the list of those who pose an alleged threat, failures of which I witnessed on many occasions in Iraq, and it seems certain that there have been strikes, perhaps many, which have been unjustifiable in their civilian death toll.</p> <p>If there is a final compelling question to be asked over the future of drone warfare, it is the one posed by Foust and Boyle who demanded whether, as a military tool, drone warfare is actually effective; whether its use is justified when set against the political fallout that the drone campaign has produced and whether drones have actually reduced the threat posed by militants.</p> <p>Without clarity on these issues \u2013 that the drone campaign is operated within a real, clear and publicly defensible moral framework and serves a quantifiable defence purpose \u2013 the questions about drones will only get louder and more insistent.</p> <p>Comments will be swtiched on at 11am</p>",
  "<p>It's important to note that the Rochelle Canteen in Shoreditch is open to anyone who fancies a good lunch. But eating there does make you feel like you're in on a secret. To get there, you turn off Shoreditch High Street, and stroll past Leila's Deli, purveyors of good coffee and excellent cheese, until you reach Arnold Circus, home of the magnificent Boundary Estate. At this point, if you are a first timer, you will feel a little anxious, there being no hint of a sign, much less of a table. Do not despair. Walk confidently towards the Victorian school at the Circus's far side. In a brick wall is set a door. \"BOYS\", it says above it. You have arrived. Ring the bell, and the door will swing open. The restaurant is in the old bike shed. Personally, I recommend the samphire with brown shrimp. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.arnoldandhenderson.com/4-rochelle_canteen.html\" title=\"\">The Rochelle Canteen</a> began its life, as the name suggests, as a cafeteria: a dining room for the artists and creative types who rent space in the converted Rochelle School. It's a white rectangle, in essence, kitchen at one end, dining room \u2013 wipe-clean tables, vintage Ercol chairs, Shaker pegs on which dangle three battered sunhats \u2013 at the other. As a legacy of this, it has no licence, and is open only on weekday lunchtimes. But in every other way, it has evolved into a serious restaurant. \"It's amazing, isn't it?\" says its co-owner, Margot Henderson, with a slightly startled air. \"It's a proper place. I mean\u2026 the kitchen is really strong.\" A pause for contemplation, and then: \"Are you going to have pudding? I think you should. James [Ferguson, the Canteen's chef] is fantastic at tarts.\" </p> <p>Henderson came here eight years ago \u2013 although she is vague about dates \u2013 with her business partner Melanie Arnold; mostly, they needed a base, not to mention a kitchen, for their catering company, <a href=\"http://www.arnoldandhenderson.com/\" title=\"\">Arnold &amp; Henderson</a>. So it still surprises her when she sees it as it is today, brisk and noisy, customers continuing to arrive as late as 3pm. Do not, though, mistake mild amazement for a lack of ambition. Henderson is warm, funny, clever, enthusiastic and slightly eccentric. But she is also, I think, highly competitive and quite tough. Ask her how she felt when her husband, Fergus Henderson, left the French House Dining Room, the tiny Soho restaurant where they cooked together, to set up St John and she will tell you, no messing. \"Was I envious? Yeah! I was really envious. I went kind of mental. I thought: something's gone wrong here. I was rolling along and then suddenly, it was: there's no room for you, you're having a baby.\" Her voice rises at the continuing outrage of a crime committed more than 15 years ago. </p> <p>Has she forgiven Fergus? Yes. But her magnanimity must have been made easier by her own victories in the years since: the acclaim the Rochelle Canteen has received; the swanky client list she and Mel have built (Alexander McQueen, the Gagosian Gallery, Zaha Hadid). Even better, she has now written a cookbook so brilliant it already feels like a classic to rival Fergus's<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780747572572\" title=\"Nose to Tail Eating\"><em>Nose to Tail Eating</em></a>. \"Are you serious?\" she asks. Apparently, it was agony to write. \"I tried to give the money [the publisher's advance] back at one point. I shouldn't have worried. I should have just done it. But I just kept putting it off, and then I would lose the thread.\" </p> <p>Unlike most new cookbooks, <em>You're All Invited</em> isn't desperately trying to take up a position. There are no earnest lectures about seasonality, no dreary outbreaks of solidarity with hard-pressed working women. Her introductions to each recipe are witty, but minimalist. \"White food is so chic,\" she says simply, before telling you how to make brandade. You could say it's a life's work in 300 pages: a load of reliable things that are easy to make and delicious to eat from salt cod and potato bake (the first dish she ever made for Fergus), to cabbage and truffle spaghetti (the first dish he made for her), to a Turkish coffee cake that is unlike anything I've come across (cinnamon, coriander, wholemeal flour). Plus, the odd cocktail \u2013 because she and Fergus do love a drink. </p> <p>When I say it's the result of a life's work, I mean it. Henderson's mother was a journalist who wrote a series of books about eating out in their native New Zealand, so Margot went to posh French restaurants \u2013 the kind, as she points out, that had carpets \u2013 from an early age. \"I always adored them.\" Her mother, though, had also fallen in love with the teachings of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayelord_Hauser\" title=\"Dr Gayelord Hauser\">Dr Gayelord Hauser</a>, the American nutritionist, with the result that she had thrown out anything refined and white; her children endured cider vinegar and honey in place of cordial. \"So, when I was 10, I started catering for my younger brothers. I said: they just can't have bran biscuits for their birthdays.\"</p> <p>The first recipe she tried was the ginger crunch from the <em>Edmonds Cookery Book</em>, the New Zealand household bible.<br>And then there were the snails. \"I was about eight or nine. We were studying France at school. So we took all the snails from the garden. We drowned them, and then we fried them up with breadcrumbs. I thought they were delicious. After that, I was always rustling up snails for my parents' dinner parties, which was quite funny in Wellington. Or anywhere. <em>My</em> children wouldn't cook snails. I think I just wanted to be different.\" </p> <p>She went to university to read English, but lasted \"about two seconds\u2026 I just hated the discussions. I got really annoyed with everyone, waffling on\". She left, and worked in a Mexican cantina \u2013 a place emphatically without carpets \u2013 to save up and come to London. \"I'd fallen in love [with a boy who'd come to England], and we were all obsessed by London and the <em>Face</em> magazine then.\" There followed stints in bedsit London and then Australia \u2013 and that was when she got really serious about cooking, following Stephanie Alexander, the great Australian cook, and working in a slick Sydney brasserie. <br>\"Then I came back to England. I missed it, and I needed a man. Everyone in Australia was gay; I kept falling in love with gay men. That's a bit of a problem with me.\" She laughs, delightedly. \"I had this rice ball business. I cooked 50 kilos of rice every day in my flat, and made them into balls with carrots and stuff, and then I deep-fried them. Basically, it was bad food for macrobiotics.\"</p> <p>But then, in a single afternoon, everything changed. \"I'd bought this new dress, and I was feeling quite good. When I walked past 192 [the Notting Hill restaurant name-checked in <em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em>], I thought: I want to work there. So I went in. They said I could start Monday.\" </p> <p>This was the beginning of a career that left Henderson with a CV that pretty much tells the story of all that was hip and delicious in 90s London. 192 was followed by the First Floor Restaurant nearby (Peter Gordon, soon to open his Sugar Club, was a colleague), and the Quality Chop House and the Eagle in Clerkenwell. It was at the Eagle that she met Fergus. He came to one of their sprawling Sunday lunches. \"I thought he was an incredibly sweet man. I wasn't used to that.\" Soon afterwards, they met to discuss the idea of opening a restaurant together (Fergus was working in the Globe, a Notting Hill nightclub frequented by Lucian Freud). \"He was so lovely. He let me talk about coriander, and everything. It went really well, and by the end of the weekend we were a couple. Within a fortnight, he was telling me what we were going to eat at our wedding \u2013 a salt cod feast \u2013 and within a month, he'd asked me to marry him.\" Did they go with the salt cod in the end? \"No, we made cassoulet, for 300 people.\" </p> <p>In 1992, they opened the French House Dining Room, above the French House pub in Soho. She pulls a face. \"But, of course, Fergus left quite quickly to open his big restaurant, so leading to years of bitterness, which I might just be coming out of.\" She stayed on; the French House, being so small, was a good restaurant for a woman who wanted to have children (they have three teenagers), and the team was close enough that they would tolerate the odd toddler. But it was hard, watching Fergus build his reputation \u2013 and she was so tired. \"I was exhausted. If I could get through a night without crying, it was a miracle. It was a difficult situation. Half of me wanted to work, the other half wanted to be with the children. But Fergus also put up with a lot. You mustn't forget that I was completely in awe of Fergus. I was a groupie! I remember we had these quails. I was going to bone them all out \u2013 very efficiently, of course \u2013 and he said to me: oh, we'll cook them whole. The way he changed me was really exciting. I was going towards that way of cooking, but he tipped me over.\" </p> <p>She didn't choose to leave the French House; she and Mel (who replaced Fergus as her business partner, and who has three children herself) were eventually given their marching orders by the landlord after several happy years. But still: what does her experience say about why there are still so few women chefs? \"It's a difficult question. I mean, why are there not more women doing all sorts of things? Children, obviously. I think, too, that it's hard to battle away from doing pastry \u2013 not that there's anything wrong with pastry. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/15/restaurants-war-on-garnish-jay-rayner\" title=\"And tweezers! Men love all that stuff\">And tweezers! Men love all that stuff</a>. Maybe a hot, fiery kitchen, throwing out tons of food, full of men is intimidating. But I loved it when I was younger. Flirting with the boys all day long! It was great.\" </p> <p>She and Fergus have had their troubles. He has Parkinson's disease, though things have improved wondrously since, six years ago, he underwent deep brain stimulation (wires were implanted in his brain, enabling certain electrical signals from it to be blocked, thus helping to control his tremors). \"It is a miracle,\" she says. \"When you think that, before, he was moving all the time. We went to a Japanese restaurant, and he couldn't get the food into his mouth. I said: 'Well, I could feed you. That would be quite sexy.' That was the only time he ever got cross. But that would never happen now.\" Fergus is adorably equable \u2013 or that is how he has always seemed to me. \"Yes. He never complains. I envy that. I'm really moany. I've never heard him say: 'I'm sick of this.' I've never even heard him mention Parkinson's. He's incredible.\" </p> <p>But you feel, too, that they are truly partners; her book is dedicated to Fergus, and he is one of the threads that run through it (the others being her mother, and her mother-in-law, excellent cooks, both). And now her children are growing up, the search is on for a site for a new restaurant. Does this mean the Rochelle Canteen will close? I feel, polishing off a quince and almond tart, slightly panicky at the thought. \"Oh, no,\" she says. \"We love it here. But it would be nice to have a place that was open for dinner and weekends. I mean, that's what normal restaurants do, isn't it? Dinner, weekends\u2026\" She hoots with laughter, though whether at the barminess of the present regime, or in expectation of the mayhem that lies ahead, I can't quite tell.</p>",
  "<p>Benedict Cumberbatch, star of <em>Sherlock</em>, has talked about posh-bashing in the UK. He apparently complains of being \"castigated as a moaning, rich public school bastard\", saying the whole thing makes him want to move to the States. Well, if that's what he really means, fine, see you later, posh boy. Do one!</p> <p>I suppose that last bit marks me out as a posh-basher. Along with about a trillion previous offences. What the hell, I admit it: I'm a posh-basher. Should I join posh-bashers anonymous? Is it time I controlled my baser instincts? Even admit to being a hypocrite, seeing as it was a lifetime ago that I was living in a squat, using bin liners for wallpaper?</p> <p>I've long been uncomfortably aware that my posh-bashing rests somewhere between a hobby, a hastily cobbled-together political stance and a state of mild psychosis, which makes me normal in some parts of the UK.</p> <p>This is what Cumberbatch has stumbled into, perhaps innocently, but still rather impetuously. What he must understand is that, for many Britons, posh-bashing isn't a problem \u2013 it's a fundamental human right. If we had a constitution, it'd have to be written into it.</p> <p>There lies the rub. Even if posh-bashing is technically a hate crime, no one cares much. \"Oh dear, have you been <em>cas-ti-gated</em> for being posh? Have they forced you to play a toff again? Poor you, I'm going to cry.\" It might not be pretty, but this attitude is embedded in the Brit DNA, and for good reason. Mocking the posh and smirking about silver spoons rammed into gobs is a comic artform honed by the masses as a response to centuries of oppression. Unlike chav-baiting, which was pure bullying, posh-bashing is part of an instinctive protest against inequality that lies at the very core of sociopolitical emancipation.</p> <p>It's also a hoot. Executed properly, without malice, posh-bashing is screamingly funny, the most bloodless of blood sports. \"We're just metaphorically knocking the boaters off your heads, chaps, all good knockabout fun \u2013 don't go taking it to heart!\"</p> <p>What's odd is that increasingly the posh-bashed are complaining and sulking, which is simply not the right way to handle it. The correct, the only, response is to laugh along, conceding that, yes, you were born into fortunate circumstances, but this doesn't automatically mean that you are a painful buffoon, without an ounce of self-awareness.</p> <p>This is even more necessary now that we have an Eton-heavy, millionaire-stuffed cabinet, with legislation against the socially disadvantaged at an all-time high. And the gap between the haves and the have-nots is getting wider by the second. Which brings us to the only really important point about the ethics of posh-bashing. While I'm sure it can get a bit tiresome, all things considered, aren't they getting off lightly?</p> <p>Which would they prefer \u2013 the current culture of mild piss-taking or a full-on bloody revolution, at least a full-on socioeconomic overhaul? Indeed, in defence of those who practise posh-bashing, perhaps they should be given a little credit for their restraint, commended for the fact that, faced with social injustice that isn't likely to change in the near future, their main indulgence is a bit of light teasing.</p> <p>Put like that, the idea that posh-bashing has \"gone too far!\" looks nonsensical. Arguably, it hasn't gone far enough.</p> <p>Put it this way: do any posh people look around, in the year 2012, and sincerely think that it's them getting the pounding? Perhaps Cumberbatch should think about that the next time he's throwing a strop and fantasising about running away to America (where he can get typecast as a Bond villain instead?).</p> <p>He's a good actor, highly valued and if the only thing he's got to worry about is the occasional raspberry from the cheap seats, he's winning. Suck it up, Benedict, there's a good chap.</p> <h2>I'm through my A-levels. Result!</h2> <p>May I give heartfelt thanks to the universe for the fact that, for the first time in three years, I am in no way parentally involved with A-level results or clearing. Every year, the media depict the pupils whooping or weeping. They're the only ones who count \u2013 the young and the beautiful. No one takes pictures of the parents slumped, grey-faced and beaten in chairs, with a phone clamped to each ear, trying to get through to universities' clearing lines so that their progeny can discuss whether they have good enough grades for a BA hons in sociology and nail varnish.</p> <p>If you think that sounds like a course not worth considering, believe me, anything starts sounding promising after seven hours on the phone, ankle-deep in newspaper clearing supplements and upturned coffee mugs, not to mention creeping existential dread.</p> <p>I have mused before that clearing could be the wake-up call some teenagers need, but that doesn't mean I think their poor parents should have to go through it.</p> <p>There were bigger issues this year, not least a slump in applicant figures, because of the disgraceful fee rises. Get me another time and I will foam at the mouth with the best of them about the unfairness of it all \u2013 the cynical betrayal of a generation.</p> <p>However, just for one week, on an entirely selfish level, some of us are pathetically grateful to throw away the dreaded clearing supplements, even to the point of childishly flicking Vs and yelling: \"So long, suckers!\" as they disappear into the bin.</p> <p>Commiserations to the hundreds of thousands not so fortunate and still waiting to hear their fate. However, I earned this bad attitude and I intend to enjoy it.</p> <h2>Never mind him \u2013 it's the new Mrs Cleese I fear for</h2> <p>John Cleese has married for the fourth time, to jewellery designer <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9470746/John-Cleese-marries-for-the-fourth-time.html\" title=\"\">Jennifer Wade</a>, who's 31 years his junior.</p> <p>The consensus seems to be that, even with a prenup in place, he's taking a \"big risk\" marrying again.</p> <p>What about the risks his new wife is taking? Should it all go wrong, she risks him embarking on another \"alimony tour\", as he did after his $20m divorce from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/23/catherine-bennett-john-cleese-divorce\" title=\"\">Alyce Faye Eichelberger</a>.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>It is a clash involving three of the titans of Shakespearean acting, in a theatrical year dominated by the works of the Bard. Dame Janet Suzman, who has played an extensive range of leading parts in Shakespeare's dramas, has launched an outspoken attack on her fellow Shakespearean actors Sir Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance for giving succour to \"conspiracy theories\" that the world's most famous playwright was not the sole author of his works.</p> <p>Doubts about Shakespeare's authorship have been voiced for more than 150 years, with the usual suspects including Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. Last year the film <em>Anonymous</em> portrayed the Bard as a drunken, inarticulate buffoon and Oxford as the genius behind <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Macbeth </em>and <em>King Lear</em>.</p> <p>Rylance, who is currently performing in <em>Richard III</em> at London's Globe theatre, has appeared to support the theory that the earl may have been the real author of the plays, citing his familiarity with Italy, where he travelled widely: \"The big thing in his favour is this extraordinary visit to Italy,\" said Rylance last year. \"You would expect a playwright who set 14 of 37 plays in Italy to have been there, and the knowledge is exact.\"</p> <p>Then, in a talk in June, Jacobi said the earl was the real author, choosing to conceal his identity to escape the wrath of the authorities. \"I believe the man from Stratford-upon-Avon, known as Shakespeare, became the frontman for \u2026 the 17th Earl of Oxford. The simple fact is the earl could not be seen as a common playwright. He was living in a Stasi-type London.\"</p> <p>Suzman takes on \"the Oxfordians\" in a book published by Oberon books this summer entitled <em>Not Hamlet</em>. Although the work mainly deals with the treatment of women in theatre, she also devotes a chapter to the authorship question and \"conspiracy theories\".</p> <p>She accuses film producers Sony of \"wasting their money\" on <em>Anonymous</em> \u2013 the cast of which included both actors \u2013 calling the production \"a far-fetched film \u2026 [with] no facts to back it up\".</p> <p>Suzman told the <em>Observer</em> she felt the time had come to kill off the Shakespeare myths once and for all. \"I suddenly got mad as a snake about it,\" she said last week. \"I realised that so much energy and time is spent on this complete smoke-and-mirrors myth. It annoyed me\u2026 I suddenly felt like Joan of Arc riding into battle.\"</p> <p>In the book she writes: \"You have to be a conspiracy theorist to imagine the earl secretly wrote 37 plays, performed and printed over a quarter of a century, without being found out. And you have to be a snob if you just hate it that the greatest poet the world has produced was born into the humble aldermanic classes of a provincial town.\"</p> <p>It is absurd, she adds, to take the view that \"only an aristocrat can enter the soul of a king, or that only a university-trained mind can display such a ready wit. How strange it is that Jacobi and Rylance, hundreds of years later, with their outstanding acting instincts, should embrace such a haughty view of the man who has made them as big as they are \u2026 Common sense might not come amiss \u2026 I keep wondering exactly when their own professional experience went flying out the window, and why?</p> <p>\"We have seen a dozen times how thrillingly they themselves can conjure up fantastical character studies of fictional persons \u2013 without ever having been crowned king or murdered a rival in real life. It's what actors do for heaven's sakes, and Shakespeare was one too. It's called imagination.\"</p> <p>Suzman speaks with the authority of one of the country's greatest Shakespearean actresses. She was born in Johannesburg but trained in Britain and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company for its inaugural season, later delighting audiences as Kate in <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> and as Ophelia in <em>Hamlet</em>. Her films include <em>Nicholas and Alexandra</em>, for which she received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations.</p> <p>Discussing the reasons for Oxford's \"coronation\", she addresses his travels: \"For your Oxfordian, it's impossible for a writer to conjure up another world in the imagination, he has to have been there, which for a start puts the entire range of science fiction into the rubbish bin \u2026 Oxfordians require topographical accuracy. The metaphor of the plays is quite beside the point to this lot.\"</p> <p>She also points to evidence that Shakespeare's schooling would have been equivalent to today's university.</p> <p>Stanley Wells, a Shakespearean scholar, said: \"Good for Janet \u2026 At the [Shakespeare Birthplace] Trust, we have been fighting a vigorous campaign, sparked off in part by the silly film <em>Anonymous</em> \u2026 It's all a result of ignorance, especially of the Elizabethan educational system and of Shakespeare's background in general, of snobbery and of a kind of petulant form of self-advertisement.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Rylance said he did not just promote the Oxfordian case. Jacobi was unavailable for comment.</p>",
  "<p>As it did for Team GB, this summer should have triggered a gold rush for JJB Sports. But instead executives at its Wigan headquarters are wondering if the chain's 40-year career on the high street is finally over.</p> <p>Last week, hopes for the struggling retailer faded further after US giant Dick's Sporting Goods, which had looked as though it might ride to the rescue, distanced itself from JJB, writing down the value of its \u00a320m investment in the company \u2013 made just four months ago \u2013 to zero.</p> <p>When that cash injection was announced in April, the agreement included the possibility of more funds. But in updating Dick's shareholders last week, chief executive Edward Stack was clear: \"We have no further funding obligation to JJB at this time and will continue to monitor the situation.\"</p> <p>This apparent change of heart had a dramatic effect on JJB's already battered share price: it closed the week down 30% at just 3.15p, valuing the company at around \u00a313m. When it last updated shareholders in July, JJB's then chief executive, Keith Jones, blamed poor sales of England shirts during the Euro 2012 tournament for a dire performance that meant it would have to put the brakes on much-needed store refurbishments and ask shareholders for more cash soon.</p> <p>But JJB has got the begging bowl out four times in as many years, and the cash-hungry business has burned through more than \u00a3200m raised from investors while a succession of management teams has showed little sign of effecting a turnaround.</p> <p>While JJB has been self-destructing, rivals have got stronger. \"Sports Direct stands for value; JD stands for fashion; and JJB stands for nothing,\" says one supplier. \"The people who have been managing JJB haven't come from a sportswear background and don't empathise or understand the customer. Now JJB's not the cheapest and it's not cool\u2026 it's not very good at anything.\"</p> <p>JJB has only survived a series of financial crunches thanks to the largesse of a small group of investors and its landlords, who have endured two company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) \u2013 legal agreements that enable struggling retailers to slash their rent costs. The fundraisings, including the one in April, garnered support from some of JJB's biggest shareholders: Invesco, Harris Associates, Crystal Amber and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The question is now, with still no sign of light at the end of the tunnel, whether they will throw more good money after bad.</p> <p>Insiders at JJB say talk of demise is premature, and that although recent trading has been poor, it has not breached its banking covenants: in July, JJB's bank debt stood at \u00a317.7m. But it has emerged that turnaround groups, such as Better Capital led by private equity tycoon Jon Moulton, are considering buying up its loans as a means of gaining control.</p> <p>\"As third parties put their hat into the ring to try and buy the group's debt, the story on JJB has gone from one of hope, given the backing of Dick's, to one of huge uncertainty again,\" says Singer analyst Matthew McEachran.</p> <p>If JJB were to fail, the list of buyers would perhaps be limited by competition concerns in what is still a close-knit sector. Those with long memories will remember the Office of Fair Trading's inquiry into the price-fixing of replica football shirts a decade ago, which landed many of the key players, including JJB, then the biggest name in the market, with multimillion-pound fines. Today JJB, with annual sales of \u00a3284.2m, is dwarfed by Sports Direct's turnover of \u00a31.8bn while number two player JD, another possible buyer, is grappling with a new charge \u2013 outdoor chain Blacks, which it took out of administration in January.</p> <p>The estimated \u00a38.5bn sports goods market appears to offer diminishing returns. In the 1990s and early part of this century, sportswear was a thriving sector thanks to its mass adoption as casualwear. But Sports Direct has annihilated the competition with its \"pile it high, sell it cheap\" approach, leaving niche stores and websites such as American Golf Discount Centre, Decathlon and Wiggle to carve up what's left.</p> <p>JJB has been riven by both internal and external battles. It has been unable to recover from the disastrous tenure of Chris Ronnie, chief executive between 2007 and 2009, who made a series of poor acquisitions that saddled it with debt. In April, Ronnie was charged with a series of offences relating to an alleged \u00a31m fraud at the retailer. Ronnie denies the charges.</p> <p>Analysts suggest the next test for JJB will be 29 September, when a big rent bill falls due. Dave Whelan, its founder, is keeping a watchful eye on his former charge. In 2009, he acquired its health club chain in a generous \u00a383m deal that bought JJB some time. \"I don't want it to go [into administration] and it would be sad for Wigan if it did go,\" he says. Although a fraction of its former size, the 180-store chain still employs more than 4,000 people.</p> <p>If JJB were to collapse, Whelan would be interested in buying \"certain aspects\" of it: \"I wouldn't be looking at the whole of JJB. There's quite a lot of things wrong and it's been badly run.\" But there is no reason why a sports shop \"run well\" shouldn't succeed, he says: sales in the gym shops, now called DW Sports Fitness, are up 15% \"purely on the back of the Olympics\".</p> <p>Following a recent visit to JJB's Wigan head office, the supplier left with a sense that it was all over: \"There seemed to be no fight, no leadership, no strategy.\" JJB has its own Olympic mascot in the shape of gold-medal-winning rower Sir Matthew Pinsent, who sits on its board. But there is little sign of Pinsent's sporting glory rubbing off on JJB.</p>",
  "<p>In her statement to a nobbled judge hearing <a href=\"http://chtodelat.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/yekaterina-samutsevich-closing-statement/\" title=\"\">a trumped-up charge before a kangaroo court, Yekaterina Samutsevich</a> explained why she had \"blasphemed\". The secular forces of oppression at Putin's disposal were not enough for him, she said with remarkable lucidity given her perilous circumstances. He wanted \"transcendental guarantees of his long tenure at the pinnacle of power\" too. The Orthodox church, \"associated with the heyday of imperial Russia, where power came not from earthly manifestations such as democratic elections and civil society, but from God Himself\", now gave credulous believers religious reasons to support the crime gang in the Kremlin.</p> <p>Pussy Riot had staged many protests. Revealingly, the security apparatus came for Samutsevich and her sisters after a 30-second stunt in Moscow's Christ the Saviour Cathedral. It hit a nerve by striking at Russia's union of church and state \u2013 of patriarch and oligarch \u2013 into a common reactionary front.</p> <p>\"Holy Mother, Blessed Virgin, chase Putin out,\" they sang. The Holy Mother remained as elusive as ever, but Kirill I, Patriarch of Moscow, is more than content to keep Putin's money launderers in the Temple. He has struck a deal. Putin offers the Orthodox church a partial restoration of its tsarist privileges: state aid for the restoration of churches the communists destroyed; and the return of priests to the schools and universities. Kirill returns the favour by making support for the Kremlin kleptomaniacs a quasi-religious duty. Everyone quotes his statement that Putin's rule was a \"miracle of God\". But they miss the hysterical assertion that before Putin's divine intervention Russia was in as bad a state as when the Nazis invaded in 1941. Those who protested against Putin's rigged election, continued Vsevolod Chaplin, spokesman for the Moscow patriarchate, were comparable to foreign agents. They were \"under the influence of puppet masters\" \u2013 manipulated and suspect.</p> <p>Russian Orthodoxy has always been a state religion. The communists persecuted believers, but the KGB found many collaborators in the church who were prepared to put obedience to established power first. For this reason, it is a mistake to dismiss Kirill's support for Putin as simple cynicism. He believes in autocracy and hates liberalism as much as his predecessors did and Putin does. That Kirill is liberalism's avowed enemy becomes clear from reading his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freedom-Responsibility-A-Search-Harmony/dp/0232528705\" title=\"\"><em>Freedom and Responsibility: A Search for Harmony</em></a>. If its Amazon ranking is a guide, hardly any English reader has glanced at it, which is a pity because although the cleric's arguments are drear when they are not repellent, they provide as a good an illustration as any of how opposition to human rights can be covered with smells and bells.</p> <p>\"The most fundamental conflict of our present era is the clash between the liberal mode of civilisation on the one hand and national culture and religious identity on the other,\" Kirill begins. To which one can only say that he is right and that he is also fighting for the wrong side. I must emphasise that by liberalism the patriarch does not mean rampant individualism but any human society that tolerates \"sin\" providing sinners \"remain within the law of land and do not harm others\". No charge is too wild to throw at such hell holes. \"The human rights concept is used to cover up lies, falsehood and insults against religion and national values,\" Kirill fumes. Secularism is diseased \u2013 \"infected with the bacillus of self-destruction\". Secular countries allow women to control their fertility and tolerate homosexuality. They are nominally free \"but defenceless against evil\".</p> <p>The cleric barely makes an effort to disguise how Russia's dark traditions of occidentalism and antisemistim have influenced his thought. Universal values are the product of a malign, alien ideology that comes from the western \"protestant\" theologians and \u2013 but, of course \u2013 \"Jewish philosophers\". The Orthodox church can accept liberalism in the far-off lands of Europe and North America. But in Russia they \"cannot stay silent when norms contradicting the foundation of the Orthodox faith are imposed on them\". This is the \"multi-polarism\" of Putin's foreign ministry in clerical vestments. Liberal standards have no place in Russia.</p> <p>As always, the trouble with cultural exceptionalism is that it has no honest way of arguing with members of that culture who want change. You can search Patriarch Kirill's writings in vain for any acknowledgement that Russians who protest against corruption or the denial of democratic rights or the crimes of the wars in the Caucasus have a case that deserves a hearing. They are just the tools of \"puppet masters\"; the propagators of the debased ideologies of \"protestant theologians\" and \"Jewish philosophers\".</p> <p>Kirill's writing reveals one of Russia's most sinister characteristics. A regime of former KGB officers and plutocrats is robbing the country blind, while the leadership of the national church supports the thieves and denounces their opponents.</p> <p>At least the patriarch has made it clear that he is liberalism's enemy. The great wet blanket that covers criticism of religion in democracies makes returning that enmity a struggle. Overpaid and undereducated commentators in the half-serious media denounce criticism of religion as a form of racism. So I suppose that before I am accused of possessing a phobia about Orthodoxy, I must add that Putin was able to count on the support of Russia's craven chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, who told him that because protests had taken place on Saturday (the Jewish sabbath) they were \"not a Jewish business\".</p> <p>The regime could also line up a procession of mullahs and lamas to support it. The toleration of tyranny is an ecumenical business in Russia. Nor does indulgence stop at Russia's borders. The English translation of Kirill's fulminations carries a foreword by Richard Chartres, the silly and faintly disgraceful Anglican Bishop of London. He offers no criticism of the patriarch. Instead, he praises his \"acute intelligence\".</p> <p>The most ignorant political insult of our time must be the charge of \"militant atheism\" that invariably follows the accusation of racism. What else is there to say about it? The Soviet communists who murdered Christians, Jews and Muslims were militant atheists. They persecuted others because of their beliefs. Who are the communists' successors today? If you do not know, I suggest that you direct your inquiries to Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich. After two years \"corrective labour\" in a \"penal colony\", they may be able to reply.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments for this will be turned on the morning</p>",
  "<p>There's rarely a moment when we don't have a chance to see our own reflection, whether it's in a computer screen, a train window, the back of a spoon or even by using front camera on a mobile phone.</p> <p>Yet, says a new band of bloggers, our fixation on monitoring our appearance in the reflective surfaces around us has become unhealthy. In a bid to stop obsessing over the way they look, they have started \"mirror-fasting\" \u2013 abstaining from looking at their reflection for anything from a month to a year.</p> <p>The trend started in the US when bloggers such as Autumn Whitefield-Madrano, a 36-year-old freelance writer based in Queens, New York, launched her <a href=\"http://www.the-beheld.com/p/month-without-mirrors.html\" title=\"\">blog The Beheld</a>. \"I'd become aware that I had a 'mirror face',\" she says. \"Whenever I saw my reflection I'd open my eyes a little wider, suck in my cheeks a little and tip my chin down in an effort to make myself look more like I wanted to. It made me feel really vain.\"</p> <p>She embarked on her first month-long mirror fast in May 2011, in an effort to become less self-conscious about her face. \"I didn't want to do it because I felt bad about myself per se \u2013 I was just concerned about how often I was thinking about my appearance. I wanted to see how much my mood was affected by the way I perceived my looks.\"</p> <p>At the end of the experiment, she reported feeling \"calmer and more serene\", although she admits her second month-long fast in July 2011 was more challenging. She now makes mirror-fasting an annual event: \"It's my way of checking in with myself, to remind myself that I don't need to know how I look every minute to be a fully functional, capable human being.\"</p> <p>Her fellow blogger, Kjerstin Gruys, a 29-year-old sociology graduate in San Francisco, mirror-fasted for 12 months in the runup to her wedding. She says shopping for her wedding dress \"triggered a renewed \u2013 and very unwelcome \u2013 sense of vain insecurity\" about her appearance. <a href=\"http://www.ayearwithoutmirrors.com/\" title=\"\">On her blog, Mirror Mirror</a> ... Off the Wall, she wrote: \"I felt ill at ease when reflecting on the dress situation. Was all that really necessary? Did my happiness over the dress outweigh the self-centred obsessing I had gone through to get it?\"</p> <p>As a result she avoided all reflective surfaces except for driving mirrors, and banned viewing photographs of herself. At the end of the experiment, she wrote: \"I've managed to better separate my looks from my self-esteem. This is probably the most powerful secret to feeling beautiful.\" She is now writing a book to be published by Avery, an imprint of Penguin Books, about the experience.</p> <p>A study, published in the journal <em>Behaviour Research and Therapy </em>earlier this year, found that British women stare in the mirror around 38 times every day and men 18 times a day.</p> <p>Dr Phillippa Diedrichs, a research psychologist at the Centre for Appearance Research in Bristol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/body-image-anxiety-eva-wiseman\" title=\"\">pinpoints an increased pressure in our society to look a certain way </a>as the reason why people go to extreme measures to avoid their own reflections. \"The appearance ideals we have today are unachievable for most people, so when people compare themselves to them they fall short and feel dissatisfied with the way they look.\"</p> <p>She believes, however, that \"mirror-fasting\" would not have a long-term positive impact on body image. \"When working with people who have issues around body image we actually encourage what we call 'mirror exposure technique' \u2013 the direct opposite of fasting,\" she says. \"We encourage people to look in the mirror and take a less critical approach to what they see and focus on the things they like.\"</p> <p>Kate Fox, a social anthropologist at the Social Issues Research Centre in Oxford, agrees the concept is not constructive: \"It's true that avoiding something in such a dramatic and drastic manner can only be temporarily liberating. It's throwing the issue of appearance into sharp relief in the same way that crash dieting often serves to make people obsess even more about food. To me, it smacks of narcissism more than looking in the mirror like a normal person.\"</p> <p>She also suggests that blogging about mirror-fasting is just another form of fixating on the issue of appearance. Whitefield-Madrano agrees: \"I suppose I became hyperaware of how I was feeling and I started to attribute every feeling to the experiment. When I did it the second time around and had a much harder time with it, I felt like, \"Oh wait, even the mirror-fast itself is a reflection of how I'm feeling.\"</p> <p>Still, the concept has struck a chord with readers. She says: \"We're now able to curate so much of our public image via social networking. I wonder if part of the reason this [mirror-fasting] speaks to people is because there's something appealing about giving up the ability to control our image in such a major way. When I've talked with people who quit Facebook they speak of it in terms similar to how I describe the mirror-fast: serenity, liberation, a feeling of knowing oneself and one's priorities better.\"</p>",

The degradation is due primarily to the activities of grouse-shooting estates.

  "<p>Imagine, for a moment, that a 58-year-old man of sound mind believes his existence is \"intolerable\" and wishes to take his own life. Unlike many people who consider suicide, he knows that his family supports him. He has not been diagnosed with depression and nor is it a spur-of-the-moment decision. Instead, this man has had seven years to think about it. He is absolutely sure he wants to die.</p> <p>Should he be prevented from doing so?</p> <p>For many of us, the response would be a resounding no. Since 1961, the law in this country has allowed an able-bodied person to take their own life without fear of prosecution if their attempt fails. It is correctly believed that each individual should be able to exercise autonomy over their own life.</p> <p>Such a right forms the basis of liberal thinking; the belief articulated by John Stuart Mill that the only defence for exercising power \"over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\".</p> <p>But there is, it seems, an exception to that rule. And that exception is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/tony-nicklinson\" title=\"\">Tony Nicklinson</a>, who last week failed in his high court bid to be allowed to die. Mr Nicklinson, a 58-year-old father of two from Melksham, Wiltshire, has locked-in syndrome.</p> <p>A catastrophic stroke suffered while on a business trip to Athens in 2005 left him paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak. He requires 24-hour care, provided by his wife, Jane. Despite this corporeal prison, Mr Nicklinson's mind functions as normal.</p> <p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/23/tony-nicklinson-assisted-suicide-twitter-interview\" title=\"\">this newspaper in June</a>, conducted by Mr Nicklinson on Twitter using eye-recognition software, he summed up his life:</p> <p>\"Uncomfortable (6 hrs in chair without moving), undignified (being fed forever like a baby), demeaning (crying like a baby in front of carers), degrading (taking a dump while in a sling over a commode), wet (I dribble constantly when awake), foul taste (I sleep with mouth open so saliva dries).\"</p> <p>Mr Nicklinson's physical disability results in a double bind: it is impossible for him to commit suicide and yet any doctor or family member who helped fulfil his wishes would be in danger of prosecution.</p> <p>For the terminally ill, there have been recent moves to make the law more compassionate, but this does not help Mr Nicklinson. His situation might be terminal but his illness is not. He is, in effect, being discriminated against because of his physical disability.</p> <p>The three high court judges who released their judgment last week in response to Mr Nicklinson's legal challenge (mounted alongside a fellow sufferer of locked-in syndrome known only as Martin) admitted that both cases were \"deeply moving\", but that ruling in their favour would result in a major change in the law and exceed the power of the courts.</p> <p>According to Lord Justice Toulson: \"These are matters for Parliament to decide.\"</p> <p>This is a complex and emotive issue, but it is one from which we, as a society, should not shirk. Mr Nicklinson's case might seem extreme but advances in medical science and increases in life expectancy mean that all of us could face similar quandaries, either for ourselves or our loved ones in the future.</p> <p>Indeed, public support for assisted dying is high: the 2010 British Social Attitudes survey showed that 82% believed that a doctor should \"probably\" or \"definitely\" be allowed to end the life of a patient with a painful, incurable disease at the patient's request.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are many who oppose Mr Nicklinson's position through a genuinely held fear that any change in the law giving doctors the power to kill would endanger the elderly or the disabled.</p> <p>But it cannot be beyond the realms of feasibility for Parliament to enshrine a law with sufficiently high safeguards that would protect the vulnerable or as, Mill expressed it, \"to prevent harm to others\".</p> <p>In his <em>Observer</em> interview, Mr Nicklinson commented: \"Intelligent people who can work out how the universe began [should be able] to devise a few simple rules so that those who need protection get it while those like me get assistance\u2026 I thought the law was there to serve the people, not vice versa\".</p> <p>Our politicians must now confront this challenge head on. The law should treat Mr Nicklinson as it would treat anyone without physical impairment. To prolong his anguish seems unnecessary.</p> <p>It also seems unjust.</p> <p>Comments will be switched on at 11am</p>",
  "<p>Today is <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/humanitarianday/\" title=\"\">World Humanitarian Day</a>. It marks the anniversary of the day on which S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, the special representative of the secretary-general to Iraq, and 21 colleagues were killed by a massive car-bomb attack on the UN headquarters in Baghdad. It is a day to pay tribute to all humanitarian personnel who have lost their lives in the line of duty and to all those who continue to take risks to relieve the suffering of the less fortunate.</p> <p>The Canal Hotel bombing, as it became known, irreversibly changed the security situation in which humanitarian aid workers operate. In the past, aid workers were respected, not targeted. The flags and emblems of humanitarian organisations that traditionally provided a shield for aid workers are now turning them into potential targets.</p> <p>Humanitarian work is one of the world's most dangerous professions. Kidnappings, shootings and death threats are all part of the job description in places such as Sudan, Syria, Somalia and others blighted by conflict. Those who work in this rocky terrain are increasingly exposed to risk while maintaining a lifeline to the victims of wars and disasters.</p> <p>It is self-evidently unacceptable that they are subject to harassment, abduction or even plain murder while serving humanity.</p> <p>Attacks on humanitarian posts have tripled in the last decade. Since 2011, 109 humanitarian workers have been killed, 143 others were wounded and 132 have been kidnapped, according to the United Nations. Crimes against unarmed civilians are never justified. When these crimes are committed against people who dedicate their lives to saving others, the injustice is ever more apparent.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it's important to remember that the overwhelming majority of these victims are not international aid workers from western countries, but those serving in their own country, working closest to the local population. Humanitarian aid is not the preserve of the west but a global imperative. The many national aid workers who have made the ultimate sacrifice bear witness to this.</p> <p>Over the last 12 months, Syria has become a killing ground. Six humanitarian aid workers have been killed since the beginning of this year, all of them Syrian staff. In two cases, it is alleged that the victims, both from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, were deliberately targeted. As with the shooting at ambulances, the misuse of hospitals and the shelling of civilians, these are direct violations of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The safety and security of aid workers are directly linked to safe access to vulnerable populations and the sustainable delivery of assistance. The violence committed against aid workers also affects those they are helping. Thousands of vulnerable people can be left without essential support if aid is suspended or closed due to insecurity.</p> <p>Humanitarian principles and international legal frameworks offer a degree of formal protection but only if and when they are observed and respected. Sadly, the conditions in which humanitarian workers operate are growing more dangerous every year.</p> <p>Humanitarians draw the world closer together by reminding us that we are one family, sharing the same dreams for a peaceful planet, where all people can live in safety and with dignity.</p> <p>This is also a day to examine our lives and consider what more we can do to help \u2013 to reach out to people enduring conflict, disaster and hardship.&#xa0; Let those we honour today inspire us to start our own journey to make the world a better place and bring our human family more closely together.</p>",
  "<p>There used to be a time when Italy's super-rich gravitated to the smartest enclaves of Sardinia for a summer of relaxation and luxury. Not any more. In an increasingly austerity-conscious country, the yacht-owning classes are coming under increasing and unwelcome scrutiny, some of which would not look out of place in a scene from the film <em>Apocalypse Now</em>.</p> <p>\"We first spotted the targets with the helicopter's radar and closed in to identify about 50 boats off the two islands,\" said Italian coastguard captain Pietro Mele, describing a recent raid on yachts suspected of straying too close to the coast. Swooping in, the helicopter crew barked orders to the plush pleasure craft through a loudspeaker, telling them to move on from the protected Sardinian islands of Soffi and Mortorio, where anchoring is strictly forbidden.</p> <p>It was hardly an act of war, but the tough measures have been enough to spark a furious reaction from royalty, actors and entrepreneurs who keep their yachts on the nearby Costa Smeralda and are now threatening to move on to Corsica or France's C\u00f4te d'Azur.</p> <p>\"These helicopter raids are a huge problem and many yachts won't be back to Sardinia any time soon,\" said Roberto Azzi, who runs a rental agency called Emerald Yachts.</p> <p>The helicopter raids top a terrible summer for Italy's upmarket sailors, who have suffered regular visits from tax inspectors instituting prime minister Mario Monti's crackdown on tax avoidance. \"We are 30% down this season,\" complained Azzi.</p> <p>The two islands have long been favourite spots for boats heading out from the swish port of Porto Rotondo, which is popular with rich Italians, Russian magnates and Arab sheikhs. Among those up in arms about being turfed out were German and Italian princes, as well as former Formu la 1 racing driver Alessandro Nannini. \"Yachtsmen pass the word around and get out before the checks start,\" he told <em>Corriere della Sera</em>. \"But that's got to stop. Something has to change, or I am not going back.\"</p> <p>Azzi admitted that the islands have long been officially out of bounds, but the boats had flocked there anyway. \"And now, with the crisis on, they go and send in a helicopter? The rules are arbitrary and there are 2,000 people employed in the business here who stand to lose their jobs if the yachts flee.</p> <p>\"The anchoring damages the sea grass, but there is a group who ignore the ban,\" responded a spokesman for the Maddalena archipelago national park, which manages the islands.</p> <p>\"They know the rules, but we are in Italy; they are on holiday,\" said Mele, who broadcast the message, \"You are in a forbidden area, please move on,\" from the coastguard helicopter to the sunbathing tycoons. \"Unfortunately some thought we would go away and did not move, so we sent a patrol vessel in as well,\" he said.</p> <p>The Sardinian coastguard have a reputation for fearing no one. Last summer Steven Spielberg was fined for sailing too close to a Sardinian beach with his engines on.</p> <p>Azzi said that the helicopter raid was not the only way Italian law enforcers were managing to upset the rich this summer. \"Since the sinking of the cruise ship Costa Concordia, there has been a ban on cruise ships sailing too close to protected areas,\" he said.</p> <p>The problem, he added, is that police have been confusing mega-yachts with cruise ships and harassing billionaires as they lie at anchor in a beauty spot: \"They ordered Roman Abramovich's yacht to retreat from the Costa Smeralda and return to Porto Fino.\"</p> <p>As the mega-yachts sailed by the wealthy Russians fall foul of the law, the smaller motorboats run by Italians are proving a magnet for tax police inspectors who are sent out by the Monti government to crack down on tax dodgers and raise crucial funds for Italy's battered balance sheet. \"We are in a state of war\" against tax evasion, Monti warned on Friday.</p> <p>With owners of large motor boats who declare suspiciously low incomes coming under special scrutiny, a growing number are claiming that their boats have sunk and are putting in insurance claims, said Ugo Vittori, the head of investigative agency Eagle Keeper.</p> <p>\"Sinkings need to happen in deep water, for example off the Puglian coast and near the Tuscan Formiche islands,\" he said. \"The owners say it was a miracle they survived and we send down a robot sub to find the boat, but it often turns out they have been sold in Miami or Martinique,\" he added.</p> <p>After tax inspectors swept through the Alpine resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo this winter, ostenstatious displays of wealth have fallen out of fashion this summer and people are rediscovering mountain walking, wrote Italian daily <em>La Stampa</em>.</p> <p>Motor racing tycoon Flavio Briatore has even threatened to close down Billionaire, his Costa Smeralda nightclub frequented by Naomi Campbell and Silvio Berlusconi, claiming: \"Italy is now a country where, if you own a yacht and tie up in port, you are either a bandit or a thief.\"</p>",

Amid all the Olympics hoo-ha and the usual summer silliness (David Cameron's choice of beach shoe? Really?), the big day of one of the BBC's most consistently successful digital offerings has been slightly overlooked. Its 10th birthday celebrations seem to be taking place in a separate soundproofed room set aside for potentially messy get-togethers. Not in the mainstream, but&#xa0;apart.</p> <p>We could draw an analogy about urban music nights being forced into out-of-town venues, having to be held on Sundays because no club owner would host them on a Friday or Saturday\u2026 but, well, let's not. Because this is 1Xtra! The party's rocking! To the BBC's credit, a sample of 1Xtra's charms could be heard every morning this week on big-sister station Radio&#xa0;1 as smoothie Trevor Nelson took over Fearne Cotton's slot. And, ooh, he sounded goooood! The music was so much better it made you laugh, and Mr Relaxo Trevor was, as ever when it comes to radio, right at home. He was all wrong for guiding us through the Olympics opening ceremony. He is all right for effortless music radio.</p> <p>Still, Trevor was a strange choice for 1Xtra's 10th birthday. Great broadcaster that he is, he isn't really representative of what 1Xtra is about. Neither is its other mainstream star, Westwood \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/25/tim-westwood-xtra-drivetime-show\" title=\"\">until September</a> 1Xtra's drivetime DJ. (Thankfully, he's been retired from that slot. I'm not sure that the 16-24 target age group should be forced to listen to a 50-plus man making lecherous remarks to US singers in their early 20s\u2026 At least randy uncles save their \"friendly\" comments for special occasions. Westwood was like a dog on heat. Constant dribble. Never off your leg.)</p> <p>Anyway, 1Xtra is all about spotting and nurturing new talent, in both broadcasting and music. Mainstream British artists such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/tinie-tempah\" title=\"\">Tinie Tempah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/chipmunk\" title=\"\">Chipmunk</a>, Sean Paul, even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/n-dubz\" title=\"\">N-Dubz</a> owe much of their success to 1Xtra's early support. In fact, it's not a great leap to assert that the international success of UK music in the past few years has been partly down to the station: the grime-pop crossover that dominates today's charts was heavily promoted by 1Xtra.</p> <p>Broadcasters? Well, there's Sony&#xa0;silver-winning MistaJam, a man who works his nuts off to get a decent quote out of his guests (dance music aficionados aren't always, like, y'know, the best of, y'get me, speakers). MistaJam is an undoubted station success, as is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lgly2\" title=\"\">Dev</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/gemma-cairney-radio1-breakfast-dj\" title=\"\">Gemma Cairney</a>, who arrived a few years back like a burst of sunshine on to 1Xtra's breakfast show. She was paired with good old Trevor, and it worked brilliantly: her irrepressible daftness and enthusiasm ruffling Trev's feathers and giving him some energy.</p> <p>Now Cairney's a Radio 1 girl, on breakfast at the weekends. Plus, last Monday, turning in some fine presenting for <strong>Bruising Silence</strong>, a disturbing and affecting documentary about teenage domestic violence. The statistics are scary: the NSPCC estimates that 25% of teenage girls and 18% of boys will experience physical abuse within a so-called love relationship; and 33% of girls and 16% of boys will suffer sexual abuse.</p> <p>Cairney admitted that she herself had been in a violent relationship in her early teens \u2013 \"we wound each other up beyond control until he got violent on a regular basis\" \u2013 which she hid from everyone, including her mother. She spoke to her mum about it on the programme (\"I felt like I hadn't been able to protect you\"), as well as women in a safe house.</p> <p>But it was the straight-talking testimonies of young people barely into adulthood that were the hardest to hear: teenagers ending up in A&amp;E, being yelled at, controlled, even raped\u2026 An important subject tackled sensitively, and soundtracked with lovelorn pop hits such as Rihanna's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa14VNsdSYM\" title=\"\">Only Girl (in the World)</a> that took on a more sinister air in the context of the programme.</p> <p>For those who prefer their music clever and obscure, Stewart Lee took us through the higgledy-piggledy homemade beginnings of UK electronic music in <strong>A Sound British Adventure</strong>. I've heard a version of this story several times on Radio 4; Lee managed to make it seem fresh.</p> <p>And for those who prefer their music DJs silly, Nick Grimshaw and Scott Mills were hosting a live cabaret show from Edinburgh every night: Radio 1's <strong>Fun and Filth Cabaret</strong>. Not always radio-friendly (on Wednesday we had to have a live description of one act that was, essentially, hand-mime), but Grimmy's witty one-liners keep it all ticking over. Just.</p>",
  "<p>At the abrupt start of<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6LDkPycG54&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\"> <strong>The Makropulos Case</strong></a>, strings and wind hurtle into flight while the rest of the orchestra bustles and shoves like gossips elbowing for attention. Those few opening bars, gone in a flash, epitomise one aspect of Jan\u00e1cek's originality. He wanted to capture human conversation in music: choppy, aphoristic and elusive, with brief eloquence or bursts of poignant rhapsody. The harmonies are safely tonal, the impact raw and novel.</p> <p>Richard Farnes, conducting Opera North in the inaugural opera event of Edinburgh 2012, set an audacious pace, establishing the mood for the entire performance, at once febrile and assured. This new <em>Makropulos </em>was part of Edinburgh's \"celebration of the UK's opera companies\" (with WNO arriving later last week for a concert performance of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>). Presumably after devolution they'll just be foreign like everyone else. Whatever the fragile excuse, Tom Cairns's staging \u2013 designed by Hildegard Bechtler \u2013 more than honoured this high-profile slot.</p> <p>On first appearance, Jan\u00e1cek's late opera, a setting of a play by his contemporary Karel Capek, seems to be obsessed with the secret of youth. Emilia Marty, born Elena Makropulos and now a celebrated opera singer, was given age-defying medication as a young girl and now, more than 300 years later, is mentally paralysed by the boredom of eternal life. (\"300 years to be a filing clerk, 300 years to knit stockings,\" as Capek's original text reminds us.)</p> <p>The complicated plot, involving an unresolved law case, Emilia's several identities and a stream of past lovers, is really about learning how to die. The icy heroine melts into pathos only as the secret is revealed and the ageing process, at last, takes grip. In the title role, Yiva Kihlberg, whose biography reveals that she has also been an economist, ballet dancer and rock singer, had a handsome stage presence and performed well. Yet her voice lacked the rich inflections and suggestive power of a great \"EM\", to use the initials of the diva's ever-changing name. Anja Silja <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zrsx2dAjwU\" title=\"\">remains the ideal</a>.</p> <p>Cairns and Bechtler have updated the action to around 1960 while rooting it in the period of its creation \u2013 the mid-1920s \u2013 with a prototype Bauhaus look, which covers all temporal eventualities and echoes the time-shifting strangeness of the plot. By dividing the large stage into smaller areas the action had powerful focus: at first an open-plan lawyer's office, then on a crescent moon-shaped crimson velvet sofa backstage at the opera, then behind the voile drapes of a bed in Emilia Marty's hotel room, when the end is near. The lighting (by Bruno Poet), low-key and naturalistic, compounded the sense of veracity, moral if not actual, of this troubling opera.</p> <p>In a strong ensemble cast, Robert Hayward (Baron Prus), Mark Le Brocq (Vitek), Paul Nilon (Albert Gregor) and James Creswell (Dr Kolenaty) kept the fast-moving, high-lying vocal writing comprehensible. The text was sung in workable English, a good decision by Opera North, which sticks to the original language unless there are reasons not to \u2013 in this case few arias and dense, rapid dialogue, in Czech. The orchestra, with nowhere to hide in the theatre's exposed, front-of-stage \"pit\", played the tricky score with immense flair, which made any fluffs forgivable. The production is part of Opera North's autumn season <a href=\"http://www.operanorth.co.uk/productions/the-makropulos-case\" title=\"\">in Leeds and on tour</a>. But this month and next, catch their unmissable, life-enhancing, never-walk-alone <em>Carousel </em><a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/theatre/event-detail.asp?ID=12876\" title=\"\">at the Barbican</a>, until 15 September.</p> <p>The Queen's Hall series, for many the musical heart of the festival, opened on a high with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01lt0l7/Edinburgh_International_Festival_2012_Trio_Zimmermann/\" title=\"\"><strong>Trio Zimmermann</strong></a> in Schubert, Schoenberg and Mozart. Violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann, viola player Antoine Tamestit and cellist Christian Polt\u00e9ra spend most of their working lives as soloists, coming together as a string trio a couple of times each season. The benefits \u2013 technical prowess combined with collegiate familiarity \u2013 produce music making of an exciting, firebrand quality.</p> <p>The trio movement by Schubert, in B flat D471, in which musical ideas pass generously between instruments, offered serenity before the dark demands of Schoenberg's Op 45. The three instruments are required to abandon lyricism in favour of percussive gesture, from stabbing chords to using the wood of the bow. Hallucinatory harmonics and other ghostly, hushed effects make rigorous demands on players and listeners. Writing it after grave illness, Schoenberg agreed that the work was near impossible to play. The Trio Zimmermann proved him comprehensively wrong, before smiling again in Mozart's grand, six-movement Divertimento in E flat K563.</p> <p>Sadly for the London Philharmonic Orchestra, their Usher Hall concert was cancelled owing to a power cut. All lights, however, were blazing at the Royal Albert Hall, including the weird, intermittently changing coloured spaghetti worms on the panel behind the orchestra designed, I think, to illumine our listening. The fabulous <strong>BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra</strong>, conducted by Andrew Manze, played <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01lt276/BBC_Proms_2012_Season_Prom_46_Vaughan_Williams_Symphonies_Nos_5_and_6/\" title=\"\">three Vaughan Williams symphonies</a>. Once, the very idea would have emptied the place faster than a fire alarm. On Thursday the hall was packed.</p>",
  "<p>After something of a troubled path to market \u2013 originally a True Crime title, then cancelled, before switching publishers and gaining a new name \u2013 <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> escapes development hell and proves to be one of the best crime games in years.</p> <p>Playing as Chinese-American cop Wei Shen, the game sees players infiltrating an arm of the triad in Hong Kong. Cue some serious violence and dubious police work as you balance Wei's original mission with increasing power earned from escalating notoriety in the underworld. Completing objectives for each faction earns points to unlock skills unique to them, leading to some conflicting moral choices.</p> <p>Combat is a blend of fisticuffs and shooting, with plenty of vehicular action on the side. Though Wei's most common combos involve hammering the attack button, additional grapples, counters and finishers mix sorties up nicely. You'll soon be composing scenes right out of a John Woo movie, which, I suppose, is rather the point.</p> <p>The script and attendant voice acting is superb, bolstered by brilliant cut-scene animation with precise facial movements capturing the actors' performances. <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> is an outstanding romp through the seedy underbelly of one of the world's most vibrant cities \u2013 it's so good that the upcoming <em>GTA V</em> might have cause for concern.</p>",
  "<p>Considering the extraordinary levels of access that he's been granted both to interviewees and archive recordings, it would have been easy for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kevin-macdonald\" title=\"\">Kevin Macdonald</a>'s vibrantly exhaustive documentary <strong>Marley </strong>(2012, Universal, 15) to become little more than a hagiography. Although the tone is indeed broadly celebratory (Ziggy Marley gets an executive producer credit, and family members feature heavily on screen), Macdonald still manages to delve beneath the public adulation, painting a credible and engrossing picture of a troubled youth who grew into a cultural giant, often at the cost of his family life.</p> <p>Describing his approach as \"more traditional\" than such previous works as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96944/touching.the.void\" title=\"\"><em>Touching the Void</em></a>, Macdonald intertwines interviews, stills and concert footage with some spectacularly scenic views of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jamaica\" title=\"\">Jamaica</a> as he traces Marley's mixed-race roots (his father was a uniformed white man who looked at home on a horse) to find a search for identity at the heart of his passion for music.

With its roots in Mark Baxter and Paolo Hewitt's book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mumper-Mark-Baxter/dp/0955557305\" title=\"\"><em>The Mumper</em></a>, this unexpectedly charming coming-of-age yarn about long-term friendship, 80s industrial unrest and unlikely horse-racing capers deserves to find a more welcoming home on DVD.</p> <p>At the centre of its appeal are a couple of reliably top-notch performances from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/bob-hoskins\" title=\"\">Bob Hoskins</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/apr/29/phil-davis-modern-british-horror\" title=\"\">Phil Davis</a> as the old guard of the print industry (portrayed more convincingly here than is traditional on screen) into which Calum MacNab is inducted. Tipping its hat toward the traditions of Ealing and the style nostalgia of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36323/quadrophenia\" title=\"\"><em>Quadrophenia</em></a>, this warm-hearted shaggy-dog story is drenched in well-chosen period music \u2013 Dexys, Style Council et al \u2013 and played with a sense of both fun and conviction by all involved. One speech, about a father who \"never let a friend down, never crossed a picket line, and told his wife he loved her every day\" had me wiping away a tear.</p> <p>The only vaguely fun thing about the otherwise ear-bashingly awful <strong>Battleship</strong> (2012, Universal, 12) is a splendidly stupid sequence in which missiles are randomly fired at allocated grid references, thereby briefly reminding you that this is actually based on the super-dull Hasbro board game of yore.

Shamelessly recycling riffs ripped from <em>Outland</em> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/43857/alien-3\" title=\"\"><em>Alien 3</em></a> via <em>The Rock</em> (the credits ironically cite \"an original idea by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/12/luc-besson-collection-dvd-review\" title=\"\">Luc Besson</a>\" \u2013 ha!), this sends <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/guy-pearce-actor-jane-mulkerrins-actor\" title=\"\">Guy Pearce</a> into orbit to regain control of an extraterrestrial prison on which the president's daughter has become inconveniently incarcerated. With its solidly un-special special effects and forgettable conspiracy backstory involving some nonsense with a lost briefcase (no, really), this stands or falls on the quality of the hard-boiled quippage between its chalk-and-cheese stars, which, to be fair, is a lot more entertaining than you might expect \u2013 think <em>The Last Boy Scout</em> with less swearing. And in space.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of his third year at Sussex, Ian McEwan, somewhat reluctantly, visited the university's careers office. He already knew that he wanted to be a writer, but perhaps, he thought, this could be done in combination with a parent-placating job: \"I had read<em> Seven Pillars of Wisdom </em>[by TE Lawrence] and the one thing I could imagine being was an Arabist diplomat, the kind of man who would wear a dinner jacket one evening and a keffiyeh the next.\" The careers office gave him a pamphlet. \"On the back of it was a table. There were two columns. On one side was your age, all the way up to 65. On the other was your expected salary at any given age. I looked at it and it filled me with horror. My whole life was there. I was going to spend the next 35 years working my way through this table.\" The aspiring author's riding-a-camel-over-a-sand-dune fantasies were thus brought to a sudden and rather feeble end.</p> <p>Luckily, this was the early 70s, when it was very bliss to be alive. Honestly! \"I had the time of my life,\" says McEwan, with a fervent smile. \"It was very easy not to have a job, to live the life of a full-time writer. I had a huge apartment in south London and it cost me \u00a33 a week. The occasional review for the <em>TLS</em>, the occasional piece for <em>Radio&#xa0;Times</em>, and I could very easily pay my rent, buy a few books, make a weekly trip to the launderette. There were no machines everyone needed, apart from a hi-fi. I didn't feel poor at all. At the risk of sounding like Virginia Woolf, I could live on \u00a3700 a year.\"</p> <p>But what about the chaos? The piles of rubbish, the power cuts, the bodies left unburied? \"Oh, the crises didn't trouble me at all. I didn't own anything; I had no stake. I was restless, excited and a touch reckless. I remember reading Daniel Defoe's <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>. I loved the idea of a city in chaos. There was this line in it that went something like, 'We walked north out of London in order not to have the sun on our faces.' I thought: that's real freedom. I had this 'let it come down' feeling.\"</p> <p>There follows a brief pause while he considers what brought an end to this low-level insurrection, and I attempt to match up the 70s McEwan, hair trailing his cheesecloth collar, with the 21st-century version, who is today wearing tastefully crushed pale linen. His task is probably the easier. As he will tell me: \"The moment you have children and a mortgage you want things to work; you're locked into the human project and you want it to flourish.\" For my part, a leap of imagination is required. When I was told my meeting with McEwan would take place in the boardroom of his publisher, Random House, I was terribly disappointed; I wanted to nose round one of his famously lovely homes (preferably the exquisite Fitzrovia terraced house that was the model for the surgeon Henry Perowne's house in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/30/fiction.bookerprize2005\" title=\"\"><em> Saturday</em></a>). But now it strikes me as rather appropriate. McEwan is the nearest thing to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/22/publishers-ebook-popularity\" title=\"\"> EL James</a> that literary fiction has right now; in this sense, the boardroom chair on which he is uncomfortably perched \u2013 it keeps flipping back, forcing his knees up in the direction of his ears \u2013 might as well be a throne. No wonder I can no more see him in a launderette than I can picture him watching <em>The Only Way is Essex</em>.</p> <p>Anyway, the 70s. That is the decade in which McEwan's new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224097376\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>, is set. I can't say too much about its plot, for the simple reason that it's a novel with a <em>Roger Ackroyd</em>-ish twist and it would be awful to ruin the surprise. But here are the bare bones: Serena Frome is a young Cambridge graduate who finds herself recruited to MI5. An avid reader, she's deployed to work on a cold war propaganda scheme, codenamed Sweet Tooth, in which government cash will secretly be deployed to fund artists likely to portray the west in a favourable light. One of these artists is a promising young writer, Tom Haley. First, Serena falls in love with his stories. Then she falls in love with their writer. No, she is not a particularly good spy. Her real-life contemporary, Stella Rimington, would have had her for breakfast. (<em>Sweet Tooth</em>, incidentally, makes reference to an ambitious colleague of Serena's called Millie Trimingham.)</p> <p>How did this curious, beguiling book \u2013 a spy novel without even so much as a hint of a poison-tipped umbrella \u2013 begin? Which came first, MI5 or the 70s? \"It's hard to say,\" says McEwan. \"I rather drift into my novels. For a long time I've been interested in the <em>Encounter </em>affair [Stephen Spender resigned as the editor of the literary magazine <em>Encounter</em> in 1967, after it was revealed that the CIA had been covertly funding it], and I wondered if there was something in there for me; after I finished <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099512790\" title=\"\"><em>On Chesil Beach</em>,</a> which is set in the early 60s, I thought: sooner or later I'm going to write about England in the 70s. So I think it was both. In the end, though, I just took up my green notebook and got Serena to start talking \u2013 albeit somewhat against my will.\" Why? \"Because I've got a prejudice against first-person narratives. There are too many of them. They're too easy; it's just ventriloquism and authors can hide their terrible style behind characterisation. Any number of cliches are permitted.\"</p> <p>McEwan's MI5 is a hidebound place, staffed mostly by Pooterish, middle-aged men; filing cabinets are the order of the day, not invisible ink. He was, he says, interested in the idea of institutions and how they grow to have their own weird logic. \"What was extraordinary about the cultural cold war was that the CIA in particular poured millions of dollars into very worthy things \u2013 like a festival of atonal music in Paris in 1950. The idea was to persuade left-of-centre European intellectuals that the west was best and that America wasn't just mindless and materialist. And when you think about the horrors the Soviet regime produced, you think: why not? But you also think: why did they do this in secret? Why didn't the government just use the National Endowment for the Arts or something? It never occurred to them that secrecy wasn't necessary.\"</p> <p>In the novel, though, his interest in MI5 wavers a little once Tom Haley appears on the scene, perhaps because he and Tom Haley have so much in common. Haley teaches at Sussex University; he's published by Tom Maschler, who first edited McEwan; he does a reading for his first novel with McEwan's friend, Martin Amis; and two of his stories have been purloined on his behalf from his creator's backlist. \"Yes,\" says McEwan. \"Well spotted. The novel is a muted and distorted autobiography, though unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend.\"</p> <p>So what is he saying, exactly? This merging of fact and fiction, and the several duplicities that run through the book, when combined with its passionate accounts of reading and writing, suggest, at least to me, that<em> Sweet Tooth</em> is a meditation on the fact that novelists are cunning and cold-hearted thieves; in fact, doesn't Tom Haley say as much? \"Yes. Tom mentions the ruthlessness that is necessary to the process \u2013 and it's Serena's fear, too, that he'll write about her.\" Graham Greene said that all writers have a \"chip of ice\" in their hearts. Does he?</p> <p>\"No, I don't think I do. Philip Roth once said to me years ago, when he took an interest in me as a young writer: you've got to write as if your parents are dead. It was very good advice, and I stuck to it, and now I look back with some horror. My father, especially, was torn between exultant pride that I'd published a book and sheer horror at what was in it. So I must have had a steely bit of detachment then. But I've never done what Bellow did in <em>Herzog,</em> or Roth, or Hanif [Kureishi]\u2026 put their ex-wives in books. I couldn't do that.\" He thinks for a moment. \"My chip of ice is a bit\u2026 slushy.\"</p> <p>Ian McEwan is the child of a soldier: his father, David, was a working-class Scot who worked his way up to the rank of major. He was born in Aldershot and lived first in Germany and then in Libya until, at the age of 11, he was sent to a state-run boarding school in Suffolk. McEwan has said in the past that this was quite a bleak time: \"I just went numb for four or five years.\" On the other hand, his dorm experiences came in handy when, in 2005, he travelled with the environmental group Cape Farewell to Svalbard in the Arctic \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/14/solar-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">trip that inspired his last novel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099549024\" title=\"\"><em>Solar</em></a>. Not for him the chaos of the bootroom. He kept his stuff safely under his bed.</p> <p>After an English degree at Sussex he went to the University of East Anglia, where he studied for an MA, tutored by Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury. He moved to London in 1974 and became part of the literary set that centred on Ian Hamilton's <a href=\"http://www.ianhamilton.org/newreview/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>New Review</em></a> (Hamilton, like Wilson, has a walk on part in <em>Sweet Tooth</em>) and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Greek Street, Soho. It was during this time that he formed some of his most important friendships: with Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Christopher Hitchens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-appreciation-by-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">Hitchens died of cancer last year.</a> What is the post-Hitch world like? Oh no. He looks so terrible, as pale as ash, I wish I had not asked. \"It's very\u2026 desolate. It really does feel empty. He was the one of us who seemed to embrace all of literature; as time goes by, I don't think people will associate him with his taking an unusual line on Iraq. They will connect him with his brilliant essays on writers: Chesterton, Kipling, Wodehouse. The appetite. The conversations. I really do miss them. Martin and I regularly check in with each other in the post-Hitch desert.\"</p> <p>How, though, did he manage to stay friends with them all? The literary world can be bitchy and envious. Fall-outs are standard. \"Well, we knew each other before we were known; it's not as if we are movie stars all hanging out together.\" Besides, he says, novel-writing isn't like sprinting. No one needs to come second; there is infinite space for good writing. \"And perhaps we're too old, now, to be jealous. The status anxiety wears off. I like their company. Supper at Julian's is one of the great pleasures.\"</p> <p>But what if one of them had had to slope off and join a less celebrated profession? \"It probably would have changed things, yes. Maybe it was a self-selecting group, though. Who would want to hang out around the Pillars of Hercules? Only those bent by this passion for writing books. We were absolutely determined to become writers. We didn't use words like 'passion', but we acted them out. Writing was the only important thing.\"</p> <p>His success came a little later than that of Amis. The early macabre books \u2013 think incest, think murder, think sex with shop mannequins \u2013 were acclaimed and they had their devoted fans, but I don't imagine they were big sellers (the first came out in 1975). Then, in 1998, his novel <em>Amsterdam</em> won the Booker prize. Nine years later, his 2001 novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/23/fiction.bookerprize2001\" title=\"\"><em>Atonement</em></a> was made into an Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119568/atonement\" title=\"\">film</a>, at which point its already considerable sales doubled, even tripled. Does he think success has an effect on creativity?</p> <p>\"Of course it makes a difference,\" he says. \"But I've always done what I want to do, with the result that when I close the door and unhook the phone I feel all the old anxieties associated with trying to get something right.\" And there are certain new anxieties. \"You worry that sooner or later \u2013 it has to happen \u2013 you can't write; that you will become less thought-rich; there is the danger of repeating yourself. All writers in their 60s have to confront these things. When should you stop? Do you tail away with a series of feeble novellas? But in the silence of trying to do it, it doesn't feel different.\" He is keen to remind me that <em>Atonement</em> is an anomaly. \"It [having a huge hit] happened once. A couple of books recently haven't earned back their advances, and the advances weren't that big. <em>Solar</em>, since I'm being frank with you, was loathed by the Americans. It absolutely bombed.\"</p> <p>This is no good. If he's trying, metaphorically speaking, to give me a reality-checking cold shower, it isn't working. His life, from the outside, seems so replete, so purposeful, so \u2013 not a word one usually associates with writers \u2013 happy. It's enough to make you sick! He laughs. \"Yeah, well, stay with that thought.\" And then: \"Like lots of people, I made a very good second marriage [to Annalena McAfee, a journalist whom he met when she came to interview him]. We have to learn how to get that right\u2026 and I take a lot of delight in my sons [from his first marriage, to Penny Allen, whom he divorced in 1995]. I thought it would be bleak when they stopped thinking I was God, but I love the unfolding plot of their early adulthood.\" One is a molecular biologist, the other is working in PR.</p> <p>You can't necessarily organise how life works out, he tells me. But still, I can't help but read his own contentment \u2013 such peace always involves, I think, a certain amount of effort \u2013 as a rebuke to his (now dead) parents. Their marriage was troubled, largely because they were keeping a painful secret: in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/17/books.booksnews\" title=\"\">2007, McEwan discovered that he had an older brother</a>, Dave Sharp \u2013 the result of an affair between his parents when his mother, Rose, was still married to her first husband (Ernest Wort, with whom she had two children, was off fighting in Italy; her baby with David McEwan was born in 1942; Wort died from combat injuries in 1944). The baby was given away via a newspaper ad in the <em>Reading Mercury </em>which said: \"Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age one month; complete surrender.\"</p> <p>\"That would have been my father,\" says McEwan. \"He would have written that ad. 'Complete surrender' \u2013 it's semi-military.\" Did he feel cross when he discovered what his parents had done? \"Yes. I wanted to shake them. I wanted to say, 'Confront this; deal with it, make yourselves happy.' My regret is that they didn't meet David, because he would have reassured them he wasn't bitter. One of the first things he [David] said to me was, 'I was loved as a child.' He went to visit my mother but she'd already lost her mind. If he'd gone even a year earlier\u2026\"</p> <p>It's such a sad story, given that Rose and David eventually married and could have brought up their child together. \"Yes. They closed something down for themselves. Probably that was my father too. I can hear him say it, 'What's done is done.' But my parents' generation\u2026 it took the 60s for people to give themselves permission to talk about things.\"</p> <p>Is the presence of his brother in his life (Sharp is a bricklayer) another element of his contentment? I think it must be. Even if they're not best friends, a flashlight has been shone in the direction of yet another shadow. McEwan doesn't disagree. \"It makes life richer,\" he says, quietly. \"It absolutely does.\"</p> <p>It's a measure of McEwan's writerly reputation that, even before publication, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> is causing a fuss; the Booker judges have naughtily neglected to put it on their longlist. \"Oh, I've become immune to the Booker,\" he says, though this is an easy line to take when you've already won it. \"I think we need something a little more like the Pulitzer prize, where there isn't this great race. The sense that it's a 110 yard dash has a streak of vulgarity about it.\" As for the reviews, he won't read them. Does he think, as so many people claim, that we are witnessing the end of publishing and, with it, perhaps, the slow death of the novel itself? \"We have a hunger for talking and thinking about others and I don't think any other form can deliver that insider-ish feeling.\"</p> <p>Screen or paper, it doesn't matter. On the other hand, he's just moved house \u2013 yes, Henry's place has been sold, replaced with a flat in Bloomsbury and a house in Gloucestershire \u2013 and he has spent several days pulling books from boxes. \"You put them on the shelf and it's the complete narrative of your existence,\" he says. \"All these crappy, yellowing paperbacks I bought when I was 17. I'll never read them again, but I could never throw them away, either.\" He hugs himself, trying his best \u2013 mostly for my benefit \u2013 to look neurotic. \"I want them around me and that's not something you can do electronically.\"<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>In a huge house in a mysterious part of London, a tall, energetic man called Rupert Maas is showing me a drawing: <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/elizabeth-siddal-and-tennyson/\" title=\"\"><em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a> by <a href=\"http://lizziesiddal.com/portal/\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Siddal</a>. \"It's absolutely lovely, isn't it?\" he asks, though I have the strong impression that he doesn't give two figs whether or&#xa0;not I agree with him. \"There are no more ethereal drawings produced by any of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-pre-raphaelites\" title=\"\">pre-Raphaelites</a> than those by Lizzie, and this is a very, very good one.\" His voice runs on: not dreamily, exactly, but clotted with a certain kind of passion. \"It has this febrile intensity. It's deeply sexy, for some reason. Look at the tightness of her dress, the yearning quality of it.\" Somewhat trepidatiously, I tell him that, to me, this particular <a href=\"http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/shalott.htm\" title=\"\">Lady of Shalott</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alfred-tennyson\" title=\"\">Lord Tennyson</a>'s Arthurian maiden, condemned forever to see Camelot only in the reflection of a mirror, was a favourite subject of the pre-Raphaelites \u2013 looks a little like a doll. \"Yes, well... I think that might be part of it,\" he says, with a smile.</p> <p>Elizabeth Siddal, the redhead who is perhaps best known as the model for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/12/10-best-pre-raphaelite-paintings\" title=\"\">John Everett Millais</a>'s <a href=\"http://www2.tate.org.uk/ophelia/\" title=\"\"><em>Ophelia</em></a>, was married to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/11/archive-the-death-of-mr-d-g-rossetti-1882\" title=\"\">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a>, one of the seven founders of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, from 1860 until her death from an overdose of laudanum in 1862 \u2013 though their relationship began in about 1851, when she first started sitting for him. \"The relationship between Rossetti and Lizzie is absolutely central to the pre-Raphaelite spirit,\" says Maas, still peering over my right shoulder. \"She is Beatrice to his Dante.\" But Siddal, who had humble roots and had previously worked as a milliner, also longed to be an artist in her own right; in 1855, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/14/john-ruskin-wedding-effie-gray\" title=\"\">John Ruskin</a> agreed to subsidise her career, paying her \u00a3150 a year in exchange for every drawing she produced. \"It's well-documented,\" says Maas. \"He [Rossetti] taught her. He stood over her while she drew, and he did bits that she couldn't manage. It was a thing they did together: a journey of love into another world; a medieval paradise for them both.\" Did Rossetti work on <em>The Lady of Shalott</em>, which is dated 1853? \"I think he might have had something to do with the sprite carved on the chair. I think they did that together.\"</p> <p>In the next few days, <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> will depart this house for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain\" title=\"\">Tate Britain</a>, where she is to appear in the gallery's autumn blockbuster, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde\" title=\"\">Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</a>. There, it will join works owned by, among others, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Jimmy Page</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/andrew-lloyd-webber\" title=\"\">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>. Is it thrilling to lend to such an august institution? Not for Maas. This is the second time Siddal's drawing has holidayed at the Tate (the first was during the gallery's last pre-Raphaelite show in 1984), and there are other, equally wonderful works in his collection. \"I do it all the time, quite honestly,\" he says. \"I think it's a public duty. When it's there, I won't even look at it; I'll go and look at something I'm not familiar with instead.\" He grins. \"But, of course, when it comes home, I'll have a jolly good gloat.\"</p> <p>Maas inherited some of his collection from his father, Jeremy, an art dealer who in 1969 wrote a celebrated book about 19th-century British art, <em>Victorian Painters</em>, and who began buying 19th-century British paintings when they were still amazingly affordable. (Rupert now runs his father's Mayfair gallery.) The rest, he bought: \"I'm not one of those dealers who feels he shouldn't collect.\" So what is it about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/aug/12/victorian-art-ford-madox-brown\" title=\"\">Victorian art</a> in general, and the pre-Raphaelites in particular, that speaks to him? They haven't always, it's fair to say, been terribly fashionable.</p> <p>\"Yes. But when people say they hate Victorian art, you have to ask: what is it they're hating? They're hating themselves, because they're hating the stuff of which we're made. Most middle-class people in Britain still live in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/11/victorian-edwardian-british-architecture\" title=\"\">Victorian houses</a>. They gave us all sorts of things we take for granted. And Victorian genre paintings deal with such serious social issues. Look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/16/ford-madox-brown-pre-raphaelite-exhibition\" title=\"\">Ford Madox Brown</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1891P24\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Last of England</em></a> [a painting about emigration and poverty that will also be in the Tate's exhibition]. He's asking big questions in pictures.\"</p> <p>As for the pre-Raphaelites proper, with their penchant for swooning damozels and complicated allegories, he hopes that the Tate's vast new show will persuade visitors to reconsider them. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, formed in 1848, was determined to rebel against dreary <a href=\"http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Academy</a> conventions; for this reason its members have sometimes been compared, in spirit, to the <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10220\" title=\"\">Young British Artists</a> of the 1990s. Maas, though, likens them to punks; every young artist wanted to be one. \"Millais was the greatest draughtsman. Rossetti was the romantic, the natural heir to Blake. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/16/holman.hunt.damien.hirst\" title=\"\">Holman Hunt</a> is more difficult: the priggishness, the religiosity, the density: these are some seriously wacky paintings. But they're all so big, so brightly-coloured, so powerful. You can just imagine how they must have seemed once, when everyone was used to seeing Sir Sloshua Reynolds and his school.\" His eyes widen. \"They must have seemed seriously psychedelic.\"</p> <p>It has taken Alison Smith, a Tate curator, more than five years to put Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde<em> </em>together. The idea for it came to her after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2007/sep/24/art.artnews\" title=\"\">Tate's Millais exhibition</a> in 2007. It encouraged visitors who thought of the artist as a painter of fancy chocolate-box pictures to see him in a different, more audacious light, and Smith found herself wondering if she couldn't do the same for his colleagues in the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. \"I wanted to show them as modern artists rather than as soft romantics,\" she says. \"That was my agenda.\"</p> <p>Her case successfully argued (the Tate's programme is driven not by potential visitor numbers but by intellectual inquiry, with the result that every show must have a thesis), and the exhibition safely in the schedule, she began work. The Tate has a peerless collection of pre-Raphaelite paintings, among them <em>Ophelia</em> by Millais, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-the-golden-stairs-n04005\" title=\"\"><em>The Golden Stairs</em></a> by Burne-Jones, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?id=75&amp;venue=2\" title=\"\"><em>The Beloved</em></a> by Rossetti, and <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/pre-raphaelites/triumph/\" title=\"\"><em>The Triumph of the Innocents</em></a> by Holman Hunt. But she also had a list of must-haves to be borrowed from elsewhere: Millais's <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/19c/millais.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Isabella</em></a>, which hangs in the <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/\" title=\"\">Walker Art Gallery</a> in Liverpool; Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/op34.rap.html\" title=\"\"><em>Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother</em></a>, which is in a private collection and had not been seen in public since 1984; Ford Madox Brown's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/fmb/paintings/2.html\" title=\"\"><em>Work</em></a> from <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester City Galleries</a>; Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/P16.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Light of the World</em></a>, from <a href=\"http://www.keble.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Keble College, Oxford</a>; and, most fabulous of all, Holman Hunt's <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/P30.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Lady of Shalott</em></a>, from the collection of the <a href=\"http://www.thewadsworth.org/\" title=\"\">Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art</a> in Hartford, Connecticut. This massive painting, overpowering and, some would say, overwrought, has not been seen in Britain since 1951.</p> <p>So how did she do? Lizzie Siddal's drawing, just across the river, must have been relatively easy to clinch. But what about the others? \"Oh, we secured them all,\" she says, almost nonchalantly. \"Everything we wanted, we got. <em>The Lady of Shalott</em> was in doubt for a while; there were conservation issues, and we had concerns about travel and costs. But, in the end, all the problems were resolved, and this astonishing late painting [it was completed in 1905 after the artist's death by an assistant, by which time its subject was already long out of fashion] will be the final work in the exhibition.\" And once the names on her list were ticked off, did she dance a little jig? \"No. But you feel good for the show. You feel it's finally coming together.\"</p> <p>Its major paintings bagged, the exhibition began to spread its tentacles outwards. All hands on deck. Backstage in London, Kiko Noda, the show's registrar, embarked on the complex logistical task of arranging the transportation of every loan. \"Most lenders insist on a representative being present when a painting is hung,\" says Smith. \"And once a work has been hung it cannot be moved. You can't go back and say, 'Oh, that would look nicer there.' A big lender might have five or six works in different rooms, so drawing up an installation schedule is perhaps the&#xa0;trickiest thing of all. That's where Kiko comes in.\"</p> <p>In America, Smith's co-curators, Tim Barringer and Jason Rosenfeld (the exhibition will travel to Washington), started working on their scholarly essays for the catalogue. At Tate Enterprises, the team began thinking about merchandise: scarves inspired by the gown Rossetti's model wears in <em>The Beloved</em>; bags and cushions made from fabric designed by the pre-Raphaelites' friend and supporter, <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/morris/wmbio.html\" title=\"\">William Morris</a>; and, of course, fridge magnets and postcards, which sell in their thousands. (Tate Enterprises earns between \u00a32m and \u00a33m a year for the galleries, so ordering the right merchandise is a serious business.) And the marketing department considered how best to attract younger visitors. Among their ideas: pre-Raphaelite-inspired fashion shoots; a pre-Raphaelite <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/siddal/pre-raphaelite/\" title=\"\">Pinterest</a> page; a roll call of \"modern&#xa0;day muses\" with pre-Raphaelite sensibilities (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/13/paloma-faith-interview-fall-grace\" title=\"\">Paloma Faith;</a> Florence Welch, from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/florence-and-the-machine\" title=\"\">Florence and the Machine</a>).</p> <p>The months, and the years, ticked by. It's now August and the paintings are finally arriving; Kiko Noda receives every one personally. They will be hung by a team led by Geoff Hoskins, a senior art handling technician of 20 years' experience, in the fortnight before the show opens on 12&#xa0;September (the wall texts were completed only in the past few days \u2013 Smith's American colleagues slaved through the night to finish them on time). What will it be like to see the work in the galleries at last? Smith smiles. \"For me, the most wonderful moment is installation. It's the culmination of everything. That's when you feel you are deep in the heart of a project.\" And when it opens to the public? \"The personal attachment loosens a bit, but you're still concerned. It's a like a child going out into the world: you want it to do well.\"</p> <p>The Tate's pre-Raphaelite paintings are among its most popular (<em>Ophelia</em> by Millais, so lush and yet so plangent, has long been the gallery's bestselling postcard). \"They're always on display,\" says Natasha Walker, a paintings conservator. \"And when they're not, they're often on loan to another gallery. So it's quite rare that we get the opportunity to look at them. That's why we like these big shows. It gives us the chance to get our hands on things.\"</p> <p>Some time ago, Walker and the other conservators examined all of the Tate paintings that will appear in the exhibition. \"We have priorities,\" she says. \"Obviously, if something is stucturally unsound, that's the first priority. This one [she reaches for some images] was displayable, but we wanted it to look its best. So I spent five months cleaning it.\"</p> <p>The painting in question is Dante Gabriel Rossetti's <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/rossetti/works/beauties/beatabeatrix.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Beata Beatrix</em></a> (1864-70), a portrait of the poet Dante's wife, Beatrice, that was also a memorial to Rossetti's wife, Elizabeth Siddall (the painter used sketches of his late wife to complete it). It's an exquisite piece, smaller and more intimate in scale than many pre-Raphaelite works, and softer, too, being more dimly lit. Beatrice/Siddal has her eyes closed, though whether she is in a state of religious or sexual ecstasy is unclear. Meanwhile, a bird, a messenger of death whose feathers are the colour of dried blood, drops a poppy into her open palms (this must, surely, be a reference to Siddal's death from an overdose of laudanum shortly after she gave birth to a stillborn child). In the background is Dante, looking towards the haloed figure of Love, in whose hands the burning heart of his wife flickers and wanes.</p> <p>\"The painting had a natural resin varnish over it,\" says Walker. \"It would have been added to improve its colour rendition, the gloss of it. But it had become quite discoloured.\" After doing some tests to find which mixture of solvents would best&#xa0;remove this layer, she set to work with a cotton wool swab. \"It's very painstaking. You have to be careful with the paint layer.\" She shows me some before and after pictures. \"Look at the colour shift. Before, it was warmer and quite yellow in tone. Varnish tends to make things look quite unified. The contrast between highlights and shadows is so much greater now, and her flesh is cooler, not quite so glowing.\"</p> <p>During the conservation, Walker x-rayed the picture; she also photographed it while casting light at an acute angle over it. \"I found out quite a lot. The story goes that Rossetti had made and abandoned an oil sketch of his wife, and that it lay in his studio for many years, until his dealer took it to be adhered to another canvas, and brought it back for Rossetti to finish. The x-ray showed that there were indeed canvas additions at the top, sides and bottom, all of which would have allowed Rossetti more scope for background.\" She shows me the x-ray. \"I could also see these losses in the lead white preparation under the paint. Rossetti left these losses. A more meticulous artist would have filled them before recommencing. When I cast light over the picture, I could also see brush hairs, studio dust and debris in the paint, which tells you something about the state of his tools.\"</p> <p>It took Rossetti six years to complete <em>Beata</em> <em>Beatrix</em>, a long time for a painting of this size. \"When I looked at the green of her cloak I could see that it had aged and cracked over a period of time; his red monogram had been added over the cracks. I could even see some of the red pigment caught up in the varnish, which tells me that he signed it and then quickly sent it away.\"</p> <p>How do these discoveries make her feel? Shivery, is the answer \u2013 though in a good way. \"You've seen it in books, or on walls. But this brings you so much closer.\" It's a visceral thing, a connection with the artist himself. What do her discoveries tell us about Rossetti's state of mind? Walker is reluctant to say: \"I'm not an art historian,\" she laughs (her degree is in zoology, the chemistry she learnt then a great help). But to me it seems obvious. Rossetti took his wife's death hard, burying the bulk of his unpublished poems with her in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/may/04/heritage.london\" title=\"\">Highgate cemetery</a>. Afterwards, he grew increasingly depressed. <em>Beata Beatrix</em> was a painful piece to paint; it took him an age. But when he finally felt able to let it go, he couldn't wait to get it out of his sight.</p> <p>It's not only paintings that must be conserved. When Walker and I have finished talking, she takes me to the studio of Alastair Johnson, a frame conservator. For the past year, Johnson has been working on the frame of Burne-Jones's enormous oil, <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-king-cophetua-and-the-beggar-maid-n01771\" title=\"\"><em>King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid</em></a> \u2013 a project that will be completed any day now, when picture and frame are once again reunited.</p> <p><em>King</em> <em>Cophetua </em>was completed in 1884. It was inspired by a Tennyson poem, <a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/atennyson/bl-aten-beggar.htm\" title=\"\">The Beggar Maid</a>, and tells the legend of an African king who disdained women until he met Penelophon, \"a beggar maid all in grey\", with whom he fell in love at first sight. In the painting, the king gazes at Penelophon devotedly (the theme of male enthralment to female beauty was a favourite of Burne-Jones's), having put aside his crown and shield in deference to her beauty. A deeply sensual work \u2013 with her gently rounded belly and her curled toes, there is something so straightforwardly sexy about Penelophon \u2013 Burne-Jones's friends bought it for the Tate after the artist's death in 1898.</p> <p>The painting's frame was made for it, in the Renaissance style, by the Vacani family. But a few years after it joined the collection it was altered to accommodate a glazing door (in other words, an ugly sub frame was fitted inside the original one). \"The alterations were substantial,\" says Johnson. \"They had to insert four inches of material in the bottom of the frame, removing one putto's head, and replacing it with two. They also built up the columns at the side and removed altogether the frame's lovely moulded [internal] edge.\"</p> <p>How did Johnson know what the original frame looked like? Luckily, there existed a photograph by Emery Walker of the painting in its original frame; Johnson found it at the National Portrait Gallery, where Walker's archive is kept. Using this as a guide, he set to work. First he removed the additions. \"They were quite brutal,\" he says. \"You could see the saw marks where they'd cut the bottom of the frame in two.\" Then he made moulds of a putto's head elsewhere on the frame. \"I used a silicon rubber mould; prop-makers use them; they're incredibly detailed. The heads themselves are made from composition, a doughy mixture of plaster or chalk.\" Then he set about copying the moulded edge. \"Usually we find another frame which has something similar as a guide. But I couldn't find one anywhere. In the end, I just modelled a section up in Plasticine.\"</p> <p>Finally he guilded his repairs. Johnson leads me to the frame itself, in the centre of the room. Wow. What a wonderful thing it is. But will he age his own additions? They're a bit bling at the moment. \"Yes. I'll probably use watercolour: something I can easily remove, or add to. And perhaps a bit of household dirt.\" It will, he says, be an anxious moment when the painting is put into the frame. \"A very expensive piece of Perspex \u2013 it's called Optium \u2013 will replace the glass. It has an innovative coating which makes it look like low-reflective glass. It also has an inherent flexibility, which is important with a painting of this size. Unlike glass, it won't crack.\" How will he feel when he sees it in the gallery? \"Oh, it'll be wonderful,\" he says, with great feeling. \"But I'll also be praying I measured the painting correctly.\"</p> <p>As both Walker and Johnson point out, thanks to their efforts, when visitors to the exhibition come to gaze on <em>Beata Beatrix</em> and <em>King Cophetua</em> in a few weeks' time, they'll be seeing them pretty much as Rossetti, Burne-Jones and their contemporaries saw them. Will this make a difference to their understanding of these artists? Perhaps not. Only experts and passionate fans will notice such subtle changes. On the other hand, as the late, great <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/robert-hughes\" title=\"\">Robert Hughes</a> put it, for the pre-Raphaelites, \"God was in the details: in the petals of a cornflower or the vein of an elecampane leaf, in the grain of stone or the purling of a brook.\"</p> <p>Rossetti and his friends would, I think, have adored the care the Tate has put into this show. Such attention, loving and precise, reflects the extreme trouble they went to in their own pursuit of accuracy. Though what they would have made of fridge magnets is anyone's guess.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde\" title=\"\"><em>Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde</em></a><em> is at Tate Britain, London SW1 from 12 Sept to 13 Jan 2013; tate.org.uk</em></p>",

Though some maggots are still visible, crawling in the gutter near where the dead cat lay, it is too early to say if they will hatch out into flies and what kind of flies these flies, if indeed they be flies at all, will grow up to be. The brown, dead-cat-shaped stain on the pavement, however, is expected to remain partially visible for decades, providing inspiration for generations to come and transforming the economic fortunes of the entire district.</p> <p>When the dead cat first appeared on the pavement outside the house just over three weeks ago, I admit I was one of those who was sceptical about its long-term value to the borough. After all, there had been dead rats, a dead pigeon, and even an inexplicable dead fish, in the street before and they had had very little positive impact on the area. \"A dead cat on the pavement in Hackney?\" I scoffed. \"It will be a disaster. The lady who teaches t'ai chi will probably steal it to make a hat. The infrastructure will not be able to cope. And Hackney is not even on the underground so the transport links will be horrendous. And the nature of the dead cat's sponsors is so clearly in opposition to the ideals of putrefaction the dead cat itself embodies that the whole idea has already been undermined, surely.\"</p> <p>How wrong I was. After some teething troubles, the 393 bus soon rose to the challenge, delivering crowds of morbid gawpers from all over north London to view the rotting pet via specially marked out Dead Cat lanes; and no one could have predicted what a great sponsor the taxidermist on Essex Road turned out to be, despite the fact that the shop is dedicated to the unnatural preservation of dead animals, while the dead cat itself visibly and robustly espoused the natural laws of decomposition ever more profoundly with each passing day.</p> <p>Like many locals initially unconvinced by the idea of a dead cat, I soon became obsessed with it despite myself, running out into the road every few minutes to check the progress of its slow physical erosion. Everyone in the family had their own favourite aspect of the process. I became fascinated with the gradual recedence of its beautiful green eyes into its collapsing brown face, the children enjoyed the slow stiffening of the furry limbs, while my husband and his mates from the pub, typically, loved the bit when \"its arse fell into the drain\", an event disproportionately well attended by the sponsors and their clients!</p> <p>There was something for everyone in the gradual decomposition of the dead cat and one could sense the sometimes divided community of east London \u2013 black, white, Muslim, Jew, Turk, Kurd, young, old, men, women, children, pensioners, lesbian, gay and transgender \u2013 being brought together by their shared bleak fascination with the inescapable fecundity of death, from whose icy clutches no mortal can ever wriggle free.</p> <p>The variety of life forms contained within the rotting cat, in competition for the resources its bloated corpse offered, yet co-operating together as one, was a wonder to behold. Flies from many lands crawled over it laying their eggs in fertile patches of damp flesh and soon the carcass was alive with wriggling larvae. These tiny parasites' sportsmanlike efforts to eradicate the host body caused, apparently, questions to be asked at the Football Association as to why Premier League footballers could not behave more like these maggots, which had so inspired lawless young people watching the putrefaction of the cat carcass.</p> <p>In our house, the cheese fly maggot, <em>Piophila casei</em>, has become something of a hero, despite being cruelly mocked by TV comedian Frankie Boyle on his Twitter account, for looking \"like that midget c*** Herv\u00e9 Villechaize from <em>Fantasy f***ing Island</em> with two tea strainers sellotaped over his f***ing face\". Though only 8mm long <em>Piophila</em> regularly hopped 15cm around the cat's body, a feat that made Boyle's cruel and ill-judged jibes look to everyone sitting on our garden wall like a definite case of sour grapes.</p> <p>The decomposing cat's spectacular opening ceremony turned out to be a vital strategy in winning over the doubters and the tolerance of the schoolkids who usually sit on the wall by where it was, selling small parcels of crack for pocket money prices. Unrehearsed gaggles of infants dressed as Swedish detective Wallander sang a Blakean eulogy to the now abandoned Bookstart scheme, while veteran ska band Bad Manners, who had met at Woodberry Down school, performed their 1980 pro-hard liquor hit Special Brew. Then Lady&#xa0;P, the Hackney grandmother who swore at rioters last August, jumped from a nearby window using a Happy Shopper bag as a parachute, the climax of an ill-disciplined but exuberant event that avoided all the usual opening ceremony cliches in favour of opaque nostalgia and endearing have-a-go theatrics.</p> <p>The closing ceremony was no less impressive, featuring, as it did, TV comedian Russell Brand, who used to buy drugs in the area. \"I got all me smack round here,\" he chirped, \"and now look. A dead cat. This place has gone up in the world and no bleedin' mistake, your lordships. <em>Citius</em>, <em>altius</em>, <em>fortius</em> and such like!\"</p> <p>Who can forget the hilarious song that Brand then improvised himself on the spot? \"Dead catty-watty. Catty-watty woo. Catty-wat, Wittgenstein, big stinky poo!\" After Brand's wilderness years in America, and the whole Sachsgate scandal, we all realised finally, that he was a national treasure, and forgave him as one. Indeed, the very public rehabilitation of Russell Brand may yet prove to be the most enduring and valuable legacy of the whole decomposing cat.</p> <p>But now the cat is gone and the spontaneous street party that has been raging in the road this month has abated. One of the students five doors down stumbled out the morning after the final night of celebration, in a dirty nightie emblazoned with an image of the decomposing cat. \"Jesus!\" she shouted, to no one in particular, \"the decomposing cat is gone. But everything's still broken, all the butterflies are dead, I'll never own my own home and they just closed the library. Bastards.\"</p>",
  "<p>To understand the nature of what really occurred when three young women were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">sentenced </a>to two years in a penal colony for \"hooliganism\" after performing an anti-Putin song in Moscow's Christ the Saviour cathedral, one need only examine the verdict. For the very language of authoritarian regimes, twisted to political ends, is often one of the best clues.</p> <p>If it were not for the fact that what took place in Moscow on Friday shames Russia internationally, condemning three artists to a labour camp for a 40-second performance, the shouted-out sentencing statement would be darkly comic.</p> <p>Judge Marina Syrova declared in monotone how Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Ekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alyokhina, two of them mothers, conspired to wear clothing that was an offence against church rules, \"colluded\" to produce a guitar and amplifier and \"demonstratively and cynically\" defied \"the Orthodox world\u2026 devaluing centuries of revered and protected dogmas\". In all this, the world learned from the judge, the women's \"religious hatred\" was motivated \"by way of them being feminists who consider men and women to be equal\".</p> <p>Perhaps most ridiculous of all was the cod psychology deployed to damn the women, asserting that the defendants \"suffered from mixed personality disorder displayed by their active position in life\".</p> <p>While it is entirely possible that some members of the Orthodox church were offended by Pussy Riot's Punk Prayer, and indeed it does seem to be the case that approval for their actions has been low in wider Russian society, the principle of free speech is not about offence or public approval.</p> <p>It is defined by the notion, as Evelyn Beatrice Hall framed it in her biography of Voltaire: \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\"</p> <p>The reality is that, under 13 years of Vladimir Putin, free speech has gradually been eroded.</p> <p>While some criticism of officialdom is permitted, Putin and his circle have cracked down on attacks aimed at him directly or over allegations of corruption and criminality among those close to him.</p> <p>Others who have dared to offer criticism, as Padraig Reidy of Index on Censorship pointed out in the immediate aftermath of the verdict, have found themselves similarly pursued, among them the former business magnate <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12082222\" title=\"\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>, currently serving a long jail sentence for tax fraud.</p> <p>Journalists, too, have been threatened, dismissed from their jobs and sometimes killed. Next up to be given the treatment is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16057045\" title=\"\">Alexei Navalny</a>, a blogger and opposition figure, who faces charges of embezzlement.</p> <p>Despite this policy of persecuting critics, the pursuit of the three members of Pussy Riot, who absurdly spent five months in custody even before the trial, is more than usually worrying, not least because of the strong evidence that shows how Putin, judiciary and church have formed an alliance to ensure the women's conviction.</p> <p>Indeed, after the performance in the cathedral, it was Putin himself who poured petrol on the flames by calling for action against their blasphemy.</p> <p>If all of this is has the potential to damage Putin in the long run, it is because his autocratic state has been taunted into a gross overreaction that has made the president in particular look fearful and foolish. This is a man, lest we forget, who has made much of his macho credentials, being photographed bare-chested on horseback with a rifle, riding a motorbike flying a Russian flag at a biker festival and darting a tiger.</p> <p>Indeed, the first evidence that Putin and the church might already be wavering emerged yesterday as two top clerics in the Orthodox church appeared on TV to say the church had forgiven the group. One of the clerics, Tikhon Shevkunov, is widely believed to be Putin's spiritual counsellor.</p> <p>The persecution of Pussy Riot, however clumsy and ridiculous, is sinister because it represents simply the latest assault by Putin and his cronies on a Russian state he has all but stolen through a series of transparent moves.</p> <p>Not least among those was the cynical presidential job swap he arranged with his prime minister, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7136556.stm\" title=\"\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, to keep the seat warm for him until he could run again in elections marked, say the opposition, by widespread fraud.</p> <p>And as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-putin-message\" title=\"\">Oleg Kashin</a>, a journalist on <em>Kommersant </em>argued in yesterday's <em>Guardian</em>, the Pussy Riot prosecution has not been an aberration but part of a very calculated policy of setting the \"simple people\", who Putin believes support him, against the \"creative class\" who he believes have supplied most of the protesters who took to the streets in December demanding free and fair elections.</p> <p>It has been part and parcel of a longer-term campaign by Putin and those close to him to undermine democracy at all levels and expand control by the government over ever-larger parts of Russian life.</p> <p>Inevitably, perhaps, given the anger provoked in the west by Russia's contribution to the worsening bloodshed in Syria through its support of the Assad dictatorship, governments have seized on the Pussy Riot verdict as yet another example of Russia's trajectory under Putin towards a harsh and uncompromising place where dissenting views increasingly are punished.</p> <p>If Putin has miscalculated in this case it is because, unlike in his pursuit of Khodorkovsky, an ambiguous figure, the issues around Pussy Riot are so clear cut. Even before the verdict, he was challenged about the case, in meetings with other leaders, including David Cameron, during the London Olympics. That pressure is only likely to grow, becoming a source of irritation for a man who likes to see himself as \"handshakeable\" when he meets fellow leaders.</p> <p>Which means that Putin has a simple option \u2013 to show clemency and issue a pardon \u2013 which is what natural justice demands. Inaction would confirm, as Malcolm Rifkind, former British foreign secretary, told this paper yesterday, that Russia is in danger of becoming a \"neanderthal\" state.</p>",

When her book <a href=\"http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/eatpraylove.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Eat, Pray, Love</em></a> made her into a multimillionaire, she paid off friends' credit card bills, bought them plane tickets, tuition, therapy, gym memberships, vehicles. \"Sometimes (well, twice), I even bought them houses.\"</p> <p>In the process, she says, she became what she calls a \"destiny disruptor\". She lost friends \u2013 \"and now we cross the street to avoid running into each other\" \u2013 by sweeping into their lives with \"my big fat cheque book\".</p> <p>Gilbert contends that there is a fine line between generosity and over-giving. The first is laudable and selfless. You just want to help and share your good fortune. The second is dangerous and, sometimes, self-serving. You risk playing God, trying to control people's lives.</p> <p>Leave that to the experts, she counsels. Give it to charities. They have plenty of experience in navigating this moral minefield and will happily bear the ethical burden for you.</p> <p>The Bayfords' best friend Richard added: \"I genuinely believe they will be the same people they have always been.\"</p> <p>Just to reiterate: this friend is an admirable, principled man who has done absolutely the right thing not to solicit any cash.

  "<p>When I watched a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts5MKtXNpMQ\" title=\"\">TED talk</a> given by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita \u2013 one half of the academic team behind <em>The Dictator's Handbook</em> \u2013 his gait and accent reminded me of the criminal genius <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2y40U2LvKY\" title=\"\">Vizzini</a>, played by Wallace Shawn, in the cult 80s movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77070/princess-bride\" title=\"\"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a>. Vizzini thinks himself a master of negotiation, able to see anyone's true motives and control their behaviour, but his hubris inevitably leads to his demise. <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/fellows/10201\" title=\"\">Bueno de Mesquita</a> has similar talents, but they've led not to his downfall but to him becoming a senior fellow at Stanford's <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/\" title=\"\">Hoover Institution</a>. The message of this book is that no political outcome is \"inconceivable\". Instead the behaviour of leaders is tiresomely predictable. Along with his co-writer, <a href=\"http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/AlastairSmith\" title=\"\">Alastair Smith</a>, Bueno de Mesquita claims to have uncovered the fundamental laws that must be obeyed to attain and retain political power. The book owes plenty to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/search/results?query=James+M+Buchanan&amp;searchBy=all\" title=\"\">James Buchanan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/gary-s-becker\" title=\"\">Gary Becker</a>, and not a little to Machiavelli, but the result is certainly original. <em>The Dictator's&#xa0;Handbook</em> does for politicians what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/search/results?query=ellen+fein+and+sherrie+schneider&amp;searchBy=all\" title=\"\"><em>The Rules</em></a> did for lonely hearts \u2013 and it's not any worse for that.</p> <p>The authors promise a tick list of simple rules that any reader can follow should they wish to win anything from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jun/24/society.localgovernment\" title=\"\">mayoralty of Hartlepool</a> to military control of, say, Zimbabwe: \"rely on as few people as possible\", \"make sure no supporter becomes irreplaceable\", \"find and control the money\", \"divide it with your allies\", \"don't take money from your supporters' pockets\", and so on. These rules are illustrated with well-told political anecdotes and the book shares revealing insights about the nature of constituencies that leaders must capture in different political environments. It won't surprise anyone that the power structure of FTSE boardrooms has much in common with African dictatorships, but it's good to read the evidence.</p> <p>There are two problems. First, the book is underpinned by the notion that politicians are self-interested rational actors whose choices are fixed and predictable. Economists used to think the same about consumers but behavioural science proved them wrong. Second, though students of politics, the authors assume the affectations of scientists and, in the cause of \"impartiality\", create a work of such galactic cynicism that it made me flinch on more than one occasion. \"When addressing politics,\" they state, \"we must accustom ourselves to think about the actions and interests of specific leaders rather than thinking and talking about fuzzy ideas like the national interest, the common good, and the general welfare.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the critical mauling former BP boss Tony Hayward received for his handling of Gulf of Mexico blowout, you would think he'd want a quiet life. But instead, his new job as boss of Genel Energy has put him at the centre of a skirmish between the oil barons of Iraq and Kurdistan.</p> <p>Genel, whose backers include Nat Rothschild, has taken a bet on Kurdistan being the next big province for the oil industry and recently increased its stake in an exploratory field there. So the City will want to know Hayward's take on the argy-bargy between Baghdad and Erbil at the company's half-year results on Thursday. Iraq has threatened to cut ties with foreign oil companies if they violate Iraqi law and proceed with upstream work in the self-governing region. Kurdistan, meanwhile, is close to completing a pipeline to Turkey that will enable its producers to bypass Iraq altogether.</p> <p>Mehmet Sepil, Genel's president, is already feeling chipper: \"Baghdad has lost its oil and natural gas fight against northern Iraq. Baghdad says it will put those who operate in northern Iraq on a blacklist but the largest companies in the world are working there. The energy fight is over today. The important question is when Baghdad will admit this.\" My guess is not any time soon.</p> <h2>Premier still in choppy waters<br></h2> <p>There will be another chance to take the temperature of the (political) waters of the South Atlantic when plucky British explorer Premier Oil reports its first-half figures on Thursday.</p> <p>Last week rival Desire Petroleum did its best to drum up excitement over the chances of a commercial oil strike off the Malvinas, as Buenos Aires likes to calls them. The buzz bodes well for Premier, which recently bought a 60% stake in Aim-listed Rockhopper Exploration's interests in the Falkland Islands to get its hands on some of the action in the Sea Lion field, which could have between 400m and 500m barrels of recoverable reserves.</p> <p>But the oil companies are battling in choppy seas, as the Argentinian government is threatening to take anyone \"illegally\" drilling off the disputed islands to court. The British government has promised to stand by its explorers, and many industry experts point out that the Argentinian court threats are highly unlikely to stand up under international law.</p> <p>But some equity analysts have since questioned the wisdom of Premier choosing to put so many of its eggs into such a fragile basket. The chief executive, Simon Lockett, will need to explain why the Sea Lion should be allowed to roar.</p> <h2>Another hurdle for BAA<br></h2> <p>BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, had a quietly successful Olympics \u2013 which counts as a major achievement for one of the UK's more pilloried businesses. Given that success for BAA consists of not being caned by the national press on a daily basis, a glitch-free Games is cause for celebration. But it faces a more complicated repeat of that test on Wednesday when it is expecting its busiest arrival day for Paralympians, with more than 1,000 athletes expected to arrive while the airport handles about 190,000 passengers at the same time.</p> <p>It will be an interesting introduction for BAA's newest prospective shareholder, Qatar Holding, which has agreed to acquire a 20% stake in the business. Spain's Ferrovial, which once owned 55% of BAA, will soon find its stake dipping below 40%. If the next few weeks go smoothly, as they hopefully should, then perhaps BAA can begin to think it has banished the operational glitches that have bedevilled its recent history, not least the terrible handling of the 2010 snow crisis. If errors abound, however, the ensuing media and political reaction might make the Qataris wonder what they have let themselves in for.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Why do Bedouins wear black in the&#xa0;desert?</strong></h2> <p>The question so intrigued four scientists \u2013 all non-Bedouins \u2013 that they ran an experiment. Their study, called <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v283/n5745/abs/283373a0.html\" title=\"\">Why Do Bedouins Wear Black Robes in Hot Deserts?, was published in the journal <em>Nature</em></a> in 1980.</p> <p>\"It seems likely,\" the scientists wrote, \"that the present inhabitants of the Sinai, the Bedouins, would have optimised their solutions for desert survival during their long tenure in this desert. Yet one may have doubts on first encountering Bedouins wearing black robes and herding black goats. We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot&#xa0;desert.\"</p> <p>The research team \u2013 C Richard Taylor and Virginia Finch of Harvard University and Amiram Shkolnik and Arieh Borut of Tel Aviv University \u2013 quickly discovered that, as you might suspect, a black robe does convey more heat inward than a white robe does. But they doubted that this was the whole story.</p> <p>Taylor, Finch, Shkolnik, and Borut measured the overall heat gain and loss suffered by a brave volunteer. They described the volunteer as \"a man standing facing the sun in the desert at midday while he wore: 1) a black Bedouin robe; 2) a similar robe that was white; 3) a tan army uniform; and 4) shorts (that is, he was semi\u2011nude)\".</p> <p>Each of the test sessions (black-robed, white-robed, uniformed and half-naked) lasted 30 minutes. They took place in the Negev desert at the bottom of the rift valley between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Eilat. The volunteer stood in temperatures that ranged from a just-semi-sultry 35C (95F) to a character-building 46C (115F). Though he is now nameless, this was his day in the sun.</p> <p>The results were clear. As the report puts it: \"The amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe. The additional heat absorbed by the black robe was lost before it reached the skin.\"</p> <p>Bedouins' robes, the scientists noted, are worn loose. Inside, the cooling happens by convection \u2013 either through a bellows action, as the robes flow in the wind, or by a chimney sort of effect, as air rises between robe and skin. Thus it was conclusively demonstrated that, at least for Bedouin robes, black is as cool as any other colour.</p> <h2><strong>How do our stomachs digest&#xa0;animal bones?</strong></h2> <p>If you like shrews, especially if you like them parboiled, you'll want to devour a 1994 study published in the <em>Journal of Archaeological Science</em>. Called <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030544039590008X\" title=\"\">Human Digestive Effects on a Micromammalian Skeleton</a>, it explains how and why one of its authors \u2013 either Brian D Crandall or Peter W Stahl; we are not told which \u2013 ate and excreted a 90mm-long (excluding the tail, which added another 24mm) northern short-tailed shrew (<em>Blarina brevicauda</em>).</p> <p>This was, in technical terms, \"a preliminary study of human digestive effects on a small insectivore skeleton\", with \"a brief discussion of the results and their archaeological implications\". Crandall and Stahl were anthropologists at the <a href=\"http://www.binghamton.edu/\" title=\"\">State University of New York in Binghamton</a>. The shrew was a local specimen, procured via trapping at an unspecified location not far from the school. For the experiment's input, preparation was exacting. After being skinned and eviscerated, the report says, \"the carcass was lightly boiled for approximately 2 minutes and swallowed without mastication in hind and fore limb, head, and body and tail&#xa0;portions\".</p> <p>Here's how Crandall and Stahl handled the output: \"Faecal matter was collected for the following 3&#xa0;days. Each faeces was stirred in a pan of warm water until completely disintegrated. This solution was then decanted through a quadruple-layered cheesecloth mesh. Sieved contents were rinsed with a dilute detergent solution and examined with a hand lens for bone remains.\" They then examined the most interesting bits with a scanning electron microscope, at magnifications ranging from 10 to 1,000 times.</p> <p>A shrew has lots of bony parts. All of them entered Crandall's gullet, or maybe Stahl's. But despite extraordinary efforts to find and account for each bone at journey's end, many went missing. One of the major jawbones disappeared. So did four of the 12 molar teeth, several of the major leg and foot bones, nearly all of the toe bones, and all but one of the 31 vertebrae. And the skull, reputedly a very hard chunk of bone, emerged with what the report calls \"significant&#xa0;damage\".</p> <p>The vanishing startled the scientists. Remember, they emphasise in their paper, that this meal was simply gulped down: \"The shrew was ingested without chewing; any damage occurred as the remains were processed internally. Mastication undoubtedly damages bone, but the effects of this process are perhaps repeated in the acidic, churning environment of the stomach.\"</p> <p>Chewing, they almost scream at their colleagues, is only part of the story. In each little heap of remains from ancient meals, there be mystery aplenty. Prior to this experiment, archaeologists had to, and did, make all kinds of assumptions about the animal bones they dug up, especially what those partial skeletons might indicate about the people who presumably consumed them. Crandall and Stahl, through their disciplined lack of mastication, have given their colleagues something toothsome to think about.</p> <h2><strong>Is a pound of lead heavier than a pound of feathers? </strong></h2> <p>A pound of lead feels heavier than a pound of feathers, a thing long suspected, but not carefully tested until 2007, when Jeffrey B Wagman, Corinne Zimmerman and Christopher Sorric ran an experiment involving lead, feathers, plastic bags, cardboard boxes, a chair, blackened goggles and 23 volunteers from the town of Normal, Illinois.</p> <p>The scientists were based at <a href=\"http://illinoisstate.edu/\" title=\"\">Illinois State University</a>, which is located in that unassumingly named place. <a href=\"http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p5854\" title=\"\">In a study published in the journal <em>Perception</em>, they explained why they took the trouble. '\"Which weighs more \u2013 a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?'</a> The seemingly naive answer to this familiar riddle is the pound of lead, whereas the correct answer is that they weigh the same amount.\" But, they wrote, this \"naive answer may not be so naive after all. For over 100 years, psychologists have known that two objects of equal mass can feel unequally heavy depending on the mass distribution of those objects.\"</p> <p>Wagman, Zimmerman, and Sorric poured some lead shot into a plastic bag, then sealed and taped the bag inside the bottom of a cardboard box. For clarity, let's call this the box with lead in its bottom. Then they stuffed a pound of goose feathers into a large plastic bag. Feathers and bags being what they are, this fluffed, baggy entity entirely filled a box that looked just like the box with lead in its bottom. Let's call this snugly packed second box the box with feathers spread throughout its innards.</p> <p>Then came the test. One by one, the volunteers sat in the chair, donned the blackened goggles, then \"placed the palm of their preferred hand up with their fingers relaxed. On a given trial, each box was placed on the participant's palm in succession. The participant hefted each box and reported which box felt heavier.\"</p> <p>Slightly more often than not, the volunteers said that the box with lead in its bottom was heavier than the box with feathers spread thoughout its innards.</p> <p>After weighing and judging all the data, the scientists educatedly hazarded a guess as to why one box seemed heavier. Probably, they said, it's because \"the mass of the feathers was distributed more or less symmetrically in the box (ie the feathers filled the box), but the mass of the lead was distributed asymmetrically along the vertical axis (the box was \"bottom-heavy\"). Therefore the box containing lead was more difficult to control and it felt heavier.\"</p> <p>The scientists did not test how volunteers would respond if the lead were fixed precisely in the middle, rather stuck to the bottom, of the box. This they left for future scientists to contemplate.</p> <h2><strong>How should bosses choose who to promote?</strong></h2> <p>Three Italian researchers were awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel prize in management for demonstrating mathematically that organisations would become more efficient if they promoted people at random. But their research was neither the beginning nor the end of the story of how bureaucracies try \u2013 and fail \u2013 to find a good promotion method.</p> <p>Alessandro Pluchino, Andrea Rapisarda and Cesare Garofalo of the University of Catania, Sicily, calculated how a pick-at-random promotion scheme compares with other more enshrined methods. They gave details in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0455/\" title=\"\">a report published in the journal <em>Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications</em></a>.</p> <p>Pluchino, Rapisarda and Garofalo based their work on the Peter Principle \u2013 the notion that many people are promoted, sooner or later, to positions that overmatch their competence. The three cited the works of other researchers who had taken tentative, exploratory steps in the same direction. They failed, however, to mention an unintentionally daring 2001 <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/xr67g49g6l51558v/\" title=\"\">study by Steven E Phelan and Zhiang Lin, at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was published in the journal <em>Computational and Mathematical Organisation Theory</em></a>.</p> <p>Phelan and Lin wanted to see whether, over the long haul, it pays best to promote people on supposed merit (we try, one way or another, to measure how good you are), or on an \"up or out\" basis (either you get promoted quickly or you get the boot), or by seniority (live long and, by that measure alone, you will prosper). As a benchmark, a this-is-as-bad-as-it-could-possibly-get alternative, they also looked at what happened when you promoted people at random. They got a surprise: random promotion, they admitted, \"actually performed better\" than almost every other method. Phelan and Lin seemed (at least in my reading of their paper) almost shocked, even intimidated, by what they found.</p> <p>But where Pluchino, Rapisarda, and Garofalo would later, independently, hone and raise this discovery for the world to admire, Phelan and Lin merely muttered, ever so quietly in the middle of a long paragraph, that \"this needs to be further investigated in our future studies\". Then, by and large, they moved on to other things.</p> <p>More recently, Phedon Nicolaides, of the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht, the Netherlands, suggested what he saw as an improvement on random promotion: randomly choose the people who will make the promotion decisions. <a href=\"http://www.cyprus-mail.com/opinions/policy-making-hoof/20120715\" title=\"\">Professor Nicolaides published his scheme in the <em>Cyprus Mail</em> newspaper</a>.</p> <p>Another, very different, non-random method was devised for use by the US Air Force. <a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG678.html\" title=\"\">Details appeared in a 170-page paper prepared in 2008 by Michael Schiefer, Albert Robbert, John Crown, Thomas Manacapilli, and Carolyn Wong of the Rand Corporation.</a> But regardless of its merits, this scheme may have been doomed purely because it had a curious name. The report was called The Weighted Airman Promotion System.</p> <h2><strong>Do ethicists steal more&#xa0;books?</strong></h2> <p>\"One might suppose that ethicists would behave with particular moral scruple,\" begins a little 2009 monograph by two philosophy professors who specialise in ethics, embarking on what they call a \"preliminary investigation\" of their fellow experts.</p> <p>Eric Schwitzgebel, of the University of California, Riverside, and Joshua Rust, of Stetson University in Deland, Florida, surveyed almost 300 attendees of a meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.apaonline.org/\" title=\"\">American Philosophical Association</a>. Tell us, they asked in a variety of ways, about the ethical behaviour of ethicists you have known. Schwitzgebel and Rust offered candy to anyone who agreed to complete the survey form. They reported that \"a number of people stole candy without completing a questionnaire or took more than their share without permission\".</p> <p>The ethics experts in aggregate indicated that in their experience, on the whole, ethicists behave no more ethically than do other people. <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/PeerOpinion.htm\" title=\"\">The paper, published in the journal <em>Mind</em>,</a> pauses for just a moment to suggest a broader context. \"Police officers commit crimes,\" it says. \"Doctors smoke. Economists invest badly. Clergy flout the rules of their religion.\"</p> <p>Schwitzgebel also wrote a study, on his own, called <a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/EthicsBooks.htm\" title=\"\">Do Ethicists Steal More Books?</a>, which elbowed its way into the face of readers of the journal <em>Philosophical Psychology</em>. He drew up lists of philosophy books \u2013 some specifically about ethics, others not. Then, using information available through computer networks, he examined the status of every copy of those books in 19 British and 13 American academic library systems.</p> <p>Schwitzgebel looked separately at what happened to newish books (Buchanan's <em>Ethics, Efficiency and the Market</em>; Baron's <em>Kantian Ethics Almost Without Apology</em>; Hurd's <em>Moral Combat</em>; and suchlike bestsellers) and to older ones (Aristotle's <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>; Kant's <em>Critique of Judgment</em>; Nietzsche's <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> and other beloved masterworks).</p> <p>It was roughly the same story. The ethics books, whether youthful or aged, went missing more often than did the not-quite-so-relentlessly-about-ethics books. The youthful, \"relatively obscure, contemporary ethics books of the sort likely to be borrowed mainly by professors and advanced students of philosophy were actually about 50% more likely to be missing\". The aged, \"classic (pre-1900) ethics books were about twice as likely to be missing\". (For those older books, Schwitzgebel looked only at the American libraries, muttering that \"the British library catalogue system proved impractically unwieldy\".)</p>",

  "<p>Time is running out for many of Britain's most vulnerable people who are struggling to pay crippling care bills and could be eligible for several years backdated funding from a \"secret\" NHS scheme. If no one acts on their behalf before the end of next month the right to retrospective payments going back to 2004 will be lost.</p> <p>Every year thousands of family properties are sold to enable mainly elderly people to meet the costs of their care. But if the main reason for a person going into a home is ill-health they should be eligible for the virtually unknown Continuing Healthcare, which means that the NHS covers all the costs, including accommodation. There is no ceiling on the amount that can be paid out, there is no means test and it is not age-related.</p> <p>Anyone who is successful in claiming on behalf of a loved one could be entitled to have the payments backdated to April 2004, even if their relative is no longer alive. But applications must be submitted before 30 September.</p> <p>Under the present system (which could be set to change \u2013 see below), anyone moving into a care home in England with savings or assets of more than \u00a323,250 (\u00a322,000 in Wales; \u00a324,750 in Scotland) is liable for the entire costs \u2013 unless they are there because of a \"primary health need\". That shifts the financial responsibility to the health service.</p> <p>With care and nursing homes charging as much as \u00a31,000 a week, the expense can be enormous. \"Continuing Healthcare is a huge secret,\" says Lisa Morgan, a partner at solicitors <a href=\"http://www.hughjames.com/\" title=\"\">Hugh James</a>. \"People can't ask whether or not a member of their family is eligible if they don't know about it in the first place.</p> <p>\"Communication and information are even more important with the deadline approaching. The Department of Health said there would be a communication programme so as many people as possible would know about it. I've seen hardly any publicity. I'm worried that thousands of people are going to miss out.\"</p> <p>Access to Continuing Healthcare can be particularly difficult for those suffering from dementia. Michelle Mitchell, charity director general of <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Age UK</a>, is also concerned. \"The NHS needs to do more to make people aware of Continuing Healthcare, particularly for those families that may have been eligible in the past and are running out of time to make a claim,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Assessment does, to an extent, take mental health into account, but factors such as cognition and emotional health, key symptoms of dementia, are disappointingly not weighted as priorities,\" says Andrew Chidgey, director of external affairs at the Alzheimer's Society.</p> <p>While the charity does not have figures of how many people with dementia specifically access Continuing Healthcare, the latest estimate suggests it is only 46,599. There are around 100,000 people with late-stage dementia, so the charity believes many more should be eligible.</p> <p>Anyone thinking of applying should be prepared for a long battle</p> <p>The first step is to contact your local primary care trust (PCT) and ask for an assessment. If you can't find the necessary contact details, call NHS Direct (0845 4647).</p> <p>The initial screening is designed to see if there is a case for eligibility \u2013 it cannot, in itself, lead to automatic payment. Usually, a claim is rejected at this stage.</p> <p>\"If you are not satisfied with the outcome, challenge the decision,\" says Morgan. In theory, you should be told why your application has been turned down.</p> <p>Should the initial check suggest that a person may be eligible, the PCT will call on what is known in the jargon as the \"decision support tool\", which involves a series of separate assessments covering 12 different \"care domains\" \u2013 including behaviour, skin condition and mobility. The results can take weeks.</p> <p>The chance of success depends greatly on where you live. There is a \"national framework\" which covers England and Wales, but all the evidence points to a postcode lottery. (Continuing Healthcare is available in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the eligibility criteria differ and the 30 September deadline does not apply.)</p> <p>\"Different PCTs interpret the rules differently,\" says independent financial adviser Russell Hall of <a href=\"http://www.almarygreen.com/\" title=\"\">Almary Green</a>.</p> <p>However, anyone who is turned down can take heart from what has become known as the \"Coughlan test\".</p> <p>Pamela Coughlan needed full-time care after she was paralysed in a road accident. This was paid for by the NHS until her local health authority transferred responsibility to the social services, which meant she was subject to means-testing and had to pay the costs herself. After a two-year legal battle that went to the Court of Appeal, the ruling was that the responsibility for looking after someone with severe medical problems lies squarely with the health service, and therefore savings and assets don't come into the equation about who picks up the bill.</p> <p>But, despite the ruling, many people still find they have to call on a solicitor.</p> <p>Lawyer Jennifer Margrave, a member of the 1,300-strong organisation <a href=\"http://www.solicitorsfortheelderly.com/\" title=\"\">Solicitors for the Elderly</a>, says: \"We can show someone who is not used to medical issues how to interpret the evidence.\"</p> <p>Many solicitors will offer representation on a no-win, no-fee basis \u2013 otherwise typical fees are around \u00a32,000.</p> <p>You can keep costs down by doing a lot of the legwork. Vital evidence to support your case is often found in the records of care homes, hospitals and GPs. Ask to see these under the Access to Medical Records Act.</p> <p>\"It helps if you have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/blog/2011/sep/10/power-of-attorney\" title=\"\">power of attorney</a>,\" says Margrave. \"If not, argue that, as next of kin, you are protecting your relative's interests.\"</p> <p>There are alternatives to paying for a solicitor. Age UK offers free advice, as do other charities including the Alzheimer's Society.</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesman said of the impending deadline: \"We asked the local NHS in March to let people know about it and would encourage people to contact their local primary care trust if they think they are eligible.</p> <p>\"The deadline allows for a minimum of 12 months between the period of care in question and the deadline.</p> <p>\"And we have provided for exceptional circumstances which mean that some cases may still be accepted after the deadline.</p> <p>\"It is appropriate to set deadlines because it becomes more difficult with the passage of time to properly evaluate people's historical needs.\"</p> <h2>Family claims \u00a3100,000 after three-year legal battle<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394936964\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345214045403/Edna-Witt-case-study-phot-001.jpg\" alt=\"Edna Witt case study photo\" width=\"220\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Happier times: Edna Witt</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hasson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The weary family of 88-year-old Edna Witt, who suffers from Alzheimer's, finally had to enlist the help of a lawyer to claw back more than \u00a3100,000 she was entitled to for care home fees.</p> <p>Time and again since her mother's diagnosis seven years ago, Julie Burton was told she wasn't eligible for Continuing Healthcare funding. This was despite the fact that, as well as Alzheimer's, Mrs Witt had been diagnosed with a string of serious medical problems including a heart condition and acute mental health problems that, on one occasion, caused her to attempt to strangle another patient in her Eastbourne care home.</p> <p>Her family would not take no for answer. \"This is not money we have 'won' \u2013 it is money that never should have been taken from my mother in the first place,\" Mrs Burton, of Ringmer, East Sussex stresses.</p> <p>When Mrs Witt went into care, Mrs Burton says: \"Social services swooped on us and wanted to see all her bank accounts. They asked if she had her own house. When we told them she did, they said we would have to sell it to pay for the costs of her care.\"</p> <p>It all became such a bureaucratic nightmare that, at the beginning of 2009, they contacted solicitors Hugh James, and began what turned into a legal battle that lasted well over three years.</p> <p>\"To be honest, we would have given up without the help of the solicitors,\" says Mrs Burton \"The way the PCT acted was appalling.\"</p> <p>Mrs Witt had gone into care in 2005 after the death of husband, Clifford, hastened the onset of dementia.</p> <p>\"She went downhill very quickly,\" says Mrs Burton. \"We just couldn't look after her any longer. Each time they turned us down we told them to go back and look at my mother again. It's a box-ticking exercise. They almost always tell the relatives 'no'. But don't accept it \u2013 you have the right to appeal and demand a formal assessment.\"</p> <p>She advises anyone who encounters the same difficulties to submit as much evidence as they can. She believes the home's daily care records were key, but the family also acquired hospital notes and details from Mrs Witt's GP.</p> <p>\"A lot of people give up,\" says Mrs Burton. \"You have to remain strong and carry on. Have your facts ready and be prepared to challenge their decisions.\"</p>",
  "<p>For an artist renowned for her madness and sadness, it's surprising just how downright saucy Chan Marshall is. \"You're using your teeth!\" she crows when I suck a wedge of post-tequila shot lime. \"I'm jus' kiddin' \u2013 you're suckin' \u2013 I'm just&#xa0;kiddin'.\"</p> <p>It's late and we're in a fabulously tacky Miami Beach bar, the kind where the umbrella-bedecked drinks are wearing more clothes than the clientele. This night began when, hours after I had interviewed Marshall in her beachside condo, I answered my phone to a hammy cockney voice talking nonsense. When I asked who it was she'd answered: \"Your worst nightmare \u2013 get your dancing shoes on.\"</p> <p>As far as drinking companions go, Marshall is the opposite of a nightmare \u2013 she buys rounds, proffers cigarettes and charms and disarms a swelling crowd of strangers with her irrepressible shimmying around the dancefloor.</p> <p>Tonight, she's the life and soul, but the more common image of her is as tortured singer-songwriter Cat Power, an emotionally intense, psychologically fragile artist who for the past 17 years has bewitched fans with a voice that prompted the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/12/10/071210crmu_music_frerejones\" title=\"\"><em>New Yorker</em>, in 2007, to deem her</a> \"a conjurer\" worthy of comparison with Patti Smith and Nina&#xa0;Simone.</p> <p>Back in 2005, at university, I walked into a stairwell flooded with the sound of 1998's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/88d34969-dd30-32ee-a28b-eb8015f07116\" title=\"\"><em>Moon Pix,</em></a> Marshall's fourth album and the one that ensnared a legion of ardent fans. Her voice stopped me in my tracks. The body of that album was written during one night spent alone, hallucinating in a South Carolina farmhouse, and it sounds like it \u2013 a keening, sad, dark, confused nightmare of a record, as gorgeous as it is unsettling. The friend playing it at full volume was, like seemingly every other boy in my year, hopelessly in love with her.</p> <p>But it's a fallacy that the best music always comes out of anguish. Six years after her last collection of original material, Marshall is finally about to release a new album, and the shock is not just that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/71ca1851-2de4-42e4-b72e-40917118dfa9\" title=\"\"><em>Sun</em></a> is her best yet, but that it is also the most jubilant.</p> <p>When we first meet, we sit on the roof terrace of her Miami Beach condo. Or, rather, I sit, while, like a little girl arranging a play house, she fusses happily with a rug and table for our drinks, narrating all the while in a breathless logorrhoea. She seems childlike now, but on the album, which she produced and on which she plays every note of every instrument, she sounds like an artist in supreme control&#xa0;of her gifts.</p> <p>Finally settled with tequila and cigarettes, I tell her this. She takes a drag and slowly, grimly shakes her head. \"Thank God,\" she exhales. \"It was very trying. It was totally a challenge.\"</p> <p>But she admits that she's done much less \"shaking hands with the dark side\" on this one. Marshall has always used the word \"triumphant\" to describe her music, which, hearing the raw sorrow of her first three albums, seemed ridiculous. Now she's made an album that fits the description. Even the most plaintively titled track, Always On My Own, has at its heart an affirmative \"I want to live my way of living\" attitude. That sentiment is magnified on the album's penultimate song, a joyfully unspooling 11 minutes titled Nothing But Time, on which she exults: \"It's up to you/ To be a superhero/ It's up to you/ To be like nobody.\" There are shouts of \"they wanna live!\" in the background before Iggy Pop joins her in the refrain: \"The world is just beginning.\"</p> <p>When she talks about her triumphs, her words come in staccato, elliptical bursts, and it can be a struggle to keep up. \"[I have been] empowering myself to realise that no other human, no matter who it is, can invalidate my way of thinking. I'm triumphing over all the different ways in my life I've been invalidated and I can still smile and laugh and know that in my heart I'm making the right choices for myself. Maybe somebody else doesn't agree but that's not my problem.\"</p> <p>And then she stops and a child-like smile creeps on to her face. Why is she&#xa0;laughing?</p> <p>\"Because I don't know what I'm saying! We're born and we die alone, I guess. So you have to take care of yourself.\"</p> <p>Is she better at doing that now?</p> <p>\"I'm better at understanding that I have to. I always thought I was going to pass away or whatever. I used to wish I had a lobotomy. But I don't want to pass away any more. I want to keep [she drops her head and claps her hands twice above her in the air, smartly, like she's sealing a spell] <em>living</em>.\"</p> <p>She once said that all creativity comes from a place where we don't have love and she's standing by that.</p> <p>\"Because,\" she says, upping her southern twang, \"if we had love we'd be busy fucken'!\"</p> <p>I wonder whether not having love is a perverse sort of blessing, in terms of yielding songs such as these.</p> <p>She frowns. \"You crazy? Love is much better than creativity!\"</p> <p>So if she had to choose between never writing a song again and\u2026</p> <p>\"Love!\" she cries before I can finish. \"You kiddin' me?\"</p> <p>Most of <em>Sun</em> was made while Marshall was with actor Giovanni Ribisi. He ended their relationship of three years in March this year with a phone call. Four months later, he married model Agyness Deyn. At one point, she says \"my boyfriend\" and corrects herself to \"my ex\". Later, she begins: \"Since the break-up\u2026\", but is characteristically derailed by another thought. Marshall had moved to LA in 2009 to be with him and his teenage daughter, with whom she's particularly close, and in interviews conducted during this time she'd talked about how much she was enjoying being a mother.</p> <p>Her relationship with her own mother has been volatile. Charlyn Marie Marshall was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1972 to Myra Lee and Charlie Marshall, a blues musician. She and her younger sister, Miranda, had an unstable and itinerant childhood, suffering their parents' alcoholism, mental health problems and divorce. Marshall finally settled back in Atlanta, where she worked in a pizza parlour called Fellini's for three years and gained local fame as the hottie behind the counter.</p> <p>In 1992, she moved to New York with her friend, the late musician Glen Thrasher, through whom she experienced the more avant garde edges of the city's rock scene. Two years later, she recorded 20 songs in a single day, and they formed her first two albums, 1995's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/b1d7bce1-68e4-38c7-8b17-164e0dceced3\" title=\"\"><em>Dear Sir</em></a> and 1996's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/dc58d3f2-cdea-3006-a998-21d614bed5e1\" title=\"\"><em>Myra Lee</em></a>. Later in 1996 she signed to Matador and released the acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/eadb8f2e-3924-314e-9565-eaee3b6a51e5\" title=\"\"><em>What Would the Community Think</em></a>. From there on her stardom was assured, even if her feelings about it were anything but.</p> <p>\"First interview,\" she explains. \"Bam. I didn't want to do it. Didn't know where I was, what was going on. Losing my mind. Thoughts of Satan and all that shit. Control and oppression. Secrets, lies, blah blah blah.\" She remembers hiding in a hotel room bed while a 17-year-old fanzine editor waited anxiously to talk to her.</p> <p>\"Eventually, I just say [to the fan], 'I just wanna fucking <em>kill</em> myself!' And then she turns to me, and she's full of anger and sobbing, and she says, 'If you give up, then I give up'. When she told me that, it was a transference of self\u2026 I&#xa0;just had to help <em>her</em>.\"</p> <p>She hasn't always dealt with her fans' emotional hunger so simply. Her notoriously irregular live shows reached their nadir in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/05/arts/pop-review-performance-anxiety-hiding-onstage.html\" title=\"\">well-documented</a> performance at Manhattan's Bowery Ballroom in 1999. Prostrate and foetal on the floor of the auditorium, she sang the dirge-like Cross Bones Style with her nose pressed into the ground, while fans gathered round her awkwardly, stroking her and murmuring consolations.</p> <p>She admits that it's taken her years even to believe in her fans' existence, let alone their love for her. \"It's out of fear of rejection. Because I went to so many different schools and I was always the outsider. You know, the new kid who doesn't have friends.\"</p> <p>The song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRcl_TefEak\" title=\"\">I Don't Blame You</a>, from 2003's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/b24234fc-1afd-34df-9c42-92cb51cc0a36\" title=\"\"><em>You Are Free</em></a>, has been taken as a rejection of fans' demands, specifically the lines: \"They never owned it/ And you never owed it to them anyway.\" Online message boards have been filled with speculation over who it's about \u2013 Marshall herself or some other fame-troubled singer?</p> <p>\"I've never told anybody this,\" she says, \"but that is about Kurt Cobain. It's about him blowing his head off.\"</p> <p>That song is not her only moment of Cobain kinship. Hate takes the title of a Nirvana track for its refrain \u2013 \"I hate myself and I want to die\" \u2013 and it's the bleakest moment on 2006's <em>The Greatest</em>, her soul-soaked and languorous seventh album. Recorded with the feted Memphis Rhythm Band, it brims with a resigned, hard-won peace. And yet weeks before the record's release, and with her label preparing for her stardom to go stratospheric, she suffered a psychotic breakdown and was hospitalised. She's been on medication for bipolar disorder since then.</p> <p>All of which somehow makes improbable her confession that she would like to be a comedian, specifically a performer on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. \"I've been trying for years,\" she says. \"Kristen Wiig's gone now so\u2026 I'll just have to lose a bunch of weight. She got so skinny.\"</p> <p>The next night, I get a text&#xa0;message: \"Shelborne Hotel NOW!!! KARAOKE!!!!\" Once again, Marshall orders rounds and rounds of tequila and sodas, pushing them up and down the bar towards people while chain-smoking from a packet stashed in a cowboyish black leather holster.</p> <p>Hours later, the party moves to beside her pool and some of that southern hospitality kicks in as she bustles around lending swimsuits and assembling a tray of drinks and snacks. At some point \u2013 bottles of tequila drunk, joints smoked \u2013 her iPod&#xa0;speakers are casting Nina Simone's Wild is the Wind, a song that Marshall has covered, out into the sultry Miami night.</p> <p>\"For we're creatures of the wind,\" Simone sings, \"and wild is the wind,\" and then, by some uncanny magic, the palm trees begin to stir and the night erupts into a rainstorm. Rods of water begin hammering the surface of the pool, but Marshall can't be persuaded indoors. She remains sitting between those palm trees in the turquoise pool light, cross-legged, rocking back and forth, smoking in the rain.</p>",

  "<p>They were there in their thousands, leaning against tin shacks or sitting in the dusty veld: miners and their wives still looking for answers after a massacre by South African police that left 34 striking workers dead. A red T-shirt worn by a rally organiser seemed to offer one, stating: \"Fuck capitalism.\"</p> <p>The huge crowd erupted as a charismatic young politician, Julius Malema, took the microphone. He is seen by some as a dangerous demagogue, but to the grieving, angry community at the Lonmin mine in Marikana he came as a messiah offering a radical future.</p> <p>\"The British are owning this mine,\" he said. \"The British are making money out of this mine ... It is not the British who were killed. It is our black brothers. But it is not these brothers who are mourned by the president. Instead he goes to meet capitalists in air-conditioned offices.\"</p> <p>Malema was expelled this year as president of the youth wing of the governing African National Congress after falling out with President Jacob Zuma, whom he accuses of failing to challenge \"white monopoly capital\". He has since been in the political wilderness; once contemptuous of the media, he now courts it. As the Marikana tragedy lays bare discontent over inequalities 18 years after apartheid, he senses his moment.</p> <p>\"President Zuma said to the police they must act with maximum force. He did not say act with restraint. He presided over the murder of our people and therefore he must step down. Not even apartheid government killed so many people ... From today, when you are asked 'Who is your president', you must say 'I don't have a president'.\"</p> <p>There were cheers from people whose votes the ANC can no longer take for granted after 18 years in government.</p> <p>It was the promises of a militant union that stirred violence at Marikana, where the ANC-aligned National Union of Mineworkers has been losing support. Malema hopes this will be mirrored on the national stage, where he accuses the ANC of failing to pursue economic freedom as it did political freedom, leaving millions of black people poor and disenfranchised. He wants mines to be seized from private companies and nationalised. The call appears to be gaining traction in Marikana, where workers are demanding from Lonmin, whose HQ is in London, a wage increase from 4,000 rand (\u00a3300) to 12,500 rand a month.</p> <p>\"Lonmin treat us like dogs,\" said Thembelani Khonto, 24. \"When you're underground, it's like you're a slave and they don't know you. But on the surface people who don't do anything in offices are earning more than us.\"</p> <p>Siphiwo Gqala, 25, said he sometimes spends up to 14 hours a day underground but does not receive overtime pay. \"It's dangerous work,\" he said. \"Sometimes you go down there and a rock falls and you die. Big vehicles can come and kill you.\" Recalling Thursday's massacre, he said: \"I've never seen something like that: people killed like chickens. One of my friends is still missing. I don't know if he's in the hospital or the mortuary.\"</p> <p>The impact on the community will be far-reaching, added Gqala, who lives in a shack because house rentals are too high. \"Women come here from Eastern Cape with their husbands, who are the breadwinners. If someone has five children, how will they live? I have two young brothers depending on me. What if I die? Who's going to look after them?\"</p> <p>The conditions leave people like Gqala looking for radical solutions. \"The mine must be nationalised. We support Julius Malema and the youth league for saying the mines must be nationalised. Now they're starting to shoot us. If we die today, all of us must die: we no longer want to work here.\"</p> <p>Two days after the shooting, in which 34 people died and 78 were injured, many families are still waiting to learn the miners' fate. A casualty list has still not been published and there is little information on who is dead, injured or under arrest. Wives have been turned away from local clinics and hospitals.</p> <p>A 22-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, had lost a loved one in the shooting. \"He was shot in cold blood,\" she said. \"My tears have not dried; I cried all day. I'm worried about things like who's going to feed the kids he left behind. No one is going to give the love to his children like their father.\"</p> <p>Elizabeth Makana, 48, a widow whose brother-in-law was wounded, said: \"They treat the miners like dogs. The miners take the risk to dig platinum, but the people who sit in offices make the money.\"</p> <p>Lonmin defended its treatment of mine workers. A community development brochure published by the company describes extensive health, education, infrastructure and economic projects in the area. Spokesman James Clark said: \"We absolutely recognise the hugely positive relationship we have with communities living in the area and doing the best we can for them and their families goes to the heart of our business. It's why we do so much around health and education, but we're not complacent. We do the best we can and try to do better every time.\"</p> <p>That will not satisfy Malema and his constituency, however, who argue that the ANC has been too moderate for too long, bending the knee to western corporations. Flashpoints like Marikana expose the fissures in a party that contains capitalists and communists.</p> <p>Aubrey Matshiqi, a research fellow at the Helen Suzman Foundation, said: \"I think the people of Marikana, particularly the miners, see themselves as the manifestation of the gap between mineral wealth and socioeconomic conditions. The death of so many miners has amplified the extent to which Julius Malema's views on mine nationalisation resonate with the people in the area.\"</p> <p>He added: \"You have the ANC that some people believe has been too pragmatic and sold out and bent over backwards for foreign capital at the expense of the people. Julius Malema suggests that a better life for all would be possible under someone like him. If he is wrong, you will have populism and disappointment that will lead to conflict.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the past week there has been much talk about football's inability to match the charm, humility and humanity of the Olympics. On Monday evening, in a corner of a foreign field, there will be an antidote to such concerns.</p> <p>Langholmen FC, a fledgling, English-speaking club with a number of British and Irish expats, will meet IFK Gothenburg in the last 64 of the Swedish Cup. This is the romance of the cup in excelsis, and a comparison between the two sides makes David look like a lively outsider when he met&#xa0;Goliath.</p> <p>Gothenburg, founded in 1904, are the most successful club in Swedish history, with 18 championships and two Uefa Cups. Langholmen are only 10 years old and lie second from bottom of Division 4, the sixth tier of Swedish football. They have 10 teams above them in the league and a further 276 in the Swedish football pyramid.</p> <p>\"It's probably the equivalent of Manchester United playing a good county-level side, two levels below the Conference,\" says Andrew O'Sullivan, the left midfielder and press officer. Imagine Manchester United against Stocksbridge Park Steels or Hemel Hempstead Town in the FA Cup. Exactly. \"We would have to have a miraculous performance, they would have to leave their minds behind in Gothenburg, and only then would there be any chance of us unsettling them. As a player, the original feeling of excitement has now changed into the slight fear of a 16-0 thrashing.\"</p> <p>The Gothenburg squad includes Tobias Hysen, the son of the former Liverpool defender Glenn. His last match was for Sweden against Brazil on Wednesday. \"A seamless transition of quality,\" says O'Sullivan.</p> <p>Brazil almost certainly has more football players than Langholmen does people. It's a tiny island famous for two things: it was a prison island until 1975 \u2013 which is why Langholmen play in black-and-white stripes \u2013 and it has a Schnapps factory.</p> <p>Langholmen's shirts are sponsored by Southside, \"Stockholm's best and friendliest Irish pub\". It's the team's unofficial clubhouse, with memorabilia adorning the walls. The pub staff store and wash the kit, while providing Chips of Victory \u2013 or Chips of Mediocrity \u2013 after each game. It seems fair to assume that ice baths and Gatorade chasers are not on offer.</p> <p>The club started when a group of friends, mainly British and Irish, met for a regular Saturday morning kickaround on a gravel pitch. A few years later they set up a team and joined the Swedish football pyramid at the bottom in Division 8. Langholmen were promoted five times in the first seven years and even spent a season in the national, semi-professional Division 3. They now have six men's teams and two women's teams and are exploring the possibility of a youth scheme.</p> <p>They usually play at Essinge IP (known as the Rock), a pitch in a residential area with a car park that has precisely seven spaces. For this match they have hired Grimsta IP, the home ground of the second-tier team IF&#xa0;Brommapojkarna.</p> <p>\"The logistics behind this game are such that we wouldn't be able to control security or fit enough people round the pitch,\" says O'Sullivan. Their usual attendance of around 50 is expected to rise to between 800 and 1,000. They tried for the Olympic Stadium but it was already booked. \"Maybe,\" says O'Sullivan, \"Bruce Springsteen is in town.\"</p> <p>O'Sullivan works for a brand consultancy. There aren't any butchers, bakers or candlestick makers, but, in the best cup underdog tradition, the team come from all walks of life: there is a teacher, an accountant, an IT project manager, a carpenter, a recruitment consultant, an IT programmer, a physiotherapist, a telecoms salesman, a subway driver and a bunch of students. The manager, Stuart Lascelles, runs a gym.</p> <p>Most will work on the day of the game \u2013 and the morning after, too, even if it seems fair to suggest that productivity will not be at an all-time high as the events and the drinks of the previous night swirl round their heads.</p> <p>Langholmen were entered into the Swedish Cup by virtue of making the final of last season's Stockholm Cup. Victories in the first two rounds took them into the last 64, the point at which the big sides join the draw. \"We hoped for a big club but thought we'd probably get some team nobody had heard of,\" O'Sullivan says. \"When it happened I was at work and got a text from one my team-mates, which said: 'Have you seen it?' I'd completely forgotten about the draw so I replied: 'Have I seen what? What are you on about? You're freaking&#xa0;me out.' Then all hell broke loose. It was pandemonium.\"</p> <p>SVT, the Swedish equivalent of the BBC, have interviewed the team on a number of occasions. They were on the national news, and even trended on Twitter for a few hours last week. They have had shirts reprinted for the game with additional sponsorship, while a local Welsh and Irish butchers will put on a barbecue at the game.</p> <p>\"This is what we've been working towards for 10 years,\" says the chairman, Mats Gustavsson. \"We are ambitious, we set ourselves high standards, and in many ways this high-profile opportunity is a reflection of all the hard work put into the club by a dedicated band of members and&#xa0;supporters.\"</p> <p>As such there will be an inevitable rush for souvenirs at the final whistle. \"What is the general etiquette of shirt swapping at the end of a game these days?\" O'Sullivan asks. \"They won't want our shirts will they? But I quite fancy one of theirs \u2026\"</p>",
  "<p>I have no private access to the particulars of the current situation, but it seems likely that the impasse between Kevin Pietersen and the England management and team is not just a matter of the recent text messages (whatever they contained). It must have been an accumulation of factors, of situations, of mounting frustration and/or provocation. As Andrew Strauss said on Wednesday, there is a breakdown of trust, and the players and management have simply had enough. The texting must have been the last straw.</p> <p>Impasses always in part reflect on the management and captaincy, for it is the job of leaders to get the best out of a team, especially from star players like Pietersen. On the other hand, there can be individuals who make life impossible and create situations that have simply gone too far to continue with. Sometimes the leaders or powers-that-be have failed over time to understand the difficult individual sufficiently to build trust and impress upon him that certain behaviour is unacceptable. But the other party to the dispute may be hell-bent on destructiveness, or on pushing his antagonist \u2013 enraged or despairing \u2013 to act.</p> <p>Sometimes the impasse results from bad chemistry, each party to the conflict getting under the other's skin, pressing, as we say, the other's buttons, so that tiny pinpricks, as in domestic disputes and breakdowns, become infected wounds, even bones of contention.</p> <p>In my experience cricket teams are full of strong and sometimes difficult characters, people who have the drive and ambition to succeed at the highest level and to sustain that success under the spotlight. It is often the rest of the team that can help to contain and make the most of such self-destructive and sometimes damaging characters. For instance, one resource for the insecure is to become a joker, to get attention by arousing laughter, by mocking those in authority or pretending not to care, and I have known teams refuse to go along with such actions or playacting, refraining from laughter at the individual's indiscipline or shenanigans, and refusing to be cowed by the latter's arrogance.</p> <p>I had one long conversation with Pietersen in 2008, when he was captaining England, on a long plane journey between Chennai and Mohali. He struck me as more thoughtful and generous than I had expected. He commented that it had been a privilege to watch from close quarters the great Sachin Tendulkar score a hundred (an innings that had just won the recent Test match for India); he appreciated that cricket disasters (losing a Test match, for instance) bear no relation to real-life disaster (such as being severely disabled, like the young man whom the Indian team funded to follow their home matches all over the vast country). It seemed to me that he was willing to listen as well as to talk.</p> <p>After seeing these last two of his three Test matches in charge, and after my long talk with him, I had some hopes of him as a captain. But then in what seems to be a characteristic piece of misjudgment he threw his chance away by trying to get the coach, Peter Moores, along with the then assistant coach, Andy Flower, sacked. The outcome was that Moores and he were, while Flower became the England coach.</p> <p>Misjudgment seems to me to be one of Pietersen's main failings. I do not think he is malicious or in a deliberate way destructive. He is unable to control himself, words come out of his mouth (or on to his Twitter site) without a second thought. If any of us inflicted our stream of consciousness on the world at large, with no further reflection, no simple common sense in the form of a modicum of diplomacy and reticence, we would cut ridiculous or tricky or outrageous figures. I daresay he would have fared better in a time when there were no mobile phones, no tweeting, when foolish rants were more likely to be confined to the pillow or behind closed doors. He has been his own worst enemy.</p> <p>My impression is that he is an insecure and divided person. Perhaps he needs more reassurance about his value and his standing \u2013 I remember being surprised (though I shouldn't have been) at how much praise some fine players needed, how much they benefited from being told (truthfully) how good they were. I imagine that his mood switches from high to low, so that he is liable either to be over the top, regarding himself as above reproach, untouchable, able to get away with anything, or else to be low, from which position he feels the need to build himself up, to excite himself by provoking responses, even negative ones.</p> <p>Pietersen cannot resist drawing attention to himself (if that has been his aim, however unconsciously, he must have exceeded his hopes in the days leading up to the current match). But now he must be suddenly aware of how so much of that attention has been of the wrong kind; instead of the great charge given to him when striding out to bat for England, when going full throttle for the opposition bowling, he is off the big stage.</p> <p>His replacement, Jonny Bairstow, showed terrific promise and presence in scoring 95, and his success has made us miss Pietersen less. However good the latter is \u2013 and he is remarkably good, a cricketing genius even, capable like no one else since the great Viv Richards of turning a game round through his own intense and powerful skills \u2013 he is now in the wings, off-stage, not forgotten but done without. He is not indispensable.</p> <p>I suspect there is no stomach for easy rapprochement in the England set-up, and that it will be up to Pietersen to show some contrition and be willing to look at his own contribution to the difficulties before he is tolerated in the team, let alone welcomed back with open arms.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Brief preamble:</strong> I've been on cricket duty so sorry for the late filing. Opening day always used to evoke for me the inspirational sentiments expressed so vividly by the great baseball writer Thomas Boswell in his essay Why Time Begins on Opening Day. \"Born to an age where horror has become commonplace, where tragedy has, by its monotonous repetition, become a parody of sorrow,\" Boswell wrote in 1984, \"we need to fence off a few parks where humans try to be fair, where skill has some hope of reward, where absurdity has a harder time than usual getting a ticket.\" Already, after a series of extraordinary Premier League results, hope is dashed for QPR and Norwich and Liverpool have hardly ushered in the Brendan Rodgers era with confidence, grumbles from my colleagues about refereeing notwithstanding.</p> <p>For this match between the fourth and fifth-placed teams last season, the joy of their pristine fixture lists is the hope writ large throughout them. Will Newcastle be able to build on last season. How will Papiss Ciss\u00e9 fare in a full season? Tottenham have a new manager, a new system and a fine new midfielder in Gylfi Sigurdsson. What will we learn? Let's find out here and also have a look on Monday when the \"five things we learned\" feature we've run for the past few seasons reappears as \"10 things we learned\". </p> <p><strong>Here are your teams:</strong><br><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Krul; Simpson, Steven Taylor, Perch, Santon; Ben Arfa, Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye, Guti\u00e9 rrez; Ciss\u00e9, Ba. <br>Subs: Harper, Williamson, Anita, Gosling, Ryan Taylor, Shola Ameobi, Obertan. <br><strong>Tottenham:</strong> Friedel; Walker, Kaboul, Gallas, Assou-Ekotto; Livermore, Sandro; Lennon, Sigurdsson, Bale; Defoe. <br>Subs: Cudicini, Vertonghen, Van der Vaart, Naughton, Jenas, Townsend, <br>Kane. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Omens:</strong> ESPN has just said that these two have met three times for the first match of the season with Spurs winning all three. Yet Newcastle have won four and drawn two of the past six at St James' Park. Andr\u00e9 Villas Boas says he didn't pick Vertonghen because Kaboul and Gallas have more experience. Coloccini is out with a thigh strain for the Toon, meaning James Perch comes in. I liked his work as a central midfield holding player last season, not so sure of him at centre-half.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Substitute change:</strong> Shola Ameobi has hurt his hamstring in the warm-up and though Newcastle wanted to name Marveaux as his replacement but they're still trying to locate him \u2026 now they've named Amalfitano instead.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> New season, new season bookies' ads to gladden the heart. We're away Newcastle begin as ESPN announces that Alex Song has joined Barcelona from Arsenal for \u00a316m. Spurs attack up the right through Lennon and Walker, a pair of speedsters, but Santon reads their intentions and blocks out Walker's pass for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Taken by corner specialist Sigurdsson, Kaboul tries to turn and shoot and Perch blocks. Another corner which Newcastle clear up the field where when Spurs build again Tiot\u00e9 slides into Sigurdsson with huge force, but fairly, and looks to have come off worst.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Tiot\u00e9 jogs back on after a minute getting treatment to his knee. Assou-Ekotto chips a 70-yard pass forward for Bale, Taylor holds him off and ushers the ball out for a goalkick. Bale wears Taylor's arm on the nose, accidental I think. He's wearing the No11 shirt this season, Bale.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Gutierrez wins a free-kick as he dribbles through midfield to the left of centre, just in side the Spurs' half. Sandro clears the cross. Ben Arfa's cross when it breaks down flies out to Lennon who storms forward, slips a pass through to Sandro who has made great ground. he miskicks it and his shot finds Sigurdsson, who is given offside in the area when clattered into by Krul but he shouldn't have been.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Tottenham look very quick and dangerous on the break. Newcastle have another free-kick just inside the Spurs half. Cabaye drills it to the far post from the left of the field and Friedel plucks it out of the air.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Loose interplay between Perch and Santon gives the ball away 30 yards from goal and Sigurdsson curls a peach of a cross to the far post but bale had already cut inside.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Good strong tackle from Gutierrez blocks Walker's cross. Sigurdsson looks a real livewire in this formation, just behind Defoe but drifting wide, particularly to the right to overload with Walker and Lennon. That's what made Gutierrez's intervention so vital and a reward for his reading of the danger.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Danny Simpson gives away a free kick on the left and is booked. Sigurdsson loops the cross-shot over the bar. Anita is about to come on for Tiot\u00e9 even if Tiot\u00e9 keeps telling Pardew he wants to carry on.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Livermore brings down Ben Arfa in the centre-circle and he gets a booking for that tame-looking trip. Anita goes back to warming up with his high-vis vest on rather than standing on the touchline with the manager whispering into his ear.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Newcastle have been on the back foot too much to get Ciss\u00e9 and Ba on the ball. They just tried to get a quick break again from the middle of the field when Sandro grabs Ben Arfa's arm to hold back his run. He joins Livermore in the book.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Ba drops back to link up the play when Tiot\u00e9 retreats as a shield in front of his centre-halfs. He laid it off to Simpson then sprinted forward to take the long diagonal pass but Gallas squeezed him out. A moment later Ciss\u00e9 almost scores with a 25-yard shot that takes a deflection, flat foots Friedel and trickles past his right post. This is a far better spell for Newcastle now.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Spurs free-kick for Ben Arfa's shirt tug, 40 yards from goal on the left. Bale swings in a cross but Newcastle see out the danger, holding off Walker's attempt to recover possession by the right touchline.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Simpson brings down Bale, well thrusts out his leg and Bale falls over it. Gallas asks the ref why there was no second yellow card for Simpson but Atkinson shoos him off. Thirty yards from goal, Sigurdsson gets it up and over the wall, and it dips viciously towards Krul's right post. The keeper plays safe and palms it into touch for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> An email from Andrew Mullinder: \"I'm still unconvinced about whether Cisse and Ba can be an effective pair. They should be an excellent pair, but it seems to me that in this half they've both made the same run, looking to get behind the Tottenham defence, or against the last defender, when it needed one to drop off. How many times have we been forced to lump it long from midfield?\" Quite a few Andrew, though in the past five minutes Ba has started to track back and look for shorter passes from Cabaye.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Sigurdsson, who must have had more touches than anyone else, tries a pot shot from 25 yards, left of centre, that skips past the goal. He didn't exactly connect with the full force of his right foot. But speaking of him, here's poor Matt Dony: \"Right, I've already had to put up with Liverpool being edged out by the mighty West Brom, now I've got to read about how well Gylfi's playing as well? It's a day for what-might-have-beens. I suspect there may be more to come over the next nine months or so \u2026\" Hope abandoned. See Nadezhda Mandelstam but for less flippant reasons.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Excellent move from Spurs, Sandro storming through the centre circle on a direct dribbling run. He lays it off to Sigurdsson who slips in Defoe cutting in from the left and his shot hits the post and rebounds into the middle of the area by the penalty spot but away from Lennon who was driving in from the right. Perch hooks it clear.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Newcastle have upped their pressing in midfield with Ba and Ciss\u00e9 hustling the Spurs back four for the first time. Their defence takes a higher line, too. They need to knock Tottenham off their stride and cut out Sigurdsson's space.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Spurs hit the woodwork again when Lennon sells Santon a dummy which the defender buys. Lennon feints left and goes right, standing up a cross to the far post where Bale leaps to meet it and heads it on to the bar.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> A cry goes up. But it's Rob Smyth greeting the fall of Jacques Kallis's wicket. Newcastle throw in and Ben Arfa and Simpson combine on the right to hit a back-post cross which Friedel punches to start a counterattack. Sigurdsson again feed Defoe who cuts inside on to his left foot and shoots over. All in 10 seconds from Newcastle having the ball by the corner flag at the other end.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Chris Waddle may have divided loyalties over these two sides but at the moment is full of praise for Tottenham and saying that Newcastle look flat. They look reticent more than flat to me.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> \u2026 which shows how well Tottenham are playing, forcing Newcastle back into their own half. Ben Arfa has the ball on the right of the penalty area when Assou-Ekotto robs him. The crowd shouts for handball but the ref waves play on.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Santon goes on a rare run beyond halfway and links up with Ciss\u00e9, wrongfooting Walker when he comes in from the touchline on to his right foot but his cross is blocked by Kaboul.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min +2:</strong> Newcastle corner after Ba's header is blocked. Ba and Taylor hold each other face to face in the penalty area to wait for the corner so they can't be marked. Odd \u2026 and the cross from Cabaye can't find either.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min +3:</strong> Cabaye is the fourth player to be booked for hauling Bale down and the whistle goes. The SJP DJ pust on the Kinks' Sunny Afternoon as the players troop off.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong>: Back in 10 minutes. \"This Barcodes v Sperz game is the second one I've watched today and I've yet to see a goal after undergoing <strike> extensive paint-drying analysis </strike> watching Arse v Mackems,\" writes Nick Saberton. \"So am I a goal Jonah?\" Yes, Nick. It's all your fault</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Newcastle attack the Gallowgate, Taylor knocking a 60-yard ball up to Ba who nods it back to Ben Arfa but he's not given the time to control it and Tottenham recycle the ball over to their right.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Lennon goes on a delightful crossfield run, knocking the ball ahead of him, seemingly too far each time, but then using his speed to nick it again with his toe but his cross, as it so often does, doesn't match the buildup play. \"OK, I'm switching it off now,\" writes Jonah Saberton. \"Presumably when the players trooped off at HT to the Kinks' Sunny Afternoon, Friedel was the only one who said: 'Ah, I remember this one.'\" Naked ageism, Nick. I'll get a letter.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Ben Arfa knocks the ball past the retreating Assou-Ekotto but can't get past him on his blindside. Newcastle have not begun this half with fresh purpose.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Bale and Lennon have switched wings and the Welshman storms up the right, skinning Santon, drives diagonally into the box to the byline but his right-foot drag-back is weak and Perch clears.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> If Spurs tire in this heat, Newcastle's patience may pay off.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 1-0 Tottenham (Ba)</strong> And it does. They hold on to the ball for a minute, spraying it across the back, then to ben Arfa who crosses to the back post from the right. Kyle Walker heads it awau but gets under it, spoons it up in the air and it ends up with Ba who swivels and hits a wonderful shot back across the box and past Friedel.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong>We're still on the old MBM technology today. I've no idea why, but you might have to refresh, F5, to get the goal description. Sigurdsson curls a shot from the left of the Newcastle area and wide of the post. Newcastle players thought the ball was out of play before Sigurdsson's shot and Alan Pardew protested by shoving the linesman and he is sent to the stands.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> \"I've turned it back on again,\" writes my only <strike> friend </strike> correspondent, Nick Saberton. \"The jinx is broken \u2026 peach of a finish.\" It was a glorious shot.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Alan Pardew is struggling to put his headset on up in the directors' box and needs a helping hand from Derek Llambias to screw the earpiece in. Assou-Ekotto shoots from distance but it doesn't trouble Krul.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Van der Vaart warms up for Spurs who have shown enough when Newcastle sat back in the first half to pose a threat if the home side does it again. \"Did Pardew really just shove the linesman?\" asks Chris Humphrey. \"Was is that poor a decision or is this game just much more intense for all involved than it appears to be for all watching?\" Well, it was more of a tap, the sort of thing your mother might do in exasperation. But, yes, the ball was out. ESPN focuses on the communication problems Pardew is enduring, no radio, no phone so he's having Wilie Donachie run down to the bench to relay his thoughts.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> John Carver rallies the Toon on the touchline with that pair of breasts mime while AVB talks to Van der Vaart. Ben Arfa has covered Simpson well this half and steps up to nick the ball off the advancing Assou-Ekotto's toe.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> AVB brings on VDV for Sigurdsson. I couldn't find the initials for the son of Sigurd, damn. Jack Reagan writes: \"If a player does same thing, he would likely get red carded and would be out three games.<br>Does Pardew get same punishment? He should.\" He probably will, Jack. The FA will tell him to put his trousers on, son, you're nicked. Tottenham corner, taken by Van der Vaart, loops out of the area to Lennon who wastes his chance.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Newcastle sub. Anita on for Cabaye. Good pass from Walker splits Santon and Perch, Defoe darts in and shoots low from 15 yards. Krul dives to save and Taylor goes on all fours to head it back off the ground into Krul's hands to prevent Spurs winning a corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> \"Spurs should be concentrating on getting Bale running at Simpson all the time,\" writes Nick Saberton. \"And they're crying out for a bit more presence up front.\" They should and do look light up front but have no options other than Will Kane. Defoe again creates a chance for himslef with a clever run and his shot as he cuts across the box from left to right is deflected for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 1-1 Tottenham (Defoe)</strong> Cross from Lennon from the left, Defoe heads from the edge of the six yard box. Krul dives low to beat it away but Defoe nicks in front of Santon to bury the equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Sandro dives in to block Tiot\u00e9's shot from 25 yards and jars his arm on the pitch. He's receiving length medical treatment.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Penalty to Newcastle</strong> Lennon and Van der Vaart bring him down when he spins between them and cuts into the box.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Newcastle 2-1 Tottenham (Ben Arfa, pen)</strong> Slotted to Friedel's left with the keeper diving the other way.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>80 min: </strong>Refresh for goal, pen descriptions one last time. The new blog cavalry is on the horizon.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Ben Arfa trips Bale in the centre circle. If you haven't seen the goals, there was some big manager air-punching and leaping going on for the equaliser and the penalty.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Excellent cross from the right by Ba to Ciss\u00e9 who chests it down, Gallas nips in to blast it away to Gutierrez who shoots from 25 yards inches over the bar. Obertan comes on for Ba.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Harry Kane comes on for Tottenham and gets away with what looked like a trip on Tiot\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Sorry about the Will/Harry Kane mix-up. Wrong prince. Van der Vaart spins in a long, deep, diagonal cross towards the centre of the goal and Krul rushes off his line to take it off Bale's head.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> An appeal from Niall Sheerin: \"On the train back to Strasbourg after a lovely day swimming in the Rhine in Basle/Barrrl/Basel and your MBM is spoiling it for me. My wife doesn't want me in a bad mood &amp; divorce is on the horizon unless you can fashion a wining (equalising) goal for Spurs.\" Hmm. You've played pretty well, Niall. Sigurdsson is excellent. Defoe is in fine form. You need another two strikers.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min+1:</strong> Spurs free-kick, 25 yards out to the right of the box. Van der Vaart curls in a cross to the far post and Krul fists it clear to Obertan who blasts it upfield.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> Spurs free-kick by their own penalty box, launched forward but Krul comes out to collect and the whistle goes.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Final score: Newcastle 2-1 Tottenham</strong> Tottenham had the best of the first half, much the best and continued in the same vein at the start of the second. Gradually Newcastle began to push up and enjoy more possession and control. Ba scored a quality goal, Tottenham fought back then a disastrous defensive intervention from Lennon and Van der Vaart threw a point they deserved away. Newcastle look compact and strong, Ben Arfa, Ciss\u00e9 and Ba class. For Spurs Sigurdsson took up where he left off last season, Defoe was sharp, Lennon a danger. When they spend the Modric money they'll be fine. Thanks for your emails. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Police footage taken from the night officers say a suspect in Arkansas managed to fatally shoot himself in the head \u2013 despite having his hands cuffed behind his back \u2013 has failed to remove questions over the incident.</p> <p>Chavis Carter died in the back of a patrol car on 28 July after being picked up in a traffic stop in Jonesboro during which drugs were discovered in the vehicle.</p> <p>The 21-year-old black man had been searched twice by officers, but a handgun that officers say the suspect later used to shoot himself was not found. Questions have also been raised as to how the left-handed Carter was able to deliver a fatal shot to his right temple while in restraints.</p> <p>On Friday, following a Freedom of Information Act request by multiple news organizations, police released footage of the immediate aftermath of Carter's death. </p> <p>They had earlier handed over a video taken before the suspect's body was discovered. But that first video failed to provide any answers to the dead man's family, who claim that he was killed by police.</p> <p>Chavis died from a single gunshot wound to the head.</p> <p>He had earlier been detained \u2013 alongside two other suspects \u2013 by officers searching for drugs in the back of a truck they had noticed parked on the street with its lights on.</p> <p>Having found a set of scales giving off a strong smell of marijuana, and a bag containing a white substance, a check was run on Carter revealing an outstanding warrant for the Mississippi resident, according to copy of the police report posted online.</p> <p>The suspect was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back and led to the back seat of a patrol car.</p> <p>It was while in restraints and in the rear of the police car that Carter is alleged to have shot himself.</p> <p>In an apparent copy of the official incident report <a href=\"http://thegrio.com/2012/08/02/chavis-carter-case-mother-disputes-police-story-of-squad-car-suicide/\">posted online by TheGrio.com</a>, an officer states that he heard a \"loud thump and a metallic sound\" while speaking to the two other suspects.</p> <p>But he said he dismissed it as the sound of a car driving over a piece of metal on the roadway.</p> <p>It was only after the two other suspects were sent away that Carter's body was discovered, one officer recorded.</p> <p>\"We went to the rear passenger side door, opened it and I observed Carter in a sitting position slumped forward with his head in his lap.</p> <p>\"There was a large amount of blood on the front oh his shirt, pants, seats and floor. His hands were cuffed behind his back.\"</p> <p>The incident has raised questions, not least over how officers apparently failed to find the gun on Carter during an initial search.</p> <p>It has also been considered suspicious that the suspect died as a result of a gunshot wound to the right temple, as Carter was left handed and handcuffed at the time.</p> <p>The dead man's mother, Teresa Carter, has accused police of a cover up.</p> <p>Amid growing media interest in the case, police agreed to release footage from a dashboard camera that captured events leading up to Carter's death. It shows the suspect being led to a patrol car.</p> <p>But it failed to provide any clues as to what happened after he was put in the vehicle.</p> <p>\"There's still nothing in there about what actually happened with Chavis,\" Benjamin Irwin, a lawyer for the Carter family, said.</p> <p>A second batch of video clips was released Friday. It contains an audio exchange between two unseen men \u2013 thought to be officers \u2013 shortly after the suspect's body is discovered.</p> <p>\"He was breathing a second ago,\" says one, while another is heard stating: \"I patted him down. I don't know where he had it hidden.\"</p> <p>The Jonesboro police department has asked the FBI to assist in its investigation into the incident</p> <p>Special agent Kimberly Brunell told the Guardian earlier this month: \"We are monitoring the situation and we have received certain information, investigative information has been shared with us.\"</p>",
  "<p>The international diplomatic row over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange \u2013 who is avoiding extradition to Sweden by taking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London \u2013 was escalating as Ecuador continued to push for the support of its South American neighbours.</p> <p>Having secured an emergency meeting of the Organisation of American States over what Ecuador says is Britain's threat to invade its embassy in London to arrest Assange, the Ecuadoreans are pushing for similar meetings of the Union of South American Nations, the left-leaning Alba association of Bolivarian states and the UN.</p> <p>On the agenda for the OAS meeting will be both Ecuador's claims that the UK has threatened the principle of \"inviolable\" status of its embassy in the UK and demands that the UK grant \"safe passage\" for Assange out of the UK.</p> <p>As Assange prepared to give a statement on his situation \u2013 reportedly outside the embassy, where he could face arrest for breach of his bail conditions \u2013 the row over Britain's veiled threat that it could enter the embassy to arrest him appeared to escalate.</p> <p>On Friday the OAS voted to hold a meeting next Friday following Ecuador's decision to grant political asylum to Assange. Assange has described the move as a \"historic victory\" but the foreign secretary, William Hague, made it clear that the Australian would not be allowed safe passage out of the country.</p> <p>The latest developments came as the Australian government released redacted logs under a Freedom of Information request detailing its deliberations over the Assange case. Included in the documents is the Australian government's legal view that any US attempt to prosecute Assange under the Espionage Act \u2013 which Assange says he fears \u2013 would face \"serious obstacles\".</p> <p>The released cables also appear to directly contradict Assange's claims that he had sought asylum with Ecuador because Australia had \"abandoned\" him by refusing to intervene in his planned extradition.</p> <p>Officials claim he has been contacted eight times by consular officials while in the embassy. The sources added that far from refusing Assange help, it was Assange who had declined Australian assistance.</p> <p>Assange has been in the embassy for two months after facing extradition to Sweden to be questioned on claims of sexual assault. He denies the claims and says he fears being sent to the US if he goes to Sweden.</p> <p>The decision by the OAS to debate the affair follows a letter from the Foreign Office to Ecuadorean authorities, warning it believed it had a legal basis to arrest Assange in the embassy, interpreted by Ecuador as a threat to raid the building \u2013 although this has been denied by the UK which says it prefers a \"negotiated outcome\".</p> <p>The US, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago opposed the resolution, but 23 members voted in favour of the meeting. There were five abstentions and three members were absent. OAS secretary general Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza said the meeting would be about \"the problem posed by the threat or warning made to Ecuador by the possibility of an intervention into its embassy\".</p> <p>He added: \"What is being proposed is that the foreign ministers of our organisation address this subject and not the subject of asylum nor whether it should be granted to Mr Julian Assange. That will be discussed between Great Britain and Ecuador. The issue that concerns us is the inviolability of diplomatic missions of all members of this organisation.\"</p> <p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said in a radio interview on Friday that his nation was not trying to undermine Sweden's attempts to question Assange. He said: \"The main reason why Julian Assange was given diplomatic asylum was because his extradition to a third country was not guaranteed; in no way was it done to interrupt the investigations of Swedish justice over an alleged crime. In no way.\"</p> <p>Hague has said that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals. He said it is a \"matter of regret\" that the Ecuadorean government granted the WikiLeaks founder political asylum but warned that it \"does not change the fundamentals\" of the case.</p> <p>The case could go on for some \"considerable\" time, Hague said, adding: \"We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom, nor is there any legal basis for us to do so.\"</p> <p>Ecuadorean ministers have accused the UK of threatening to attack the embassy to seize Assange, after it emerged that the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 could allow revocation of a building's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it \"ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post\".</p> <p>But Hague said: \"There is no threat here to storm an embassy. We are talking about an Act of Parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law.\"</p> <p>The Swedish foreign ministry said that it had summoned Ecuador's ambassador over the Latin American country's \"unacceptable\" decision to grant asylum to Assange.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Preamble? You want a <em>preamble</em>? It's the Saturday of the Lord's Test, the sun is burning, everything is at stake and a kid is 28 runs away from a moment that would melt the hardest heart. There's your preamble!</p> <p>(Yes, yes I am running a bit late.)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Take the most exacting day's work</strong> of your life, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near what Jonny Bairstow went through yesterday. It will be such a challenge for him to get past this first hour, not least because, if he gets through the first eight overs, he will then have to contend with the second new ball. That new-ball period may well decide this match.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>73rd over: England 210-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 22)</strong> It's a glorious day at Lord's, absolutely perfect. There will be some sore, pink shoulders in north west London at 7pm. Jacques Kallis is going to bowl the first over of the day, which shows that South Africa have an eye on that new ball. Bairstow tucks him through midwicket for two, the first runs of the day.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>74th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> It'll be Morne Morkel at the other end. That might seem unusual, in that Dale Steyn doesn't take the new ball at the start of the innings, but that's because of the two left-handers at the top of the order and Morkel's hold over Strauss. Steyn will take the second new ball because there will probably be two right-handers. Even if Stuart Broad is in, Steyn won't mind. Morkel starts with an excellent, tight line to Prior, giving him no room to free his arms. Prior pushes a single to cover to end an excellent over.</p> <p>\"Crucial session this,\" says Peter Haines. \"What a perfect set-up for the Saturday of the Lord's Test \u2013 this is definitely the sporting highlight of the year. Oh, and it seems that South Africa did end the career of a third England captain; it's just that it's Pietersen, not Strauss.\" With every passing day, the chances of him playing for England again seem to recede.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>75th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> This is a fine, disciplined start from South Africa. Their line to Prior has been extremely good, and that's a maiden from Kallis. The camera cuts to a couple drinking champagne in the crowd, at 11.09am. \"You can't afford to be dehydrated in this weather...\" says Sir Ian Botham on Sky. What a day to be at Lord's. It's absolutely perfect. There's a lovely, respectful hush around the ground.</p> <p>\"They've got to say to themselves, runs don't matter this morning,\" says Chris Evans. \"Be 260 for five at lunch and be 150 ahead at the close.\" Tell that to Matt Prior. I know what you mean, although I'm not sure it would be wise for Prior, or indeed Bairstow, to play such an unnatural game.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>76th over: England 215-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 23)</strong> Morkel is a touch too full and straight, the first bad ball of the day, and Bairstow drags him through midwicket for four. He's 22 away from one of the great feelgood centuries of the last decade. Please please please let him get what he wants.</p> <p>\"Eff being 260/5 at lunch,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Being 360/8 would be fine. More than fine, obviously, given the other ways in which batting in that style might turn out.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>77th over: England 216-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 24)</strong> South Africa are giving Prior absolutely nothing to work with here. Their plan is to control the scoreboard until the second new ball, and they've done it very well; there have been eight runs from five overs this morning.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>78th over: England 219-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 25)</strong> Bairstow works Morkel through midwicket for a couple to move into the eighties. \"STOP talking about a possible c*****y!!\" says David Ward.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>79th over: England 220-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 26)</strong> Tahir bowls a token over before the new ball in the hope he can snare Prior for the third time in the series. He doesn't. The camera cuts to more people drinking pink champagne. The gits. That's right: <em>gits</em>.</p> <p>\"Is it arguable that Onions and Monty in the side for Broad and Swann would make the team stronger?\" says Jatinder Sahota. \"This is especially the case with Swann who I think has been below par for a while now. Finn may not be as good a bat as Bresnan but by keeping him out of the team until now surely England weakened themselves overall \u2013 and doesn't the same principle apply?\" You could certainly make that case, although it's moot because there is no chance of England ever going in with a tail of Finn, Anderson, Onions and Panesar. Good for last-day rearguards, I suppose, but I'm not sure about them actually scoring any runs. Onions is a fascinating bowler. I know Selve thought he would have been a good option in this game, and he took a couple for Durham the other day. In a different era he would already have 100 Test wickets.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>80th over: England 221-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 27)</strong> Dale Steyn is coming on. He'll have one over to get loose with the old ball \u2013&#xa0;and he makes it talk, snapping a beauty past Prior's outside edge. The next goes past the edge too, although that one didn't really deviate. Prior has made five from 26 balls this morning, a reflection of South Africa's disciplined line.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 221-6 (Prior c Kallis b Philander 27)</strong> Pour yourself some pink champagne, get behind the sofa, do whatever you need to do because it's time for the second new ball \u2013 possibly the decisive period of the entire series. And Prior has gone first ball! Oh for heaven's sake. He had a big drive at a seductive outswinger from Philander that flew off the edge to Kallis at second slip. It was really travelling but Kallis held on, as he always does. Matt Prior will not, it's fair to say, tell his grandchildren about that stroke. It was a minor shocker.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>81st over: England 221-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Broad 0)</strong> England could get cleaned up here. Stuart Broad, the new batsman, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/10617.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">really needs a few runs</a>. Philander is getting the new ball to swing appreciably, although his line to the left-hander isn't right at the moment. He moves around the wicket as a result and has a huge shout for LBW turned down when Broad misses a yorker. They have to review this surely? No, Graeme Smith has decided against it. It swung a long way so it might have slipped down the leg side, but that was really close. Hawkeye shows that it was missing leg. That's an excellent bit of judgement from Smith and the keeper AB de Villiers. A wicket maiden from Philander, and an ominous one for England.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>82nd over: England 225-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 84, Broad 0)</strong> Bairstow times Steyn nicely through the covers for four. Steyn is getting the ball to swing as well, so this is going to be a serious challenge for the England batsmen. If you offered Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss a total of 300 now in exchange for their deepest, darkest secrets, I reckon they'd sing like canaries.</p> <p>\"There's no need for pink champage envy Rib,\" begins Duncan Smith, promisingly. \"I am quite sure, from your rarified position you could easily start a JustGiving page. I think all of us here on the obo value you enough to contribute funds for a bottle of Lambrusco and some cochineal.\" If you make it Lambrini it's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>83rd over: England 228-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 1)</strong> Philander goes back over the wicket to Broad, who flick-pulls pleasantly for a single to get off the mark. Then Bairstow steals a second to long leg. He has been excellent between the wickets in this innings. Here's an interesting stat (which may well be meaningless in a few minutes, but still). In the last 30 years, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">only two men have scored Test centuries for England before their 23rd birthday</a>: Mike Atherton and Alastair Cook. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting\">And only 13 players have done it overall</a>.</p> <p>\"Every ball, every ball is so, so tense,\" says Gary Naylor. \"And they say a T20 innings is 120 events.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>84th over: England 232-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 5)</strong> Broad normally likes to counter-attack, although the context makes that extremely difficult. He is beaten by Steyn, chasing a wide one off the back foot when he should have been forward, and then pings a crisp cover drive for four. England trail by 77.</p> <p>\"Also, you can tell Broad knows he's batting terribly at the moment. He hasn't even been hogging the reviews like he normally does,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"A year or so ago he'd be waving his arms like a semaphore operative even if his middle stump was hurtling towards the slips.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>85th over: England 236-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 90, Broad 5)</strong> That's a lovely stroke from Bairstow, a stiff-wristed crunch through midwicket for four off Philander. He's into the nineties. <em>He's into the bloody nineties</em>. There isn't a dry nail in the house.</p> <p>\"Oh balls,\" says Guy Hornsby, suddenly recalling The Bad Thing from last night. \"That's got to be galling for Prior. Right up there with finishing fourth in the marathon, running out of paint when you get to the last part of the wall, treading on an upturned plug, and writing your best OBO mail ever only to send it in after the close of play. Are the pavilion windows intact? The balance is back with South Africa again surely. This is such a <strong>PROPER</strong> Test match. Bairstow looking for a ton, Broad in need of sensible runs, England looking for a lead and South Africa looking for a lead. It doesn't get much better than this really. This is the Flamin' Hot Monster Munch of Test matches.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>86th over: England 243-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 8)</strong> Broad drives Steyn on the up through extra cover for three. I wonder what Jonny Bairstow's pulse rate is right now. Whatever it was, it's just gone up a bit more: he is beaten by a jaffa from Steyn and edges the next ball wide of the slips for four. I don't think it would have carried anyway, but it was a genuine edge. Does anyone have any beta blockers I can borrow for the next 20 minutes?</p> <p>\"I must confess to being more nervous watching this than I was on my wedding day, at the birth of my children or being swabbed at immigration at Auckland airport,\" says Phil Withall, to the delight of his wife, his children and the crack swab team at Auckland airport. \"Please let young Bairstow do it, please.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>87th over: England 251-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 16)</strong> Broad shovels the new bowler Morkel off the hip for a couple, with Steyn doing very well to save the boundary. Sometimes, when you see those boundary saves, you think, <em>All that for one or two runs</em>. Not in this game. Every run is a precious thing \u2013 and Broad gets four more with a superbly timed squirt through point. A drag through midwicket for two takes England past 250. The unspoken intensity of this Test match is just wonderful.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 252-7 (Broad c Amla b Steyn 16)</strong> That's the end of Broad's cameo. Steyn dug in an excellent, straight short ball that Broad could only push gently to Amla at short leg. It was all strangely straightforward, and Steyn barely bothered to celebrate. Those are decent runs from Broad, though, 16 from 22 balls. South Africa lead by 57.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>88th over: England 253-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 1)</strong> Swann is greeted with a zesty short ball that trampolines past his not inconsiderable chin. \"Can Bairstow please get his century so I can start concentrating on the research I am trying to do in the British Library?\" says Eva Broer. \"This is too tense to be able to focus on some 16th century popes and their taste in art...\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>89th over: England 254-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 2)</strong> On the England balcony, Andrew Strauss is munching on his right fingernail. He's really tucking in too. Everyone is so desperate for Bairstow to do this. South Africa are prolonging the moment, with Morkel bowling temptingly wide of off stump. Bairstow is not tempted.</p> <p>\"Perhaps Duncan Smith would like to <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/stephfincham2/eurl.axd/596549cb73f2de4aab62940f5aa2cb41\">contribute to my JustGiving page as you don't have one</a>?\" says my colleague Steph Fincham. \"I'll be cycling across Rajasthan in February to raise money for the children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent...\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>90th over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Swann slashes Steyn up and over the cordon for four. The response is an angry short ball that Swann pulls contemptuously for four more! At the risk of asserting the bleedin' obvious, this is great stuff. In other news, some other news from India: VVS Laxman, one of the more beautiful batsmen we've ever seen, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2012/content/current/story/578096.html\">has retired from international cricket</a>.</p> <p>\"On TMS they just mentioned how good a throwing arm Steyn has from the deep,\" says John Starbuck. \"I suspect it's because he's an expert at the wrist action \u2013 have you noticed how he whips the wrist down at the moment of delivery? It's a lot more pronounced than anyone else's in this game, almost on a par with a mainstream spinner.\" That's a good point. Flintoff had a notable snap of the wrist as well.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>91st over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Bairstow fresh-airs a woolly cut stroke at a very wide delivery from Morkel. He does exactly the same next ball. \"Settle boy, settle,\" pleads David Gower on Sky. When Bairstow leaves the next ball, there is extravagant applause from the crowd. I can't remember the last time when everyone was so desperate for an England batsman to make a century. Graham Thorpe in 2003 maybe? South Africa are expertly prolonging his stay in the nineties, bowling wide of off stump for the most part. It's a maiden from Morkel, who has been outstanding this morning. Bairstow has already faced 21 deliveries in the nineties.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! England 264-7 (Swann not out 12)</strong> The marvellous Dale Steyn strikes again! Swann is going to review it \u2013 there are two left, so he may as well \u2013 but he's in trouble here. He pushed down the wrong line of a good delivery that jagged back into him. But Hawkeye says it was bouncing over the stumps! Swann survives! What a bonus for England. I think Swann thought he was out and only reviewed it because there were two left.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>92nd over: England 264-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 12)</strong> \"Prior's dismissal means he is currently second in both the England batting aggregates and averages to he who shall not be named, who is also top of England's bowling averages,\" says Graem Peters. \"At the end of the series, the head coaches are each allowed to choose the opposition player of the series. It would be interesting to see what would happen if Kirsten chose Kevin Pietersen.\" Crikey, that's a good point. It wouldn't quite be up there with Mohammad Amir two years ago but it would still be uncomfortable. They might give it to Anderson, whose series average of 41.85 is a travesty.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 264-8 (Bairstow b Morkel 95)</strong> English cricket has just had its heart broken. Jonny Bairstow has gone for 95, cleaned up by an excellent full-length delivery from Morne Morkel. Bairstow tried to whip it to leg but it ducked back in and burst through his defences. He walks off to a standing ovation for an immense innings, and if you're not moved by this, you don't have an anima. We must be two-eyed and say that it was majestic bowling from Morkel, who kept Bairstow in the nineties and then bowled him with a beauty. Bairstow made only one run in his last 40 minutes at the crease.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>93rd over: England 266-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Crikey. This email, which must have been stuck in a jam on the information superhighway, is accompanied by big dollops of sadness. \"Irrespective of whether he gets his hundred, this has been a terrific innings by Bairstow,\" says SB Tang. \"He's shown guts, determination and no small amount of skill under the most difficult of circumstances. It's safe to say that he's booked his ticket to India this winter.\" That will be a big tour for him, because he had problems there in the ODIs last year. I suppose the seven batsmen in the squad could be the six from this game plus Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>94th over: England 268-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Graeme Swann did make 85 against South Africa back in 2009-10. England would take half that here, even a third of it. He may as well tee off and try to get as close to 300 as possible. Give it some humpty, it's the weekend.</p> <p>Here's Tom Bowtell. \"On TMS, Blowers, apropos of something, just said: 'Geoffrey Boycott has a corridor of uncertainty in his bed'.\" Oh that is magnificent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>95th over: England 274-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 13, Anderson 7)</strong> Anderson gloves a grisly short ball from Morkel short of slip \u2013 his hand was off the bat, Mr Tucker \u2013 and then drives three through mid on. There is plenty of chat between Morkel and Anderson, two gentle souls who get in character as soon as they enter the field. South Africa lead by 35.</p> <p>\"I must say,\" says Josh Robinson, \"there was something wonderfully reassuring about the way Bairstow got out: it showed me that I can at least play around a<br>straight one just like a Test batsman, even if it usually happens much earlier in my innings.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>96th over: England 276-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Philander replaces Steyn, who bowled a fine spell of 8-1-28-1. Anderson steals a run to mid off. Every little helps. \"What an innings Bairstow played and it would be a huge surprise if he isn't a fixture in the team for the next ten years,\" says Mark Lloyd, who has quite the memory on him. \"Back in the dark days of 1989 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63508.html\">I was lucky enough to be at Lord's</a> to see a David Gower Ashes hundred but the innings I remember more is Robin Smith's 96. Terry Alderman denied him a maiden hundred with a beauty that nipped back and bowled him. I remember at the time wondering if that would be the closest Smith ever got to a Test century. I only hope Bairstow ends up a) becoming as important to England as Smith became, and b) being treated better than Smith was by the selectors. Hats off to the young man!\"</p> <p>I can't find a clip of that dismissal, but here's a bit of Alderman action from 1989, when he was close to unplayable. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBG1pSMgTnw\">I suppose it helps if you actually try to play him</a>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>97th over: England 277-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Anderson is rapped painfully on the left elbow by Morkel. You could see all the muscles pulsating at the point of contact. He's getting some treatment, although he doesn't seem especially perturbed. This delay will ensure that this is the last over before lunch. Anderson plays out those two deliveries to end another brilliant session of Test cricket. South Africa were outstanding, making England fight for every run, and they lead by 32. Jonny Bairstow was dismissed five runs short of a maiden Test century. Like the man said, it's been emotional. Rob Bagchi will be here for the afternoon session; email him on <a href=\"mailto:rob.bagchi@theguardian.com\">rob.bagchi@theguardian.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong> Afternoon all. Here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/18/vvs-laxman-retires-india-international-cricket\">our story on the retirement of VVS Laxman</a> which, I think, is an inevitable consequence of his recent form but nonetheless saddens me that I won't see him bat again. At his best he had a dreamlike quality of composure when well-set, the ability to transform a commonplace shot such as a leg-glance into a thing of charm and a handsome ease at piercing the infield that kept the scoreboard moving at a pace that perplexed the assumptions of bowler and spectator alike. </p> <p>Rob Wright has invaded Selve's inner sanctum, which is more than I have done as he notes: \"Just had a tour of the Lord's media centre, including the bit where all the papers do their OBOs. I excitedly enquired whether Rob Smyth and Rob Bagchi might be there, and was met with a blank stare. Met Boycott and Gower though.\" We're in Kings Cross, Rob, which allows us the scope to moonlight on football later this afternoon though we'd much prefer to be there.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Anderson c Rudolph b Steyn 12</strong> Fending off the fourth short ball he's faced, the last of this over, he takes his eyes off it and dollies it up for third slip to run six feet in and catch it.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>98th over: England 283-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 17, Finn 0)</strong> An enthralling morning session with honours just about even, England scoring 67 for the loss of three wickets and some supreme bowling from Morne Morkel. Steyn begins from the Pavilion End, dishing up another elbow polka for Anderson who is now wearing a bandage covered by a sweatband on his bruised left funny bone. The first three balls are all short of a length, Anderson stepping to leg and cut-pushing the last of them to third man where the fielder's slip gives England three. Steyn finally pitches one up to Swann who tucks in with an on-drive to within a foot of the rope and they run three more. Anderson is out from the last ball of the over, <strong>England 26 behind</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>99th over: England 291-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 2)</strong> Tahir comes on to toy with Finn's mind. Swann takes a single off the first ball and Finn accomplishes himself well to get off the mark with a toppling sweep. The batsmen swap singles again, leaving Swann on strike for the last ball and he belts it over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>100th over: England 293-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 4)</strong> Steyn peppers Finn but he gets in line to play it off his chest well short of short leg. The next one is another bouncer, not played so well, Finn fending it to where silly point might have been placed. Next Steyn pitches it up, drifts to leg and Finn tucks him away for two. This short stuff eventually worked for Anderson and Broad but it's a relentless, bullying strategy and the umpires let it pass. Finn withdraws the bat from the last ball of the over, another half-tracker, and it glances him on the shoulder on its way through to De Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>101st over: England 294-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 24, Finn 4)</strong> Philander, buttock knack and all, replaces Tahir after the leggie's solitary over. Swann pushes a single and puts Finn back on strike. Big Vern is bowling Broad pace and surprises himself and Finn with low bounce to which the batsman shows the maker's name. He gets in line, Finn. If he's a rabbit he's not the kind that runs down a hole by the square leg umpire.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>102nd over: England 297-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 25, Finn 4)</strong> Swann has Steve Waugh-like confidence in his partner, taking another single off the first ball of an over. A \"red-inker\", chides Nasser Hussain. At times like this Steyn looks like a shark, all nose and teeth and cold, cold eyes. What a magnificent and vicious bowler he is, though, smacking Finn on the helmet behind his ear and they take a leg-bye. A few inches lower and that ball would have put Finn in hospital. At last Swann farms the bowling, swatting a cut off the top half of the bat down to backward point and running one to end the over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>103rd over: England 298-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 4)</strong> Philander looks as stiff as a scarecrow but gamely soldiers on. No swing. \"Without wishing to underplay the quality of Bairstow's innings, and its importance in the context, aren't people being a bit premature in taking it to show that he's sure to be a success in Test cricket now?\" writes David Wall. \"That's one success in four matches when in the previous ones he looked pretty unconvincing. Moreover, as it turned out, his innings sadly fell short of being decisive in the match. England do have to win, after all. That's not to say it's not a good sign, and I hope he does continue to show the resilience and quality he showed here, but he wouldn't be the first who failed to build on early promise.\" He wouldn't David but what was encouraging was the signs that he'd taken on board the weaknesses West Indies exposed and done something about it. \"What is a sure sign of quality (in a different field, of course) is the way Blowers just used 'tautological' in his commentary on TMS in a throwaway fashion\" he continues. \"It's a sad reminder that we're going to have to endure Jonathan Pearce and Alan Green for the next nine months.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>104th over: England 303-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 8)</strong> Finn sways out of the way of one that goes past his chin so Steyn comes round the wicket, bounces him, and Finn hooks him for four. \"Oh right,\" writes Dale Slater. \"When Steyn goes short he's bullying and you're looking for intervention from the umpires. When Anderson and Finn are relentlessly short to Steyn in bad light and floodlight failure, it's a strategy of some merit. The only bullying that's going on here is those who control the means of communication taking advantage of it to reinforce their own little prejudices and pop a few more bricks in their wall of stereotypes.\" Wow. When did I say bullying in a cricket context was a bad thing? I said it was relentless and understandable given it did for Anderson and Broad and that umpires these days don't do anything about it, not that they \"should\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>105th over: England 308-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 32, Finn 8)</strong> Swann leans into an off-drive, eyes wide, and smashes a four over mid-off from Philander's slightly overpitched third delivery. \"Crucial session this,\" writes Peter Hanes. \"Swann's hitting and Finn's bravery are raising England's spirits, but they could be up against it if South Africa make the most of the good batting conditions now. This is great cricket.\" It is.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>106th over: England 312-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 35, Finn 9)</strong> England draw level when Swann leg-glances Steyn for a single and ahead when Finn prods one into the off-side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>107th over: England 314-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 36, Finn 10)</strong> Smith drops Finn at first slip, a straightforward chance that bursts through his hands and into his chest. Finn runs a single as the ball cannons of towards leg gully. \"Knowing words like 'tautological' doesn't mean you can't have a howler or two,\" writes John Starbuck. \"Blowers this afternoon has already failed to identify 'turbine' as the modern kind of windmill and also said he'd never seen a bat in the form of a cake. Me too.\" He was on tip top pork pie eulogising form on Thursday. Ian Copestake says: \"The key to bringing the literacy level of footer commentary up to and beyond that of cricket is by unleashing the glories of Stuart Hall at every possible match. He would eat tautologies for lunch and make a feast of his own alliterative biscuits.\" A gem:<br>\"On his firm Stuart Hall International Travel: 'I've never been brilliant in business.

Finn c Duminy b Morkel 10</strong> <strong>England are all out for 315, six runs ahead</strong>. Morkel copped him with a slower ball, his bat through the uppercut too soon and slicing it up to Duminy at point. Swann's vital innings ended on 37 not out.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Innings break</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 0-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 0, Smith 0)</strong> Anderson begins to Petersen with his tail up and mithering about the indent/foothold on the crease where his left foot lands. Smyth has sent me a stat that none of the last 24 Lord's Test have been won by the team trailing on first innings. Interesting but as he points out, probably means nothing in this context. Every ball bar the last is on an outside-off line but the sixth hurries Petersen into a drive that squirts off the edge towards cover. On come the ground staff with their saw dust to fix the hole.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 1, Smith 1)</strong> Dale Slater's been back on. \"Point was, that whenever an English journalist hears the words 'South Africa' he finds in his Book of Cliches that the true meaning of the phrase is 'Nasty Bully' - just as surely as he finds the word 'Englishman' actually denotes 'Plucky lad grinding on against incredible odds'! Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability; you don't even know you're doing it!\" And he who seeks prejudice where there is none, what is he? Have you read the respect and admiration we've shown for South Africa throughout this series? Or taken the word \"bullying\" and inflated it for all its worth to pander to your sense of victimhood? Smith plays a loose hook of Broad from a ball that was wider and bounced higher than he initially thought. He gets enough on it to clear midwicket and it drops like a stone 30ft in from the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 6-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 1)</strong> Glorious whipped shot from Petersen through midwicket for four. Anderson was looking for outswing and the edge but it didn't deviate. The fifth ball of his over did, though, jagging away from Petersen's forward defensive and into Prior's hands. The England players' squeals are louder than the crowd's.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 7-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 2)</strong> Huge appeal from Broad when he thinks he's got Petersen leg-before with the batsman prodding around the ball but he got an inside edge, as the replay confirmed. \"It may be worth mentioning that Blowers only used 'tautological' to try and dig himself out of the hole he'd dug by saying Finn had got himself tucked up in 'angular angles',\" writes Hugh Barker. Those pesky angular angles.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 12-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 9, Smith 3)</strong> Forgot to mention that South Africa had knocked off the deficit in the third over and had now moved into the black. Anderson comes round the wicket to Smith and he plays that trusty shovel shot around the corner and takes the single. David Gower thinks England are playing to his strengths because he's also vulnerable with that shot early in his innings. Anderson's got the face on, more so when Petersen plays a majestic cut for four.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Broad resumes after a length chat with Anderson and then much gesturing from third slip with Fingerbobs hands to show him how the ball should be moving. He bounces Smith first up but then strays too straight, allowing Smith to turn it to square leg. He tosses the next ball up to Petersen, who smacks him through the covers for four. Time for Finn. Smith changes his bowlers much quicker than Strauss does.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Anderson bowls one of Boycott's \"lollipop bouncers\" to Smith who has an age to duck out of the way. \"Just to clarify, it wasn't the word 'tautological' that was nice about that bit of commentary but the completely natural, throwaway way in which he used it (and why not, it's a perfectly cromulent word),\" writes David Wall. \"If Clive Tyldsley had used a similar word or phrase then he'd keep trying to work it into the rest of the commentary just to remind everyone how clever he'd been.\" Sorry. I'm anispeptic, frasmotic, even compunctuous to have caused you such pericombobulation. Smith chases another wide bouncer, hooking and top edging squarish but short of Ian Bell who stops the single.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 20-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 14, Smith 6)</strong> It's still Broad, still barely breaking 80mph. Petersen taps a single through the legside and Strauss runs from slip to chat to him which, if it was meant to inspire him, doesn't as he bowls a wide long-hop outside leg stump. He drops short again and Smith hooks him off his visor, a neat controlled pull that the hare Bairstow prevents from going for four with a sprint and a slide. Richard Potter can stand for many of you on the subject of Dale Slater. \"He says: 'Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability.' That, Sir, is drivel, and you know it.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Big shout when Anderson traps Petersen on the pad, pushing forward. It hit him outside the line. More from proud Cantabrigian, Richard Potter: \"'angular angles' from Blowers was more oxymoronic than 'tautological'. Blowers from Cambridge would agree - Oxymorons are people from the other place \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Swann comes into the attack and places a short-leg, short midwicket and slip for Smith. The bowler turns it from the start, enticing Smith, as is his wont, to hit against the spin towards square leg and midwicket, which he does a couple of times competently even if it excites Matt Prior enormously. Maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> White handle grips still look odd to me, you can't see the join with the gloves when Petersen hits powerfully. Anderson continues, looking rather mournful about the lack of consistent or even regular swing. \"Julian Barton de Courcy Thompson, who played for Kent in the 90s was a right arm quick bowler,\" writes Nick Mannion. He was actually South African and also a medical doctor \u2026 of gynaecology as it happens\u2026 Apparently he was/is the go to expert on the corridor of uncertainty.\" Fnarr.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> Swann continues with his line of attack to Smith who again works the ball against the spin into the legside. He catches Petersen on the front leg prodding forward and appeals though it hit him outside the line, so Swann bowls a bit straighter.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 31-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 18, Smith 13)</strong> \"Afternoon Bagchi, afternoon everybody,\" writes Josh/Johs Robinson. \"I think I've found a <strike> good </strike> use for Twitter. If an email is bad enough that even you won't publish it, one can tweet it to the good folks over at the Sofa, and they'll read it out to <strike> all </strike> their listeners. OK, so maybe there's a case to be made that emails that aren't good enough even to appear on the OBO are best left in Robinson's sent mail folder. Yes, I think I've convinced myself that that's actually yet another example of why Twitter is evil. It is the place where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westendproducer/status/233463522045079552\">this</a> appeared, though.\" Unimprovably put by Wiggins. Finn takes over from Anderson. His first three balls are shortish and outside off, Smith playing and missing the first then clumping him for four with a bludgeoning cut.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 32-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 19, Smith 13)</strong> Swann is devilishly interested in testing whether Smith can play against the spin with as much efficacy as he did at the Oval, trying to tempt him into an outside edge when playing across the line. So far Smith has had the upper hand. One more over before tea.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 33-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> Finn comes in to Petersen with Nasser Hussain suggesting the tickle down the legside to the keeper is the dismissal they're aiming for and he does have a drive at one drifting across him that he misses and then gets off strike the next ball with a push to mid on. <strong>South Africa end the session 27 ahead</strong>. Thanks for all your emails, particularly Clare Davies and her detective work. Rob Smyth will be here for the evening session.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Hello again</strong>. This doesn't look too pretty, does it. The new ball deviated about as much as a prissy nun, and unless England get some reverse swing they are going to find it very difficult to force a winning position. We'll have a pretty good idea of where the match is heading by the close; there are still 37 overs remaining in the day.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile, at the Oval</strong> <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542535.html\">Just look at this</a>!</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 33-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> England have around 100-120 overs from now to bowl South Africa out if they are to have a chance of winning the game. It really won't be easy as the pitch is a belter. Swann starts after tea to Petersen, with a slip and a short leg. It's a maiden.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> Despite his failure in the first innings, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;qualmin1=2;qualval1=matches;template=results;type=batting\">Graeme Smith still has a three-figure average at Lord's</a>. He leaves a delivery from Steven Finn that isn't too far of off stump, although ultimately Smith knew what he was doing. He wasn't so sure next ball, when an attempted pull met only with still air. A good over from Finn.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 34-0 (Smith not out 14)</strong> England have wasted a review. Smith was beaten by a beauty from Swann that ripped past the edge and the fielders behind the stumps (though not Swann) went up for caught behind. Kumar Dharmasena said not out \u2013 which I suppose is reason enough to review given his performance in this game \u2013 and replays showed there was daylight between bat and ball. There was more than a hint of desperation in that review.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> So what's England's minimum requirement in the remaining 35 overs? I suppose they would want at least two wickets, ideally three. \"On the subject of the photo at the top,\" says Mac Millings, \"I didn't know Naylor had taken up smoking.\" <a href=\"http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/kxNRKUFirF-l.jpg\">Here, for those who were wondering, is a picture of Mac Millings</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 35-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 21, Smith 14)</strong> Petersen pulls Finn for a single. England do at least have control of the scoreboard, which is a quarter of the battle. If England are to somehow win this game it will probably come down to a time/runs equation. </p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://media.slated.org/displayimage.php?pid=119\">This is why I'm not showing my face in that picture</a>,\" says Mac Millings.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 35-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 21, Smith 14)</strong> Yet another maiden, from Swann to Petersen. His figures are 6-4-2-0. With many teams you'd say that this almost strokeless batting approach would be risky, but South Africa's top six have the discipline to bat forever, regardless of what the scoreboard is doing.</p> <p>\"Aaargh!\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Smyth, I hold you entirely responsible for the fall of that last Middlesex wicket. Lancashire desperately needed a Surrey defeat to at least keep within touching distance of avoiding relegation going into the fag end of the season, and the impossible was just starting to look possible until you went and flagged it up to the world. No hotpot for you.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 42-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Smith 19)</strong> Smith back cuts Finn for the first boundary in eight overs. \"Getting twitchy at all the commentators jinxing the South African batsman with talk of their imperturbability,\" says Helen Musselman. It's not an attempt to jink them, just a sincere judgement as to how the game is developing. I'd be surprised if South Africa lost another wicket all match, never mind 10 by tea tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 46-1 (Smith LBW b Swann 23)</strong> Graeme Swann has got him! I was just typing 'The certainty of Smith's batting is awe-inspiring and terrifying' when he went for an ugly sweep, missing it completely as the ball zipped on to hit the pad. Kumar Dharmasena raised the finger, and after a long discussion with Alviro Petersen, Smith decided to walk off without reviewing the decision. He was right to do so: Hawkeye showed the point of contact was 'umpire's call' and it was hitting the just below the off-and-middle stump bail. There was no need for Smith to play that shot. Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 46-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Amla 0)</strong> The new batsman is Hashim Amla. He has struggled a little since that triple hundred at the Oval \u2013 his series average is an embarrassing 120.33. He defends his first ball from Swann, who has a lovely rhythm and figures of 7-4-6-1.</p> <p>\"I have a bottle of Joseph Perrier in the fridge for emergency celebrations,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I was planning on opening it when Bairstow got his ton, and after he fell for 95 I decided to open it when Middlesex hit the runs that consigned Surrey to defeat. Now I think I should decide to open it at the moment when South Africa's series victory is confirmed. I think that's what they call hedging.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 48-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 1)</strong> Stuart Broad replaces Finn, and his first ball reverse swings in towards Petersen. Two more later in the over shape back into Amla. This is really encouraging for England because the ball is only 23 overs old. Hence the '23rd over' bit at the top of this entry, yeah?</p> <p>\"Is there a league table of Test bowlers and their record of successful DRS decisions?\" says John Starbuck. \"Swann must be on it somewhere. Perhaps more pertinently, does it include umpires too?\" I have no idea, but I do know that Aleem Dar has a 110 per cent success rate.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 49-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 2)</strong> \"I want to see Max Millings when he was a young man, when his wife's heart stopped at her first sight of him, when she fell helpless into his arms and whispered 'take me',\" writes <strike> Mac Millings </strike> Alex Xu.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-2 (Petersen LBW b Broad 24)</strong> Another one gone! England are flying! Broad had Amla dropped two balls earlier and then trapped Petersen plumb in front with a beautiful reverse inswinger. Petersen played across the line and knew immediately he was gone. He didn't even consider a review. What a stunning Test match this has been. Twenty minutes ago England were moving towards the brink; now they have two wickets, the ball is reversing and all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 50-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 3, Kallis 0)</strong> England could have had another wicket, but Prior dropped Amla earlier in the over. It was a difficult chance diving to his left when Amla gloved a short from Broad down the leg side, but Prior almost always takes those. Prior was really angry, almost gritting his teeth as he shook his head. The wicket of Petersen soon changed his mood.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 52-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 4, Kallis 1)</strong> Strauss must be tempted to give Kallis a couple of others of rough stuff from Finn. Against that Swann is bowling really well, and Kalls gets an inside edge onto the pad and not far wide of Taylor at short leg. South Africa by 46. Can anyone lend me some beta-blockers please?</p> <p>\"My good chum Dominic Sayers did <a href=\"http://blog.dominicsayers.com/2011/04/12/umpire-ranking/\">an Umpires' DRS-o-meter in April of last year</a>,\" says Ant Pease. \"It's now out of date, but shows pretty much what you just said; that Aleem Dar is very good indeed. Daryl Harper, not so much.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 57-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 2)</strong> Kallis has a filthy record on this ground: 23 runs in four Test innings before this, one run in two ODI innings and 20-odd in his only T20 knock here. He hooks Broad for a single and then Amla plays a gorgeous back-foot square drive for four.</p> <p>\"Please don't get carried away,\" says Clare Davies. \"England are not 'flying'. It's just good Test cricket and the most excited we should get is to exclaim 'Game on' in discreet and refined tones. All right?\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 61-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> The camera cuts to an admirable obese gentleman in the pavilion as Swann comes in to bowl again. After blocking a few, Kallis drives Swann imperiously over mid on for four. That was a seriously good shot.</p> <p>\"The photo,\" says Iain Chambers. \"I'm pretty sure that old geezer puffing on a stogie forgot his bow tie and has cunningly fashioned one out if a Tunnocks caramel wafer wrapper.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 66-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> Amla wears a short ball from Broad on the body \u2013 and then Kallis takes one on the helmet, completely missing an attempted hook. The ball bounced off the helmet and overs the slips for four leg byes. I would definitely give Finn a short spell at Swann's end before Kallis gets his eye in.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 70-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 11, Kallis 7)</strong> \"I think it's time to retire the term '110%',\" says John Starbuck. \"Ever since Chancellor Ozzy started using it, in what he (probably) fondly imagines to be a knowing, ironic way, it's become the numerate's equivalent of 'inter web', still employed by crass lifestyle journalists. Squares, the lot of 'em.\" Oh it's a hideous term. I used it knowingly. Obviously. In fact it's a decent rule of thumb: if you read a cringeworthy term or phrase on the OBO, just assume it's being used knowingly. Yeah?</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 81-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 12, Kallis 16)</strong> Kallis makes room to uppercut Broad high over the cordon for four, and concludes the over with another boundary, driven beautifully off the back foot. This pair have regrouped calmly after that manic 10 minutes when England took two wickets and had Amla dropped.</p> <p>\"If I stay in this pub with my gin, not talking to anyone and only reading the OBO, will I forget about football?\" says Liz Rippin. \"Or will Amla ruin my weekend anyway by batting his way to a million runs? Please advise.\" Are you a Liverpool fan? Did they not win today? Oh well, there's always 2013-14. Besides, if you drink enough gin, by 11pm you'll be convinced they won 7-1, with all eight goals from Andy Carroll.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 85-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 16, Kallis 16)</strong> What a beautiful shot from Amla. He was given a hint of width by Swann, and skipped back to cut it emphatically for four.</p> <p>\"Amla, when he's facing Swann, is shuffling from leg to off to a ridiculous degree. By the time he hits the ball, his leg stump is completely exposed,\" says SB Tang. \"Swann just needs to spear in a well-disguised yorker onto his leg stump. I seem to recall Amir dismissing Simon Katich \u2014 another obdurate leg-to-off shuffler \u2014 at Headingley in July 2010 with a ball that pitched outside leg and swung back to clatter into the leg stump.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 92-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 20, Kallis 19)</strong> Anderson replaces Broad, who bowled a good ageing-ball spell of 5-0-19-1. He strives for a reverse swinging yorker to Kallis, who waves it superbly wide of mid on for three. Amla then pings a beautiful square drive for four. South Africa have scored 22 from the last three overs; the mood of the match has changed yet again.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 94-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 21, Kallis 20)</strong> Swann is milked for a couple. This partnership is starting to look a little ominous for England.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 101-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 28, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla brings up a fine fifty partnership with a thick edge for four off Anderson. South Africa lead by 94, there are 17 overs left in the day, and England are in the same postcode as the place called 'need a wicket'.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 102-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 29, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla sweeps Swann for another single. These two look a bit too comfortable for comfort. It might well be time for a bit of Finn music with a couple of men back.</p> <p>\"I'm following the cricket to forget about that other sport, and the repeated mental beatings that Liverpool visit upon me,\" says Matt Dony. \"Three months of excitement wiped out in 90 painful minutes. Please don't add to that. Just allow me to read about the jeffing cricket. I've been nothing but supportive, and I always defend your crass cliches as 'knowing'. All I ask is a little reciprocation. Viva cricket!\" There's no need to be sad. I don't care what anyone says, the race for a Champions League place in 2018-19 is wide open.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 111-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 30, Kallis 24)</strong> The ball hasn't reversed much for Anderson. A couple of induckers but nothing more. Kallis opens the face to steer another boundary to the vacant third-man area, and the following delivery swings down the leg side for four byes. South Africa are scoring far too quickly at the moment, with 41 from the last seven overs.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 112-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 31, Kallis 24)</strong> Swann breathes new life into the game with a fine over that include three huge appeals. He <em>begs </em>for LBW when Amla is hit on the back leg, but Kumar Dharmasena says not out. Swann wants to review it, Strauss is not convinced. England have only one review left and I suppose they can't risk it. It's the right decision as it hit the pad outside the line of off stump. There's an even bigger appeal next ball when Amla gets in a tangle as he attempts a slap to leg. Again Dharmasena says not out, again England decide not to review and again it's the right decision: this one was turning past the leg stump. Then there's a third LBW appeal, this time against Kallis. It wasn't a bad shout but he was outside the line. Excellent work from Kumar Dharmasena, who after an iffy start to this match has had a very good day.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 116-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 35, Kallis 24)</strong> Finn comes on for Anderson. England are starting to make things happen again at the end of a long day. Amla inside edges consecutive deliveries, the first wide of off stump for two and the second onto the pad, from where it lands safely on the off side. There are 13 overs remaining today. Please please please please please let England take another wicket or seven.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 121-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 25)</strong> Swann now has no slip but two men on the leg side, short leg and backward short leg. Amla clips a full delivery through midwicket for four with beautiful timing.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 125-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 29)</strong> Another boundary to the vacant third man area, with Kallis forcing Finn wide of the slip cordon. This has been a fantastic partnership at a crunch time in the entire series. Amla and Kallis have not so much coped with the pressure as ignored it. If they are still here at the close, South Africa will sleep very soundly tonight.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 126-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 40, Kallis 29)</strong> Amla just about gets his bat down on a horrible grubber from Swann, although I think he'd have been outside the line anyway.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 128-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 29)</strong> Ten overs remaining. One last push, from Queen, country and mace, and to keep Piers Morgan's mouth shut. Finn is getting a bit of reverse inswing and has a big shout for LBW against Amla turned down by Simon Taufel. Height is the issue, as ever with Finn, and Strauss is not interested. Replays show it was bouncing over the top.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 130-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann's figures are 18-4-33-1. Pr-etty good indeed, although Enlgand could really do with one becoming two before the close and to hell with that Spice Girls song.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Finn's certainly reversing it now. He also gets one delivery to seam back grotesquely towards Kallis, who takes it on the arm without complaint. \"That would have been three months off for you Nass...\" says Beefy on Sky. Seven overs remaining; a wicket now would be pure gold for England.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann switches around the wicket to Amla, who will have to change his approach. He had been exposing all three stumps when moving towards the off side to repel Swann. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 131-3 (Kallis LBW b Finn 31)</strong> Kallis has been given out LBW by Simon Taufel \u2013 but he must think he's hit it because he reviewed the decision instantly. Hang on, the first replay suggests he he didn't hit it: the two noises were the ball hitting both pads. Height is the other big issue. It only needs to shave the bails for it to be out. Here comes Hawkeye ... <strong>he's gone</strong>! It was smacking the middle-and-leg bail. This is a <em>huge</em> moment in the game. Kallis is really unhappy \u2013 he thinks he's been stiffed in both innings \u2013 but that looked a perfectly fair decision. There was nothing at all on Hotspot. He pushed around his front pad at a good delivery that came in just enough to beat the inside edge as Kallis pushed around his pad. His bat made contact with his pad as well, and I think that's why he thought he hit the ball.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 131-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Steyn 0)</strong> Dale Steyn is in as nightwatchman. There are still five overs remaining after this, but we won't get them all because play has to end at 6.30pm. Steyn survives the remainder of a fine over from Finn, a wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 136-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 48, Steyn 0)</strong> Look, I know greed is one of the seven deadly sins \u2013 and look what happened to that bloke in Se7en who got greedy \u2013 but I don't care. The wicket of Kallis was lovely and brilliant and spiffing and life-affirming, but could we have Amla before the close as well please? Nice one.</p> <p>It doesn't happen in that over. Swann, still around the wicket, bowls a strange long hop that is smashed for four by Amla. At first I thought it was a Warne-style bouncer but in fact it just slipped out. It was the filthiest delivery of the series. \"One twenty for four here lads,\" shouts one of the England fielders, which is the definition of optimism given South Africa are 136 for three.</p> <p>In other news, Snickometer suggests that Kallis <em>might</em> have got an inside edge, but it's not conclusive \u2013 so much was happening at the same time \u2013 and there's no way the decision could have been overturned, even if Snicko was available to the third umpire.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 137-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 49, Steyn 0)</strong> Amla, driven back in his crease, pushes Finn off the face of the bat and just wide of Taylor, diving to his left at short leg. Steyn then takes a hit on the glove from Finn and calls for treatment. He's in a bit of pain here. The break (in play, not on Steyn's left hand) will ensure this should be the last over of the day. Steyn gets into line for the last two balls of the over. We will have time for one more.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 145-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 57, Steyn 0)</strong> Stuart Broad will bowl the last over of the day, a smart move from Andrew Strauss. Amla drives him sweetly through mid off for four to reach a tough and vital half century, and then fizzes another boundary through extra cover. That's the end of another storming day's Test cricket: 85.3 overs, 252 runs, eight wickets and the match still in the balance. South Africa lead by 139 and are slight favourites, but England are still right in this. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Ah, opening day. This excerpt from Saturday's clockwatch sums up much of the emotion:</p> <blockquote> <strong>This year it'll be different, won't it?</strong> Those point-snatching spirit-sapping last-minute equalisers after you've dominated. Those spineless defeats just when things were beginning to look up. Those ex-players who were useless in your shirt but just happen to play a blinder when they rock up with their new employers. Those referees that gave you nothing. Those skewed clearances. Those shanked shots. Those short corners (because you never score from short corners). That goal that definitely wasn't offside, wasn't even close. That pie at Gresty Road that you knew was a mistake even before you'd got your change. That seven-hour round-trip to wherever the back of beyond meets the arse-end of nowhere only to see your boys 2-0 down after 15 minutes. That new season-changing signing that gets crocked in his first training session. That uninspiring FA Cup draw (and subsequent miserable exit). The substitute the manager won't bring on even though everyone in the ground can see he's just what you need with 10 minutes to go. That goalkeeper with palms greasier than an adolescent's nose. That berk of a centre-half who wanted an extra touch even though the forward was closing in and he was only going to hoof it anyway. That full-back who inexplicably seems to be ever-so-slightly-slower than every winger he ever comes up against. That midfielder with the control and poise of a goat on a unicycle but none of the pace. That striker who just-needs-one-to-go-on-off-his-bum but has needed one to go in off his bum for the LAST BLOODY SIX MONTHS and would actually be far more useful thank you very much if he could just put one in with his foot when six yards out with the goal gaping and the keeper nowhere to be seen. They're all things off the past - memories, ghosts, tattered rags of old emotions left to drift about the deserted streets of yesterday. <strong>This year it'll be different, won't it?</strong> </blockquote> <p>We know it won't be, not really, but for one day we can let the two-faced maniac that is Hope carry us away. Spare a thought, then, for long-suffering fans of Exeter City. The unwanted Award for Home Fans Having Optimism Sucked Out Of Them Quickest On Opening Day went to the Grecians, who were 3-0 down at home to Morecambe after 32 minutes. On the bright side, that was the final score. So at least it didn't get any worse.</p> <p>\u2022 Also looking on the bright side were Bristol City fans after their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest. It's the first time they've lost by fewer than three goals on opening day in three years.</p> <p>\u2022 The Pozzo era at Watford got off to a winning start. The Hornets were trailing 2-1 to Crystal Palace with two minutes to go, but Almen Abdi (on loan from Udinese) and Matej Vydra (on loan from Udinese) scored in the 88th and 94th minutes respectively to give Gianfranco Zola a winning start. <a href=\"http://www.englandfootballblog.com/2012/08/14/watfords-academy-destroyed-by-foreign-ownership/\" title=\"\">Shame about the academy, though</a>. And there were late goals too for Birmingham (who rescued a 1-1 draw against Charlton thanks to Nikola Zigic), Sheffield Wednesday (who completed a comeback from 2-0 down against Derby in the first minute of stoppage time), Hull (who bagged a winner at home to Brighton) and Ipswich (who grabbed a draw against Blackburn).</p> <p>\u2022 When the fixtures were released in the summer, you'd have forgiven Owen Coyle for cursing his luck. His relegated Bolton side visited Turf Moor, a venue at which promised a ferocious atmosphere and a home team motivated by more than just opening-day enthusiasm. And it proved an unhappy return for the Wanderers manager, with Burnley bagging a comfortably 2-0 win.</p> <p>\u2022 Every 75 or so years Halley's Comet can be seen from earth, but at Fratton Park on Saturday afternoon there appeared something that has not been seen, by my reckoning at least, for 124 years. Portsmouth fielded a first XI of debutants, quite possibly the first time it has happened in the Football League since the original members kicked things off back on 8 September 1888. Almost 18,000 were there to watch Pompey \u2013 who we are contractually obliged to describe as \"beleagured\", \"embattled\", \"cash-strapped\" or variations on the theme \u2013 go ahead against Bournemouth through Izale McLeod before being pegged back by a visiting debutant, Lee Barnard.</p> <p>\u2022 There were mixed results for the other relegated sides in League One \u2013 Doncaster thumped Walsall 3-0, while Coventry were held to 1-1 draw by Yeovil (15 years ago those sides were separated by 100 positions in the pyramid).</p> <p>\u2022 After eight years in the Conference, York City made their return to the Football League on Saturday but the party at Bootham Crescent was pooped by Wycombe, who ran out 3-1 winners. Fleetwood Town, the other newcomers to the league, were held to a 0-0 draw by Torquay.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Song will complete a \u00a315m transfer to Barcelona in the next 48 hours after Arsenal agreed terms for a five-year deal. The Cameroonian midfielder, who was conspicuously absent from Saturday's 0-0 draw against Sunderland, had made it known that he, like Robin van Persie, wished to leave and he now follows the route to the Camp Nou taken by Cesc F\u00e1bregas a year ago. Song had three years left on his contract.</p> <p>\"He expressed his desire to go to Barcelona,\" Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said. \"We have Abou Diaby coming back, Jack Wilshere coming back in one to one-and-a-half months, and Tomas Rosicky is not far away. We might bring another midfielder in as well.\" That is expected to be Nuri Sahin from Real Madrid.</p> <p>Barcelona said Song would undergo a medical on Monday before joining the rest of the squad for an official team presentation later on.</p> <p>Arsenal, who lost Van Persie to Manchester United on Friday, could not find a way past Sunderland despite debuts for the strikers Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud and the playmaker Santi Cazorla.</p> <p>Inevitably Wenger was asked afterwards whether Arsenal would have won had Van Persie been there. \"Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. We can never check that,\" he said. \"But it's true last year in every game he found something special. I never deny we lost a world class player and it is very difficult to replace him.\"</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Throughout the decades that he haunted her, Winnie Johnson had only one question for Ian Brady: \"Where is my son Keith?\"</p> <p>Of the five victims Brady is known to have killed with his lover, Myra Hindley, only Keith's body has never been found. But until her death in the early hours of Saturday morning, Mrs Johnson never stopped hoping she would find her son's remains. The 78-year-old widow had expressed the hope that one day Keith's coffin would be carried in a horse-drawn hearse to a Manchester cemetery. For years she kept a simple wooden cross on her mantelpiece that she dreamed of placing on Keith's grave.</p> <p>Her son was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother on 16 June 1964. As with the four other victims whom Brady and Hindley lured to their deaths and sexually tortured, Keith was buried on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester.</p> <p>\"The thought of him alone there for eternity fills my every waking moment with dread,\" his mother once said. \"I didn't retire until I was 70 because I had to stay busy to occupy my mind. Keith was 12 when I lost him, a little boy with broken spectacles and a shiny new bike who loved nature and collecting coins. That's how I remember him because, of course, he never reached manhood. A combination of that image of innocence, and the fact that I feel so guilty about him being alone the day he was snatched, meant I had to fight Brady right to the end. There was only him and me left. I was determined never, ever to relent.\"</p> <p>In 1987 Brady was taken back to the moor as police sought the remains of Keith and another victim, Pauline Reade, but only Reade's remains were found.</p> <p>Professor Malcolm MacCulloch, one of Brady's former psychiatrists, has suggested the visit was an attempt by Brady, now 74, to exercise control over his victims' families from within the confines of a high-security mental hospital.</p> <p>\"It's just possible that Ian Brady was on the moor and checked the site without letting on, as it were,\" MacCulloch told the BBC in 2004. \"Final control is the possession of the body. 'I know, you don't know. You want to know and I'm not going to tell you'.\"</p> <p>Professor Jeremy Coid, another psychiatrist who treated Brady, told a Channel 4 <em>Cutting Edge</em> documentary, to be screened on Monday night, that \"withholding information as to where bodies might be buried is an enormously pleasurable sense of control for somebody who is obsessed with control\".</p> <p>The effects of battling Brady left psychological scars on Mrs Johnson. \"Ian Brady has tortured me for over 40 years and enjoyed every minute of it,\" she said. \"He is like Hannibal Lecter, getting pleasure from mind games. He did his best to drive me mad, even though behind bars. I felt at times that his mind was in search of my soul. Many times he nearly pushed me over the edge.\"</p> <p>But time was running out and last December Mrs Johnson said she wanted to hear face-to-face from Brady where her son was buried.</p> <p>In July, gravely ill with terminal cancer, she renewed her plea, saying in a letter to Brady that her dying wish was to find Keith's body. Her recent move to a hospice prompted Channel 4 to bring forward the <em>Cutting Edge</em> documentary <em>Ian Brady: Endgames of a Psychopath</em> in which it is alleged Brady had left a sealed envelope for Mrs Johnson to be opened in the event of his death.</p> <p>\"No one can verify the contents of the envelope, and therefore what information it does or does not contain, but given the enormity of the implications as suggested by Brady's letter we felt we had a responsibility to inform the family,\" explained Emma Cooper, Channel 4 documentaries commissioning editor. \"Winnie's poor health was foremost in our decision-making and this is why we have decided to bring forward the broadcast of the film and make the existence of the envelope public.\"</p> <p>Jackie Powell, who has been Brady's mental health advocate for the last 15 years, told the programme that she received a letter of instruction and a sealed envelope from Brady via his solicitors. She told the programme: \"He says that he doesn't wish to take secrets to his grave and that within the sealed envelope is a letter to Winnie Johnson and that within that is the means to her possibly being able to rest.\"</p> <p>But doubts are growing about whether the letter, said to have been written 10 years ago, still exists or ever existed. Police have searched Powell's house but to no avail. Powell has claimed she handed it back to Brady, but a search of his room at Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital has proven fruitless.</p> <p>One possibility is that, in keeping with his sadistic character, the letter was a hoax, an act of malice by a psychopath immune to the damage he had done.</p> <p>\"A lost child is something which destroys part of you at the time and then the rest of you slowly,\" Mrs Johnson said. \"It can and does drive you mad, properly mad. And it also makes you want to kill the perpetrator. I would like to tie Ian Brady to a stake in the street and tear bits of flesh off him, torturing him as slowly and as completely as he has tortured me. And then when he was dead I'd happily bang the nails into his coffin myself. I don't have to explain why. The grief never goes away.\"</p>",
  "<p>A storm of criticism broke in Russia following the harsh two-year prison sentences given to three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot for protesting against the government in a Moscow cathedral. Those openly critical of the jail terms included some who are close to Vladimir Putin and others with strong links to the church, increasing pressure on the authorities to treat the trio more leniently.</p> <p>Three members of the punk collective \u2013 Maria Alyokhina, 24, Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22 \u2013 were sentenced to serve two years in a penal colony on Friday after being found guilty of \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\". A Moscow judge rejected the defence's argument that the band's performance of an anti-Putin \"punk prayer\" was a form of political protest and ruled that it was motivated by hatred for Russian Orthodoxy.</p> <p>Alexey Kudrin, a former finance minister who remains a close ally of Putin, said: \"The verdict in the case against the Pussy Riot punk band isn't only a fact in the lives of three young women; it is also yet another blow to the justice system and, above all, Russian citizens' belief in it.\"</p> <p>Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, another member of the country's minority liberal elite, also attacked the verdict, calling it a \"strategic error that terribly damages the authority of the justice system\". He voiced the widespread belief that the court case was politically orchestrated: \"We don't know who took the final decision \u2013 the Kremlin? The patriarch? Probably not the court itself.\"</p> <p>Opposition activists have accused Putin of orchestrating the campaign against Pussy Riot. The trio were arrested after a brief performance in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour of a song calling for the Virgin Mary to \"chase Putin out\". The band formed in response to Putin's decision to return to the presidency, and have gone from being a radical fringe group to becoming the figureheads of a protest movement numbering tens of thousands.</p> <p>The case against Pussy Riot was widely seen as serving as a warning to other protesters, as well as a means of appealing to Putin's deeply conservative base. A poll released on Friday by the Levada Centre, an independent pollster, found that 44% of Russians believed the case against the band was conducted in a just manner. Most of those polled also believed the case was initiated by groups linked to the Russian Orthodox church.</p> <p>In a sign that the women might be released early in a bid to ease tensions and boost Russia's international image, the church released a statement late on Friday calling on the authorities to show mercy. \"Without putting the correctness of the court's decision into any doubt, we call on the state authorities to show mercy to the convicts, within the framework of the law, in the hope that they will refrain from repeating blasphemous actions,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Andrei Isayev, a high-ranking member of the ruling United Russia party, also spoke out against the verdict. \"The verdict is harsh. The president still might take a decision. But nonetheless this verdict which, probably, will be taken negatively by some of our liberal intelligentsia, will be taken as just by a significant number of people.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for the Pussy Riot trio have said they will appeal. A request for a pardon would require an admission of guilt, which the women have said they will not give.</p> <p>Even some of Putin's loudest supporters called the verdict a mistake. Tina Kandelaki, a prominent media personality and Putin cheerleader, called the verdict and sentence \"information suicide\" and \"wrong at its very roots\".</p> <p>\"For some reason, from the very beginning, Putin's advisers gave the president a new 'Khodorkovsky',\" she said, referring to jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whose arrest in 2003 signalled Putin's willingness to jail political critics, say critics.</p> <p>\"The millions of dollars of taxpayer money spent in the last few years on fixing the image of our country abroad have been thrown to the wind,\" she said. \"Our image in the eyes of the world is getting closer to a medieval dictatorship, although in reality we are not that.\"</p> <p>The case has deepened the rift that emerged in Russian society following the unexpected appearance of a mass protest movement against Putin's return to the presidency. Some in the opposition movement gave dire predictions of what lay ahead.</p> <p>Referring to the performance art collective <em>Voina</em> (\"War\"), from which Pussy Riot emerged, opposition Duma deputy Dmitry Gudkov tweeted after the verdict: \"So, there was the art group War, and now there will be real war. Idiots.\"</p> <p>Condemnation also came from western capitals and human rights groups. The US state department said it was concerned by the ruling and urged the Kremlin to review the case. Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the verdict had done \"real damage\" to Russia's image internationally. \"It creates an image of a neanderthal country which can imprison young people for indulging in silly pranks. It is a huge own goal. Putin will have alienated a large amount of Russian youth in the process.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International called the verdict a \"travesty\". \"[It] shows that the Russian authorities will stop at no end to suppress dissent and stifle civil society,\" Michelle Ringuette, of Amnesty, said in a statement. \"Each step in the case has been an affront to human rights.\"</p>",
  "<p>Five days after the final Olympic athlete left the village, the spruced-up complex is ready to open its doors again for the first of the 4,200 Paralympians who will compete in London.</p> <p>The village, featuring accessible toilets and ramps and upgraded rooms, will begin receiving the first athletes on Monday, with the British team \u2013 ParalympicsGB \u2013 due to arrive on 22 August, seven days before the Games' opening ceremony.</p> <p>Among the other changes made in a rapid overhaul of the Olympic Park, thousands of signs, banners and flags have been replaced, 2,000 vehicles rebranded and almost 300 converted, and another group of Games volunteers introduced \u2013 only 30% of whom also worked during the Olympics.</p> <p>The organiser Chris Holmes said: \"All it relies on is getting tens of thousands of details right \u2026 It's about doing everything we need to do so that athletes can focus on giving the performance of their lives.\"</p> <h2> THE GB TARGET</h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>UK Sport has told ParalympicsGB what it wants in return for its \u00a349m funding: a minimum of 103 medals this summer from at least 12 different sports, and at least second place in the medals table.

  "<p>At the conclusion of an active summer, Arsenal were left hot and bothered. Despite the presence of three new players around which Ars\u00e8ne Wenger intends to build his attack, Arsenal sweated and stuttered and found no way through Martin O'Neill's resilient Sunderland.</p> <p>It felt like a chef had thrown together a bunch of ingredients but could not pull together a mouthwatering meal in a hurry. It was bland at times, as Arsenal lacked cohesion, communication and natural combinations. Perhaps it was not altogether surprising that they played a little like strangers. Compared to the final game from last season, Arsenal had seven different names in the starting XI.</p> <p>Wenger acknowledged there was an inevitable, awkward question that will trail around them in performances when they falter in front of goal. If Robin van Persie were there would they have won? \"Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. We can never check that. But it's true last year in every game he found something special. I never deny we lost a world class player and it is very difficult to replace him.\" Alex Song has also gone, with terms agreed with Barcelona for the Cameroonian's transfer.</p> <p>O'Neill anticipated there might be a special nuance in the atmosphere hot on the heels Van Persie's move. But the most helpful thing from a Sunderland point of view was that Arsenal simply could not click. After two chances in 11 minutes \u2013 James McClean's snap shot and a well worked move that fell to the excellent Jack Colback \u2013 they resorted to a rearguard action. New arrival Carlos Cu\u00e9llar played his part and slotted expertly into the back four.</p> <p>Arsenal's game revolved around Santi Cazorla. Fresh \u2013 if he'll pardon the expression \u2013 from a midweek long haul to Puerto Rico, he immediately showed he has the quality to pull strings at will. He found space easily, and with his polished touch and seemingly equal control with either foot, was able to spray passes, launch set pieces, and he even did not mind pressing to win the ball. First impressions suggest Arsenal might have landed themselves a gem. \"It is difficult not to be pleased with him,\" said Wenger. \"Basically he created all the chances.\"</p> <p>But for him to be a successful creative hub, he needs greater understanding with his new team-mates, who were not quite on his wavelength.Arsenal did not make the best of Cazorla's invention. In the sixth minute he ambled forward and let rip. Simon Mignolet thrust up a strong hand to push the Spaniard's effort over the bar. Shortly after, Gervinho carved Sunderland open and Cazorla nipped in ahead of Lukas Podolski but steered his shot narrowly wide.</p> <p>It was not quite happening for the Germany international. He was tantalisingly close but frustratingly far from clean connection on more than one occasion. Three minutes before half-time, the lead went begging as Mikel Arteta, Cazorla and Theo Walcott combined to set up Podolski, but the determined mass blocking of three Sunderland players smothered the danger. He gave way to Olivier Giroud, who scooped his first chance over the bar, then shanked wide when he was teed up by Cazorla. His physical presence augered well but his sharpness was not yet there.</p> <p>O'Neill was relieved to see Sunderland hold out when they began to feel the effects of fatigue in the burning sunshine. Further forward they, too, were missing sharpness. \"St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon had two days training and Louis Saha has not had anything all summer,\" noted O'Neill. \"I thought coming here would be particularly difficult. We had a disappointing pre-season and we were very tired indeed, but that game will bring us on immensely.\" He also added that new recruits are expected before the close of the transfer window.</p> <p>Wenger assessed that his new strikers were not entirely geared up to plunge into Premier League football. \"Podolski is not ready yet,\" he admitted. \"Physically he lacks that change of pace. Giroud had a great chance and we expected him to score.\" Wenger did not beat about the bush in concluding that the result was a \"greatly missed opportunity.\"</p> <p>Emerging from the shadow of Van Persie's departure might take time. It seems there is no quick fix.</p>",
  "<p>For a man who insists he bears Liverpool no grudges after being sacked via a pho\u200bne call from human resources in the summer, Steve Clarke exacted a most brutal revenge. West Bromwich Albion inflicted a methodical, measured torture on the club their new head coach served for 18 months. For Brendan Rodgers, the first day at the office in the Premier League disintegrated into a calamity.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager bemoaned referee Phil Dowd's decision to dismiss Daniel Agger for a professional foul on Shane Long and the ease with which the Republic of Ireland striker went to ground for Albion's second penalty of the afternoon. He had a point, Long does go to ground too easily as many of his peers do but as the clock ticked towards 90 and Albion ran riot thanks to goals from Zoltan Gera, Peter Odemwingie and Romelu Lukaku, it is no exaggeration to say Rodgers presided over a shambolic defensive display. He was fortunate that Liverpool did not join the list of those to suffer a 5-0 hiding on the opening day.</p> <p>Everything that could go wrong did so for Liverpool and Albion, driven by the impressive James Morrison, the control of new signing Claudio Yacob in central midfield and the force of late substitute Lukaku, were devastating. Satisfaction for Clarke lay in the manner of his first victory at the helm after years as a loyal lieutenant to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Kenny Dalglish and others, not the dishevelled state of the team he left behind.</p> <p>\"The manner of my departure from Liverpool is not an issue,\" Clarke said. \"That's what happens in football nowadays. It doesn't give me any added satisfaction and I have no axe to grind with Liverpool.</p> <p>\"If this is the way it is going to be every week then great but I've been in the game long enough to know there are different Saturdays to come.\"</p> <p>Rodgers's league bow would not have surprised many seasoned Liverpool observers or Clarke. Initially at least, the visitors carried the greater threat in an open, absorbing first half. They stretched Albion with Joe Allen making an encouraging debut and Luis Su\u00e1rez bristling with menace but, as was the case throughout last season, his finishing did not complement the approach.</p> <p>The Uruguay international missed three excellent chances, put several wide or too close to Ben Foster and was booked for dissent against the referee's assistant as his frustrations boiled over once again. In another echo of last season they were unable to respond to falling behind and, once Agger walked, their performance collapsed.</p> <p>For 32 minutes Liverpool glimpsed a future without their Danish defender. It is ugly. Agger will miss next \u200bweekend's home game against Manchester City \u2013 unless Liverpool appeal and win \u2013 and the club who have had a \u00a320m bid rejected for the centre-half will be confident of adding to Rodgers's misery on this evidence.</p> <p>Clarke's side settled quickly with Youssouf Mulumbu and Morrison driving at the heart of the visiting defence. Liam Ridgewell went close with a lofted chip and Long also shot over from an acute angle having dispossessed Lucas Leiva. But otherwise it was Liverpool who created the clearer openings in the first half and contrived to miss them all.</p> <p>Su\u00e1rez squandered three chances before the interval and was accompanied by Glen Johnson and Lucas before The Hawthorns erupted in recognition of a stunning goal from Gera.</p> <p>Martin Skrtel got his head to a Morrison corner and there appeared little danger when it fell to the Hungary international outside the box. It was returned with venom, Gera controlling with his chest and unleashing an unstoppable right-foot finish into the top corner for his first league goal since November 2010.</p> <p>\"I am really pleased for Zoltan,\" Clarke said. \"He has had a horrendous two years with injury and to score that goal was a milestone for him in a way.\"</p> <p>Albion could have sealed the game on the hour when Agger was sent off for pushing Long as he raced into the area from Morrison's pass. The resulting penalty was abject, as Long dithered and rolled the spot-kick straight at Pepe Reina. The Liverpool keeper fell on to the ball in stages.</p> <p>Long did not have to wait long for salvation. Five minutes later, as Skrtel attempted to bring the ball out of his own area, the Albion striker nipped in to steal the ball and tumbled over the defender's leg. To Liverpool astonishment Dowd pointed to the spot again and this time Odemwingie made no mistake with an emphatic finish.</p> <p>Morrison should have added a third after their on-loan Chelsea striker Lukaku brushed aside Skrtel and squared for a simple finish but the midfielder blazed high and wide from 10 yards. Number three did arrive when Ridgewell found himself free in the area and crossed for Lukaku to head inside the far post.</p> <p>The closing stages were painful for Rodgers and Liverpool's travelling support as Albion cut through at will. Joe Cole aggravated a hamstring injury within 10 minutes of coming on and Reina kept the scoreline down, though far from respectable for Rodgers.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama has called on Congress to release billions of dollars in funds to counter the damaging impact of teacher layoffs on America's education system.</p> <p>A report released Saturday by the White House found that more than 300,000 teaching positions had been lost since the end of the recession in 2009, resulting in a 4.6% bump in student-to-teacher ratios.</p> <p>In his weekly address, Obama struck out at obstructionists in Congress for blocking provisions that would support states in preventing further job cuts and help them rehire out-of-work teachers.</p> <p>He also took a swipe at Republicans for putting forward a budget that he claimed would further impact teacher numbers.</p> <p>The president said the financial blueprint put forward by his opponents would lead to \"fewer teachers in the classroom, and fewer college students with access to financial aid, all to pay for a massive new tax cut for millionaires and billionaires\".</p> <p>\"That's backwards, that's wrong. That plan doesn't invest in our future, it undercuts our future.\"</p> <p>The White House claimed that the proposed Republican budget could strip close to $3bn from education grants.</p> <p>They contrast this with the president's job plan that was put forward a year ago, but has only been passed in part.</p> <p>That employment blueprint includes provisions for some $25bn in educational aid. The money is needed, the administration says, to prevent further teacher layoffs.</p> <p>According to the report released Saturday, average class sizes have climbed as a result of an uptick in student-to-teacher rations from a low of 15.3 to one in 2008 to 16 to one in 2010.</p> <p>\"If we want America to lead in the 21st century, nothing is more important than giving everyone the best education possible \u2013 from the day they start preschool to the day they start their career,\" Obama said in his radio address.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the weekly Republican address, House representative Vicky Hartzler attacked Democrats for failing to restore disaster programmes for farmers in the mid-west suffering from the worst drought in a generation.</p> <p>The upper house refused to carry the legislation before breaking for the summer, citing that Republicans in the House had stripped from the bill provisions related to the extension of food stamps.</p> <p>\"A lot was riding on this bill, but the Senate \u2013 a body controlled by the president's party \u2013 left Washington for the month of August without bringing it to a vote,\" the Missouri politician said.</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, in the weeks before America's 2010 elections, I suggested that the safest strategy for voters was to disbelieve all political advertising. It's even more important now.</p> <p>The barrage of lies and distortions this year is looking to dwarf what we saw in the last national campaign. But this time, a huge amount of the money being spent to poison voters' minds is coming from people who lack the honor and/or courage to admit what they're doing.</p> <p>The ads range from slimy to scurrilous, and come mostly from the political right. Those are intended to put Mitt Romney in the White House and install a firmly hard-right Congress, as well as electing Republicans in state races around the nation. The biggest of the organizations creating the ads are giving anonymity to their funders. They are funded by unnamed people and corporations, and congressional Republicans have seen to it these cowards can snipe with impunity.</p> <p>Two of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/two-dark-money-groups-outspending-all-super-pacs-combined/\">what ProPublica, a nonprofit journalism organization, calls \"dark-money\" groups</a> are out-raising and out-spending the organizations that (by law) must say who pays the bills. The two mega-money groups are \"Crossroads GPS\" and \"Americans for Prosperity\" \u2013 the former is a brainchild of Republican operative (and News Corp's Wall Street Journal op-ed columnist) Karl Rove \u2013 and the latter is believed to get at least some of its money from the mega-rich Koch family, which has made a mission of returning America to the lamented era of domination by robber barons.</p> <p>Little of their sludge lands on me. I use the web much more than TV, and I have a hard-disk video recorder in between my satellite dish and television, so I never watch live TV anymore. The recorder, connected to a satellite system, has a button that makes 30 seconds disappear; I use it liberally, and advertising has essentially disappeared from my viewing.</p> <p>But most American television viewers don't have or use such aids, and can scarcely avoid the onslaught of negative ads. They're directly in the advertisers' cross-hairs if they live in \"swing states\", where the outcome of the presidential race is in doubt. (I live in California, where the outcome of presidential and Senate races is not in doubt; the sleazy ads will come later and address, if that's the right word, a variety of ballot propositions.)</p> <p>One of the great scandals in this rancid avalanche is something Americans won't be told by the broadcasters: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/07/who-gets-value-for-money-2billion-election\">TV networks and local stations are making immense profits from these political ads</a>. Hundreds of millions of dollars will flow into the coffers of media companies this year from these sources. The very notion that TV \"news\" \u2013 a word that almost always belongs in sarcastic quotes \u2013 would bite the hand that feeds it is, well, absurd. Television is complicit in this thoroughly corrupt system.</p> <p>We need two kinds of disclosure. One is to unmask the anonymous cowards who pay for the rancid advertising. Since that won't happen as long as Republicans can block legislation, we can at least force some disclosure on the media companies. Naturally, the media industry has been fighting even tame federal regulations that would require the biggest broadcasters to disclose online what they're being paid, and by which organizations, for political advertising. The hypocrisy of media conglomerates, which (occasionally) insist on transparency in government but resist it themselves, is unsurprising.</p> <p>Several journalism and public-interest groups, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/if-tv-stations-wont-post-their-data-on-political-ads-we-will\">including ProPublica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/blog/2012/08/10/seeking-political-ad-sleuths\">Free Press</a>, are trying to persuade citizen journalists in local communities to visit broadcasters' premises and copy the documents which those companies legally must file on paper already, and then post the results online. This is a useful exercise, especially given that the FCC rules \u2013 assuming they're ever obeyed or enforced \u2013 apply only to major TV markets.</p> <p>In the end, we need to persuade the voters that they should do more than ignore the sleazy advertising. They should assume that what they're seeing and hearing is false. This is a hard idea to sell, because at least some of the political advertising has to contain at least some truth. The problem is that we can't know what is truthful and what's not \u2013 and we're crazy if we trust anything we're told by people who hide anonymously in the shadows. Since Congress won't insist on disclosure, the only practical approach for now is to believe nothing.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last few days, Israeli newspapers have been consumed by reports that the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/08/13/why-do-israeli-media-keep-predicting-war-with-iran/\" title=\"\">decided to launch an attack</a> on Iranian nuclear facilities some time this autumn. Although Netanyahu has an obvious interest in increasing pressure on Iran, it would be <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/05/21/if-the-baghdad-nuclear-talks-fail-netanyahu-is-likely-to-attack-iran/\" title=\"\">an error</a> to regard these reports as simple rhetorical sensationalism. In my opinion, whether this year or next, Israel is likely to use its airforce to attack Iran.</p> <p>While it is impossible to know for sure whether Netanyahu will act, it is possible to consider the likely repercussions that would follow an Israeli attack. While it is likely that Iran would retaliate against Israel and possibly the US in response to any attack, it is unlikely that Iran will instigate a major war. Albeit for different reasons, Iran, Israel and the US all understand that a war would not serve their interests.</p> <p>First, the Israeli policy angle. If Netanyahu decides to order an attack on Iran, his focus will be on maximising the success of that action and minimising any negative consequences that might follow. In terms of Iranian retaliation, Israel would expect Iran's core non-state allies Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2012_Gaza-Israel_clashes\" title=\"\">launch rocket attacks</a> into Israeli territory.</p> <p>However, present success with advanced defence systems has helped increase Israeli confidence in their ability to absorb this method of retaliation. Beyond rocket attacks, the Israeli leadership also understands that a likely mechanism for Iranian retaliation is via attacks against Israeli interests internationally. Whether carried out by the Iranian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force\" title=\"\">Quds Force</a> or Hezbollah, or a combination of both, various incidents this year have shown Israel that Iran continues to regard <a href=\"http://www.tomroganthinks.com/2012/07/bulgaria-bus-explosion.html\" title=\"\">covert action</a> as a powerful weapon.</p> <p>The key for Israel is that, while these Iranian capabilities are seen as credible, they are not seen to pose intolerable threats to Israel. Faced with rocket strikes or limited attacks abroad \u2013 to which the likely response would be air strikes or short-duration ground operations (not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War\" title=\"\">a repeat of 2006</a>) in Lebanon and Gaza \u2013 Israel would be unlikely to pursue major secondary retaliation against Iran. Certainly, Israel would not want to encourage intervention by Syria's Assad alongside Iran (an outcome that might follow major retaliatory Israeli action).</p> <p>If Netanyahu does decide to take action, Israeli objectives would be clearly limited. The intent would be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear capability while minimising escalation towards war. Israel has no interest in a major conflict that would risk serious damage to the Israeli state.</p> <p>Though holding opposite objectives, Iran's attitude concerning a major war is similar to Israel's.</p> <p>While Iran regards nuclear capability as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/24/iran-sanctions-nuclear\" title=\"\">prospectively guaranteeing</a> the survival of its Islamic revolution, clerical leaders also understand that initiating a major war would make American intervention likely. Such intervention would pose an existential threat to the theocratic project that underpins the Islamic Republic.</p> <p>Thus, in the event of an Israeli attack, Iran's response would be finely calibrated towards achieving three objectives:</p> <p>\u2022 First, punishing Israel for its attack.</p> <p>\u2022 Second, deterring further Israeli strikes and so creating space for a reconstituted Iranian nuclear programme.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, weakening US/international support for Israel so as to increase Israeli isolation and vulnerability.</p> <p>Hezbollah, Hamas and other non-state allies would play a major role in effecting Iranian retaliation. Iran may also attempt to launch a number of its new <a href=\"http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/irans-ballistic-missile-program\" title=\"\">Sajjil-2 medium-range missiles</a> against Israel. Again, however, using these missiles would risk major retaliation if many Israeli citizens were killed.</p> <p>As a preference, Iran would probably perceive that utilising Hamas and Hezbollah would allow retaliation without forcing Netanyahu into a massive counter-response. Crucially, I believe Iran regards that balancing its response would enable it to buy time for a reconstituted, hardened nuclear programme. In contrast to the <a href=\"http://www.isisnucleariran.org/sites/\" title=\"\">relatively open current structure</a>, sites would be deeper underground and far less vulnerable to a future attack. The nuclear ambition would not be lost, simply delayed.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a final objective for retaliation, Iran would wish to weaken Israel's relationship with the US and the international community. This desire might encourage Iran to take action against US navy assets in the Gulf and/or attempt to mine the Strait of Hormuz, so as to cause a price spike in global oil markets and increased international discomfort.</p> <p>However, beyond their rhetoric, the Iranian leadership understand that they cannot win a military contest against the US, nor hold the strait for longer than a few days. For Iran then, as with Israel, regional war is far from desirable.</p> <p>Finally, consider the US. It is now clear that Obama and Netanyahu <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCdR0-sxm1w\" title=\"\">disagree on Iran</a>. In my opinion, Netanyahu does not believe Obama will ever be willing to take pre-emptive military action against Iran's nuclear programme. Conversely, Obama believes Netanyahu's diplomatic expectations are too hasty and excessively restrictive.</p> <p>The policy distance between these two leaders appears increasingly irreconcilable. If Netanyahu decides to go it alone and attack Iran, the US president will face the unpleasant scenario of having to protect American interests while avoiding an escalation dynamic that might spin out of control towards war. This difficulty is accentuated by Obama's re-election race and his fear of the domestic economic fallout that may come from the decisions that he might have to make. Again, the simple point is that the US government has no interest in a war with Iran.&#xa0;</p> <p>If Netanyahu decides to take military action, he will do so in a strategic environment in which Israel, Iran and the US have no preference for a major war. Each state views the prospect of a war as counter to their particular long-term ambitions.</p> <p>Because of this, while serious, Iranian retaliation would be unlikely to produce an escalatory dynamic leading to war. The leadership of each of these states will restrain their respective actions in the pursuit of differing long-term objectives but common short-term ones.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article are currently set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed earlier</p>",
  "<p>They are currently a small emergent group of volunteer activists committed to direct action on the seas. But by the end of the year, if meticulous planning pays off, <a href=\"http://theblackfish.org/\" title=\"\">the Black Fish</a> could be making headlines with the launch of a guerrilla-style campaign against illegal fishing in European waters.</p> <p>Taking their name from the term given to illegally caught fish, the Amsterdam-based group has a budget of only a few thousand pounds a year and pays no salaries, but boasts contacts and activists from across Europe, including Britain. Within weeks it expects to have raised around \u00a3500,000 from wealthy European backers to buy its first boat, a former coastguard vessel.</p> <p>The aim will be high-profile confrontation on the high seas. Greenpeace's first action was to sail to the Aleutian islands to stop the dropping of an atomic bomb. The Black Fish crew of 12 will sail to the Mediterranean, where they plan to stay for three years to confront illegal fishermen, and, they hope, embarrass commercial companies and persuade Europe to ban completely the catching of endangered fish, such as the bluefin tuna that they have released off Croatia.</p> <p>Each year 30-40,000 tonnes of Atlantic bluefin tuna are legally caught in the Mediterranean and towed to farms in Croatia and elsewhere in giant nets. The fish are then fattened for several months until they reach the target size of around 250kg, when they are sold, largely to Japan, where a single 269kg fish was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/japanese-half-million-pound-tuna\" title=\"\">sold this year for a record price of nearly half a million pounds</a>.</p> <p>Most Mediterranean tuna farms act responsibly, but spiralling prices encourage trawlers to far exceed quota limits and catch many juveniles. The result, says conservation group WWF, is that up to 20,000 tonnes of tuna are illegally caught each year. Breeding numbers have plummeted in the last five years, suggesting that the whole fishery could collapse within a few years, perhaps never to recover.</p> <p>The tuna trade will be the Black Fish's primary target. \"We have identified the boat \u2013 we are on the point of buying it \u2013 the crew has put their lives on hold and we are ready to go,\" says Wietse van der Werf, a Dutch environmental activist who spent six years in Nottingham working with Earth First! and was co-founder of the community media group Notts Indymedia.</p> <p>The group sees itself as a young, fleet-footed organisation with most of its founders and members in their 20s and none of the disadvantages and burdens of bureaucratic, membership-based organisations.</p> <p>Last month the group released thousands of endangered bluefin tuna, worth millions of pounds on the Japanese market, after activists located a series of Croatian fish farms where tuna were being fattened up. As guard boats circled and under the eyes of men in a watchtower, members of the group cut a large hole in one of the nets and watched a silver tide of the most expensive fish in the world escape into the Adriatic. According to the group, thousands of tuna of all ages and sizes escaped.</p> <p>In another successful action, a small group of Black Fish divers went to Japan and cut the nets of six pens in Taiji that were holding dolphins destined for international theme parks. The group has also won a battle to close down a German dolphinarium.</p> <p>Van der Werf, a vegan who says he encountered police spy Mark Kennedy when he infiltrated their group in Nottingham, has travelled twice to the Antarctic with Paul Watson's Sea Shepherd conservation group to stop Japanese whaling. In 2010 he helped Watson release 800 bluefin tuna off the Libyan coast, an action that led to a court case that was dismissed earlier this year.</p> <p>\"I came off the Sea Shepherd boat with nothing. I borrowed \u20ac500 to set up the group and I had \u20ac50 left. We have raised money from benefit concerts, and supporters. No one has been paid but we can call on web designers, legal firms and fishery experts,\" said Van der Werf, who originally trained as a violin-maker.</p> <p>\"We realised that you don't need to be a huge Greenpeace or Sea Shepherd with millions of pounds and big staff behind you to act; you can start small, be flexible. We want to move away from the 'hero' complex and encourage ordinary people to act for the oceans,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd inspired us, but what is not needed now is an organisation similar to them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/jul/13/activists-tuna\" title=\"\">We need more of a social movement of people who work on marine protection</a>. Conservation groups talk the language of politicians and MPs. There is an increasing gap between them and the public. I have trouble understanding their reports. We want to inspire other local initiatives.\"</p> <p>The Black Fish has positioned itself firmly at the \"no compromise\" end of the green spectrum. \"We don't see ourselves as witnesses, more as enforcers of law. We want evidence of illegality and we are prepared to take direct action. We don't want to just build awareness, but achieve change. We want to be judged by our actions and be effective,\" said Van der Werf.</p> <p>\"We have growing support from the public. We have customs officers, tube drivers, all kinds of people.\"</p> <p>He claims the tacit support of most European conservation groups, but the group is certain to cross swords with those who advocate reform of fishing practices rather than an absolute reduction in the catch. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/oct/14/ofm-awards-2011-fearnley-whittingstall\" title=\"\">The high-profile campaign by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall </a>and Jamie Oliver to ban \"discards\" \u2013 young fish that are not allowed to be sold in EU markets and are thrown away \u2013 is not good enough, he says. \"In effect they are saying it's a waste of fish; let's eat the by-catch,\" said Van der Werf.</p> <p>\"Sustainable fishing\", promoted by supermarkets and some conservation groups, is totally unsustainable, he says. \"It's a feelgood option. Sustainable fishing has not worked in terms of over-fishing. It just legitimises destructive fishing.\"</p> <p>The group has challenged the establishment to change. \"Governments and some mainstream conservation groups argue that 'aquaculture', where fish are bred and reared in captivity, is the way forward, with the industry just needing to 'clean up'. But can such an industry clean up? Governments have failed by letting this lucrative industry spiral out of control,\" says the group on its website.</p> <p>Van de Werf adds: \"The fact is 85% of all stocks are overfished. Oceans are rife with corruption. Unless something is done, there will be no fish left.\"</p>",

The US, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago opposed the resolution, but 23 members voted in favour of the meeting. There were five abstentions and three members were absent.</p> <p>The OAS secretary general, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, said the meeting would not be about Assange but the \"the problem posed by the threat or warning made to Ecuador by the possibility of an intervention into its embassy in London. The issue that concerns us is the inviolability of diplomatic missions of all members of this organisation, something that is of interest to all of us.\"</p> <p>Assange has been in the Ecuadorean embassy for the past two months after facing extradition to Sweden accused of sexual assault.
