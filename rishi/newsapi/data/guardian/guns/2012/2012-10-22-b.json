I have heard a lot of cynicism about whether or not they make a difference \u2013 or worse, that celebs are just attention-starved and will do anything to be recognized.</p> <p>When I hear the apathy, and worse the snark, it always makes me feel a little sick inside. Maybe because I am one of those people who has spent the last 20 years of my life using comedy to shine a light on creeps with power.</p> <p>So, as we come to the end of this election cycle, I thought it might be helpful to tell you what I have experienced when creative friends get together and make some noise. Change happens. It's not bullshit. It's not self-serving. It is awesome. </p> <p>It was a natural progression for me to go balls-out into politics as, over the years, my career has developed into more or less \"call-and-response\" comedy. If it happens, I am reacting either on stage, in videos or on radio and TV.</p> <p>So, when 2011 rolled around and the relentless attacks started on reproductive rights in congress and statehouses across America \u2013 oh, like 1,000 bills proposed to curb access to services from Pap smears to abortion \u2013 I decided to devote my creative energies touring the country doing comedy shows to benefit Planned Parenthood. I knew humor got people to sit up and take notice. I have built a career using comedy to expose hypocrisy.</p> <p>But now the rhetoric was escalating at warp speed. It seemed like each week, in every new town, some implausible piece of vaginal invasion legislation was happening. So touring for Planned Parenthood seemed like a no-brainer. The shows were packed and I was helping raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Planned Parenthood, all across America. </p> <p>Then, just when I thought the idiocy couldn't get any thicker \u2013 BAM! A panel of men were called before Congress to discuss whether religious institutions that employ secular people should be required to cover birth control in their healthcare plans.</p> <p>Sandra Fluke, a young law student at Georgetown University, one such Catholic institution, who was an advocate for having birth control included in these plans, was not allowed to speak before the panel. So, she took to the airwaves to address the issue. Her appearances on news programs caused a rabid anti-woman backlash, and she was labeled \"a slut\" and worse by the likes of radio talkshow muculent, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-1753947.html\">Viagrasaurus Rush</a>. </p> <p>In the heat of all of this, I got a Facebook message from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Plimpton\">actor and activist Martha Plimpton</a>, asking if I wanted to join forces and do something about all this \"slut\"-shaming.</p> <p>The idea was simple: create an advocacy group called <a href=\"http://www.aisfor.org/\">\"A is For\"</a> that has a few goals: first, to launch an amazing website with the most up-to-the-minute reproductive rights news, which could serve as hub for women and men to share their stories about why protecting reproductive rights is so important; and second, to raise money for the groups like pro-choice organization <a href=\"http://www.naral.org/\">Naral</a> and the Center for Reproductive Rights, which are fighting the big battles. Our logo would be a scarlet letter \"A\", reclaiming the symbolism of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter\">The Scarlet Letter</a> and our hope was that women and men would wear the \"A\" proudly, announcing to the world: \" I am a sexual being, I support all aspects of reproductive health and I will not be shamed into silence about it.\"</p> <p>Last March, then, I ventured to LA and met with a group of amazing women Martha had assembled, and so we started making videos, making scarlet A's, and defining what our mission would be. And seven months later, we have women and men walking around all over the country wearing that scarlet A, proudly declaring their support for women's reproductive rights.</p> <p>But I also wanted to expand my reach and make some videos that address issues using the language I speak, that candidly combine truth and humor, and hit hard just what is at stake in this election. I was inspired by my pal <a href=\"http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/\">Sarah Silverman</a>, who, during the 2008 presidential election, made a huge difference in Florida with her video <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgHHX9R4Qtk\">\"The Great Schlep\"</a>, creating an amazing call to action, simply being her. No censorship, no worries about who it would offend, just Sarah: knowing and trusting that her hilarious voice and message would generate action. It did. </p> <p>And then, in 2012, she <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B5o6-qNk6Q\">scissored her dog</a> in the name of introducing to a whole lot of people who may otherwise have never learned about him a major GOP money-machine named <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019476367_apusbiggestdonorsrepublicans.html\">Sheldon Adelson</a>. And no one but Sarah would think of calling for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypRW5qoraTw\">arming the elderly in the name of exposing voter suppression laws</a>. People sat up and took notice. They laughed. Then they Googled. Then they got angry. Then they got active.</p> <p>I wanted to do that with my repro rights videos. I raised some money on <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/reprorightspsa\">Indiegogo</a>, teamed up with the amazing creative team at <a href=\"http://revolutionmessaging.com/\">Revolution Messaging</a>, made six videos and launched <a href=\"http://www.ladypartsjustice.com/\">Lady Parts Justice</a>. </p> <p>Our first video, called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbdTMK66tq4\">\"It's the Law\"</a>, is an uncomfortable, hilarious and real video about a law in some states that forces a woman to pay extra for a medically unnecessary vaginal probe that takes pictures of her womb before she can terminate a pregnancy. That video had 635,000 views in 72 hours. My inbox was flooded with questions asking whether the law was real, or saying that they were shocked to find out that laws like this exist; they asked us if we can please make more videos that expose other pieces of legislation which these creepy politicians are trying to pass.</p> <p>Some told me they hadn't realized how bad it had gotten and thanked me for the reminder. That was exciting. But when people asked where they could get more information on other awful laws proposed or passed, it felt pretty cool to say, \"Go to 'A is For'\", knowing all the detail was there.</p> <p>But now the assaults on sanity have started to feel like relentless cluster bomb attacks: seems like half of my day is spent slack-jawed staring at the news, gobsmacked as unqualified kook after unqualified kook keeps getting elected spouting things like <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/18/joe-walsh-abortion-exception_n_1983701.html\">women no longer die during childbirth</a>, or that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\">the chunks of toxic bilge that spew from antiquated factories have nothing to do with our melting earth</a>, or maybe the weirdest of all, that more than a few folks, some of whom sit on the US supreme court, believe a <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/press-releases/fact-sheet-mitt-romney-supports-dangerous-personhood-amendments-1155.htm\">bunch of cells in a woman's body</a> <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/\">Walmart</a> are people. </p> <p>But when I talked to people about what affected them the most, it was not about a specific issue, rather the epidemic of how a lie gets repeated over and over again \u2013 and how the media seemed pretty lax at calling out the bull, and thus these lies were starting to become truths. Someone needed to correct the record. And who better to do that than comedians?</p> <p>So, in one phone call with comedian and fellow troublemaker <a href=\"http://thisweekinblackness.com/\">Elon James White</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.filmaid.org/joy\">FilmAid</a> executive director and make-it-happenist Liz Manne, we came up with the concept of \"Actually\". Our plan was make series of videos using clips of some of the most egregious political lies, and then we turn to our most trusted information sources \u2013 comedians \u2013 to correct the record. Each rebuttal starts with the word <a href=\"http://actually.org/#actually\">\"Actually\"</a>: the word that so many of us say right before opening a can of whoop-ass.</p> <p>We wanted to do it right, so to produce them, we called the folks at <a href=\"http://www.thegreatschlep.com/schlep-labs\">Schlep Labs</a> who had made all the wonderful videos Sarah Silverman had done. We pitched the idea to <a href=\"http://www.americanbridgepac.org/\">American Bridge</a> to see if they wanted to finance the project. They were in, and in less than a month, and for way less than the millions poured into rightwing political ads that push lie after lie, we had Rosie Perez, <a href=\"http://www.wkamaubell.com/\">W Kumau Bell</a>, Elon James White and <a href=\"http://www.illdoctrine.com/\">Jay Smooth</a> all doing amazing videos setting the record straight.</p> <p>The best part for me was that Sarah and I, who usually spend our limited time together laying in a hotel bed with a few dogs and some junk food, watching a Law and Order marathon, teamed up and took on that hideous notion that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYfJWybKCy0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\"Corporations Are People.\"</a> Voila, <a href=\"http://actually.org/\">Actually.org</a> was born: a fact-checking website with added fun. Could there be a better public service?</p> <p>Now you have some answers about whether or not these celebrity ads work. They do wake people up, and using humor backed up with facts is an amazing one-two punch for re-energizing some folks who have been feeling deflated about politics. And there is one other thing you should know: many of the celebs you see in these ads face opposition from managers or agents who tell us not to step up because it may offend some conservative network executive, or alienate the viewers of certain cable channels. They warn we will be branded as partisan. </p> <p>Hell, I've already been branded as a whore and worse because I dare speak out about the radical notion that because women are sexual beings they should have all the access they need to affordable healthcare. I'll take \"partisan\".</p> <p>I tell you this because when you see ads where someone famous sticks their neck out for a cause, they are taking a risk that they may lose fans and work.</p> <p><em>Actually</em>, they do it because they believe in something greater than themselves. So, when you feel like shitting all over a celebrity for speaking out and taking a stand, remember they don't have to; they are chosing to do something for the greater good, and are willing to take a hit for it.</p> <p>All I ask is that if your first response to seeing a celeb talking about an issue is \"What an asshole\", think about what they are saying. Then, think again.</p>",
  "<p>Health experts are warning that pro-smoking smartphone apps could tempt young people to start using cigarettes after new research found that dozens of them have been downloaded millions of times.</p> <p>Researchers who uncovered the existence of such apps, some of which use cartoons, fear it is a new way for tobacco companies to exploit loopholes in restrictions on their marketing activities in order to promote their products.</p> <p>Australian researchers, writing in the medical journal Tobacco Control, say they came across 107 apps that promoted smoking in some way when they checked the Apple and Android Market app stores in February. Sixty-five were in the Apple App Store and the other 42 in Android Market's equivalent. By that month a total of about 11 million people used the 42 apps held by Android Market.</p> <p>Their paper \"identifies a new trend of promoting tobacco products in a new medium with global reach, a huge consumer base of various age groups and less strict regulation policies\", they write. The apps included images of particular brands, told users where they could buy tobacco products, provided cigarette brands' packaging to use as wallpaper on their smartphone and let users simulate smoking behaviour.</p> <p>Others replace a phone's battery icon to an image of a burning cigarette, detail how to roll a cigarette or defend smokers' rights.</p> <p>The Department of Health condemned the apps as \"disgraceful\" but said that British law may not be able to do much to combat them, as many may be produced overseas.</p> <p>The researchers, led by Nasser Bin Dihm of Sydney Medical School's school of public health, said the apps appear to be breaching the World Health Organisation's landmark framework convention on tobacco control. And they voiced concerns that apps are being misportrayed by Apple and Android Market by being available in categories labelled \"health and fitness\", \"entertainment\", \"games\" and \"lifestyle\".</p> <p>\"These apps could also easily attract teens and children due to their high-quality graphics and availability under the 'game' and 'entertainment' categories in the app stores. Pro-smoking apps that show smoking is 'cool' in a cartoon game and provide a chance to explore the available cigarette brands and even simulate the smoking experience with high quality, free apps could potentially increase teens' risk of smoking initiation\", they say.</p> <p>Professor John Britton, chair of the Royal College of Physicians' tobacco advisory group and an NHS consultant, said introducing plain packaging of cigarettes, as many medical groups argue, would lessen the apps' appeal to young people as distinctive branding would be much less familiar.</p> <p>Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said Britain should follow the example of the United States and Canada and force tobacco firms to reveal what sort of promotional activities they are undertaking and how much they are spending on each. \"The measure we have in this country to control tobacco promotion apply to 20th century techniques, not 21st century ones such as the internet and smartphones. Apps are exactly the sort of thing that will attract young people to sample tobacco products because they glamorise them,\" Arnott added.</p>",

This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Had he been president, Romney would have blared his support for Iran's Green Revolutionaries in the summer of 2009.

President Obama shut down Bush's CIA \"black sites\" and prohibited the torture tactics Dick Cheney argues for to this day.</p> <p>Romney appears to favor the use of torture in some cases. His team of advisers includes figures from the Bush administration who were among the most aggressive advocates of torture.</p> <p>\"A Romney administration would risk a return to the immoral, illegal, and counterproductive policies of President George W.

But it is consistent with his public statements, in which he has criticized President Obama for ending the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d and has maintained, against precedent and common sense, that waterboarding is not torture.</p> <p>The Romney torture memo is unsigned, but was written by members of a committee of Romney national security advisers that included Steven Bradbury, Cully Stimson, David Rivkin, and Lee Casey. These may not be household names, but they should cause alarm among those who care about the United States\u2019 commitment to the rule of law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read Cole on Bradbury's work for Bush <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508585ab58f96784ee2908d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:43:07.664Z\">6.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Giant glaring metaphor alert:</strong> A blimp-like aircraft with a huge Romney ad on the side got into trouble in high winds in South Florida last night and crash-landed.</p> <p>\"After all it isn't every day you see something this large looming below the treeline,\" the reporter says, helpfully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWo7G22zcEw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWo7G22zcEw?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50857ef358f96784ee2908d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:14:27.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's one for the <strong>conspiracy theorists</strong>: the CBS affiliate in Arizona broadcast a graphic Friday afternoon showing that Barack Obama had been reelected president of the United States.</p> <p>The twist: the election hasn't happened yet.</p> <p>The explanation: the station was just practicing.</p> <p>The suspicious detail: why not practice with a graphic showing that Mitt Romney won?</p> <p>If you have the stomach for this sort of thing you can visit <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11103719&amp;l=d0a2d0b7dd&amp;id=24718773587\">Sarah Palin's Facebook</a> page to sample the outrage, such as this witticism from commenter Jorge Lopez Jr: \"Goes right along with their name, 'see BS.'\"</p> <p>Michele Wallace of KPHO told <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/21/cbs-news-affiliate-calls-2012-presidential-race-for-barack-obama-weeks-ahead-of-election/#ixzz2A33rRQGU\">The Daily Caller</a> it was a mistake with a test graphic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Friday October 19th during a test of KPHO- CBS 5\u2019s election returns software we inadvertently aired a test graphic for about 15 seconds in an episode of Peoples Court.

  "<p>When a prime minister decides it is time to make a speech about crime, it is generally also time to look at the state of the polls. David Cameron made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-speech-crime-live?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">such a speech</a> on Monday and, sure enough, the polls show his party is in trouble. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/tories-poll-voters-trust-economy\" title=\"\">The latest Guardian/ICM survey</a> has the Conservatives stuck eight points behind Labour, 33% against Labour's 41%. The prime minister's crime speech also follows one of the most demoralising weeks for the Tories since the \"omnishambles Budget\" in March \u2013 a week that included the Andrew Mitchell resignation, the George Osborne train ticket hoo-ha and Mr Cameron's fumbled announcement on energy prices, all against the background of continuing economic stagnation.</p> <p>Self-evidently, therefore, this was a moment that called for Mr Cameron to regain the initiative by making a tough law-and-order speech. As an admirer of Tony Blair, the PM will know his predecessor-but-one's aphorism that a leader never loses votes by being tough on crime. Many of the responses to Mr Cameron's speech saw his announcements entirely in such a frame, including the <a href=\"http://www.poauk.org.uk/index.php?press-releases&amp;newsdetail=20121022-2_camerons-sound-bites\" title=\"\">Prison Officers Association</a>, who accused the government of playing the law and order card because it is in trouble, and <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/tory-led-govts-justice-policy-is-in-tatters\" title=\"\">Labour's Sadiq Khan MP</a>, who dismissed it as a smokescreen.</p> <p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/crime-and-justice-speech/\" title=\"\">Mr Cameron's speech</a> is more interesting than that suggests. This is not to deny that a prime ministerial speech on crime at such a moment is one way of trying to regain lost grip. It is only fair to note, though, that Mr Cameron can hardly be accused of changing the agenda to crime when <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/\" title=\"\">elections for police and crime commissioners</a> are scheduled through most of England and Wales in just over three weeks. These elections are controversial. A low turnout on 15 November will be another headache for the Tories, who have promoted the introduction of PCCs in the face of almost universal scepticism, most recently <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221149/Chris-Grayling-condemns-silly-Sir-Ian-Blair-telling-voters-boycott-police-chief-elections.html\" title=\"\">from Lord (Ian) Blair, London's former police chief</a>. It would be odd if Mr Cameron did not try to focus attention on crime at such a moment.</p> <p>The striking thing about Mr Cameron's speech, however, was that it was not, overall, an old-fashioned get-tough law-and-order speech. Past leaders would have called for more spending on police, tougher sentencing and more draconian prison regimes. But Mr Cameron governs in tougher financial times. His pitch was therefore an interesting mix. It was summed up in the claim that his government was committed to a \"tough but intelligent\" approach through each stage of the criminal justice system. This neat piece of triangulation enabled him to celebrate, rightly, the fact that crime has fallen by 6% at the same time as central spending on police is down by 20%. It enabled him to promote an extension of life sentences at the same time as sounding more focused about the need, financially driven though it is, to boost rehabilitative options for many offenders. It was genuinely cheering to hear Mr Cameron say \"we have tried just banging people up and it's failed\".</p> <p>In fact Mr Cameron's speech contained few new specifics. It was fairly good on strategy and rhetoric. But it was full of vagueness \u2013 the welcome denunciation of arbitrary targets sitting awkwardly with the introduction of equally arbitrary sentencing. It was silent on many of the financial and resource means without which the approach cannot succeed. Great weight is to be placed on outsourcing and payment-by-results in the private and voluntary sectors to achieve these rehabilitative goals but, as PFI showed, such systems are riddled with risk, are often inadequately drafted and tested, and can land the taxpayer with heavy costs if they go wrong.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-initiative-trouble\" title=\"\">problem with Mr Cameron's speech</a> was not the intentions, which were often good, but the realities, which fall significantly short of what would be needed for rehabilitation to become the truly effective alternative it must be. Shifting a party's opinion poll numbers is a hard task. But shifting the numbers in a criminal justice system that relies so much on long prison sentences is even harder.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Labour enjoys an eight-point lead in Tuesday's Guardian/ICM poll and has only a four-point deficit on the economy, compared with a 21-point gap not long ago, will do little to calm the growing nerves on the Tory backbenches that something structural, as well as political, is leading David Cameron to misfire so frequently.</p> <p>The prime minister called for calm, urging his backbench MPs not to get distracted by media ephemera.</p> <p>\"We need to focus on the big picture,\" Cameron said. \"What actually happened last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about [refusing to extradite] Gary McKinnon. Those are the important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a million private sector jobs in the last two years. There will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually matters is what is happening out there.\"</p> <p>By Thursday, he could have added, the economy will come out of recession.</p> <p>But the worrying aspect for Tory MPs is \"what is happening out there\" is being obscured by what is happening in No 10. The lack of grip was underlined by a rare interview with Cameron's deputy chief of staff, Oliver Dowden. \"Most of my time is spent on day-to-day crisis management,\" he cheerfully conceded.</p> <p>Dowden added that \"we are not permanently in crisis\" before admitting he only discovered the daily political agenda by listening to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"Often you'll get surprised by what's going on \u2026\"</p> <p>Asked when he was last surprised, he replied: \"I'm surprised on a day-to-day basis. There is no accounting for the conduct of individuals.\"</p> <p>More broadly, this may reveal a greater truth about the permanent structure of No 10. One gently described the structure as \"very flat\", code for meaning that a lot of people can go to the same meeting. Another said: \"It is an interesting question who people report to and who they answer to.\"</p> <p>This thesis suggests there is a three-dimensional structural problem \u2013 within the Conservative party itself, between coalition parties, and between the political class and the civil service \u2013 that leads to so many mistakes.</p> <p>Andrew Cooper, the modernising director of strategy at No 10, annoys the right because he openly challenges their thesis that the Conservatives could have won the 2010 election outright but for modernisation.</p> <p>Writing recently in a memoriam for the Labour pollster Philip Gould, Cooper ridiculed rightwing revisionism for saying \"a Conservative majority was there for the taking if only the leadership had pressed harder with robust Tory messages on tax and Europe, and above all immigration; if, in other words, it had refought the 2005 campaign or its 2001 campaign.\"</p> <p>It is the chorus of a cadre of culturally estranged Tory activists committing what Michael Portillo has described as 'the worst error you can make in politics': to presume that the electorate thinks the same as you\".</p> <p>So when senior Tories attack No 10's grip, they are often attacking its politics, or the way in which its politics remain unresolved in the personality of Cameron.</p> <p>Some of that grip is weakened by tensions between the coalition partners. It is hard to prove this, but the sense is that apart from a very small group at the top of the coalition, political, as opposed to personal, relations between the two parties are deteriorating. The tensions created around the absence of growth is pulling the two parties apart.</p> <p>Cameron was left to look foolish over energy prices for 24 hours because the Department of Energy, a Lib Dem fiefdom, refused to come out and help him. Bigger disputes await over Europe, welfare and civil liberties that will make coherence harder to project.</p> <p>The interface between the civil service and the political wing of the coalition is mixed. Steve Hilton, No 10 strategy adviser, left partly because he could not stand civil service delay any longer. In what an observer described as simultaneously \"the best and worst meeting I have ever attended\", Hilton lost it with education department officials when he realised they had made insufficient progress on a zero-based budget review.</p> <p>At points, relations between Tory politicians and the civil service plunged so low that Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service, has suggested a Royal Commission to review its role. The idea has been rejected.</p> <p>Cameron has nearly two years to turn all this round, aeons in politics, but the worry is whether he is ready to accept there is a problem to resolve.</p> <p>There are some short-term some personnel issues, too. The communications department is in transition, with the prime minister's steady spokesman, Steve Field, about to take a new job at the IMF. Cameron's press secretary, Gabby Bertin, will leave soon for maternity leave and, as luck would have it, the No 10 communications director, Craig Oliver, has been in America studying the US television presidential debates during much of the furore over the chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, who was forced to resign on Friday after a month-long controversy over what he said to a police officer at the gates of Downing Street.</p> <p>That in turn may have led to small confidence-sapping errors, such as the conflicting advice issued on Friday on whether a replacement for Mitchell, was to be announced that night (it was).</p> <p>The dank and grey mood around No 10 and the government will hardly be lifted by another poll commissioned by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft suggesting Labour has stretched its lead in the Corby and East Northamptonshire byelection to 22 points.</p> <p>His numbers show a 13% swing since the 2010 election, and a doubling of the Labour lead since Ashcroft last polled the constituency in August in the immediate wake of the resignation of Louise Mensch.</p> <p>Labour has every confidence that it will hold all four of the other byelections caused by the death of MPs or resignations to stand as police commissioners. Those police commissioner elections due on November are likely to have such low turnouts that the main winner will be apathy, rather than the Conservatives, the pre-eminent party of law and order.</p> <p>Both the Corby poll and the Guardian/ICM poll indicate a substantial Labour majority at the next election.</p>",
  "<p>Progress on human rights in Tunisia following last year's Arab spring revolution is being reversed by the current government, Amnesty International has warned, as the country marks the first anniversary of free and fair democratic elections.</p> <p>Reforms that followed the overthrow of President Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011 \u2013 including the release of political prisoners, new laws on press freedom and associations \u2014 have not been maintained, it says. Last October's elections were widely praised as representing a model transition to democracy.</p> <p>But in the latest in a series of critiques by international human rights watchdogs, Amnesty says that recent months have seen new restrictions on freedom of expression targetting journalists, artists, critics of the government, writers and bloggers.</p> <p>\"Protesters, who have continued to take to the streets in different parts of Tunisia to express their dissatisfaction with the slow pace of reform, have been met with unnecessary and excessive force,\" Amnesty said, adding that that it has received reports of torture and other ill-treatment, \"many of them from protesters who alleged they were beaten during demonstrations, during arrest or in detention centres\".</p> <p>A state of emergency in place since the uprising has been repeatedly renewed, most recently until the end of this month. The Tunisian authorities have also appeared \"unable or unwilling\" to protect individuals from attacks by those believed to be affiliated with Salafist groups.</p> <p>Last week, Human Rights Watch said it had documented a series of attacks by radical religious groups against political activists, which the authorities had failed to investigate. HRW also expressed concern that a draft law prohibiting Ben Ali-era government officials from seeking office was too restrictive and would not advance \"inclusive democracy\".</p> <p>Tunisian journalists also went on strike, accusing the government of seeking to impose new controls. Investigators from the UN and African Union also recently noted human rights violations, including attacks against journalists, artists and activists, torture, threats by conservative Islamic groups and the excessive use of force against demonstrators by police.</p> <p>Tunisia was the first and most peaceful of the uprisings of the Arab spring, sending shockwaves across the Middle East and north Africa when Ben Ali, who had ruled the country since 1987, was forced from power and fled into exile in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>It was also the first Arab country to see the rise to power of an Islamist party, En-Nahda, which was banned before the revolution. It now rules in coalition with the Congress for the Republic party of President Moncef Marzouki.</p> <p>Beji Caid Essebsi, Tunisia's first prime minister after the revolution, has called the death of one of his party's senior officials during violence last week a \"political assassination\" and referred to the \"lynching\" of Lotfi Naguedh.</p>",

  "<p>The UK is to double the number of armed RAF \"drones\" flying combat and surveillance operations in Afghanistan and, for the first time, the aircraft will be controlled from terminals and screens in Britain.</p> <p>In the new squadron of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), five Reaper drones will be sent to Afghanistan, the Guardian can reveal. It is expected they will begin operations within six weeks.</p> <p>Pilots based at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire will fly the recently bought American-made UAVs at a hi-tech hub built on the site in the past 18 months.</p> <p>The UK's existing five Reaper drones, which are used to target suspected insurgents in Helmand, have been operated from Creech air force base in Nevada because Britain has not had the capability to fly them from here.</p> <p>After \"standing up\" the new XIII squadron in a ceremony this Friday, the UK will soon have 10 Reapers in Afghanistan. The government has yet to decide whether the aircraft will remain there after 2014, when all Nato combat operations are due to end.</p> <p>\"The new squadron will have three control terminals at RAF Waddington, and the five aircraft will be based in Afghanistan,\" a spokesman confirmed. \"We will continue to operate the other Reapers from Creech though, in time, we will wind down operations there and bring people back to the UK.\"</p> <p>The use of drones has become one of the most controversial features of military strategy in Afghanistan. The UK has been flying them almost non-stop since 2008.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/drone-attacks-pakistan-counterproductive-report\" title=\"\">CIA's programme of \"targeted\" drone killings in Pakistan's tribal area was last month condemned</a> in a report by US academics. The attacks are politically counterproductive, kill large numbers of civilians and undermine respect for international law, according to <a href=\"http://livingunderdrones.org/\" title=\"\">the study by Stanford and New York universities' law schools</a>.</p> <p>The most recent figures from the Ministry of Defence show that, by the end of September, the UK's five Reapers in Afghanistan had flown 39,628 hours and fired 334 laser-guided Hellfire missiles and bombs at suspected insurgents.</p> <p>While British troops on the ground have started to take a more back-seat role, the use of UAVs has increased over the past two years despite fears from human rights campaigners that civilians might have been killed or injured in some attacks.</p> <p>The RAF bought the drones as an urgent operational requirement (UOR) specifically for Afghanistan, and the MoD confirmed that their purpose after 2014 was unclear. Under rules imposed by the EU and the Civil Aviation Authority, UAVs can be flown only in certain places in the UK, including around the Aberporth airfield in mid-Wales.</p> <p>If the air-exclusion zone restrictions are not lifted by the end of 2014, the UK may have to relocate the drones to the US, or perhaps even to Kenya, sources said.</p> <p>\"No decisions have been made about the longer-term future of Reaper as a core capability, nor have any decisions been made on the basing of Reaper aircraft once the UOR is complete,\" said a spokesman. \"The UK has a need for a persistent intelligence-gathering capability. Our investment and experiences with Reaper will be considered in developing the programme ... at this stage, the MoD is still developing this strategy.\"</p> <p>The MoD said the relocation of RAF personnel from 39 Squadron at Creech air force base would begin in the new year, and that RAF Waddington would eventually be home to two squadrons of drones.</p> <p>\"The intention is to phase the relocation of 39 Squadron to ensure there is no disruption to Reaper support to current operations,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>In the first three-and-a-half years of using the Reapers in Afghanistan, the aircraft flew 23,400 hours and fired 176 missiles. But those figures have almost doubled in the past 15 months as Nato seeks to weaken the Taliban ahead of withdrawal.</p> <p>The MoD insists only four Afghan civilians have been killed in its strikes since 2008 and says it does everything it can to minimise civilian casualties, including aborting missions at the last moment.</p> <p>However, it also says it has no idea how many insurgents have died because of the \"immense difficulty and risks\" of verifying who has been hit.</p> <p>The MoD says it relies on Afghans making official complaints at military bases if their friends or relatives have been wrongly killed \u2013 a system campaigners say is flawed and unreliable.</p> <p>Heather Barr, a lawyer for Human Rights Watch, has said: \"There are many disincentives for people to make reports.</p> <p>\"Some of these areas are incredibly isolated, and people may have to walk for days to find someone to report a complaint. For some, there will be a certain sense of futility in doing so anyway. There is no uniform system for making a complaint and no uniform system for giving compensation. This may not encourage them to walk several days to speak to someone who may not do anything about it.\"</p> <p>In December 2010, David Cameron claimed that 124 insurgents had been killed in UK drone strikes. But defence officials said they had no idea where the prime minister got the figure and denied it was from the MoD.</p> <p>A high court hearing on Tuesday may shed light on any support the UK is giving to the CIA's campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan. The case has been brought by Noor Khan, whose father was killed in an attack on a local council meeting in 2011. He is asking the foreign secretary, William Hague, to clarify the government's position on sharing intelligence for use in CIA strikes, and is challenging the lawfulness of such activities.</p> <p>His lawyer, Rosa Curling, said: \"This case is about the legality of the UK government providing 'locational intelligence' to the US for use in drone strikes in Pakistan.</p> <p>An off-the-record GCHQ source stated to a number of media outlets that GCHQ assistance was being provided to the US for use in drone attacks and this assistance was 'in accordance with the law.'</p> <p>\"We have advised our client that this is incorrect. The secretary of state has misunderstood the law on this extremely important issue and a declaration from the court confirming the correct legal position is required as a matter of priority.\"</p>",
  "<p>The number of patients known to have contracted a deadly form of meningitis linked to contaminated steroid shots prepared by a Massachusetts pharmacy edged closer to the 300 mark Monday.</p> <p>Health officials said some 294 cases had now been recorded across 16 states, up 12 on the previous day's figures. To date some 23 deaths have been attributed to the rare fungal meningitis, thought caused by the contamination of vials at the New England Compounding Center.</p> <p>The firm is believed to have sent out more than 14,000 individual doses of the suspect steroid injection to clinics across the US. All of the recorded cases of fungal meningitis have resulted from patients being administered steroid shots to the spine to help with back pain.</p> <p>A further three peripheral joint infections \u2013 relating to injections to areas such as the knee, hip and shoulder \u2013 have also been recorded as part of the current outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its daily update Monday.</p> <p>Nine of the new meningitis cases relate to patients at clinics in Michigan, one of the hardest hit states. Michigan has now recorded 62 infections, five of which have resulted in death.</p> <p>Tennessee is still the worst affected, with 69 identified cases and nine fatalities.</p> <p>Health regulators have formally matched the fungal meningitis to a contaminate found at the premises of the NECC in the Boston suburb of Framingham.</p> <p>Last week, federal agents from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raided the pharmacy compounder as part of a widening investigation.</p> <p>One of the areas being probed is whether the company violated regulations by supplying bulk orders to clinics without matching the drugs to specific prescriptions or patients.</p> <p>The pharmacy compounder has a checkered history of violating health and safety standards, having been cited on numerous occasions by the FDA prior to the latest outbreak.</p> <p>As well as the prospect of potential criminal action, the company is already the subject of numerous civil lawsuits by those affected by the meningitis outbreak.</p> <p>After being identified as the likely source of the infection, the NECC recalled all of its products amid fears that other drugs were contaminated.</p> <p>A sister company of the pharmacy, drug manufacturer Ameridose, has likewise suspended operations, and will remain shut until November 5 at the earliest for inspections.</p> <p>The move has led to warnings that hospitals may experience a shortage of some medications.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the FDA posted a statement on its website stating that the \"current production shutdown of Americdose may impact supplies of certain drugs for some health care systems\".</p>",
  "<p>Amid admissions that cycling was facing its worst crisis \u2013 and even debate over whether it could survive \u2013 the UCI president, Pat McQuaid, in increasingly ragged attempts to draw a line under the blighted Lance Armstrong saga and move on, included one statement that spoke volumes. It was a defensive response to a query about whether the UCI could remain both policeman and promoter of the sport and it cut to the heart of the debate about what a sport's governing body should be and whether it is inherently conflicted when it comes to tackling doping.</p> <p>Asked whether the promotional and regulatory functions of cycling should be formally split, McQuaid said: \"I don't see why we should. We are responsible for the regulation, the development and the promotion of cycling worldwide. That includes anti-doping.\"</p> <p>From amid the alphabet soup of international federations, national governing bodies, national anti-doping organisations and law enforcement agencies, the World Anti-Doping Agency must somehow corral a coherent approach to the issue.</p> <p>While Wada, which has an annual budget of \u00a317.8m from national governments and the Olympic movement, can provide a framework for the rules it is largely down to federations and individual countries to enforce them.</p> <p>David Howman, the Wada director general, has conceded that the set-up is far from ideal. \"The model we've got is the one we've got and it's not going to be changed in a hurry. It's not perfect,\" he said. \"We acknowledge the imperfections and try and work with them.\"</p> <p>Other clashes between governing bodies and Wada down the years \u2013 most recently with Fifa, the world football governing body, and other team sports over its \"whereabouts\" out-of-competition testing programme \u2013 highlight the frustrations.</p> <p>The United States Anti-Doping Agency report made uncomfortable reading for McQuaid. It repeated allegations, strongly denied by the UCI, from Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton that, when Armstrong and Johan Bruyneel visited its headquarters in Aigle in May 2002 to offer $100,000 to help the development of cycling, they were doing so in order to buy its silence. McQuaid admitted accepting donations totalling $125,000 from Armstrong's camp in 2002 and 2007 but strongly denied there were any conditions attached.</p> <p>The UCI president attempted to draw a distinction between Armstrong's imperial phase between 1998 and 2005, before he was president, and afterwards \u2013 claiming there was no evidence to suggest that Armstrong had been doping when he came back to the sport in 2009 and 2010. And yet the Usada report says that there was a \"one in a million\" chance of Armstrong's blood profile occurring naturally. Moreover, it said, expert examination of his blood values \"build a compelling argument consistent with blood doping\".</p> <p>That dual role also makes McQuaid's insistence that there was nothing untoward in accepting a donation from Armstrong in 2002 hard to square while the current regime remain in place. Even taking its strong denials of any impropriety into account, he faced inevitable questions over the wisdom of accepting such large donations from the very athletes it is supposed to be policing.</p> <p>The Irishman said himself that the UCI's relatively impoverished state \u2013 \"we don't have billions in the bank like Fifa\" \u2013 made it reliant on donations such as that from Armstrong. He also said he was not about to stop associating with the sport's biggest names just in case it came back to bite him.</p> <p>Challenged as to whether it should have taken the money when there were already suspicions about drug use, McQuaid fell back on the explanation that Armstrong had never failed a test. Which, given that the organisation had just banned him for life and stripped him of his titles on the basis of a damning report that does not rely on tests for its proof, seemed a little inconsistent.</p> <p>In the fall-out from Ben Johnson's demise \u2013 perhaps the only individual fall from grace comparable in impact to Armstrong's \u2013 it was widely debated whether the sport had, consciously or not, turned a blind eye to the fact that one of its biggest names had exhibited a pattern of behaviour consistent with doping.</p> <p>The methods may be more subtle and harder to detect these days. McQuaid admitted in his press conference that it was only during the London Paralympics that an effective test of Human Growth Hormone had become available, while a test for blood transfusions of an athlete's own blood remains some way off.</p> <p>But McQuaid also pointed out, with some justification, that it was not the UCI or Usada that ultimately did for Armstrong but a federal investigation in the US.Once a gun and a badge were placed on the table, it finally broke the code of omerta.</p> <p>Other major drug conspiracies \u2013 notably the Balco scandal \u2013 have only unravelled once law enforcement agencies have become involved.</p> <p>That is why Wada has been talking for some time about increasing the focus on so-called \"non-analytic\" or evidence-based findings. But for that to happen it will need large resources and unashamed co-operation from the biggest sports governing bodies, not to mention the police and politicians. And, of course, money.</p> <p>\"The global sport industry is presently generating somewhere in the region of $500bn [\u00a3312bn] in annual revenues, against which the annual budget for the fight against doping in sport pales into insignificance,\" said Wada in its last annual report.</p> <p>\"I [the chairman, John Fahey] would suggest that it may be time for this sector to assume more of the responsibility for protecting athletes from doping and defending the integrity of all sports and, by extension, all leagues\" \u2013 the implicit point being that, if international federations are happy to take responsibility, they ought also to invest the necessary time, focus and cash in catching the cheats \u2013 whatever the consequences.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/foreign-policy-debate-romney-obama-live\">third presidential debate tonight focusing on America's foreign policy</a> will probably not have much impact on the race, two weeks before election day \u2013 and with an electorate much more concerned about economic prospects close to home than when exactly did Barack Obama acknowledge that the Benghazi 9/11 attack was an act of terror rather than a spontaneous reaction to the anti-Islam video. Debate moderator Bob Schieffer's decision to devote half the debate to Middle East-related issues (two-thirds if you include also the 15 minutes on Afghanistan/Pakistan) may also seem rather disproportionate, while China, with its major influence on the US economy, is only to be discussed in the final segment. And the eurozone and Mexico, both arguably affecting ordinary Americans lives to at least as great a degree as the Arab uprisings, are not even in the line-up.</p> <p>But one issue to be debated in Boca Raton has the potential to play big in the election \u2013 just not the American one. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/barack-obama-israel-settlements-palestine\">Israeli politicians and strategists will be anxiously watching the third debate segment</a> (entitled Red Lines \u2013 Israel and Iran). But it won't be for any inkling of how Obama in his second term or a new Romney administration would handle Iran's nuclear project \u2013 they know that election rhetoric has little relation to foreign policy once the campaign dust settles. Besides, they are in daily contact with both camps in Washington and know the current thinking. Their concern is much more immediate.</p> <p>This will most likely be the last chance to hear a clear statement from either candidate, not only before Americans go to the polls on 6 November, but also in advance of Israel's general elections exactly two and a half months later. Never has an Israeli election been held so close to an American one, and the results of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/third-presidential-debate-swing-romney-obama\">electoral college</a> are likely to have major implications on the tone and perhaps the outcome of the Israeli campaign. The strategic teams of the major Israeli parties, Likud and its rivals from the center-left, will be on the lookout for any usable quote that demonstrates either closeness or the slightest of differences between either of the candidates and the government in Jerusalem. Depending on the identity of the victor in two weeks, these quotes will be used accordingly in the ensuing campaign.</p> <p>All the polling in Israel currently points to a clear victory for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, with the coalition of rightwing and religious parties upon which he can rely for support winning at least 60% of the vote. The center and leftwing parties are at war among themselves and none of their leaders is seen as a viable challenger to Netanyahu. Each of the parties is trying to attack Netanyahu and Likud on a different front \u2013 social inequities, bellicosity on Iran, religious special interests, the deep-frozen peace process \u2013 but none of these seem for now potent enough to prise enough voters away from the Likud and its partners to break Netanyahu's coalition-lock (a third of Israeli voters describe themselves as centrists). </p> <p>American voters are in the position to give them a crucial lever.</p> <p>In a recent poll carried out by the Maagar Mochot polling company for Bar-Ilan University on Israelis' attitude towards America, 69% said that the United States is Israel's loyal ally, opposed to only 10% who disagreed. An even more overwhelming 93% of Israelis agreed that the close relationship with the US is crucial for Israel's security. This unanimity among the general public is reflected also in closed briefings with senior military and diplomatic officials, who refer to the alliance with the Americans as \"Israel's No 1 strategic asset\", bar none.</p> <p>But there is a slight cloud on this horizon. While 30% of Israelis believe that a President Romney would improve the two countries' relations, should he win next month, only 8% expect Obama to improve ties if awarded a second term. That doesn't mean Israelis dislike the president: 38% said in the poll that they have a positive attitude towards Obama; a similar proportion said they were neutral; and only 23% described their feelings towards him as negative. Just 15% feel he has been unfriendly to Israel during his first term. </p> <p>The great majority of Israelis do not seem to think that Obama has something against them, quite the opposite. This is despite the bombardment of anti-Obama propaganda they have been under for the last five years, ever since the foundation of free newspaper Yisrael Ha'Yom (Israel Today), a well-financed daily that has become the country's most widely-read paper. The slavishly pro-Netanyahu paper, founded and bankrolled by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, has been telling readers, basically from its first edition, that Israel cannot rely on the pro-Palestinian Democratic party. This is despite the current administration deepening security coordination and intelligence-sharing with Israel and financing Israel's new missile-defense system, the Iron Dome.</p> <p>Adelson is estimated to have spent around $100m on his Israeli paper (political donations in Israel are capped by law, but a private newspaper is a convenient loophole). That is similar to the sum he has pledged the Republicans in their attempt to beat Obama. But it isn't just the mega-donor who connects Netanyahu to his GOP allies. Israel's prime minister, since the time he spent as a diplomat in the 1980s in the US, has been a trusted member of conservative circles.</p> <p>He shares much of their worldview and fiscal principles, is beloved of Christian evangelicals and in his first term in office (1996-1999) incessantly quarreled with Bill Clinton. The last four years have been spent openly differing with the Obama administration, first on freezing settlement-building, and when Obama eased on that, shifting focus from the Palestinian issue to Iran. Netanyahu did not miss a single opportunity to belittle Obama's attempts to dissuade Tehran from pursuing a nuclear weapon through diplomacy and sanctions.</p> <p>While Mitt Romney's reception in London this summer was hardly enthusiastic, on his next stop in Israel, he was accorded a head of state's welcome. And that included an intimate dinner with Prime Minister Netanyahu, each accompanied by his wife.</p> <p>To date, Netanyahu's forceful policy on Iran has not harmed his popularity with Israeli voters. At the same time, successive polls indicate that the majority of Israelis do not support a military strike against the administration's wishes. While the differences between Jerusalem and Washington have been widely reported, Israelis do not fear for now that the relationship is in any way at risk. An open rift could be a potential game-changer. </p> <p>It won't happen, of course, if Romney wins in two weeks: a Republican win could seal also Netanyahu's claim to electoral victory. Netanyahu would be free to bask in the shared glory after betting on the challenger when no one gave him a fighting chance.</p> <p>A re-elected Obama, freed from campaign restraint, is another matter. He wouldn't have to change his policy even, just adopt a more censorious tone towards Netanyahu for a few weeks. </p> <p>The prospect of re-electing a prime minister who is putting Israel's crucial strategic alliance at risk will make many Israelis think twice. Netanyahu, who is acutely aware of this possibility, has brought the elections forward to the earliest possible date, in the hope that two and a half months would not be enough time for Obama, facing the fiscal cliff, to launch new diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, the Israeli electorate has swung back and forth between right-, left- and centrist-led coalitions six times. At present, the opposition seems too fractured and leaderless to win over the centrist voters and unseat Netanyahu in this election. But the prospect of diplomatic isolation could lend them a rallying call \u2013 and perhaps, the only slim chance they are going to get.</p>",
  "<p>It's the crucial final debate of the 2012 presidential campaign, and one man may have every right to be anxious about how his performance goes down on Monday night. Not the candidates, but Bob Schieffer, the moderator.</p> <p>A common theme of the three debates so far has been the criticism moderators have faced for their performance \u2013 being variously accused of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/05/jim-lehrer-on-debate-mode_n_1941335.html\">not interrupting enough</a>, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/10/17/Crowley-interrupts-28-times-Romney\">interrupting too much</a>, and having invited <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">the wrong people to their wedding</a>.</p> <p>When Schieffer becomes the latest high-profile journalist to enter the lion's den on Monday night, he will open himself up to similar vitriol from Republicans and Democrats scrutinizing every second of the debate for signs of bias.</p> <p>The good news is, Schieffer has been here before. The veteran host of CBS's Face the Nation has been in journalism for half a century, and moderated presidential debates in 2004 and 2008. But even he might be surprised by some of the venom directed at contemporaries Jim Lehrer and Candy Crowley.</p> <p>Crowley, the chief political correspondent at CNN, was variously accused of having <a href=\"http://www.theblaze.com/stories/act-of-jouranlistic-terror-limbaugh-rips-candy-crowleys-moderator-performance/\">\"committed an act of journalistic terror\"</a> (Rush Limbaugh) to having committed an act similar to <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/video/2012/10/18/tucker-carlson-compares-cnns-candy-crowley-to-j/190724\">John Wilkes Booth assassinating Abraham Lincoln</a> (the Daily Caller's Tucker Carlson) when she fact-checked Romney in Tuesday's debate.</p> <p>ABC's Martha Raddatz, moderating the vice-presidential debate, faced inquiries into her <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">wedding in 1991</a>, where a certain Barack Obama was among the guests as a friend of her husband, Julius Genachowski. (Raddatz and Genachowski divorced in 1997).</p> <p>Lehrer, who arguably did not put in his best performance as he hosted his twelfth presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/jim-lehrer-debate-sucked\">faced widespread criticism</a>, descriptions of his performance ranging from \"practically useless\" to \"a bit overwhelmed\".</p> <p>But Schieffer's huge experience reporting on Washington means he should certainly be well placed to chair Tuesday's debate in Boca Raton, Florida, and his easygoing demeanour should mean he is able to handle any criticism that comes thereafter.</p> <p>Schieffer, 75, grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, and attending Texas Christian University before serving in the US air force. He joined the Fort Worth-Star Telegram upon leaving the military, <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/154064/schieffer-i-would-become-a-footnote-of-sorts-in-jfk-assassination-story/how\">with one of his first big scoops coming in 1963</a>, when John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas.</p> <p>Schieffer was the night police reporter that evening, and d<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/172893/how-2-twentysomething-journalists-brought-down-a-corrupt-kentucky-sheriff/\">escribed in an article for Poynter</a> how, amid the newsroom bedlam in the wake of Kennedy's shooting, he grabbed a ringing phone to find a woman ask: \"Is there anyone there who can give me a ride to Dallas?\"</p> <p>It was Lee Harvey Oswald's mother. Schieffer obliged, collecting Marguerite Oswald and driving her to the police station, where police took him to be a \"young detective\" and agreed to allow Schieffer to speak to the suspect. After waiting for six hours, an FBI agent finally asked Schieffer why he was there, only to be \"not amused to discover I was a reporter\".</p> <p>\"I never got that scoop but over the years there would be more stories to write about the Kennedys,\" Schieffer said. He moved from the Star-Telegram into local television and was later hired by CBS, first as a general reporter, then moving into national politics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/10/21/4351062/for-debate-bob-schieffer-has-the.html\">In an interview with his former newspaper on Friday</a> Schieffer lamented the fact that \"people pay too much attention to moderators\" in the current environment.</p> <p>\"We're like the umpires. You only hear criticism from the losing team,\" Schieffer said.</p> <p>\"These debates are not about what the candidates say. People are watching to judge character.</p> <p>\"I don't think it matters what the questions are about \u2013 what matters is how candidates answer. Do they seem in control? \u2026 I'm just there to help the viewers get a better understanding of who these people are.\"</p> <p>Schieffer has stayed with the political beat for over 40 years, first serving as White House correspondent, then chief Washington correspondent before becoming the anchor of Face the Nation in 1991.</p> <p>While it is \"an honour to be asked\" to moderate the debate, Schieffer <a href=\"http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/entertainment/television/a-qa-with-cbs-bob-schieffer-on-the-lynn-debate/nShRR/\">lamented the partisanship</a> in American politics in an interview with Florida's Palm Beach Post over the weekend.</p> <p>\"Now we have people who want news from a conservative slant or a liberal slant, and they go to different places. It's a rare thing when we get our information from the same place,\" Schieffer said, adding that was why it was so important that both sides can use the debates to see the opposing candidates on the same stage.</p> <p>\"Because the partisan divide is deeper than I ever remember it,\" Schieffer said. \"A deep, deep divide, and I've been in Washington 43 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>What is the last refuge of a prime minister in trouble? Grasping for something \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-initiative-trouble\" title=\"\">tough but intelligent</a>\" on crime. Such transparent desperation rarely appeases the insatiable furies at their heels. David Cameron's eye-catcher didn't even last half a day at the top of the news, though it affects many lives.</p> <p>In his ceaseless search for tough law and order announcements, Tony Blair doubled the prison population at phenomenal cost, wasting money that might have reduced reoffending. Myriad new crimes were created, sentences were lengthened by law, and judges and magistrates tuned their punishments to his political messages. Only recently, for the first time in years, former justice minister Ken Clarke's good sense did bring down prison numbers a little, despite a blip in excessive riot sentencing \u2013 though they are rising again. The Office for National Statistics says the figures are not conclusive, but it looks as if crime rates are continuing to fall, whoever is in power.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/07/michael-howard-prison-works-analysis\" title=\"\">Michael Howard's notoriously mendacious \"prison works</a>\" cry, Jack Straw's implementation of \"three strikes and you're out\" and cancelled early release schemes, David Blunkett and John Reid's ever harsher measures \u2013 all these sent prison numbers soaring, even though crime was falling. Counter-intuitive it may be, but there is little connection between crime rates and imprisonment. Across Europe and the US, crime has fallen, regardless of which states lock up a high or low proportion of offenders. Ministry of Justice research says prison cuts crime so little as to be utterly incommensurate with the \u00a340,000 a year per prisoner it costs, money being better spent on prevention instead.</p> <p>Governments are running out of headline-grabbing tough measures, so Cameron's team re-announced old ploys and decoys. \"Two strikes and you're out\" was already passed in the recent <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-11/legalaidsentencingandpunishmentofoffenders.html\" title=\"\">Legal Aid and Sentencing of Offenders Act</a>. Life sentences for gun-runners was announced months ago. Payment by results to private companies to cut re-offending was another re-announcement, but now it gives probation everywhere to G4S, A4e, Serco and the like, without waiting for the results of pilots. Cameron's spinners planted on the Mail on Sunday's front page a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221178/David-Cameron-unveils-plans-force-criminals-stop-watching-TV-start-earning-money-bars.html\" title=\"\">plan to abolish the meagre \u00a346 prisoners get on release</a>. Who thinks it a good idea to send them out without the price of a sandwich or a ticket home, if they have one? But that was just a dog-whistle which mysteriously vanished from Cameron's speech.</p> <p>With much posturing and positioning, Labour passed 50 criminal justice bills: compare that with just six between 1929 and 1945. The net result was self-defeating, as it will be for Cameron. If governments won't calm crime fears by trumpeting the fact that crime is dropping, few will ever hear that reassuring message. Pollsters show few voters believe there is less chance of being a victim of crime now than at any time in the last 30 years. The news will always wallow in fascinating crime horrors, and crime drama will always be compulsive viewing, but must politicians always join in this stirring of fear? Oppositions rarely resist \u2013 remember Cameron's absurd \"broken Britain\" rhetoric.</p> <p>Labour looks unlikely to break this pattern of political recidivism. New Labour was born the day Blair chose \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" as his recipe, his trade-off between illiberalism and egalitarianism. Is that the only way to power? Labour boasts it will only promote \"what works\", evidence-based crime policies, but as they refuse to condemn their era of evidence-free mass imprisonment, that looks doubtful. Politicians know quite well what works in crime prevention, but that's not the same as what they think works with voters. Some voters will relish Cameron's call for retribution, but many will know they are being treated as idiots. Contempt for politicians grows when people sense they are being treated with contempt.</p> <p>In three weeks Cameron will suffer the consequences of his opposition opportunism. Everyone in England and Wales, but not Londoners, goes to the polls to elect the police and crime commissioners he devised on the back of an envelope. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/police-commissioner-election-lists?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">He thought they sounded popular, but we shall see how many vote</a>: creating hollow ballots can be dangerous. Already at odds with the police, Cameron has created a mechanism that will ensure forces can never be rationalised or reformed, while the police gain a tireless \"democratic\" advocate demanding ever more manpower and money, despite no close correlation between police resources and crime rates. (There is a link between numbers of police and the amount of crime reported \u2013 figures are treacherous.) Crimefighting money is far better spent on now-abolished youth services, on drug and alcohol programmes or housing, employment and treatment of offenders.</p> <p>Out campaigning, would-be commissioners focus on street crime, burglary and antisocial behaviour \u2013 all already falling. So who will push resources towards crimes the public worries about less? Domestic violence is rising, always an orphan in the fight for attention. Solving more white-collar crime brings the state extra income, but clever people studying accounts in back offices will lose out to bobbies on the beat as commissioners eye their re-election.</p> <p>Every half-alert politician knows the famous research showing each plod on the pavement will only come within a 100m of a crime once every eight years \u2013 and then probably won't see it. But you won't find Labour whispering such blasphemies. Astonished to find themselves unexpectedly well-positioned as the policeman's friend, Labour looks set to fight their way to the election decrying the shocking fall in police numbers \u2013 because that's what works with voters.</p> <p>Telling the truth may not always be the road to victory. Politicians dissemble for good reason, right to mistrust voters claiming to want hard truths. Will people choose honesty when confronted with awkward and unpopular counter-intuitive facts? Labour faces that dilemma on many fronts. Borrowing more to invest in growth and cut the deficit is Keynes's difficult \"paradox of thrift\". Closing some hospitals to improve NHS results goes against local belief. Cutting the police to spend better on crime prevention sits in that same difficult in-tray. At least Labour agonises over these, while such scruples rarely seem to trouble Cameron's sleep.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Freedland's argument about contrasting reactions to events in Israel and Syria is significantly flawed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/19/condemn-israel-why-silence-on-syria?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 20 October). First, there has been huge outrage over the Assad regime's brutality, including weekly protests outside the Syrian embassy and others in Trafalgar Square. Is there any credible figure in British politics who has not condemned its behaviour?</p> <p>Second, the British government has quite rightly unequivocally opposed the Assad regime's crimes and supported 19 rounds of sanctions against regime figures and entities. Though Israel's crimes are not directly comparable, when its forces bomb schools, level villages, use human shields, demolish houses, torture civilians, and steal land there is little more than routine tame verbal criticism and a business as usual approach. Britain cannot even support Palestinian statehood. This rank hypocrisy and double standards rankles with many.</p> <p>There is little more that we can expect the British government to do on Syria short of engaging in a dangerous war, while the Assad regime hardly cares what British protesters think, any more than it cares about peaceful Syrian demonstrators. In contrast, there is much our government could do tangibly to demonstrate that it takes Israel's consistent violations of law and Palestinian human rights seriously, not least a full arms embargo.</p> <p>In both cases there has been plenty of prominent media coverage, not least in the Guardian. Those suffering in other conflicts such as Congo would love even a fraction of the attention. <br><strong>Chris Doyle</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.caabu.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Council for Arab-British Understanding</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland makes the usual plea \"why condemn Israel?\". Israel claims to be a western-style democracy that respects human rights and international law. The US and the EU, as well as our own country, have social, academic, cultural and trade links with Israel, and many of us have friends or colleagues in Israel. To many UK citizens, it is their home too. Israel drove the Palestinians from their homeland and livelihoods in 1948 and for 45 years Israel has occupied the West Bank. The treatment of the Palestinians is brutal and humiliating, as I have witnessed. We are right to condemn Israel for its actions. We are right to demand a higher standard of behaviour from Israel than from Arab states that are&#xa0;only now struggling to achieve political change. I have been to Syria. Does Mr Freedland really want Israel to be judged by the same standards by which we judge&#xa0;Syria?<br><strong>Jenny Tonge</strong><br><em>House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is absolutely right. I'm a UK Jew and a frequent critic of Israel's government for its persecution of Palestinians. Freedland makes no secret of his own concerns about Israel's behaviour towards Palestinians. But the unforgivable behaviour of Syria's Assad and his supporters against their own people is even more damnable and the absence of public protest about it is highly regrettable. Perhaps the form such protest could take simply hasn't occurred to the UK \"protester community\"? The brush-off Freedland received from <a href=\"http://www.stopwar.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the War</a>'s Lindsey German comes as a shock. I will certainly raise this with Stop the War next time I receive one of their frequent appeals.<br><strong>Stanley Walinets</strong><br><em>Barnard Castle, Durham </em></p>",

The event left many, including journalists who asked outright about whether McQuaid was considering resignation, wondering whether McQuaid or the UCI as presently led has a place in cycling. Let's look at McQuaid's statements in more detail.</p> <h2>'Fight against doping'</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I took over as president of the UCI in 2005, I made the fight against doping my priority. That still remains my priority.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is some justice in this claim. Under McQuaid's presidency, Anne Gripper, an Australian, was appointed head of the UCI's anti-doping programme. Gripper made significant headway, inroducing of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_passport\">biological passport</a> in 2008 as a means of identifying suspicious activity by cyclists year-round. Gripper left the UCI in 2010. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/gripper-calls-on-the-uci-to-do-more-to-fight-doping\">Gripper made critical remarks</a> about how the UCI had bent the rules to allow Armstrong to compete without full anti-doping vetting on his comeback in 2009. About McQuaid, Gripper said specifically: \"I know his commitment to this was very strong while I was there. It may have wavered a bit.\"</p> <h2>UCI 'at the forefront'</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UCI has always been in the forefront of the fight against doping.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's a bit of a gloss. In fact, after the 1998 Festina scandal, the Tour de France's management company, ASO, then under the leadership of Patrice Clerc, was much more pro-active and tougher than the UCI on doping. In 2006, for instance, Clerc excluded 13 riders who had been implicated in Operation Puerto, the Spanish police investigation into a blood-doping ring run by Dr Carlos Fuentes. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/clerc-comments-on-astanas-exclusion-and-vuelta-ownership\">he shut out the entire Astana team</a> because of its record and reputation. The UCI excluded riders on the basis of positive tests; it never adopted such presumptive, pre-emptive action.</p> <p>The former World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) chief Richard Pound has been an outspoken and consistent critic of the UCI for not doing enough to stop doping. The UCI even sued Pound for remarks he made after stepping down from the presidency of Wada in 2007. (That resulted in a settlement in 2009, as part of which<a href=\"http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/12997/Richard-Pound-Interview-The-Kimmage-case-Armstrong-the-governance-of-cycling-and-more.aspx\"> Pound issued a clarification \u2013 he insists it was in no way a retraction</a>). Pound has recently said that the <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2012/10/news/former-wada-chief-says-uci-knew-drug-testing-system-was-flawed_261599\">UCI's testing regime was \"designed to fail\"</a>, alleging that riders were tipped off about tests in advance and were often unchaperoned. \"It is not credible that they [the UCI] didn't know this was going on,\" Pound said.</p> <h2>'Adapting' to the EPO era</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When EPO came in, the whole situation changed. The UCI then \u2013 and I do accept it took some time for the UCI to adapt to that and to start a strong amount of out-of-competition controls \u2013 but we moved forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>EPO use started in the pro peloton at the very beginning of the 1990s. Despite cyclists being the leading endurance athletes using the blood-boosting drug, the UCI failed to develop a test for it. Only for the 2000 Olympics did the IOC introduce a blood and urine test for the drug, which was afterwards adopted by the UCI. True, the science is complicated, and a reliable test for EPO was challenging to develop. But when McQuaid says it took \"some time\", this was an entire lost decade in which a pervasive culture of medicalised, systemic doping was allowed to establish itself, virtually unchecked.</p> <h2>'I'm not Hein'</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Me personally, I wasn't president of the UCI in that period. I can only account for my tenure from 2005 onwards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, McQuaid attempts to distance himself from the regime of Hein Verbruggen, who was the UCI president from 1991 until 2005. Verbruggen, who as a vice-president and an IOC official, continues to play a key role at the UCI. McQuaid has backed the actions and reputation of his predecessor on every occasion \u2013 including joining him in defamation lawsuits against former Wada president Dick Pound, ex-pro Floyd Landis and Irish journalist Paul Kimmage (see below).</p> <h2>The UCI and cycling's omerta</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UCI always had a commitment to try to protect clean riders.</p> </blockquote> <p>Any rider or member of the entourage who pointed a finger of suspicion at Lance Armstrong was brutally ostracised, as can attest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/christophe-bassons-not-bitter-lance-armstrong?newsfeed=true\">Christophe Bassons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/simeoni-armstrong-and-past-still-haunt-me\">Filippo Simeone</a>, Emma O'Reilly, and Betsy and Frankie Andreu. To break cycling's code of silence on doping was to make yourself untouchable, as <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-15/the-world-according-to-lance-key-players/4313246\">J\u00f6rg Jaksche</a> eloquently testifies. It's hard to think of any UCI policy or action that encouraged whistleblowers or tackled the power of the omert\u00e0 in professional cycling.</p> <h2>Floyd Landis' confession</h2> <p>McQuaid was asked if he regretted that the UCI had not listened to Floyd Landis' accusations against Armstrong, which formed the basis of the Usada report. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We did listen to Landis back then [in 2010].</p> </blockquote> <p>McQuaid allowed his colleague Philippe Verbiest to explain that the UCI received a copy of Landis's confessional email of 30 April 2010. Verbiest said the UCI sent Landis a letter sent telling him to retract his allegation that it covered up a 2001 \"positive test\" by Lance Armstrong, and saying it favoured an investigation of his other allegations. Verbiest said the UCI let Usada get on with the investigation. What neither Verbiest nor McQuaid mentioned is that they have subsequently sued Landis in a Swiss court over the cover-up allegation. Landis did not defend the case and <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/cycling/2012/10/03/world-cycling-body-hails-court-win-over-landis/1610319/\">lost by default</a>, but the allegation has been repeated in near identical detail, as the Usada report notes, by Tyler Hamilton (see below).</p> <h2>The haematocrit permission</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In early 2000s \u2026 the UCI introduced haematocrit controls to stop people dying in their beds. What that did, as we all know now, was allow riders to use EPO to a certain limit, control it. Whenever we saw suspicious tests, especially on important riders, we called them into the UCI and asked them what they were doing. One of those indeed was Tyler Hamilton \u2026 Tyler Hamilton was in the UCI, and was tackled about his activities. His response at the time was that your machines must be calibrated wrong, I'm doing nothing.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is interesting, if only because it illustrates the weakness of the UCI's anti-doping regime during the early 2000s. Essentially, riders were asked to come in and deny their doping: other than reminding them to be more careful and not get caught, it's hard to see what these consultations achieved. Revealing, also, though, is McQuaid's remark that these cosy chats took place \"especially on important riders\". This corroborates the context for the Usada account of the meeting that took place in 2002 between Lance Armstrong and his manager Johan Bruyneel and the UCI President Hein Verbruggen, after which Armstrong made his now-infamous donation to the UCI (see also below).</p> <h2>Losing sponsors</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We lost a very important sponsor, Rabobank, last week. That's true. But I am quite confident that sponsor will be replaced.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a governing body that complains, as McQuaid did on Monday, of not having \"billions in the bank like Fifa\", this is a remarkably insouciant and cavalier statement.</p> <h2>Crisis, what crisis?</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I like to look at this crisis as an opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p>In which case, the UCI has had a great many missed opportunities to address the doping problem already: the Festina scandal, Operation Puerto, the T-Mobile/Team Telekom revelations, Marco Pantani's death, Floyd Landis' revelations, the Italian criminal investigations of Dr Michele Ferrari and Dr Francesco Conconi \u2026</p> <h2>The 2001 Tour de Suisse story</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UCI would absolutely deny that ever happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>McQuaid is responding to a direct question about the Usada report's account of Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton, who both attested that Lance Armstrong had told each that he had made a positive test in the 2001 Tour de Suisse go away following discussions with the UCI and agreeing to donate $125,000 for anti-doping programmes. The UCI, Verbruggen and McQuaid strongly deny the allegation of corruption and cover-up.</p> <p>While McQuaid and Verbruggen have sued Floyd Landis, the same accusation has been made by Tyler Hamilton on CBS's 60 Minutes programme and in his recently published book The Secret Race. Verbruggen and McQuaid have not sued Hamilton. The Irish former professional racer and sports journalist Paul Kimmage is, however, being sued for running Landis' account of the story.</p> <h2>Usada, Landis and Kimmage</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What you have to do is separate this action and this Usada report. The case against Paul Kimmage has nothing to do with Usada, nothing to do with Lance Armstrong, nothing to do with Paul Kimmage as an anti-doping advocate, nothing to do with Paul Kimmage who wrote the book The Rough Ride. This is about a journalist who accused me and my predecessor and the UCI of being corrupt. It's a straightforward defamation case.</p> </blockquote> <p>The denials are unambiguous, but it is hard to discern any consistency in the pattern of legal action taken by the UCI over accusations of corruption. Further, Kathy LeMond, wife of America's last remaining Tour de France champion, Greg LeMond, has testified under oath that a US Postal team mechanic, Julian DeVries, told her that the <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/verbruggen-denies-kathy-lemonds-story-of-cover-up-payment\">UCI took $500,000 to cover up Armstrong's positive test for cortisone in the 1999 Tour de France</a>. DeVries does not now corroborate the story, and Verbruggen has denied the allegation. At this time, no legal action has ensued. As David Walsh, the Sunday Times' crusading journalist and author of LA Confidentiel, tweeted:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidWalshST/status/260349636047425536\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Be good if someone asked McQuaid if UCI intended to sue LA. He told teammates he could get positives covered up, i.e. that they were corrupt</p>&mdash; David Walsh (@DavidWalshST) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidWalshST/status/260349636047425536\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:59:24+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <h2>The Armstrong donation</h2> <p>McQuaid was then asked directly whether the appearance of a conflict of interest, if not worse, in accepting a large donation from Lance Armstrong was not a resignation issue.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's certainly not a resignation issue. What I've admitted is that it would be best if we didn't do it [accept money from riders], if we hadn't done it. Or if we were to do it in the future, it would be done in a different way. But there is no connection between a donation given to the UCI and a test covered up, because there was no test covered up. There was nothing to cover up. \u2026 We would accept it differently and announce it differently than we did before.</p> </blockquote> <p>McQuaid was asked again about the problem of taking Armstrong's donation. His response:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We didn't know he [Armstrong] had had a suspicious test for EPO. And don't try to make the connection between the donation and the test. There were no positive tests on Lance Armstrong.</p> </blockquote> <p>McQuaid was careful to correct the term \"suspicious\" to \"positive\", though his statement thus acquired an unfortunate resonance with Armstrong's own oft-repeated protestation that he never tested positive.</p> <p>In fact, as the Swiss laboratory director Martial Saugy says in the Usada report (and <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/armstrongs-2001-sample-was-suspect-but-not-positive-says-head-of-lausanne-lab\">has affirmed in interviews since</a>), the samples he had were \"suspect\", around 85% probable, but not positive for EPO use. Saugy also confirmed that he was informed by the UCI itself that one of these samples was Armstrong's. He attested that he later, in 2002, met with Armstrong and Bruyneel to explain exactly what a \"suspect\" result meant scientifically. Saugy's statements thus directly contradict McQuaid's, since Saugy says the UCI <em>did know</em> of Armstrong's suspect sample.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, McQuaid was asked yet again how the UCI could accept a donation for fighting doping when it knew that the rider (Armstrong) had a suspicious test for EPO. On this occasion, revealingly, McQuaid did not deny knowledge of the suspect test, nor attempt to equivocate by saying it was not a positive test that they didn't know about.</p> <p>Instead, with something like resignation or regret, McQuaid shook his head.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We accepted it. We used the money to assist in the fight against doping.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>What would American life be like without Roger Ailes?</p> <p>Not immediately that different, which is why many people have wishfully thought his contract might not be renewed. The Fox News method \u2013 rancorous rightwing personalities with a carefully curated subtext \u2013 is a ratings-winning formula that would have continued. But soon enough, it would begin to pall (which is, of course, what the wishful have hoped for).</p> <p>There is an obsessional quality to the Fox formula when it's directed by Roger Ailes. This is auteur stuff. This is real trouble-making. His is a golden gut \u2013 not just for television but for provocation (of how many can that be said?). Whereas everyone else in television is worried about going too far, Ailes is diabolically turning the country upside down.</p> <p>By all success measures, Roger Ailes may be the one person in America who most deserves to keep his job. And indeed, after a protracted period of negotiation \u2013 which likely will have made him the highest-paid person in television \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/10/19/roger-ailes-signs-deal-to-stay-at-fox-news-through-2016/\">last week</a>, News Corp, Fox's parent, renewed his contract for another four years: right through to the next presidential election, over which he will, once again, have vast and undue influence.</p> <p>Almost everyone of good will and establishment credentials surely shivered at the news.</p> <p>This includes, along with the liberal establishment and his competitors in the television business, the children of Rupert Murdoch. They, with their father, control New Corp, and for both political and internecine reasons (Ailes has undue influence over their father, they believe) have been <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2012-01/05/michael-wolff-why-i-love-fox-news\">gunning</a> for the Fox News chairman. Also <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/01/09/the-fox-murdoch-feud.html\">included</a> is Wendi Murdoch, the boss's wife, whose social life is manifestly liberal with her BFFs fervently campaigning against Ailes. Even Rupert Murdoch, whose self is divided by the aggravation Ailes causes him and the money Ailes makes him, likely had a moment's pause.</p> <p>But the people who most bitterly must suck up the news of his renewal \u2013 they can't afford not to suck it up, can't afford to show the slightest lapse in their fealty to Fox News \u2013 are the mainstream Republicans with whom Ailes is most truly at war. Indeed, a life without Roger Ailes would be most dramatically different at the upper reaches of the Republican party.</p> <p>Ailes might goad and taunt the liberals, but he has <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/fox-news-republican-party_b_1234219.html\">directly challenged and bested the Republicans</a>. He has set up an alternative party. </p> <p>Give credit where it is due: it's the Ailes Tea Party. Without Ailes, Fox News would merely be a conservative MSNBC, fundamentally concerned with ratings instead of rocking the boat.</p> <p>Let me make a crucial distinction here: Ailes is fundamentally concerned with ratings, but they are achieved, in his approach, precisely by rocking the boat (a concept that I doubt any other working television executive could grasp). The long-term success of Fox is the result of not just annoying the left, but of creating an ever-mounting dramatic tension among conservatives of various hues. Ailes' real theme is authenticity, and his talent is to be able to undercut everybody else's claim to it.</p> <p>Ailes creates conflict. Conflict creates good television.</p> <p>And further: Fox, with its Ailes-curated message, has changed the language of conservative politics. Talking the talk \u2013 electric, pugnacious, hyperbolic, self-dramatizing television talk \u2013 is talking Fox talk.</p> <p>Mitt Romney ought to be the guy most depressed about the Ailes' contract renewal. If Romney wins, Ailes will be his biggest political problem.</p> <p>It's a double-reversal punch line. Ailes is the key figure in promoting a Republican party bench of unelectable gargoyles. That allowed Romney, an obvious centrist, to emerge as the only viable candidate \u2013 provided, however, that he helplessly pander to the Ailes party. There may never have been a candidate who has been forced to be so at odds with himself.</p> <p>Without Ailes, Romney might pedal back to his Massachusetts self. With Ailes, and his subliminal messaging and subtle adjustments to language, Romney is hemmed in. He's stuck with Fox talk. Indeed, any deviation from that language is a deviation from conservative righteousness. Just try it.</p> <p>If Romney loses, then he's the culprit \u2013 not Fox. Romney will be the stand-in, as no doubt he should be, for all the establishment Republican phonies. Obama, remaining in office, stays as the lightening rod \u2013 indeed, the anti-Christ against which the Tea Party (or Ailes party) continues to mount its suicidal, but ratings-winning opposition.</p> <p>Ailes wins on 6 November, no matter what.</p> <p>But it is important not to see this as a political story. This is a media tale. And it is not so one-dimensional as a media mogul using his power to try to influence the political process. That's merely Murdoch 101. The reason Ailes has become almost all-powerful within News Corporation is because his worldview is vastly more complex than that. He long ago outdid Murdoch at being Murdoch.</p> <p>He's established Fox News as the pre-eminent political world. When you watch it, you're not just watching people who can influence power people, you're watching the thrilling exercise of power. What you see \u2013 the malevolence, the disruption, the veiled subtexts \u2013 is the drama of dominance and submission.</p> <p>Ailes, alone among news professionals, has understood the most important truth about modern news: nobody's interested in politics, not in real politics anyway. It's a buzz kill. Both Romney and Obama: buzz kills. Nonentities. But if you repopulate the political world with extremists, eccentrics, loudmouths and well-scripted voices, you have a show.</p> <p>That's what we have four more years of with Ailes firmly in place: parallel realities, with Fox having long since overshadowed, or even mostly replaced, actual political reality.</p> <p>It's Roger's world, and we just live in it.</p>",
  "<p>At one stage in Pat McQuaid's heavily stage managed press conference on Monday the president of the UCI paid tribute to the riders who had testified against Lance Armstrong in the long and agonising process of exposing the doping conspiracy that enabled the Texan to win a record seven Tours de France. \"The UCI indeed thanks them for telling their stories,\" he said. Many believe that McQuaid and his organisation should have played a bigger part in exposing such a massive example of cheating.</p> <p>To the 63-year-old Irishman, however, the UCI never had a chance. \"I don't want to justify what happened,\" he said in a more informal conversation later in the day, \"but it's very easy to sit here in 2012 and criticise the lack of action in 2002, 2003 or 2004. You have to work with the system in place at the time. Bear in mind that in the early 2000s there were not laws in place and police forces were not involved. It was left to international federations. Now it's a different landscape.</p> <p>\"All the UCI could do at that time was send samples to the laboratory. If they came back negative, then they came back negative. You can't do much more than that. We didn't have police powers to go any further. All we could do is say we were going to chase you. We caught loads of guys as a result of chasing them. But they [Armstrong's teams] had a sophisticated system and they beat the system.</p> <p>\"We couldn't put a gun on the table or a badge and say you're up in front of a grand jury, which is what happened in this case. None of these witnesses volunteered to come forward. They were subpoenaed by the police.\"</p> <p>He described it as \"a landmark day for cycling\", although he refused to mark it in the way his detractors would prefer, by announcing his own resignation. McQuaid, a former amateur rider who twice won the Tour of Ireland, even made a plea for sympathy when, having refused to countenance the prospect of resignation, he described his experiences in the fight against doping over the past seven years.</p> <p>\"I was elected in September 2005 at the world championships in Madrid,\" he said. \"On the Sunday prior to that I went to a dinner to congratulate the winner of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Roberto Heras. A week after I was made president we heard that he had tested positive for EPO. That was the beginning of my presidency. Since then I've had to deal with Operaci\u00f3n Puerto in 2006, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/floyd-landis\" title=\"\">Floyd Landis</a> in 2007, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/26/cycling.tourdefrance\" title=\"\">Michael Rasmussen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/24/cycling.tourdefrance2\" title=\"\">Alexander Vinokourov</a>, Andrey Kashechkin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/20/cycling.tourdefrance\" title=\"\">Patrik Sinkewitz</a> and the Telekom affair, in 2008 the Cera cases, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/13/tourdefrance-cycling\" title=\"\">Bernhard Kohl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/06/tourdefrance.cycling\" title=\"\">Stefan Schumacher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/apr/28/drugs-cera-epo-retesting-beijing-olympics\" title=\"\">Davide Rebellin</a>, in 2009 the [blood] passport cases with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jul/24/tour-de-france-doping-problems\" title=\"\">Danilo Di Luca</a>, in 2010 more passport cases with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/06/alberto-contador-ban-tour-cycling\" title=\"\">Alberto Contador</a>, in 2011 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/30/ezequiel-mosquera-tour-of-spain-fails-dope-test\" title=\"\">Ezequiel Mosquera</a> and now Armstrong. It's been a pretty horrific seven years. But I'm optimistic, although there's still work to be done.\"</p> <p>The biggest fish, however, was completely missed by the UCI, who now have been forced to accept the findings of Travis Tygart and the US Anti-Doping Agency. The governing body's deeper feelings may have shown through in the statement it produced when it criticised Usada's \"on occasion animated and overstated language\" and \"intense involvement in the prosecution which not always serves the degree of detachment that one may expect from a disciplinary decision\".</p> <p>If intense involvement were what it took to persuade Armstrong's team-mates to give their incriminating evidence, then perhaps cycling needs more of it. \"I'm grateful to Usada for what they achieved,\" McQuaid admitted, \"but they needed the support of federal agents to do it.\"</p> <p>He also refused to heed the call of David Millar for the resignation of Hein Verbruggen, McQuaid's predecessor, who was in charge during the Armstrong years and remains as honorary president. \"Hein Verbruggen wasn't holding David Millar's hand when he stuck a needle in his backside,\" McQuaid said. \"The riders have to take responsibility. They're adults. They know the rules and they know when they're breaking them. It's not the president's responsibility if they go into a doping programme.\"</p> <p>But the current president refused repeated requests to say what he would like to see Armstrong do now, for the good of the sport. \"I know what I'd like him to do but I'm not going to say. It's up to him to decide. From what I gather he's finished with cycling.\"</p> <p>McQuaid was insistent that Tuesday marked a turning point. \"This affair has been hanging over us for some time,\" he said. \"This is the culmination and we can now put it behind us. We must take what we can learn from it and put in place measures so such a thing never happens again.\"</p> <p>He declined to discuss <a href=\"http://english.gazzetta.it/More_sports/17-10-2012/the-ferrari-system-swiss-bank-accounts-fake-contracts-912946609743.shtml\" title=\"\">the stories in last week's <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em></a> previewing the findings of a two-year investigation by a public prosecutor in Padua into the activities of Dr Michele Ferrari, Armstrong's trainer, involving a network of Italian and Russian riders and secret bank accounts in several cities in Italy and Switzerland. On the face of it this is the uncovering of a scandal of almost equal and complementary weight to Usada's Armstrong investigation and is likely to shadow the sport for some time to come, although McQuaid refused to accept the Gazzetta's verdict that the sport is now in \"a bottomless black hole\".</p> <p>\"It's a difficult period,\" he said, with considerable understatement. \"The UCI in one sense has had a great year. There has been some magnificent racing at the Olympics and the world championships. But this is a very critical moment for the sport.\"</p> <p>Yesterday was an opportunity to take advantage of that critical moment and show that big decisions are being taken to lead cycling into a better future. Instead McQuaid conveyed the impression that, in the face of scandal and retreating sponsors, the sport is being offered more of the same.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when conservatism meant what the word suggests. It was an attempt to keep things as they are: to arrest economic and social change, to defend the position of the dominant class. Today conservatism has become a nihilistic festival of destruction: a gleeful Bullingdon dinner party of upper-class anarchists, smashing other people's crockery and hurling the chairs through the windows. Yet its purpose is still to secure the position of the dominant class.</p> <p>It is no longer enough to own the land and most of the capital, to own the media and \u2013 through the corrupt system of party funding \u2013 the political process. To reinstate Edwardian levels of inequality, the feral elite must seek to reverse the political progress that has been made since then. This means dismantling the tax system, which redistributes wealth. It means ditching the rules that prevent the powerful from acting as they please.</p> <p>Both are being consumed in what British Conservatives proudly describe as a bonfire. Nowhere is deregulation more destructive than in its treatment of the natural world.</p> <p>If <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara\" title=\"\">ash dieback</a> takes root in Britain, it could be as damaging as Dutch elm disease was. This fungus is now raging across the continent, consuming almost all the ash trees in its path. Few ashes \u2013 among which are some of the oldest and best-loved trees in Britain \u2013 are expected to survive if the disease becomes established here.</p> <p>The only way the fungus can arrive in this country is through imports of infected saplings. In February the first case in the UK was reported, at a tree nursery in Buckinghamshire. The disease has now been found in 10 places, and foresters are desperately trying to contain it.</p> <p>But \u2013 and this is the extraordinary thing \u2013 the government still refuses to ban imports of ash saplings. Instead, it has put the issue out to consultation, as if it had all the time in the world. It's like spraying one side of a burning house with water while allowing petrol to be sprayed on the other. The government's commitment to deregulating business outweighs the likely consequences. If ash dieback spreads through Britain, Cameron's administration will be solely and unequivocally to blame.</p> <p>It cares just as little about what's happening to the bees. A <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11585.html\" title=\"\">new study published this week in Nature</a> provides yet more evidence of the devastating impacts of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids. But, unlike other European nations, Britain refuses even to suspend their use.</p> <p>The same politics inform the planned mass slaughter of badgers, which seems mystifying until you understand that it's an alternative to effective regulation. Far from controlling tuberculosis in cattle, it could, as Professor John Bourne (who led the previous government's \u00a349m scientific trial) says, \"make TB a damn sight worse\". In the 1960s, strict quarantine rules and the rigorous testing of cattle almost eliminated the disease from the UK. But farmers complained, so the rules were relaxed, and TB returned with a vengeance. Killing badgers creates an impression of action, without offending landed interests.</p> <p>In March, the government published its kill list of environmental regulations. Among those being downgraded are the rules controlling hazardous waste, air pollution, contaminated land, noise, light and the use of lead shot. Ministers describe this as the shrinking of the state. In reality it's the shrinking of democracy. Regulation is the means by which civilised societies resolve their conflicts. It prevents the selfish and the powerful from spoiling the lives of others.</p> <p>But this isn't about only economic dominance. It is also about cultural hegemony. Uniquely perhaps, in Britain the rightwing culture war is waged largely in the countryside. Tory culture revolves around land owning: battle lines are drawn around the issue of who represents rural Britain. Writing in the Telegraph last month, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/countryside/9525542/Shale-the-hidden-treasure-that-could-transform-Britains-fortunes.html\" title=\"\">Fraser Nelson</a>, a reliable guide to the current state of thinking in the party, maintained that people who live in the countryside don't care about \"newts, trees and bats\": these are of interest only in London. He went on to describe David Cameron as \"at heart, a rural Tory\", who \"still grumbles to his wife about what, for him, are 'banned activities' \u2013 notably shooting\". Authentic rural people spend their adult lives in Notting Hill and drive out to their second homes for a shooting party at the weekend. Inauthentic rural people are those who live in the countryside and care about wildlife. They are, \"at heart\", Londoners. The rural-urban divide, as formulated by Tory theorists, is nothing to do with location. It's about class.</p> <p>Those who wish to restrain destructive activities are characterised \u2013 by the minister Greg Barker and, apparently, George Osborne \u2013 as \"environmental Taliban\". Their attempt to associate democratic debate with people who shoot girls in the head tells you all you need to know about their sense of political entitlement.</p> <p>This conservatism does not care what it destroys. It does not care whom it hurts. It will sacrifice entire species rather than contemplate the slightest check on its own self-interest.

  "<p>In 2001, I found the corpse of a man by the banks of the river. I didn't even know it was a corpse. I called an ambulance and they pronounced him dead. After 10 days, they came and put me under investigation. Six days later, I was arrested. I was 21 years old.</p> <p>For two years there were court hearings and investigations and in 2003 I was sentenced to 12\u00bd years. I was sent to the Shakhovsky women's prison colony in the Orlov region.</p> <p>I was in shock from the moment I entered. There were women there from all the regions of Russia. For me, it was wild. I had never met such women before. They didn't even seem like women, but like real men. Tattooed, no teeth, very short hair.</p> <p>There were around 100 women in each unit. There were bunk beds \u2013 the women who proved their authority got the bottom beds. There was a television and even a DVD player, but we were allowed to watch only on weekends.</p> <p>For me, as a woman who was serving time for the first time, it was hard to understand jail politics.</p> <p>Wake-up came at 6am. Then exercise and breakfast. We were usually served porridge made from water. At 7.20am it was time to go to work. We sewed uniforms for soldiers, uniforms for police, uniforms for court guards.</p> <p>According to the law, we were meant to work for eight hours a day, but sometimes we worked for 12. We worked from 7.30 to noon then had 20 minutes for lunch. Then it was back to work. Work was meant to last until 3.30pm, according to the law, but often it lasted until 7pm. If work ended at 3.30pm, you could go to your unit and wash and wait for dinner. There was time then for yourself \u2013 to write letters, read newspapers, watch TV. But that was very rare. Usually after work they made us clean the territory of the prison. Dinner came at 6.30pm and lights out at 10pm.</p> <p>For two years, I couldn't adapt at all. It was very difficult for me to understand everything. I remember once I went to the library and found an art book in French. I went back to the unit and told the women: Can you believe it? I found an art book in French! In the prison library! They all looked at me like I was an idiot. Then I understood I was a little different. Maybe because I was not guilty, maybe because I was raised differently.</p> <p>But after a while, a person gets used to everything. I got used to them, they got used to me. Our prison colony was a so-called \"model prison\" so it was more or less normal, more or less clean. As far as I know, all the other colonies are total chaos.</p> <p>It's a bad life. A person can go in totally normal and come out not a person at all. I saw it happen many times \u2013 a woman comes in under a \"light\" charge, like theft, eventually goes free and after a while comes back on a \"hard\" charge like murder. It breaks you as an individual. People don't go in there to be fixed, but to be broken further.</p> <p>I was let out on 27 July 2012, after writing official letters to everyone \u2013 to members of parliament, to the president, to the head of the supreme court and the regional court, to all levels of justice. It finally worked. They let me out with two years and two months left to serve.</p> <p>Now I work at a factory and have been accepted to the law faculty. I want to be a lawyer. I want to protect people who, like me, got into this system when they were not guilty.</p> <p>Our justice system doesn't try people according to the law, but uses its own internal beliefs, which is totally illegal.</p> <p>Now people write to me all the time, asking for help. I try to help anyone I can, with whatever strength I have. That's the goal of my life \u2013 to achieve justice.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/14/syria.israelandthepalestinians2\" title=\"\">Israel was bombing Beirut during the war of 2006</a>, a colleague and I sat drinking a beer after a long, hard day, listening to the explosions coming every few minutes from the southern suburbs. \"Is this what it felt like to be somewhere in central Europe in the 1930s?\" he mused. Comparisons are never exact, but I saw what he meant. Lebanon, and the region, was dogged not just by the violence of that year's war but also by a gnawing feeling that the future could contain something even worse.</p> <p>In Lebanon, one of the strongest counterweights to the predictions of bad times ahead is the memory of bad times in the past. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14647308\" title=\"\">Fifteen years of civil war in the 70s and 80s</a> left many scars. Lebanon has managed to survive a succession of serious crises since the assassination \u2013 by Syria, bereaved supporters say \u2013 of the former prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13978635\" title=\"\">Rafik Hariri</a>, in 2005. A year later there was a war with Israel; in 2007 a protracted battle with jihadists in a Palestinian refugee camp; and there was a mini-civil war in 2008. The list goes on.</p> <p>For every Lebanese person I have spoken to in the last few days, the assassination on 19 October of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/lebanon-divide-assassination-security-chief\" title=\"\">General Wissam al-Hassan</a> \u2013 the most important security official in the country \u2013 is every bit as serious, and could have even greater consequences. In his elegant apartment high above Tripoli, Lebanon's second city, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13767064\" title=\"\">Faisal Karami</a> \u2013 one of Lebanon's rising politicians, the son and nephew of past Lebanese prime ministers who has been talked about as future leader himself \u2013 did not try to play down the seriousness of what has happened. \"He was killed right in the middle of Beirut. It's one of the most dangerous moments for Lebanon since independence in the 1940s,\" he said calmly as gunfire crackled periodically outside. In the slums of Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbanneh a few miles away, Sunni gunmen were trading bullets with Lebanese Alawites, from the same Shia sect as President Assad and his fervent supporters. \"We've already got a mini-civil war going. People are being shot in the streets.\"</p> <p>In every recent crisis, despite dire predictions, Lebanon's leaders, often with foreign help, have found a way to restore a certain sense of quiet in a country that has never been properly stable. What makes it harder this time is the civil war in Syria, a short drive away, and the uncertainty right across the Arab Middle East. In the region plenty of people have no idea what will happen a month from now, let alone next year.</p> <p>Lebanon's curse is that it does not control its own fate. Throughout its short history as a small and weak independent country, it has been at the mercy of its stronger neighbours. Lebanese leaders depend on the alliances they make with powerful foreigners. Inevitably that makes them party to their patrons' quarrels and wars too.</p> <p>The alliances are partly based on sectarian sympathy, and plug Lebanon into one of the region's most basic conflicts, between the allies of Saudi Arabia and the west, and those who look to Iran. The leader of Lebanon's Sunnis, Saad Hariri, is the client of Sunni Saudi Arabia, which is doing all it can to unseat the Assad regime in Syria. The Assads, with Shia Iran, are the patrons of Hezbollah, the Shia movement of fighters and politicians that is the most powerful force in Lebanon.</p> <p>With conflict in the region these days comes sectarianism. The Lebanese are the Middle East's experts on the subject. They know what it is like to co-exist \u2013 which is why you can see bikinis and beer on Beirut's beaches and black chadors in the city's southern suburbs \u2013 and they know too what happens when communities fall out. Power has always been parcelled out in Lebanon on sectarian lines. Sometimes the system works, but when it breaks down people reach for their guns.</p> <p>As the Middle East goes through an historic transformation, sectarianism is emerging as one of the strongest features in the political landscape. It is not a new phenomenon. The faultline that divides Sunni and Shia Muslims goes back to the dawn of Islam. But it has been sharpened by the events of the last decade, starting with the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p> <p>For societies that are overwhelmed by political uncertainty, with economies that do not provide enough for young populations, sectarianism is a form of friction they don't need. Using and abusing sectarianism is a good way to manipulate, to mobilise, to consolidate power, to spread chaos in the hope of gaining the upper hand.</p> <p>Nationalism had a similar role in Europe in the 20th century. Sectarianism in the Middle East&#xa0;is as divisive, and perhaps potentially as dangerous, as nationalism used to be, and sometimes still is, for Europeans. Arab&#xa0;countries, and Iran, are not \u2013 yet \u2013 as militarised as the Europeans were. This is not a prediction of catastrophe. But dangers, serious ones, lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p>France is planning to send drones into Mali as part of an international intervention to free the west African country from al-Qaida-backed insurgents who control large swaths of its territory, according to reports.</p> <p>A French defence official said the country was moving surveillance drones to the region as part of secretive plans with the US, amid increasing fears that, if left unchecked, the crisis could serve as a launchpad for terrorist attacks on its own soil.</p> <p>Speaking to the Associated Press, the official said on Monday that France was discussing plans with the US for drones, intelligence-gathering and security in Africa's Sahel region. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that Germany would be prepared to train Malian security forces and would consider providing \"material and logistical support\".</p> <p>\"Free democratic states cannot accept international terrorism gaining a safe refuge in the north of the country,\" Merkel said at a German military conference near Berlin. A diplomatic source told the Guardian that the international consensus on the need for a concerted action in Mali was unprecedented.</p> <p>\"I've never seen anything like this level of international co-operation : the United States, the EU \u2013 both collectively and its individual states \u2013 the UN security council, all are in 100% agreement about what we should do here,\" said the source, speaking in Mali's capital, Bamako, on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>\"It is no secret that there is military planning going on. The EU is conducting a scoping mission and looking to send a training team to help train the Malian army. But the French are the nation with the most experience working here, and they see the terrorism threat more acutely than others.\"</p> <p>News of the possible scale of the western intervention comes after the UN security council passed a resolution earlier this month giving the Malian government and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) 45 days to formulate a plan for military action. An ECOWAS source told the Guardian that the governments of Niger, Burkina Faso and Togo had all agreed to contribute to a force to reclaim the north of the country from rebels backed by al-Qaida insurgents who seized power following a coup in March.</p> <p>On Friday a meeting of African and international officials in Bamako saw increasingly belligerent rhetoric, as foreign powers agreed on the urgency of military action in the country.</p> <p>\"The Malian people rely on us to take determined and efficient action, and we must be up to their hopes and expectations,\" UN deputy secretary general, Jan Elias Eliasson, said.</p> <p>\"From the Mali government's perspective, the meeting was a big success,\" a senior security source in the Mali government said. \"The international community came to Mali to discuss our solution with us, and agreed that Mali will be the lead.\"</p> <p>But humanitarian groups expressed concern that plans for military action should consider the wellbeing of the most vulnerable groups.</p> <p>\"Mali is a country whose people are dealing with immense challenges from dire poverty, a food and nutrition crisis, and the political and security crises. We have seen hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, especially women and children,\" said Chance Briggs, national director in Mali of the charity World Vision. \"It would be intolerable to see further pain and suffering heaped on children and their families in Mali. They have enough to deal with in the past few months.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tim Taylor, Advanced skills teacher at Dussindale primary school, Norwich</strong></p> <p>The list is a good one. I might add the following:</p> <p>\u2022 Scrap primary league tables and external marked testing at KS2;</p> <p>\u2022 Keep Ofsted but make it entirely independent of government. I agree with changing the emphasis from judgment to improvement;</p> <p>\u2022 Formation of an independent professional body with a mandate to raise the professional reputation of teaching and to support the research and development of teaching approaches and curriculum learning;</p> <p>\u2022 Make governing bodies smaller and make it mandatory for at least 50% of governors to have a background in education.</p> <p><strong>Jodie Lopez-Collins, Freelance advisory teacher and consultant </strong></p> <p>I think there should be no cap on the standard grade, but things like the A* could be capped so that, say, the top 2% of pupils in the country get A*s. I'm worried about the idea of local partnerships assessing schools because there needs to be accountability at national level to have consistency. But helping to improve needs to be an in-built part of Ofsted. While it may be good to have an independent curriculum and assessment agency without political control, giving public money to a private agency causes more moral dilemmas than it solves.</p> <p><strong>Phil Allman, Head of Olney middle school, Buckinghamshire</strong></p> <p>My recommendation is to stop over-relying on data for the way schools are judged. It obscures the inspection process when it comes to making decisions about how effective a school is. The other key thing for me is if we are going to retain and recruit the right people, then attitudes towards the profession and towards the education system as a whole should be much more positive.</p> <p><strong>Lee Donaghy, Assistant headteacher at Park View school, Birmingham</strong></p> <p>I don't think schools are just judged by the number of pupils achieving [at least] five Cs at 16. That's the very public headline people see, but increasingly schools are having to think a lot more seriously about the progress pupils make elsewhere. Re the idea of an independent curriculum and assessment body, as we have seen with Ofqual, the fact that a body is independent doesn't necessarily mean it will get things right or be separate from political interference. My recommendation is that while we do need structural reform, we need to have an absolute focus on the quality of what happens in the classroom and on investing in teachers' professional development. Too often we send people off on courses. Instead we should be harnessing the resources in school by getting teachers to work together.</p>",
  "<p>Teachers and headteachers could be forgiven for thinking that they get the worst of all worlds: obliged to implement the latest ministerial whims, without having any real influence themselves on policies that directly affect a job they feel passionately about. But could the explosion of social media be about to change all that?</p> <p>The saga of this summer's GCSE results provoked a torrent of online comment and communication among teachers and heads. Now one group \u2013 mostly secondary headteachers \u2013 has come together via the social networking site Twitter to form an embryonic pressure group.</p> <p>In their sights they have the shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg. Their schools may be poles apart in terms of geography and social context, but they are united in their view that an alternative to current education policy is needed fast, and that Labour is the best hope of achieving it.</p> <p>Education writer and <a href=\"https://de.twitter.com/ThatIanGilbert\" title=\"\">blogger Ian Gilbert</a> came up with the idea of translating online activity into something more concrete after reflecting on Twitter's potential for \"social outrage\" \u2013 but also its limits. \"You can give vent in an informed way and find information,\" he explains. \"But you can also sit back in the evening with a glass of wine tweeting and think you have done your bit for society.</p> <p>\"I realised we needed to go further and get together people who have something to say. A strong theme coming through the social media was a frustration with current policy, but also frustration with no alternatives from Labour. We want to put forward the voices of people who know what they are doing. People who are in it for the kids, for the right reasons, to discuss what has and hasn't been good and come up with some concrete alternatives.\"</p> <p>The group \u2013 which has no name yet \u2013 met at the Guardian's offices to discuss their ideas. So what is good in the current landscape? The heads, from a mixture of maintained and academy schools, who were joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geogphil\" title=\"\">Dr Phil Wood</a> from Leicester University's school of education, cite the focus on disadvantaged pupils and the release of data as being the most positive developments.</p> <p>But the positives risk being undermined by too much political interference in curriculum and qualifications, an accountability system focused on an ever narrower range of exams, a continuing divide between vocational and academic qualifications \u2013 Labour's Tech Bacc attracted as much derision from these school leaders as the education secretary's English Baccalaureate Certificates \u2013 and moves towards a norm-referenced qualifications system in which only fixed numbers of students can achieve certain grades.</p> <p>\"We are moving back to a 'sheep and goats system' that will stratify society in terms of attainment and potential,\" said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosMcM\" title=\"\">Ros McMullen</a>, principal of the David Young community academy in Leeds.</p> <p>\"We need to be able to measure improvement and this requires an objective measure where students' attainment is judged against an unmoving standard, not one where only a certain percentage of students are allowed to hit certain grades. People should be talking about this.\"</p> <p>Several clear themes emerged about how an alternative policy might be shaped if Labour was \"brave enough\" to set out something profoundly different \"rather than hang on the coat-tails of the Tories\", said <a href=\"http://johntomsett.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">John Tomsett</a>, a prolific blogger and head of Huntington school in York.</p> <p>At its heart should be a de-politicisation of curriculum and qualifications, an independent body made up of teaching professionals to drive policy in this area, and a radically different approach to assessment and accountability, the heads agreed.</p> <p>Proposed changes to GCSEs were described as \"an inadequate preparation for 21st-century life\" that will only fuel what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=Vic%20Goddard&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">Vic Goddard</a>, headteacher of Passmores academy in Essex, described as a growing tension between \"doing what is right for our school and for our children\".</p> <p>\"What we have to do isn't always the same as what we need to do. We want an acceptance that education is about more than five exams. It is about the full journey and everything else that comes with it.\"</p> <p>A new form of assessment would have to guarantee rigour and high standards, place no caps on aspiration, but also incorporate other non-exam-based measurements that offer the chance for \"success at every level\" \u2013 a particular concern to those in special needs education, who fear that their children will be \"consigned to the scrap heap before they start\", according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewhitaker246/status/217876575247544320\" title=\"\">Dave Whittaker</a>, head of Springwell special school in Barnsley.</p> <p>\"We must be able to celebrate success at every level so that pupils with SEN aren't left without motivation or aspiration. This would mean a holistic view of achievement that can genuinely show progress over time and in context. It is not fair that our pupils' equivalent to the EBacc is a report that says \"never mind, you failed, but please try again sometime\".</p> <p>One suggestion is to move away from exams at 16 towards the International Baccalaureate <a href=\"http://www.ibo.org/programmes/profile/\" title=\"\">learner profile</a>. \"The IB is an internationally highly rated qualification that includes skills and competencies,\" argued Tomsett. \"Our assessment system must move away from pure examinations and towards a blended range of assessments like personal projects, extended essays, oral skills, as well as formal exams. The fact that Labour can only come up with a Tech Bacc in response to the EBacc simply highlights the paucity of their thinking.\"</p> <p>Another theme was Ofsted and its focus on one-off judgments rather than supporting improvement. This, said the school leaders, should be addressed by transferring resources to local school improvement partnerships, and investment in professional development for teachers, allied to a national annual release of all performance data to schools and parents.</p> <p>\"I want to be held accountable locally,\" said Goddard. \"We are publicly funded with the most precious resource in the world \u2013 our children \u2013 but don't just tell me where I am going wrong. I want the people who are holding me to account to be part of the journey of making me better.\"</p> <p>These individuals could be described as being part of what is now called the \"<a href=\"http://www.future-works.com/services/social-media-marketing/magic-middle-blogger-relations/\" title=\"\">magic middle</a>\" in social media. Not celebrities or the political commentariat, but trusted, persuasive experts with years of experience who blog and tweet and have the power to mobilise opinion. In other fields, businesses are trying to woo such people. When it comes to schools policy, are politicians behind the curve?</p> <p>A spokesperson for Stephen Twigg said he would be willing to meet the group's members and described their ideas as \"interesting\". Some, including regional versions of Ofsted, reform of assessment and the 14-19 curriculum, were already being considered by Labour's policy review, he said, adding \"we agree there shouldn't be an artificial cap on aspiration\".</p> <p>Education Guardian will be following the group's progress.</p> <h2>Five-point plan<br></h2> <p>\u2022 Schools should be assessed in a range of ways, not just judged by the numbers achieving five specific grades at 16;</p> <p>\u2022 Ofsted should be replaced by local partnerships that would hold schools to account and help them to improve;</p> <p>\u2022 The curriculum and assessment should be taken out of political control and given to an independent agency (under licence for 20 years);</p> <p>\u2022 The government should encourage small families of local schools in preference to large national chains;</p> <p>\u2022 \"Norm referencing\" in exam grading is not fair, ie capping the number of students who can achieve a certain grade.

  "<p>It was David Cameron's busy day. He started at Wormwood Scrubs prison, ostensibly to kick off his new law 'n' order campaign, though he may also have been checking out the accommodation for News International friends who might one day live there. It's a kindness.</p> <p>At lunchtime he made a speech about the criminal justice system. This is to become \"tough but intelligent\".</p> <p>In keeping with my theory that if the opposite of a remark is plainly ludicrous, then the thing was not worth saying in the first place, this means very little. Does he mean that the previous policy was \"limp but stupid\"? Feeble but demented?</p> <p>Possibly. The prime minister was at the Centre for Social Justice. Its managing director, Christian Guy, said: \"The CSJ was established to put social justice at the heart of British politics!\"</p> <p>I thought, it's never been exactly at the heart of Conservative politics. \"It's very good to see you at our annual dinner dance and raffle, Major. What brings you?\"</p> <p>\"A passionate desire for social justice, Mrs Prendergast and, failing that, a return to flogging and the death penalty.\"</p> <p>As always with a Cameron speech, it starts off with good, concrete ideas \u2013 teach prisoners a trade so they're less likely to reoffend, less bail-skipping etc \u2013 then spirals into vagueness: \"strengthening families, strengthening marriages, encouraging commitment \u2026 \" He loves orotund phrases: a \"rehabilitation revolution\" in our \"aspiration nation\".</p> <p>He was asked about Andrew Mitchell and, you might say, he really got his bike caught in the pedestrian gate. He had demanded more respect for the police, yet had let the ex-chief whip stay for four weeks. What message did that send?</p> <p>\"The message is that if someone does something wrong, they should apologise.\" It would have been \"easy\" to sack Mitchell straight away. But, \"government is about taking the right decision, not the easy decision\". So his indecision was actually a sign that he was tough. Whether this was also intelligent he did not say.</p> <p>Time for a quick lunch then into the Commons for a report on the latest European summit. These days that means being abused in stereo by Ed Miliband and the Tory Eurosceptics.</p> <p>The Labour leader, freshly effective after his conference, used a mixture of sarcasm and scorn. Even our friends in Finland were ruefully reflecting that the UK was leaving Europe. \"Hear, hear!\" some Tory shouted, to Miliband's delight. </p> <p>'Even he can't be happy about losing Finland \u2013 the land of the Helsinki accord, reindeer and the [cartoon] Moomins!</p> <p>\"He goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room, which is just as well, because he normally finds himself in an empty room!\"</p> <p>Various Tories gave notice that a referendum had better not fudge the issue. There should, said the \u00fcber-sceptic Philip Davies, be no \"in or in\" choice. With supporters like him, who needs traitors?</p> <p>Then Labour's Chris Bryant resumed his demand that Cameron release his private communications with Rebekah Wade \u2013 some were \"salacious\" Mr Bryant said. But Dave had skipped off, perhaps to examine more possible prison accommodation for his dear friends.</p>",
  "<p>We're officially over the debate hump \u2013 three down, one to go. What a strange trip it's been. Along the way we've reconnected with our friend Big Bird, revived that old-fangled word \"malarkey!\" and, much to our surprise, been told that professional women can best be found in binders.</p> <p>In all seriousness, we have also learned quite a bit about how these vaunted debates work. Before it's too late and the final presidential match is upon us, we think it's worth taking a look back. Using what we've learned from producing our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">post-debate decoders</a> \u2013 features that track the questions moderators ask and how candidates answer them \u2013 we've penned this quick list.</p> <h2>1. Debates <em>can</em> make a difference</h2> <p>Before the first match of the 2012 season, there was an outpouring of opinion on how debates \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/presidential-debate-myth-gamechanger\">aren't game-changers</a>\" and that they \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/03/what-political-scientists-know-about-debates/\">don't really matter</a>\". But then Romney went and unexpectedly won the first debate, and the crowds went wild \u2013 or at least the media did.</p> <p>That first match \u2013 which was watched by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-67-million-people-watch-first-obama-romney-debate-20121004,0,7322457.story\">67.2 million people</a> around the country \u2013 gave Romney a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/pew-research-poll-bombshell\">four-point bump in the polls</a>, a dramatic swing. How much of that bonus can be chalked up to his performance, and how much to the flood of media chatter is another question entirely, but the bottom line: debates can matter.</p> <h2>2. Only 17 questions have so far been asked of the next president</h2> <p>It's been an eternity since the first presidential debate of this election cycle \u2013 or at least it seems like one. Yet, only 17 questions (not including follow-ups) have been asked of the presidential candidates so far, and nearly two-thirds of them came from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Tuesday's town hall</a>. </p> <p>Jim Lehrer, for his part, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder\">asked only six questions</a> in the first debate, and those covered just four topics: the economy, healthcare, the role of government, and \"governing\", as he broke it down. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/foreign-policy-debate-topics-138341.html\">Another six questions are expected to come out of the final debate</a>. </p> <p>The town hall format did better. Besides asking more questions overall, audience members' phrasing was more personal and more unexpected. Questions included one on gun rights, one on immigration, and one on women's rights in the workplace.</p> <p>The final question count should be 23, if we take tonight's upcoming debate into account, and that seems meager \u2013 especially since candidates don't always even answer them. </p> <h2>3. Questions on domestic policy have outplayed foreign</h2> <p>Over two presidential debates so far, 16 questions have been asked about domestic policy, and one exclusively on foreign. Another six foreign policy questions should come out of the final debate. </p> <p>Since the first and last debates are dedicated to domestic and foreign policy respectively \u2013 with the same number of questions in each \u2013 it's the second debate, the town hall, that can tip the equation towards domestic or foreign issues. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Out of the 11 questions asked during the town hall debate</a> on Tuesday night, only one \u2013 on the recent controversy over the Benghazi attacks \u2013 was squarely focused on foreign policy. The other 10 covered domestic issues, from gun rights to immigration to jobs and taxes.</p> <p>In an election that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/10/this-one-economic-indicator-not-the-debates-might-decide-the-election/263260/\">remains tightly tied to the state of the economy</a>, it may come as little surprise that it was the most talked about issue of the two presidential debates so far. In fact, the subject was dedicated three questions in each debate \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder\">vice-presidential match-up</a>. That's the most question any one category was allotted by a wide margin. Subtopics included jobs, entitlements, taxes, and more.</p> <h2>4. Attacks take up most of the candidates' time \u2013 and ours</h2> <p>\"Attack dog\" may traditionally be the VP candidate's role, but we found that Romney and Obama weren't averse to some mudslinging of their own. In the first debate we saw the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">president clock in 11 jabs to Romney's 16</a>. The town hall setting of the second debate should have arguably been less attack-friendly since the candidates have to answer real audience members in real time, but that wasn't the case. </p> <p>Both Romney and Obama about doubled their attack counts this Tuesday: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">Obama coming in with 27 hits and Romney with 25</a>. The veeps took their attacking seriously too, each putting in a whopping 30+ individual attacks during their first and only showdown. </p> <h2>5. The candidates have been light on details</h2> <p>Martha Raddatz pushed the two VP candidates for \"specifics\" many times during the vice-presidential debate \u2013 but her performance turned out to be more of an exception than a rule. In the second presidential match, Candy Crowley's follow-ups were more clear and forceful than Lehrer's in the first as she attempted to get at nuances between the candidates. But the challenges to provide detailed plans largely came from the candidates themselves in the form of attacks \u2013 though these arguments hardly made up for the lack of \"specifics\" we got from both sides.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ezraklein/posts/165161553607752\">The Washington Post's Ezra Klein posted to Facebook</a> that we shouldn't interpret Obama's vague responses to mean that he doesn't have a plan for a second term. \"It's just a hard one to campaign on,\" he wrote. \"After promising in 2008 to bring about a new era of co-operation in Washington, they're campaigning in 2012 knowing that, if re-elected, they will start their second term with a brutal, economy-shaking showdown with Republicans over spending and taxes.\"</p> <h2>6. No one is really in charge </h2> <p>Presidential debates are presented as almost platonic models of the democratic process \u2013 with clear-cut rules and processes. The debate commission sets the stage (both figuratively and literally) \u2013 making sure the candidates arrive, shake hands, exchange ideas, and the moderator gives them a slap on the wrist if they get out of line. In the end, one of the two men on stage is declared the winner. That's how it works theoretically. In reality, each and every debate is an ongoing negotiation among the moderators, debate commission, campaigns and candidates. </p> <p>Just take look at the moderators: the three so far \u2013 Lehrer and Crowley in presidential and Raddatz in the VP debate \u2013 have delivered very different performances. Lehrer was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#talk\">largely criticised</a> for his light-handedness with the candidates. Raddatz's more forceful push for \"specifics\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder#talk\">earned her quite a bit of praise</a>. Crowley fell somewhere in between. She suffered many interruptions by an aggressive Romney and Obama, but kept on fighting to keep pace. She also made headlines with a live fact-check, though this move received mixed reviews. But no matter how any of the moderators did, all three seem to struggle with the same problem: it's hard to establish and keep control, especially since no one really has to play by the rules.</p> <p>The irony, is, of course, that the candidates sign off to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/110073567?access_key=key-22or579qflh51vnl1a09\">the commission's debate rules</a>, which include taking turns to answer a question rather than interrupting, and not asking each other direct questions. </p> <p>The moderators, topics, and locations are decided by the campaigns in advance of the debates. Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">official debate memorandum</a> obtained by Time's Mark Halperin. On page eight is where the campaigns agreed that during the 16 October debate the moderator should not ask follow-up questions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/us-presidential-debates-us-elections-2012-candy-crowley-obama-romney\">As Jay Rosen put it</a> in a recent piece for the Guardian: \"No one is really in charge of the presidential debates. The situation is in charge.\"</p>",
  "<p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has lambasted the country's judiciary for not allowing him to visit Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where his media adviser is currently held behind bars.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad on Monday wrote an unprecedented letter to Sadeq Larijani, the head of the judicial system, protesting that his constitutional right and duty required him to inspect the prison although officials have signalled he would not be welcome.</p> <p>The letter, published on the president's government website, disclosed that Larijani had previously dispatched a \"top secret\" communique, warning that the request to visit Evin was not in the best interests of the country.</p> <p>Evin, situated in the north of the Iranian capital, is home to the country's many political prisoners as well as some of its most respected human rights activists and journalists, including the prominent lawyer Nasrin Sotodueh.</p> <p>At the time of the Islamic revolution in 1979, Iranian revolutionaries who seized Evin vowed to convert it into a museum to show the injustice under the late Shah, unaware that it was soon to be re-opened and used as a notorious prison where thousands of leftwingers were massacred in the 1980s.</p> <p>\"You have twice insisted that inspecting Evin prison is not in the best interests of the country and you have said that you disapprove of it,\" he wrote. \"But the constitution does not require any permission or approval from the judiciary for the president in administering his legal duties.\"</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's opponents in the parliament and the judiciary have speculated that the president intended to visit Evin in order to highlight the case of his close ally and top aide Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who is serving a six-month prison term there.</p> <p>Javanfekr was put on trial last year as the publisher of \"materials contrary to Islamic norms\", a reference to a series of articles about the chador, the full-length cloak worn by Iranian women.</p> <p>He was arrested in late September while Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly in New York, a sign that the president's influence over Iranian politics is dwindling.</p> <p>In his letter, Ahmadinejad insinuated that his visit was not aimed at meeting Javanfekr but to make sure the law was being justly administered by prison officials.</p> <p>\"How come that administering the constitution is not in the best interests of the country?\" he asked. \"If that kind of view prevails in the judiciary, can't we assume that some of the constitutional laws and basic human rights are being violated or neglected \u2013 or sacrificed for the best interests of individuals in the judiciary?</p> <p>\"In a situation where the president, who is the representative of the people and administrator of the law, is being so easily accused by you, how can people of this country, who have no supporter except God, make sure they have judicial security?\"</p> <p>In recent years, Evin has also been frequented by many people who are or were working for the regime, including the son and daughter of the former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who were arrested in September. In Evin, Javanfekr and a number of the president's allies are kept not far from many opposition protesters who were arrested in the aftermath of the country's 2009 disputed presidential election which saw Ahmadinejad taking the office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud.</p> <p>It is the first time Ahmadinejad has used such a strongly worded statement against the country's judiciary, which is one of Iran's main political institutions along with the parliament and the presidency.</p> <p>Some activists said it was hypocritical of Ahmadinejad not to have requested such a visit in 2009, amid allegations that prisoners faced torture. However, Ali Motahari, an influential MP and an outspoken critic of the president, said that he should be allowed to inspect Evin, urging him to meet other prisoners, too.</p> <p>On Sunday, Iran's prosecutor general, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, embarrassed Ahmadinejad in public by saying that he could not go to Evin.</p> <p>\"We must pay attention to major issues \u2026 Visiting a prison in these circumstances is a minor issue,\" he said, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. \"If we have in mind the best interests of the nation, a [prison] visit in these circumstances is not appropriate.\"</p> <p>The row is seen as the latest setback for Ahmadinejad and his team in an extraordinary power struggle at the top of the Iranian regime between conservatives close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and those supporting the president.</p> <p>In light of the setbacks, Ahmadinejad has lost a great deal of his influence, becoming increasingly marginalised, with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime's problems.</p>",
  "<p>DNA samples have confirmed that the man killed in a shootout with Mexican marines earlier this month and whose body was removed from a funeral home the following day was Heriberto Lazcano, the head of the Zetas drug cartel, a senior US diplomat said on Monday.</p> <p>Mexico said it intends to exhume the druglord's parents to verify the genetic match, but William Brownfield, the US state department's top drug policy official, said Washington was already sure that the dead man was Lazcano, and that his killing reflected the Zetas cartel's implosion and a possible turning point in the war on drugs in Mexico.</p> <p>\"We know they got this guy because they were able to pull enough DNA off the body before the body was retrieved from the funeral home where it was obviously not carefully secured,\" ambassador Brownfield, the US assistant secretary of state for the bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, told the Guardian during a visit to London. \"So there is near 100% certainty that he is gone.\"</p> <p>\"The Zetas are on the run,\" Brownfield said. \"They are being pounded by the Mexican government which has devoted a lot of attention to the Zetas because, among organisations that are incredibly vicious and bloody the Zetas are probably the worst of them.</p> <p>\"Second, the Zetas are being devoured by the two other principal cartels, the Gulf cartel and the Sinaloa cartel who, in a marriage from hell, have got together to decimate the Zetas.\"</p> <p>Brownfield said that as a consequence of this two-sided assault, the most formidable narcotics organisation in Mexico, is now in its death throes.</p> <p>\"I lived through this with the Medellin and the Cali cartels and I think I know what the death throttle of a dying drug cartel sounds like, and it sounds like indiscriminate killing and ... a decapitation of your command and control so 19 year-old kids with virtually no education whatsoever are making decisions. It sounds like parts of the organisation turning on other parts of the organisation,\" the US diplomat said.</p> <p>Brownfield, a long-serving ambassador in Latin America, predicted that a rival cartel would now wrest the Zetas' dominant position in the drugs trade, and that US and Mexican policy would then be to target the usurper, and so on, until the trafficking gangs were forced elsewhere.</p> <p>\"You take them down one by one. You don't try to take on all organised crime at the same time and you whittle them down until the target has been neutralised and to a large extent killed off by fellow criminals. And then you pick your next target and you do that two or three times and then eventually the law of market economics come into play and the criminal organisation says [this is getting] really expensive \u2026 and they say let's go do business somewhere else,\" Brownfield said.</p> <p>\"That is when Mexico will become a much more peaceful and livable country. My own view is we are already crossed the point of return. It will probably be two years before we know for sure, but my own view is that we hit that turning point during the course of this year in Mexico.\" He said that cocaine consumption in the US had dropped 40% over the six years and Colombian cocaine production has dropped by more than a half over roughly the same period.</p> <p>Adam Isacson, of the independent Washington Office on Latin America agreed that the drug wars were becoming less bloody but cautioned that the flow of drugs northwards has been largely unaffected, with marijuana and heroin taking the place of cocaine as American tastes change. \"The violence statistics are beginning to go down and in a few years they may be substantially down, but I would be surprised if the flow of drugs through Mexico are very different from what they are now..</p> <p>\"What is happening is that you are seeing less violence often through the different configuration of the cartels who are choosing to go about their business in a different way. It is a grim grinding war of attrition, but it shows you can change the cartels' behaviour to be more pacific, more discreet, using bribery for example more than violence.\"</p> <p>Colombia still supplies the overwhelming bulk of cocaine bound for the US. Most is flown out through Honduras, from where it is sent on by river and road through Mexico, making the country's lawless northern jungle the new front in the drug war.</p> <p>Brownfield compared the battle to close the flow of drugs into the US to squeezing a balloon. \"In 2000, we squeezed the balloon hard in Colombia. One impact thereof was to push trafficking organisations to move their operations to Mexico.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, we began to squeeze that balloon hard in Mexico and the logical result is a transfer of their operational bases to Central America. Beginning this year we are beginning to squeeze pretty hard in the northern triangle of Central America: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.\"</p> <p>Brownfield said that pilot schemes in Guatemala and Honduras, in which community aid and police support are focused on \"model precincts\" had been proven to be effective. But US joint operations in Honduras have been suspended after the Honduran air force shot down two small planes, and US counter-narcotics agents got involved in firefights in which civilians were alleged to have been killed. \"They jumped out of the gate a bit fast and now they have had to put it on hold,\" Isacson said.</p> <p>Brownfield said: \"I agree it takes time. At the end of the day the one thing I would suggest is: we don't have to create paradise in Central America to drive the traffickers away. We only have to increase their costs of doing business by about 10% and at that stage the law of market economics takes over and they'll move their business away.\"</p>",

  "<p>On 18 June 1984, dressed in T-shirt, jeans and plimsolls, I ran breathlessly up the steep hill, my 21-year-old son in front of me, the pounding hooves of horses carrying police officers wearing riot gear close behind me and getting closer. I was aware that many of my fellow mineworkers had already been battered to the ground, where they were ferociously beaten by other officers on foot.</p> <p>It was the scene of a running battle between a highly trained and disciplined police force out of control and coal miners striking to save their industry, jobs and way of life. This was not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Naseby\" title=\"\">Naseby</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bosworth_Field\" title=\"\">Bosworth</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Towton\" title=\"\">Towton</a>; it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/21/hillsborough-investigation-extend-orgreave-miners\" title=\"\">Orgreave coking plant</a>, near Sheffield. It was a glorious English summer's day and yet it felt like civil war.</p> <p>Once at the top of the hill we found refuge in a supermarket. Some residents in the village opened their doors to allow miners to escape from the galloping horses, but there were instances of police on horseback following them into the homes of those trying to help.</p> <p>Was I terrified? Of course I was. The actions of the police at Orgreave were far from proportionate.</p> <p>Following the Hillsborough inquiry I have called for an investigation into the actions of the police during the miners' strike. To my certain knowledge there was widespread telephone tapping. There were, in my view, malicious arrests and prosecutions of many miners. The worst examples were charges of riot brought against a number of miners who were later acquitted \u2013 had they been found guilty, they could have faced lengthy spells in prison, up to and including life sentences.</p> <p>The cases collapsed because of unreliable police evidence. During the trial it came to light that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/18/turningbacktime\" title=\"\">BBC had reversed footage of scenes at Orgreave</a> to give the impression that miners were responsible for starting violent scenes, when in fact it was the police that had instigated the violence.</p> <p>Once again, as with Hillsborough, police officers are apparently confessing that they were instructed to fabricate statements in connection with Orgreave and the policing of the miners' strike. I see no difference between that and attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>We need to know to what extent agent provocateurs were used by the authorities at Orgreave and who authorised it. Two miners, David Jones and Joe Green, were killed in suspicious circumstances on the picket lines during the strike. We need to know if those deaths were ever properly investigated. If not, we deserve to be told why not.</p> <p>Orgreave will be remembered in the history of working class struggle for those who fought valiantly for their industry, jobs and communities. It was a terrifying experience, but I was proud to have been there.</p>",
  "<p>The banners, flags and T-shirts \u2013 Women for Obama, Hispanics for Obama, LBTG for Obama \u2013 plaster Democratic campaign offices in the hard fought swing state of Florida, just as in 2008. What's missing this time is the people.</p> <p>Four years ago Barack Obama's campaign was flooded by volunteers \u2013 the young in particular \u2013 excited by his vision of remaking America, and by the prospect of putting an African American in the White House. Now active support in Florida is visibly more sparse, and it may prove decisive as Democrats struggle to claw back the state from Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"This election's not as inspirational as the last one was,\" said Robert Obry, deputy field organiser at a near deserted Obama campaign office in Ybor City, a historic Tampa neighbourhood popular for its bars, music and cigars. \"This one is more about straight politics. Even my grandmother, who is a Republican, voted for Obama last time which kind of blew my mind. This time she's not voting for him because she says not enough has changed.\"</p> <p>That kind of thinking crosses generations and is a problem for the president. But it's particularly significant as the Obama campaign throws its energies in Florida into getting out the vote \u2013 the \"ground game\" for which it was famed in 2008. </p> <p>A month ago, Obama was comfortably ahead in Florida by as much as five points. After the president's disastrous performance in the first debate, Romney surged ahead by seven points in one poll. Two weekend opinion polls showed Romney just one point ahead, on 49%.</p> <p>Other polls show women, Latinos and the elderly in Florida more or less evenly divided between the two presidential candidates with Romney picking up support because of concern about jobs.</p> <h2>Under-30 voters: 'They're not there now'</h2> <p>The one group that has remained consistently strong in backing the president is 18- to 29-year-olds. They accounted for 15% of the electorate in 2008 and voted two to one in favour of Obama \u2013 far ahead of any other group.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.marconews.com/news/2012/oct/21/daily-news-scripps-poll-romney-obama-dead-heat-/\">Naples Daily News/Scripps poll released on Sunday</a> showed voters under 30 continuing to support Obama by the same margin. The Democrats' challenge is to get the young to vote at all.</p> <p>Susan MacManus, a former chair of the Florida elections commission and University of South Florida professor of political science, said that turn out by people under 30 is likely to be decisive in deciding who wins the state, and the signs are not good for Obama.</p> <p>\"Part of the '08 experience for young voters was communal: we can elect a black president, we can break one of the biggest barriers in America. And we can do it by all of us piling into these campaign offices and working 18 hours a day for a pizza and a beer occasionally. They're not there now,\" she said.</p> <p>The president and first lady have campaigned at Florida university campuses to woo younger voters, impressing upon them the importance of getting to the ballot box. Florida Democrats are emphasising Obama's promise of lower interest rates on student loans, the healthcare law that allows young people to remain on their parents' insurance longer, and social issues such as gay marriage in drawing a distinction with Romney. The Democrats have poured energy into registering voters in colleges across the state and encouraging early voting which begins eight days before the election.</p> <p>Yet MacManus said that among her students she sees a stark contrast in attitude toward the election after Obama's message of hope and change four years ago gave way to emphasising fears of what will happen under a Romney presidency.</p> <p>\"From what I'm hearing from a lot of the college students, they're offended by these two guys having what looks like a street brawl. They don't even want to listen to it,\" she said. \"Can the Democrats find a way to break through all of the negatives in the ads, all the negatives in the debates, break through to the two groups of voters that are leaning in their direction but are getting very alienated by the negativity \u2013 and that's young voters, especially college students, and women voters? I don't know.\"</p> <p>Getting the young to vote is even more important in the numbers game because many conservatives who stayed away from the polls in 2008 because they were unhappy with John McCain as the Republican candidate are now fired up by a determination to get rid of Obama.</p> <p>Matty Budesa, president of the FSU college Democrats group, said she does not see a drop off in enthusiasm among young voters but she does recognise that the campaign is very different from 2008.</p> <p>\"A lot of people were fired up for that election. It's not necessarily not as passionate this time, but maybe people don't want to care about it as much because it's sort of a scary thought,\" she said. \"Young people really see what's at stake this time just because there are a lot of differences between the candidates as far as their views on issues young people care about: gay marriage, family planning, obviously different federal funding issues, the cost of education.\"</p> <p>Budesa said part of the Democratic strategy this time is not to emphasise that their vote can change the world so much as preserve what Obama has achieved.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of people telling them this election very much depends on you and this isn't the time to not be excited. This is the time to really step up,\" she said.</p> <h2>'I can't say I'm very excited about Obama anymore'</h2> <p>Around the corner from the Ybor City campaign office, younger voters were not enthused.</p> <p>\"If I vote, I'll vote Obama,\" said Michael Foster, a 25-year-old recent graduate with no job. \"But probably I won't vote. I can't say I'm very excited about Obama anymore.\"</p> <p>Why not?</p> <p>\"I don't hear him talking about our future. It's all for old people. Medicare, that kind of stuff. I really don't know who's going to be better for me to find a job. I thought it was Obama but I don't know,\" he said. \"We all believed Obama would change this country. He's done some good stuff but the country hasn't really changed. It's the same shit.\"</p> <p>Aaron D'Souza, an Obama campaign volunteer at the Ybor City office from London, said the ambivalence toward the election may also reflect complacency.</p> <p>\"The lack of energy might be because people thought Obama had it in the bag, especially after Romney's 47% comment,\" he said. \"Now they know it's not.\"</p> <p>The Democrats boast that with 102 campaign offices in Florida they have more than twice as many as the Republicans. Obry said the volunteers are still coming to the Ybor City office. But their numbers across the Tampa area are evidently down. </p> <p>The Republicans have noticed it, too.</p> <p>\"The evidence of Obama is so sparse this time compared to four years ago,\" said Art Wood, chair of the Hillsborough county Republican party, which includes Tampa. \"We started street corner sign waving a couple of months ago. Four years ago we often had Obama supporters on the other corner. I've yet to see a single Obama sign waver. We're up to three or four times a week in different parts of the city and not a single Obama sign waver.\"</p> <p>One of Obama's campaign press secretaries, Jen Psaki, last week denied rumours flying around the Republican team that the Democrats are diverting money and resources from Florida and two other battleground states, North Carolina and Virginia, in order to focus the president's bid for re-election on winning Ohio and three other close states where he is still ahead in opinion polls \u2013 Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire \u2013 which would be enough to put him back in the White House.</p> <p>Psaka said the Obama campaign was \"absolutely not\" pulling back.</p> <p>\"We're still going to run in every state like we're five points behind,\" she said.</p> <h2>Signs of hope in early voting</h2> <p>Democrats in Florida have some reasons for optimism. Their campaign to get supporters to vote early shows signs of paying off.</p> <p>Republicans have traditionally led the way in Florida in supporters voting by mail but the numbers this year show that the Democrats have eaten into that advantage.</p> <p>About 2.2 million people in Florida have requested absentee ballots \u2013 a 37% leap on 2008. About 42% of the requests came from registered Republicans while 39% were from Democrats. Four years ago, the gap was 14 points in favour of Republicans.</p> <p>Of 275,000 absentee ballots already returned to election offices by mid-October, 44% came from registered Republicans while 40% were from Democrats.</p> <p>In 2008, Republicans were 17 points ahead at a similar stage.</p> <p>The Obama campaign director in Florida, Ashley Walker, latched on to those gains in an email to twitchy activists last week.</p> <p>\"In 2008, Republicans built up a huge advantage in vote-by-mail which Democrats obliterated during in-person early vote to win the state by 3 percentage points. In 2012, Republicans have a much more difficult task ahead since they have already ceded two-thirds of the vote-by-mail advantage they started with four years ago,\" she said in the message.</p> <p>Republicans acknowledge that could be a problem for them, although they say they are concerned not alarmed.</p> <p>Republicans also point to a fall in the number of registered Democrats in Florida which has dropped by more than 94,000 to about 4.6 million. But that still puts the party ahead of the Republicans on 4.2 million.</p> <p>The Democrats' problem is that the previous experience shows that older people are much more likely to vote, and the older they are the more likely they are to vote Republican.</p> <p>Alongside trying to get the young out to vote, the Obama campaign is trying to woo \u2013 some might say scare \u2013 older swing voters. The vice-president, Joe Biden, descended on the Sun City Center retirement community of about 19,000 people south of Tampa on Friday. John McCain took 60% of the vote there in 2008.</p> <p>The local hall was packed, with lines of golf carts residents use to get around the streets on specially marked lanes parked outside.</p> <p>Biden, too, emphasised early voting. But the core message was that a Romney presidency will be a financial disaster for the elderly, not least over healthcare.</p> <p>\"This is not your father's Republican party. This is not even Mitt Romney's father's Republican party,\" said Biden.</p> <p>Ellen Harris, who retired to Florida from Pennsylvania, liked the message. But she acknowledge that it may not be having much effect on Florida's elderly voters.</p> <p>\"It seems really weird to us here that more people wouldn't lean left on Medicare after all that crazy Republican primary stuff. Too many people watch Fox News,\" she said</p> <p>Harris said the Republicans appear to be running a more efficient campaign on the ground among the elderly.</p> <p>\"We get four or five flyers a day from the Republicans or their supporters like the NRA. We hardly get anything from the Democrats,\" she said. \"There's a lot of robocalls, too, mostly Republican.\"</p>",

He may not have an alias, but like Volpe he's in his early 20s and much in demand by rappers who fancy a little woozy/hazy with a side order of slurry/blurred (he's even got a track called Slurring that sounds like someone ODing on cough syrup). So far Main Attrakionz, Shady Blaze and Deniro Farrar have called upon his services while Grimes, Frank Ocean and the brilliant Danny Brown have been spreading the word.</p> <p>And the word is: chill-trap, a term we've seen used at least once to describe Hemsworth's fusion of chillwave and <a href=\"http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Trap+Rap\" title=\"Trap Rap\">\"trap\" rap</a>. Some of the tracks on his Last Words EP, such as <a href=\"http://youtu.be/g2urepI_Dgs\">Overthinking</a>, are prettily ambient, with a psychedelic vigour worthy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/asap-rocky\">A$AP Rocky</a>'s Peso. Others such as <a href=\"http://youtu.be/ProFcgQFICc\">The Happy Mask Shop</a>, with its choral samples, have a spiritual heft that suggest Hemsworth takes this stuff as seriously as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/dj-shadow\">DJ Shadow</a>, who spoke recently about (t)his brand of musical collaging in religious terms.</p> <p>Not that Hemsworth is going to be spending too much time in church: his ideal musical partners include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/02/new-band-danny-brown\" title=\"New band of the day Danny Brown (No 1,241)\">Danny Brown</a>, one of our favourite new rappers of the last couple of years and a man with <a href=\"http://rapgenius.com/Danny-brown-pac-blood-lyrics\" title=\"Danny Brown  Pac Blood Lyrics \">novel things to say about the pope</a>. We'd pay good money to hear what effect Hemsworth's box of tricks would have on the surrealist Detroit rapper's <a href=\"http://youtu.be/X9vT2hV8_PQ\">Pac Blood</a>.</p> <p>Hemsworth grew up playing video games and watching horror movies, and \u2013 according to <a href=\"http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/19/new-talent-ryan-hemsworth-and-the-eternal-quest-for-truth-and-art/\">an interview with Fact Mag</a> \u2013 he says he searches through \"weird music and soundtrack blogs\" for inspiration. He wants to be free to variously \"tackle a soundtrack for a movie, make a song for a pop singer and then a 'chune' to play out in the club\". He cites as influences <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/aug/13/hudson-mohawke-interview-satin-panthers\">Hudson Mohawke</a> \u2013 one of the most acclaimed recent exponents of the mad mosaic \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/11/aphex-twin-review\">Aphex Twin</a>: you can hear elements of the latter's seminal Selected Ambient Works 85-92 in the production of Last Words. He's also as into <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/radiohead\" title=\"the alternative rock band\">Radiohead</a> as he is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/wutangclan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Wu-Tang Clan\">the Wu-Tang Clan</a>. \"I heard the voice of Ol' Dirty Bastard,\" he recalls, \"and knew what I needed to know as an adolescent on his search for truth and art,\" he said to Fact Mag.</p> <p>A former singer and guitarist in a rock band, Hemsworth refuses to be hemmed in. His first release, <a href=\"http://ryanhemsworth.bandcamp.com/album/no-plans\" title=\"the album\">No Plans</a>, was featured in Spin magazine's Top 20 R&amp;B albums of 2011. He's prolific, too: he quickly followed up that 12-track collection of divinely sludgy, chopped and screwed soul and R&amp;B concrete with A Way and <a href=\"http://ryanhemsworth.bandcamp.com/album/kitsch-genius\" title=\"Kitsch Genius\">Kitsch Genius</a>, both of which are completely different again. Then he worked on the Hyperbolic Chamber Music, a collaborative project with NYC clothing brand Mishka that saw him helming a 22-minute cut featuring 26 different rappers from across America. Now there's Last Words, an EP of instrumentals that is bound to be anything but his final \"utterance\". \"I'm trying to put a whole bunch of feelings into under 25 minutes,\" he says, \"in a way that can work in the club, bedroom, car, or wherever it's listened to. That's what I want, a bit of everything.

  "<p>There is much for the visitor to enjoy: turquoise water, sandy beaches, good surf not too far away, a fine golf course, cafes, restaurants, boutiques \u2013 and a bakery that serves excellent pasties.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the village of Rock (so-called because of the old quarry that now serves as a car park) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/22/cornwall-revealed-second-homes-hotspot\" title=\"\">is so popular with second homeowners</a>.</p> <p>Stroll around the village \u2013 a ferry ride away from the foodie mecca of Padstow \u2013 and you could be forgiven for thinking that Britain is booming rather than gripped by recession.</p> <p>The shops are busy, the Blue Tomato cafe is full and builders are busying away on the few scraps of undeveloped land.</p> <p>A glimpse at the <a href=\"http://www.johnbraysales.co.uk\" title=\"\">website of estate agent John Bray</a> reveals only three properties advertised for less than \u00a3250,000, the most reasonable a two-bedroomed flat in the nearby fishing village of Port Isaac (where the Martin Clunes comedy-drama Doc Martin is filmed) up for sale for \u00a3169,500.</p> <p>In contrast, there are 11 properties on the website priced at more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>Bray also manages no fewer than 276 holiday cottages in and around Rock and Port Isaac. Even in mid November Quay Cottage on the front at Rock costs \u00a3500-a-week to rent. Good for those with money to invest or spend on nice holidays, not so good for local people.</p> <p>With average wages in Cornwall only just scraping above \u00a320,000, it is very difficult for people born here to stay.</p> <p>Young people wanting to get a foot on the property ladder have to move inland or even out of Cornwall.</p> <p>Cornwall council, led by a coalition of Conservatives and Independents, is trying to address the problem. Last year it called on the government to bring in new legislation to remove the council tax discount on second homes.</p> <p>It says there are around 13,500 properties registered as second homes in Cornwall, and cancelling the discount would provide an additional \u00a31.6m, which could be used to provide homes for local people.</p> <p>One of the key policies of <a href=\"http://www.mebyonkernow.org\" title=\"\">Mebyon Kernow</a>, the political party campaigning for self-government for Cornwall, is to introduce planning restrictions to \"stop and then reverse the spread of second 'homes'\" \u2013 the inverted commas around homes are significant. The argument is that most of these bolt-holes are not \"homes\" at all.</p> <p>In Rock there is a scheme to try to provide homes for local people \u2013 a shiny new collection of houses on Dingle's Way. Here a community land trust was formed and with the help of an interest-free council loan a group of people, all with strong local connections, self-built their bungalows for \u00a380,000 each, a fraction of what such a building would cost on the open market. But such success stories are rare.</p> <p>The argument against second home owners was <a href=\"http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Author-deluded-thinks-second-homes-good/story-16439105-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">passionately summed up by Western Morning News reporter Simon Parker</a> in response to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2179061/Farewell-Cornwall-I-love-After-16-summers-sandy-sarnies-glorious-clifftop-walks-AN-WILSON-selling-Cornish-home.html\" title=\"\">a piece AN Wilson wrote in the Daily Mail this summer about giving up his second home in Port Isaac</a>.</p> <p>Wilson wrote that he \"used to agonise about being one of those who had wrecked the character and economy of the old place\" but came to the conclusion that the money tourists brought in was crucial to the far south-west of Britain. Parker was unimpressed: \"By purchasing a property in a village, holidaying there a couple of times a year, and thereby transforming that village into a playground of the rich, these leeches suck the heart out of communities.\"</p>",

Click here to view</a></p> <p>On 29 April 1986, three days after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Reactor Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station went into meltdown and exploded</a>, Vladimir Shevchenko gained access to the site and filmed the ongoing disaster. He shot some of his film from a helicopter, passing directly over the burning reactor. Viewing his footage later, Shevchenko discovered that portions of it were seriously degraded. At first he thought the film stock was faulty; it turned out that the aberrant flashes and blips, and the static on the soundtrack, were the invisible crackles of radiation itself, made visible on the photographic emulsion. Those who were at Chernobyl at the time said that they could feel the radiation, like pins and needles on their skin.</p> <p>Shevchenko, along with the film and the 35mm Konvas Avtomat camera he used, had all been irradiated. The Ukrainian film-maker died a year later, and his camera is now sealed in a lead-lined casket at a storage facility outside Kiev. Chernobyl's reactor is itself entombed in its own sarcophagus. Shevchenko's film, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCcutzXzYg\" title=\"\">Chernobyl: A&#xa0;Chronicle of Difficult Weeks</a>, has since been described as the most dangerous roll of film in the world. It is now showing on a monitor <a href=\"http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whatson/exhibitions/jane-and-louise-wilson/\" title=\"\">at the Whitworth Art Gallery in Manchester</a>, alongside Jane and Louise Wilson's most recent film installation, The Toxic Camera. This focuses on Shevchenko's story, and takes us to the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, as well as to the strange, brutal, abandoned military structures that stand on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/08/untrue-island-orford-ness-macfarlane\" title=\"\">Orford Ness in Suffolk</a>, where, during the 1950s and 60s, Britain's H-bombs, minus their atomic payloads, were tested to ensure they wouldn't go off or shake themselves to pieces before they reached their intended targets.</p> <p>The Toxic Camera features interviews with Shevchenko's surviving colleagues, as well as a great deal of atmospheric and sometimes moving incident. The camera glides, rises and falls. It is a witness and guide, leading you on and detaining you. It rises over a structure that once contained a cyclotron at Orford; it skates over dead mud and pebbles. It gets sidetracked, stopping at a snail's shell, at the torn end of a pipe, a boy's face, a curl of rusted razorwire, apples falling to the ground to rot in an orchard in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. A man buries his head in a tangle of bright foliage. He&#xa0;might be crying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400863513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/22/1350917686574/Jane-and-Louise-Wilson----010.jpg\" alt=\"Jane and Louise Wilson - Toxic Camera\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grim grandeur ... a still from Toxic Camera by Jane and Louise Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Wilsons' work is more than just a film. Here is a black, bronze-cast replica of Shevchenko's camera, pointing blindly from its concrete plinth at a measuring stick which, reaching like an antenna towards the ceiling, disappears into the gallery's double-height gloom. More measuring sticks appear in and among the Wilsons' photographs, like divining rods calibrated with chequerboard markings and stripes. They measure nothing, just as the bronze camera sees&#xa0;nothing.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, I visited Orford Ness with the artists. It is one of the strangest, most haunting places I have ever been. Bunkers and concrete pagodas dot this island of shingle and wetland on the Suffolk coast. Radar was developed here during the second world war, and other secret, experimental work went on in the now decaying buildings. The Wilsons had installed their yardsticks in various places, in sub-basements and buildings without roofs, open to the weather, and amplified the ambient sounds of wind and metal that echo through the&#xa0;buildings.</p> <p>Orford feels like the end of the world, a place of grim grandeur and melancholy. The cranes of Felixstowe docks rise to the south. Sizewell nuclear power station dominates the horizon to the north. One place leads to another, Orford to Chernobyl. Journeys to forgotten spaces and liminal zones have been the subject of the Wilsons' work since the beginnings of their joint career, in the early 1990s. The sisters have taken us <a href=\"https://www.frieze.com/issue/article/beside_themselves/\" title=\"\">from Kings Cross bedsits</a> to the abandoned Stasi headquarters in Berlin, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/feb/23/daoud-hamdani-star-city-another-view\" title=\"\">a Russian cosmonaut training centre</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2003/sep/16/1\" title=\"\">a graffitied modernist folly in Peterlee new town</a>. At the Whitworth, they also show us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/26/inside-chernobyl-control-room\" title=\"\">the abandoned Soviet city of Pripyat</a>, near Chernobyl. Here is a ruined classroom and an abandoned, rotting library. Here is civilisation in ruins.</p> <p>In a second, 2011 film installation, with text by Eyal Weizman (and Shumon Basar), Face Scripting: What Did the Building See, the Wilsons' camera tours the sleek anonymity of a modern hotel in Dubai, where a Hamas operative was assassinated by Mossad agents. The camera sweeps the carpet, captures the light on louvred blinds, searches for room 230 where the deed was done. It is just another hotel room. It could be anywhere. Opposite the screen, a dangling TV monitor replays real CCTV footage of the incident. This, too, seems anonymous and generic, with its surveillance footage of corridors, parking zones and lobbies, and captured images of the blurry hit squad, looking like tourists or business guests, come to do their wet work.</p> <p>These two film installations are displayed in large, partially enclosed rooms-within-rooms with translucent walls, with mirrors at right angles to the screens. They feel as much like diagrams as real spaces. The light leaks in and the images thrown on the screen are reflected and multiplied by the mirrors. Get up close and you see yourself there, too, your repeated image bending away into infinity. The effect is like watching the bright windows of a train passing in the night. This sense of duplication and reflection is integral to the artists' work. It feels like metaphor \u2013 and it feels like a trap.</p> <p>The Wilsons' film installations haven't always been so effectively staged. Here, they have made great use of the difficult architecture of the Whitworth's complicated spaces.The exhibition design, as much as the things in it, feels like a kind of fiction. We could be in a story by JG Ballard or a novel by Don DeLillo, a movie by Tarkovsky or by Kubrick, a conspiracy thriller or a drama-documentary. What the Wilsons document, they also twist. There is no objective view. Nowadays, instead of featuring on-screen themselves, we are made aware of their overriding subjectivity, an implacable and sometimes merciless view. It is hard not to feel the sadness of the world here, the misery of the modern age, in these rooms of photographs and measuring rods, the dead bronze camera and the filmed trails of murder, nuclear disaster, cold wars and hidden wars.

The European Commission wants the size of the EU budget to be increased, a proposal which is anathema to the British government at a time of fiscal austerity at home. The UK is not the only country opposed to a large increase in the EU budget. But few are likely to fight as hard or as long against an increase as the UK.</p> <p>For his part, the British prime minister, David Cameron, is under enormous pressure from his own largely Eurosceptic Conservative Party to veto any budget deal that is inimical to British interests. Further struggles over banking union and efforts to repatriate key powers will follow, as pressures build on both sides of the Channel.

In 10 Downing St., his advisers are not only discussing whether to hold a referendum but also how to win one, says a senior minister involved in the plans. But the weakness of his political position means he cannot rule out leading a campaign to take the U.K. out of the EU if his renegotiation demands are not met.</p> <p>That puts him in a perilous situation. His hopes for a successful renegotiation rest largely on the belief that the euro zone's only hope of survival lies in full political union and the mutualization of debts. But this may be a miscalculation: Much of the fiscal and banking union needed to resolve the crisis are already in place and much of what remains to be done can probably be done within existing treaties, as it was with the fiscal pact. Even if Mr. Cameron had a radical agenda, the rest of the EU may see no need to indulge him\u2014particularly if, as last December, no U.K. interests are at stake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron's misfortune/strategic blunder is to be trapped between two formidable obstacles. On one flank (<em>the right, presumably</em>) the Conservative Party's eurosceptics. On the other, a European establishment which is more concerned with saving the single currency than helping the Brits backpedal.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:59:20.263Z\">at 9.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085051dc0e343ef1abc7e01\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:34:37.092Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Talk of snap elections in Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Political developments in Greece this morning, where an MP has been slung out out the ruling coalition.</p> <p><strong>Nikos Stavrogiannis</strong> was expelled from New Democracy's parliamentary group after he declared on Sunday that he might not support the country's new austerity programme when it comes before parliament.</p> <p>Stavrogiannis said the measure being imposed by the Troika are \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d.

After exchanging phone calls and letters with these families for several years, and helping to raise money to pay off their debts, I went to&#xa0;meet them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398165631\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350909582185/Rescue-workers-carry-bodi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rescue workers carry bodies into an ambulance at Morecambe in 2004\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rescue workers remove the bodies of the cocklepickers at Morecambe lifeboat station on 6 February 2004.

Liying looked frail and worn out, but was strong in spirit, as she had been in her letters and phone calls. She had supported her orphaned nephew, Xu Bin, with the income from her job as an assistant to an overseas Chinese businessman. In fact, the whole family's livelihood \u2013 her father, sister, daughter and unemployed husband \u2013 depended on her. Xu Bin had studied hard and passed the university extrance exam. He wanted to fulfill his parents' ambition for him, and was planning to go to Britain to further his studies before building a career back home.</p> <p>Liying and I went to visit a woman named Jinyun in her village near Fuqing. The winding lanes led to a semi-furnished two-storey house where she lived with her entire family. We talked on an old couch set against the concrete walls. I had been exchanging letters with Jinyun and her two sons, who were in high school when their father, Lin Guo Guang, drowned in Morecambe Bay. \"Guo Guang's first job in England was on a building site where he got paid \u00a340 a day,\" Jinyun said. \"That was why he resorted to cockling.\" Jinyun has brought up her sons on her own, working as a nanny and earning \u00a360 a month. By summer 2009, she had managed to pay off half the debt of 200,000 yuan (\u00a320,000) left by her husband (the remainder was paid by donations from the UK). \"I&#xa0;pretend he's still working in England and just hasn't sent money home,\" she said. \"It's much easier than thinking he's gone forever.\"</p> <p>Back in Putian, a town with few industries apart from the odd shoe and garment factory, Liying and I walked the dusty lanes to the local market where we met Mr and Mrs Lin, parents of Lin Zhifang, at 18 the youngest of those who drowned. They had come down from their home in the mountains to sell dragon eyes (a fruit similar to lychees) and sugarcane. Mr Lin said they had stopped working the land as the income was too small to live on. Now they depend on selling fruit in the market for a living. \"Zhifang had worked in a factory for two years before leaving. He was our eldest son, and what he wanted most was to build a house for the family,\" Mr Lin said. \"He could never have done it working in Putian.\"</p> <p>The burden of debt after Zhifang's death meant his younger brother had to work in the factory rather than go to university. Zhifang's mother couldn't speak much Mandarin but listened intently, and asked her husband to translate what she wanted to say. Several times she looked down, remembering the loss of her son, and wept.</p> <p>Zhifang's parents seemed to have swallowed the pain of losing their son in such a modest way, as if misfortunes were inevitable for those born into the life of peasants. They had moved on and toiled away for the little cash that would keep them from starving. Their endless strength was humbling.</p> <p>Liying and I then travelled to the outskirts of Fuzhou to see Yan Chun, the widow of Dong Xin Wu, who was 39 when he drowned. He had been a cobbler in Fuzhou and migrated to the UK to work for his family. Yan Chun lives in a village with her mother and mother-in-law, who suffers from dementia, and lives on state support of only 150 yuan (\u00a315) a month. The cost of medication has been a huge burden, even after a medical insurance system was introduced: \"It's a joke. Patients can only claim insurance if they are hospitalised, and then only 20% of the costs,\" a neighbour who helps look after Dong's mother told me.</p> <p>Yan Chun works as a cleaner in an insurance company, earning up to \u00a380 a month. Her son had wanted to serve in the army in Tibet, where he could earn 100,000 yuan and help clear the family's debts. (Most of the army in Tibet and Xinjiang, the \"troubled regions\", are recruited from the impoverished countryside.) But Yan Chun wouldn't let him go. She said she didn't want to lose him as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398165629\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350909809863/wives-of-migrant-workers--008.jpg\" alt=\"wives of migrant workers play cards\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wives of migrant workers play cards. Photograph: Hsiao-Hung Pai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hsiao-Hung Pai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the widows and families of the drowned workers, the future of the next generation has always been the overriding consideration. Yet it is hard to see what chance of a secure livelihood their children have in Fujian \u2013 and China. Fujian has always lagged behind the country as a whole; under Mao, the province was much neglected and received less than 2% of the nation's capital investment. Agriculture was the mainstay, but less than 10% of the province was arable. In the late 70s, before Deng Xiaoping's reforms, Fujian was ranked 23rd of 29 provinces in GDP. Since then, although poverty has been reduced, development initiatives have been concentrated in coastal cities such as Xiamen, while much of the countryside remains neglected and open to random land appropriation by developers.</p> <p>What's left for the youth? As Liying and others kept saying: \"There are few real jobs around here.\" In villages and townships, the main work options are in low-paid manufacturing and service industries. Even with a university education, jobs in the public sector are difficult to get: connections are the key.</p> <p>When Jinyun's family had finally paid off its debts, she borrowed money and sent both her sons to study in Japan, where course fees are half those in the UK, to study and work in the catering trade. Her younger son met a Fujianese woman and got married. However, their plans were interrupted by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami \u2013 Jinyun was anxious and asked them to return to China. Now her younger son is working for a relative in the timber business; her elder son is jobless.</p> <p>The desire for betterment still motivates many Fujianese to migrate. Today, the immigration cap on non-EU migrants has closed off legitimate routes, while the strengthening of the EU's border controls has made overland smuggling even more expensive. Given all this, many Fujianese parents look for other ways to send their children to Britain, often as students or&#xa0;asylum-seeking orphans.</p> <p>Those who come as orphans are among Britain's most vulnerable young migrants. They leave home for the first time and arrive in a country they know little about as unaccompanied minors. They then claim asylum and are put into social care. Some may be granted refugee status; others disappear into the informal economy, where they tend to work in the lowest-paid jobs in catering and service industries and are exploited \u2013 just like their predecessors. When I look at these young men and women, I remember the tanned faces of the workers, kneeling down to rake the shiny black cockles under the sun and rain, in order to send money home.</p> <p>As a Fujianese woman whose whole family had migrated told me: \"Our migrating ancestors left us with this legacy: You mustn't sit and take what is thrown at you in life. You must always endeavour to improve your living standards. You must do better.\"</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump tried to force the BBC to drop the broadcast of a critically acclaimed documentary on his alleged bullying of residents near his Scottish golf resort.</p> <p>Lawyers for the New York property magnate contacted the BBC two days before the feature-length film You've Been Trumped was screened on BBC2 on Sunday night, claiming it was highly defamatory, biased and misleading, and demanding a right of reply.</p> <p>In a letter to the BBC from Dundas &amp; Wilson, a prominent Scottish law firm which has acted for Trump for several years, and seen by the Guardian, the Trump organisation threatened to complain formally to Ofcom and the BBC Trust if the screening went ahead.</p> <p>The BBC rejected the request and gave the documentary, directed by Anthony Baxter, its network television premiere. It was watched by an estimated 1.1 million viewers, about 40% higher than average figures for the last three months, and earned praise from reviewers, trending on Twitter. The film will be screened again on BBC2 on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Trump's organisation retaliated saying it was appalled by the BBC's decision to show the \"highly biased and manipulative so-called documentary\".</p> <p>George Sorial, Trump's chief counsel, said the trust should sack Roger Mosey, the acting director of BBC Vision.</p> <p>\"The BBC is now an active participant in what many who are familiar with Baxter's work know is a complete false telling of the story behind the construction of Trump Golf Scotland,\" Sorial told the Guardian. \"I would say Roger Mosey should certainly resign or the BBC should consider firing him.</p> <p>\"We're filing complaints with Ofcom and the BBC Trust and are considering other available legal actions.\"</p> <p>Sarah Malone, the executive vice-president of Trump International Golf Links, who featured in the film, said: \"We totally denounce the BBC for further abandoning its own editorial integrity by blatantly refusing us a right of reply at the end of the broadcast last night.</p> <p>\"It just goes to show that recent criticism of the BBC's lack of sound editorial judgment to be correct. It is not a documentary \u2013 it is a piece of propaganda that is wildly inaccurate, defamatory and deliberately misleading.\"</p> <p>She said Baxter had sought to make \"a sensationalist, Local Hero story, through underhand, clandestine means, in the hope of making money off the Trump name. He's created a modern day fairytale that bears no resemblance to reality or the truth.\"</p> <p>In a short statement, the BBC defended its decision. \"You've Been Trumped is an award-winning film that has been screened at international festivals around the world,\" it said.</p> <p>\"During the making of the film, Donald Trump declined the opportunity to take part. We are confident that Donald Trump was offered sufficient right to reply in accordance with BBC editorial guidelines. Donald Trump chose not to participate but the film-maker took care to reflect his views on a number of different occasions in the film.</p> <p>\"In addition, Donald Trump was offered the chance to be interviewed live on the BBC following the BBC2 broadcast. He has not taken up our invitation.\"</p> <p>Trump has refused to see the film but on Twitter last week he described his critics as \"morons\". He asserted that Baxter had \"zero talent\" and was a \"stupid fool\" whose film had helped publicise and promote his golf course at Menie, north of Aberdeen.</p> <p>Baxter said he repeatedly asked Trump for an interview while he was making the documentary but none of the offers were taken up.</p> <p>The film showed Baxter asking Trump to respond to allegations of bullying and ill-treatment against local residents a number of times. It featured Trump talking 16 times and quoted his supporters backing the project.</p> <p>Baxter said: \"At one press conference, Donald Trump claimed I wasn't a real journalist, and at one stage his organisation put out statements claiming I was working for the [protest group] Tripping Up Trump, and I was actually banned from some press events. The opening of the golf course, I was banned from attending. They claimed I had been hiding behind bushes and heavy machinery, and filmed secret documents \u2013 all of which is utter nonsense.\"</p> <p>The film, released in May 2011, has won 10 awards from film festivals and environmental documentary organisations and earned four-star reviews in the British media. The Edinburgh international film festival refused to screen it, claiming it was not of sufficient quality.</p> <p>It has since been acclaimed by Michael Moore, the radical US film-maker, actors including Alec Baldwin, and lately the Scottish film-maker Bill Forsyth, director of the cult classic Local Hero cited by Malone.</p> <p>In an article for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/local-hero-donald-trump-bullying\" title=\"\">Guardian</a>, Forsyth said he had been left \"dazed and shocked\" after seeing the documentary in early September. Denouncing the \"malign bullying\" of local residents shown in the film, Forsyth said it was \"a moving depiction of human survival and dignity amidst murky doings akin to 70s Romania\".</p>",
  "<p>Ibrahim sits in a dark corner of a cafe, talking about his gang, the stabbings and the money he makes from selling heroin. Outside, locals splash through the narrow lanes of the congested capital of the Maldives under a heavy monsoon shower. \"It's been a good few months. We've been doing well,\" he says, lighting another cigarette. Recently Ibrahim's gang has been busy with a new sideline: providing political parties with muscle to intimidate opponents, swell meetings and provide security. \"There's so much demand, we've had to appoint someone just to run that side of our operations. Requests are coming in all the time,\" he says.</p> <p>Less than a mile from Ibrahim's neighbourhood is the international airport, where 900,000 tourists arrived last year heading for resorts on uninhabited coral atolls spread across the island nation. Few of them venture into Male. Even fewer know or care about the seething political instability, violence and social problems that wrack the country. Ibrahim, the gangleader, said he had agreed to talk to the Guardian because he wanted \"people around the world to know how things are here\". \"This is a paradise, but not everyone is an angel. Things have gone this far because of politics,\" he says. He is not the only one to think so.</p> <p>In 2008, presidential elections ended the three-decade dictatorship of Mamoun Abdul Gayoom and brought Mohamed Nasheed, a veteran human rights campaigner and well known environmental activist, to power. His victory, a new constitution and a wave of international goodwill appeared to usher in a new era. But Nasheed had many enemies: the former regime, new players hungry for power in the young democracy, religious conservatives. Then there were those alienated by what one local commentator called his \"all or nothing\" style.</p> <p>The result was a series of escalating political clashes over issues such as the independence of the judiciary and alleged \"anti-Islamic\" policies in the Sunni Muslim nation. After weeks of street violence, in February Nasheed was forced to resign. In two weeks, he faces trial on charges of illegally detaining a senior judge. Conviction could see him barred from participation in a new presidential poll scheduled for next year.</p> <p>\"They will fix it one way or another,\" the former president, 45, told the Guardian in Male last week. Government officials and supporters say the law is simply following its course. The political instability has led to a climate of fear. \"When you go out, you don't know if you are coming home unharmed,\" said a fish exporter in Male. He did not want to be named. There have been a series of attacks on prominent activists and politicians. In July, an outspoken secularist blogger survived having his throat cut. Two weeks ago, a moderate cleric and member of parliament was fatally stabbed.</p> <p>\"I get regular threats by text or calls. Some say they will kill me, some threaten me with paralysis,\" said Eva Abdullah, a parliamentarian from Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic party (MDP). Senior officials of Adhalat, the Maldives' main religious conservative party, said they too received death threats. All know there are few hiding places on a tiny claustrophobic island with 110,000 inhabitants, hundreds of miles from the nearest major land mass. Activists from the MDP also complain of police harassment and say senior officers responsible for abuses during demonstrations in February are being protected.</p> <p>An MDP \"protest camp\" has been repeatedly raided. One activist was charged with practising black magic. Others, themselves victims of violence, are facing charges of resisting arrest. Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/maldives-report-exposes-violent-repression-opposition-supporters-2012-09-04\" title=\"\">recently highlighted a \"human rights crisis\" in the country</a>. The physical violence has a verbal equivalent. Political debate often descends into unrestrained personal attacks. A <a href=\"http://minivannews.com/politics/translation-president-nasheed%E2%80%99s-devious-plot-to-destroy-the-islamic-faith-of-maldivians-30991\" title=\"\">pamphlet published by opposition politicians claimed</a> that \"since assuming office Nasheed has been working ceaselessly to weaken the Islamic faith of Maldivians, allow space for other religions, and make irreligious and sinful behaviour common\". One of the authors, Hassan Saeed, is now chief adviser to the current president, Mohammed Waheed Hassan Manik. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the charges were justified. \"You look at his behaviour, his actions, you have to come to that conclusion,\" Saeed said.</p> <p>The result of such political instability is an atmosphere where gangs thrive. In 2006, Maldives saw its first gang violence; the first gang killing followed two years later. Now bodies of teenagers regularly turn up in parks \u2013 victims of ongoing gang wars. Two members of Ibrahim's gang have been killed this year, obliging their leader to order what he called \"revenges\".</p> <p>Ibrahim himself joined his gang at the age of 14 in his neighbourhood of Henveiru. He was expelled from school shortly afterwards and rapidly rose through the ranks, selling drugs on the streets and fighting with other gangs when needed. \"I've stabbed a lot of people \u2013 and been stabbed six times myself. I've never killed anyone, at least not yet. We usually aim to disable people permanently. Paralysis, that's worse than dying,\" he said.</p> <p>Ibrahim's outfit of more than 70 members works around the clock, trafficking heroin, enforcing its territory and carrying out what he calls \"political work\". Ibrahim asks for 10,000 Rufiyah (\u00a3400) for 10 of his gang members to attend a demonstration for an hour. The rate charged for roughing up a political opponent \u2013 damaging his car or house \u2013 is between 25,000 and 50,000 Rufiyah (\u00a31,000-\u00a32,000), but for a stabbing the price would be much higher: \u00a315,000 at least. \"It's not bad, enough to pay our expenses for a month,\" Ibrahim said.</p> <p>Corruption means police officers can easily be persuaded to \"lose\" evidence and judges can be bought off. Nor is prison much of a deterrent. Phones, cigarettes, DVDs, \"anything except women\" is easily available. Mohamed Jameel, the minister for home affairs, said some political parties \"continuously seek the involvement of gangs in their activities\".</p> <p>\"Development doesn't just bring good things,\" he said. \"We have a lot of unemployed youth, dropouts end up on the corners of the street, there is peer pressure and it is easy for them to be recruited.\" Spokesmen for major parties contacted by the Guardian all denied any contact with criminals. But a <a href=\"http://minivannews.com/politics/politicians-and-businessmen-funding-gangs-to-attack-opponents-asia-foundation-44978\" title=\"\">recent report by the Asia Foundation</a>, based on interviews with more than 130 gang members, also found that most political parties use gangs.</p> <p>Dr Aishath Ali Naaz, its author, cited bullying and family problems as well as the rapid but unequal economic growth in Maldives in recent years as contributing to the violence. \"There have been losers as well as winners. Youth unemployment is very high,\" she said.</p> <p>Widespread narcotic use is also a significant factor. One recent survey found that as many as one in 20 of Male's inhabitants is a regular user of heroin or cannabis. Mohammed Shoaib of Journey, an NGO set up to help addicts, said more than 100 users register with them at their central Male office every month, more than ever before. \"It's easier to buy heroin than a pizza,\" he said. \"If you call for a pizza, it takes half an hour to arrive. The drugs take minutes.\"</p> <p>In tough neighbourhoods, the gangs play a role as a surrogate government, too. Ibrahim said the local community \"respected\" his gang, particularly after he paid for a children's playground. The fear is of a downward spiral in the Maldives, accelerated rather than slowed by the country's squabbling politicians, leading to more violence.</p> <p>\"The gang members are getting used to greater and greater severity of violence. So is society more generally. Once if someone was stabbed, everyone would be talking about it so much. Now people barely notice,\" said Naaz.</p> <p>Already, Ibrahim said, there are clashes, some fatal, between gangs working for different political parties. Casualties would be much higher if the gangs had firearms, he said. But Ibrahim hopes to leave soon. He has made enough money, he says, and, following a near-fatal stabbing 18 months ago, wants \"a quieter life\". \"I'm not sure where I'll go,\" he said, \"Maybe [Sri] Lanka. Maybe India. Out of here anyway.\"</p> <h2>The Maldives</h2> <p><strong>Political history:</strong> a Muslim sultanate for nine centuries, later a British protectorate, the Maldives have been independent since 1965. In 2008, Mohamed Nasheed won presidential elections. He resigned in February this year and was replaced by Mohammed Waheed Hassan Manik.</p> <p><strong>Geography:</strong> made up of 1,200 islands in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Threatened by climate change, with 80% of the area 1 metre or less above sea level.</p> <p><strong>Population:</strong> 400,000, 99% Sunni Muslim. More than 110,000 people live in Male, the capital.</p> <p><strong>GDP per capita:</strong> $4,300.

  "<p>Sir George Young's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-live-reaction\" title=\"\">promotion to the chief whip's office</a> has put the 72-year-old's esoteric CV under the spotlight. Not only did the Conservative MP for North West Hampshire once captain the House of Commons squash team, maintaining an unbeaten record for five years from 1979 (when he lost twice in a day to Ron Davies MP and his wife Christine, a Welsh international squash player), but he founded the Parliamentary Bicycle Pool, a surprisingly socialist initiative that provided a fleet of communal bicycles for MPs who preferred two wheels to four.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Bicycle Pool eventually morphed into what is now the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/cycling.htm\" title=\"\">All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group (APPCG)</a>. Sir George, who gained the nickname the Bicycling Baronet after doggedly cycling the seven miles from his first constituency in Acton to Westminster each day, has been an active member of the group whenever he has not held a ministerial position. Ministers are not allowed to be members of APPGs, so Sir George is now officially a patron rather than a member.</p> <p>Disappointingly, the APPCG isn't like a normal cycling club. Members don't meet at 7am each Sunday for a punishing ride around Westminister's highways and byways, the back pockets of their jerseys stuffed with energy gels and drinks. It's more of a lobbying collective. Each year the group goes on a sedate pootle around Westminster \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/audio/2010/jul/02/tourdefrance\" title=\"\">in 2010</a> the newly elected transport minister Norman Baker turned up on the departmental Brompton folding bike and Labour's Ben Bradshaw wore rather <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/david-dansky/4712322640/in/set-72157624165513771\" title=\"\">daring shorts</a>. Tory MP Peter Bottomley also provoked mirth by arriving with his helmet on the wrong way around. Luckier members go on the annual field trip: they recently went to Paris to check out the Velib bike-rental scheme (not as good as London's, was the verdict) and another year they pedalled around Holland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/cycling.htm\" title=\"\">A glance through the 135-strong membership list</a> reveals no particular party bias. Former Tory health minister turned peer Virginia Bottomley is on there, alongside Labour rebels Jeremy Corbyn and Kelvin Hopkins. So is the former law lord Leonard Hoffmann and Lords Butler and Scott, famous for heading inquiries into Iraq.</p> <p>The chair is currently shared between Labour MP Ian Austin, a speed freak who rides a racing bike, and Julian Huppert, the Lib Dem MP for Cambridge, who doesn't own a car and is something of a utilitarian cyclist, pedalling in his work clothes whatever the weather. Don't be surprised if you see either in a future cabinet: APPCG chairs have a track record for going on to become ministers. Charles Clarke and Ben Bradshaw were at the helm before taking charge of the home office and the department of culture, media and sport, respectively.</p>",

Hassan played a \u201chigh-stakes\u201d game both in investigating Hezbollah\u2019s role in the 2005 murder of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and the arrest that he organised in August of Michel Samaha, a minister linked to the Syrian government, over terrorism allegations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki\">Speaking on a noisy Skype line</a> he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon is very combustible. This current situation is especially dangerous because of the fractiousness of the Sunni community and the lack of control that [former prime minister] Saad Hariri and his Future Movement can exert over certain elements of the population, who are very angry and want to see more a proactive stance in support of the Syrian revolution, and are fed up with assassination after assassination and by what they see as Hezbollah\u2019s military dominance. This could easily become the straw that broke the camel's back. It could lead to the kind of civil violence that everybody has been trying to prevent.</p> </blockquote> <p>But for now the opposition Future Movement is making all the right noises, Muhanna said. He was encouraged by Hariri\u2019s attempt to rein in the radical demands of some Sunni groups. \u201cHariri doesn\u2019t want to assume power at this point - given all that\u2019s happening in Syria,\" he said. But there needs to be political consensus for cooler heads to prevail, he argued.</p> <p>\u201cIf they can find a way of containing the situation and keeping [prime minister Najib] Mikati in power then they may be able to return in some ways to the status quo,\" Muhanna said.</p> <p>There is as yet no evidence pointing to a link to Syria, Muhanna pointed out. But he said there is a long history of assassination of Lebanese figures who act against Syria\u2019s interests in Lebanon.</p> <p>It is impossible to tell whether Hezbollah was involved Hassan\u2019s killing, Muhanna noted. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is fair to say that Hezbollah does not gain by a situation in which Lebanon is pulled into sectarian violence. Hezbollah has really tried to insulate Lebanon from the Syrian crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaked documents have suggested that Hassan had regular contact with one of Hezbollah\u2019s security chiefs. \u201cHe was really somebody who lived inbetween the spaces between Damascus and Beirut,\u201d Muhanna said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Wissam al-Hassan&amp;#x27;s killing could spark Lebanon&amp;#x27;s combustible mix despite calls for calm from Future Movement says @QifaNabki&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T15:14:00.352Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085484cc0e343ef1abc7e24\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:21:17.089Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish-Syrian tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turkey has rejected Israeli calls for talks on the Syria crisis, as analysts express concern about Ankara's increasing aggression towards Syria.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=296024\">According to the Turkish daily Zaman</a> the calls for talks came from Pinhas Avivi, a former Israeli ambassador to Turkey and current political director of the Israeli foreign ministry.</p> <p>He suggested Syria and Turkey should both acknowledge mistakes over border violence, to avoid the tension escalating further.</p> <p>Most analysts believe Turkey wants to avoid war with Syria despite Ankara's belligerent rhetoric.</p> <p>But a new paper for the International Institute for Strategic Studies predicted that increased <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-18-2012/october/turkeys-frustrations-grow-with-syrian-civil-war\">military tension and even some form of intervention is still a possibility</a>.</p> <p>It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent events suggest that Turkey's policy towards Syria has entered a new and more aggressive phase. Ankara appears determined to increase the pressure on the Assad regime, raising the possibility of increased Turkish aid to the FSA and even artillery support, from inside Turkey, for Free Syrian Army operations in Syria.</p> <p>The likelihood of a war between Turkey and Syria remains remote. But the new impetuousness of the Turkish approach is a cause for concern. It would be a mistake to underestimate the AKP's frustration at Assad's continued hold on power, Nato allies' refusal to play a more active role in trying to overthrow him and the emergence of a Kurdish enclave inside Syria. Although it currently appears small, there is nevertheless a danger that sustained \u2013 or even increased \u2013 military tensions could generate a momentum that could drag Turkey deeper into a highly complex conflict from which it would be hard to extricate itself.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:42:59.320Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50853a37c0e343ef1abc7e1f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T12:21:11.766Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lebanese army warning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lebanon's army has called for calm amid reports that the latest wave of violence has eased.</p> <p>Reuters reports: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon's army said on Monday the nation faced a critical phase after the assassination of a senior intelligence officer prompted violent protests across the country.</p> <p>\"We call on all political leaders to be cautious when expressing their stances and opinions,\" said a statement by the army, adding that it would take \"decisive measures\" to prevent chaos in areas of high tension.</p> </blockquote> <p>Journalists in Beirut said overnight violence, which killed at least two people, appears to be over for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Streets in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Beirut\">#Beirut</a> reach uneasy calm but unclear if Army in control or if this is a just a break before nightfall. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; mitchell prothero (@mitchprothero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:52:32+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Clashes over in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23beirut\">#beirut</a>,lots of army vehicles around Tarik al Jedid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; JAVIER ESPINOSA (@javierespinosa2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:32:30+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon\">Britain's foreign office has updated its travel advice to Lebanon</a> in the wake of Friday's bomb attack and ensuing violence.

There's much to catch up on, so here's a summary of the latest news and analysis:</p> <h2>Lebanon</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/six-wounded-in-lebanon-clashes-overnight-8220028.html\">Overnight clashes in Beirut between Sunni and Shia gunmen have wounded at least six people, AP reports, amid fears that the conflict in Syria is spreading to Lebanon in the wake of Friday's bomb attack in Beirut. </a></strong>The killing of Wissam al-Hassan, head of Lebanon's internal security forces in the bombing has provoked worried discussion in Damascus, according to the National. <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/syrians-fear-their-war-is-spreading-and-will-destroy-us-and-lebanon\">\"It is a clear signal that our war is spreading</a>, it will destroy us and I'm sorry to say it will destroy Lebanon too,\" said Abu Anas, a middle-aged man from a besieged Damascus suburb.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/lebanese-clash-intelligence-chief-funeral\">The Lebanese president, Michel Sleiman, told mourners at Hassan's funeral that he had ordered a rapid investigation into the killing. </a></strong>Within an hour of the funeral, protesters drawn mostly Hassan's Sunni Muslim community began attacking security forces and attempted to storm the office of the prime minister, Najib Mikati, before rubber bullets and teargas forced them back from the barricades. They consider Mikati\u2019s government to be in league with Syria over the attack.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20024519\">US secretary of state Hillary Clinton told Lebanon that the US was willing to help investigate Friday\u2019s bomb attack, the BBC reports. </a></strong>Clinton spoke to Mikati after the funeral. A spokeswoman for the state department said: \"She noted the importance of political leaders working together at this sensitive time to ensure that calm prevails and that those responsible for the attack are brought to justice.\u201d</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/10/22/448279.htm\">President Bashar al-Assad suggested he would only back a ceasefire if western and Arab countries stopped helping the armed struggle against his government.</a></strong> After talks with international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, the state news agency Sana said Assad insisted that \u201cany initiative or political process should be essentially based on the principle of halting terrorism and what is required in this regard from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harbouring the terrorists in Syria to halt such acts\".</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE89K07E20121022\"><strong>Thirteen people were killed when a car bomb was set off in Damascus during Brahimi\u2019s visit.</strong> </a>&#xa0;The bomb exploded outside a police station in the mainly Christian central Bab Touma district.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/west-policy-syria-failure-russia-iran\">By backing one side in a civil war that neither side can win, the west's policy on Syria is failing on a monumental scale, according to former Labour minister Peter Hain.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way forward is to broker a political settlement, with Russia using its leverage to ensure that Assad negotiates seriously \u2026</p> <p>However unpalatable, Assad may have to be granted immunity in order to get him to sign up and stop his barbarity. All state employees, including those in the armed forces, must be allowed to keep their posts, to avoid a repeat of the chaos caused by America's de-Ba'athification in Iraq. A Yemen-type process may even figure. There, a hated president did not resign but did not stand for re-election. A coalition government of national unity could then prepare for Syrian elections, due in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15984\">The US should change the balance of power in Syria by supplying rebels with anti-aircraft weapons, according to Syria watcher Joshua Landis who until now has resisted US involvement in the conflict.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The supply of portable heat-seeking missiles seems to be increasingly justified. US politicians fear that elements of the Syrian opposition may misuse ground to air missiles, but surely they cannot be misused more than Assad\u2019s jets and helicopters. Assad\u2019s air superiority, combined with his inability to rule Syria, is causing endless misery. Air power is so destructive that if it could be denied to both sides, surely fewer people would be killed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jordan</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/jordan-claims-thwarted-terror-attacks\">The authorities claim to have foiled an al-Qaida-inspired plot using arms from Syria to target western diplomats, foreign nationals and shopping centres.</a></strong> A Jordanian government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah said all 11 suspects are in police custody. He said the men had brought in arms from Syria to use them in the alleged plot and had been assisted by al-Qaida operatives based in Iraq in manufacturing home-made explosives.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/protesters-libya-parliament-bani-walid-conflict\">Demonstrators broke into the grounds of Libya's parliament, wounding two security guards, in a protest against the continuing fighting in Bani Walid, a former stronghold of Muammar Gaddafi.</a></strong><br>Fighting in Bani Walid, 90 miles south-east of Tripoli, continued for a fifth day, with the government yet to provide proof of its assertion that Gaddafi's youngest son, Khamis, was killed in the town on Saturday.</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/sonia-dridi-attacked-tahrir-square\"><strong>A journalist for France 24 has described how his female colleague was attacked and groped by a group of men while filming live during protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night</strong>.</a> Sonia Dridi was surrounded while filming in the square, with the mob closing in on her as she was reporting.

  "<p>Andrew Bailey, the chief regulator of banks and insurance companies, has told his staff that the buck stops with him in the supervision of firms.</p> <p>Laying out his plans for the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) before a City audience, Bailey admitted that the new regulator being spun out of the Financial Services Authority next year could never stop all banks collapsing.</p> <p>With the regulator adopting a more judgment-based, intrusive approach to regulation, Bailey said he wants his staff to focus on key issues rather than a wide range of potential problems, as in the past.</p> <p>Attempting to demonstrate that he will take personal responsibility for the way the PRA regulates 300 banks, he said: \"If I emphasise three things we should focus on in a firm and, as I occasionally get asked by supervisors, what if it is the fourth thing that blows the firm up. Well I've made that judgment. It may not be the right judgment in retrospect, but it is the one that I've made.\"</p> <p>On secondment from the Bank of England, Bailey is currently acting head of the regulator following the resignation of Hector Sants, although he is expected to be formally appointed to the role.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/pra-approach-banking.pdf\" title=\"\">Documents published</a> alongside the presentation to City professionals showed that the new regulator has backed down from its proposals to tell banks how they are ranked on its new measurement of financial strength, for fear that it could cause them to collapse.</p> <p>Last year, the FSA unveiled a five-stage assessment, the proactive intervention framework (PIF) \u2013 with firms ranked at number one regarded as facing a \"low risk\" to their viability, and five meaning \"winding-up under way\". At the time the FSA said that banks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/19/hector-sants-city-regulator-fsa-pra\" title=\"\">will know how they are ranked</a> and did not rule out publishing those rankings.</p> <p>The latest documents reveal that firms will not be told their rankings, as European rules may require them to inform their shareholders through stock exchange announcements about where they stand. The PRA, however, intends to publish the number of firms it has categorised in each of the five rankings.</p> <p>\"The PRA would prefer to disclose PIF stages to regulated firms as a means of summarising the PRA's overall judgment on safety and soundness. In view of the current disclosure obligations in European legislation, however, the Bank and the FSA have decided not to do so, given the risk that in some cases the firm may be under a legal obligation to disclose its PIF stage publicly,\" the documents said.</p> <p>\"The PRA will engage with HM Treasury to discuss whether it would be appropriate to pursue changes to relevant European legislation to support disclosure of such supervisory judgments to the firms but not to the market generally.\"</p> <p>Bailey told the audience that his goal was for the \"public to put their trust in a safe and stable banking system\".</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/400e1bae-1b5c-11e2-90cb-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29w3wzcEm\" title=\"\">an interview with the Financial Times</a>, Bailey, a long-standing Bank of England employee, recalled a meeting with the treasurer of Royal Bank of Scotland during the 2008 banking crisis.</p> <p>\"The treasurer, John Cummins, came in and I thought he was going to have a heart attack \u2026 and he looked at me and said I need \u00a325bn today, can you do it? I said, Yes, I can do that,\" Bailey said. He was confident he could because he had also been lending cash, privately, to HBOS.</p> <p>The PRA is to be set up as a subsidiary inside the Bank of England in April.</p>",
  "<p>Students and their parents have always been concerned about safety while studying overseas. These concerns are shaped by information and experiences gained from many sources that accumulate across the international student journey. But being safe in an overseas study environment is not a one-dimensional issue, as new research by the British Council's education intelligence unit. Safety cannot be created by informing or changing one element of the international student experience \u2013 a holistic approach involving all participants is needed.</p> <p>What is striking about findings from our research is the rise of safety as an influencing factor on students' choice of where to study overseas. A country being a safe place to study is currently the fifth most important influencing factor, according to <a href=\"http://ihe.britishcouncil.org/ihe-exchange/products/115\" title=\"\">our Student Insight survey</a>, which has collected over 160,000 responses from students around the world since 2007. This compares with its ranking as the 17th most important factor out of a possible 19 in 2007.</p> <p>The UK was recently voted as the safest place to live while studying overseas, as part of an online opinion poll of over 800 students from more than 80 countries, conducted by Education Intelligence via <a href=\"http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Student Room online forum</a> . The most important factor in this verdict was the UK's rich cultural mix, followed by its lack of gun culture and good healthcare system. </p> <p>Much of this research investigated how opinions are formed and decisions are made. However, it was the final layer of our research \u2013 speaking to students, parents, teachers and agents in India about who they believe is responsible for international student safety \u2013 which formed an understanding of what action could be taken to equip and prepare students and mitigate their growing concerns.</p> <p>The young people we spoke to in Delhi and Mumbai held very strong views on how their future university overseas could make them feel safer. All students agreed that integration into both international student groups and the home student community was essential, not only to settling into university life but also improving safety. Feeling safe in their new home would give them a basis on which to build their academic ability and social networks.</p> <p>What are the implications for UK institutions? In 2010/2011, over 480,700 international students came to study in the UK, evidence of how successfully UK universities market themselves internationally. The average number of international students at the 160+ UK higher education institutions is around 2900. However, the number of international students at any one institution varies from 30 to more 10,000. The average ratio of UK students to international students is around 5:1, but at some institutions a quarter of all students are international. In classes where domestic students are in the minority, their international classmates may feel they are not fully integrated into the student community.</p> <p>International students that enter UK classrooms to study UK courses do not undertake this commitment lightly, having invested both financially and emotionally into a transaction they hope will boost their academic, professional and social aspirations. They do however embark on their journey as willing participants. Most UK students have not experienced the national and institutional marketing campaigns UK institutions conduct overseas targeted at (and witnessed by) international classmates in their home countries. Those UK students may also be unaware of their role in delivering on the promise of these campaigns.</p> <p>Like these classrooms, towns and cities across the UK feel the impact of up to 40,000 students into local communities at the beginning of each academic year, a large proportion of which are international. If a town or city is unprepared for this level of activity and not informed about the benefits of welcoming international students, there could be negative consequences.</p> <p>Fully internationalising an institution means making ready the curriculum, the administration, the careers department, and the accommodation facilities. But it also means taking steps to ensure full integration of international students into institutional and local communities. Our research shows this is an essential element of creating an environment in which international students feel safer.</p> <p>Bringing this about involves staff that work across facilities and departments, with students on campus, and with the wider community, making all fully aware of the expectations upon them to be welcoming, open and ready to learn. Is this an unrealistic, utopian aim? Let's hope not. After all, becoming a truly international and successful global institution that provides the safest and most productive learning and living environment for all students is crucial to the ongoing success of the UK as a world study destination.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Shepherd is research director of education intelligence at the </em><a href=\"http://ihe.britishcouncil.org/\" title=\"\"><em>British Council</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BritishCouncil\" title=\"\"><em>@BritishCouncil</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>\"It was part of the grieving process,\" Andrew Strauss says in his considered but booming voice over tea and biscuits on an autumnal afternoon in Hertfordshire. He might still be cold after a rainy round of golf but it does not take the former England captain long to shake off the polite niceties of a few gentle warm-up questions as he cuts to the heart of loss and painful endings. Strauss is far too grounded to linger over any comparison between death and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/29/england-captain-andrew-strauss-retires?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">his retirement from cricket</a> but it is still striking how open he is about his turbulent emotions when he wrote to England's players in August to explain, in personal letters, why he could no longer continue as their captain.</p> <p>Strauss takes another sip of tea as he remembers that poignant day. \"One of the things I've found hardest about retiring was sitting down and writing to those players. It dawned upon me how much like a second family the England team has been to me in recent years. You spend so much time together \u2013 probably sharing more nights with them than your wife. It's hard to let go. And as soon as you do let go they move on for the next tour. They're still in that bubble and you're on the other side. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/01/england-andrew-strauss-retiring\" title=\"\">Your relationship with those players will never be the same again</a>. I was prepared for that but it was still emotional writing and saying: 'This is it. Fine, I'm off. Goodbye.'\"</p> <p>Of course Strauss is too thoughtful to have scribbled such a cursory farewell. Every letter would have been packed with personal meaning from him to each specific player \u2013 summed up by the impressively old-fashioned fact that, rather than texting or emailing, he put pen to paper. \"Well,\" Strauss smiles, \"it just proved to me how successfully I'd managed to avoid getting a proper job because my hand was cramping after about 10 minutes. It took me a lot longer than I expected. I wrote the letters on the back of each other and it took at least half a day.\"</p> <p>How did he decide who he would write to first \u2013 or did he simply move down the batting order? \"It was a bit higgledy-piggledy. I had a list and some were easier to write than others and I went first with the ones that I figured would be easier. The ones that were harder to write were those with more emotion attached to them.\"</p> <p>Did Kevin Pietersen feature on his list? \"Um \u2026 I didn't write to KP, actually,\" he says of Pietersen, whose text messages to his South African friends in the opposition dressing room <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/15/kevin-pietersen-apologised-provocative-texts\" title=\"\">apparently undermined Strauss</a> during the second Test of an unhappy series for England. \"But the main reason was that I wrote all those letters so they could be taken down to the Rose Bowl where the guys were playing [in a one-day international \u2013 a form of cricket from which Pietersen had temporarily retired in order to pursue a more lucrative career in the Indian Premier League.] Obviously I texted KP.\"</p> <p>A text to Pietersen was probably more appropriate than a beautifully-written letter? \"Well yeah,\" Strauss shrugs. \"That was a strange time for the two of us. A lot had happened and during that period we were quite estranged from each other.\"</p> <p>Surely that estrangement, between Pietersen and the entire squad, cannot be healed \u2013 even though, after an awkward series of meetings, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/18/england-kevin-pietersen-squad-india\" title=\"\">he will play for England </a>against India next month? \"It's an interesting point. Maybe it actually makes it easier for the team that I'm not there because some of it was directed to me. It would have been harder if I'd stayed.\"</p> <p>Strauss has previously been resolute in stressing that he did not retire because of Pietersen's texts. Is he now saying something different? \"No, because of what happened with KP I felt guilty not sorting it before I left. I didn't want to leave it on [the team director] Andy Flower's plate and I felt uncomfortable with Cooky [Alastair Cook] having to deal with it as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/17/alastair-cook-kevin-pietersen-england-return\" title=\"\">one of his first tasks</a>. But that would have been the wrong reason for me to stay. I had to go.\"</p> <p>Was Strauss aware of Pietersen's soured mood towards him? \"Not really. That's the strange thing about it. We knew that Kevin was having issues about the IPL. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/14/kevin-pietersen-odi-cricket-retirement\" title=\"\">retired from one-day cricket</a> and didn't seem happy because it was clear that he was keen to commit to the IPL. But as players we were outside of that. So when it came to a head we were all quite surprised.\"</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that Pietersen, being such a willful maverick, has always been difficult to captain. \"Well, what makes people like KP special as cricketers is they are different. Nine-tenths of my time as England captain I found him a good guy to have in my team. He set the right example in practice and I felt he could have been far more resentful of me in the sense that he had been removed as captain before I took over. But he just got on with his job and our relationship was pretty good \u2013 which is why it was so surprising and baffling when I heard what had been going on. In the preceding months he had not given me any hint of what he thought about me.\"</p> <p>Strauss says that he and Pietersen have since met \u2013 and he acknowledges that some of England's players have not been blameless in the breakdown of relationships with their star batsman. \"I don't think anyone got to the bottom of the text messaging saga. But Kevin has since come up to me and apologised for it and I respect that. He seemed contrite and I think he was sincere. Looking back I think it was wrong some of our players were following <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/9473845/Kevin-Pietersen-parody-Twitter-KP-Genius-account-was-me-says-cricket-fan.html\" title=\"\">that [spoof KP Genius] Twitter account</a>. But I still don't think it's a justification for what Kevin did.\"</p> <p>Can Pietersen change perceptions of himself? \"It would be fantastic if Kevin does recommit himself to English cricket at a greater level. But if, deep down, he still feels more loyalty to his IPL franchise then obviously it's going to be difficult for him.\"</p> <p>Does Strauss believe Pietersen is badly advised \u2013 as he released his YouTube pitch at reconciliation in the midst of a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiaZnXayjTQ\" title=\"\">fevered night at the London Olympics</a>? \"I don't know. But I believe we all have to take responsibilities for our own actions. It was a fraught time for everyone and I now believe that KP is very contrite.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/24/andy-flower-zimbabwe-protest-henry-olonga\" title=\"\">difficulties for Flower</a>, who is just as straight and disciplined a man as Strauss, will be obvious in India as he tries to ease Pietersen's reintegration. \"It will be difficult,\" Strauss concedes. \"One of the problems is that there are two separate sections. One is going on in meeting rooms between KP and the players and on the other side is this media intrigue. From Andy's point of view, they need to get that first part right. If everyone is happy in the dressing room they will play well. But if it's not resolved then it is a problem. I honestly think it's a real problem.\"</p> <p>Is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/18/kevin-pietersen-england-india-tour\" title=\"\">reconciliation achievable</a>? \"Um \u2026 I think that it can be. But everyone has to desperately want it to happen and they all need to let bygones be bygones and not have any grudges and bitterness. Everyone has to want to move forward for the right reasons. That's the question mark and so it's hard for me to tell. But it saddens me that we've been through this \u2013 after all the hard work we put in as a group for three-and-a-half years. We all genuinely believed in this special bond and chemistry we had. Unfortunately we've slipped from there and the guys are going to need to recover that. It's going to be tough.</p> <p>\"If they can make it work then obviously England will be a better side with KP in it because he's an outstanding player. But if, behind the scenes, things are difficult and resentment is harboured, and if KP is not fully committed to England, there are going to be problems. But it's in everyone's interests to make it work.\"</p> <p>Strauss is not being disingenuous in deflecting any suspicion that he retired simply because of Pietersen. Instead, he offers some touching insights into his slow decline as a Test batsman. \"I had noticed signs that my batting was going backwards. I was starting to feel a bit old and that's not a good place to be as a professional athlete. I first felt it 12 months ago. I didn't have a great summer in 2011 and then over the winter I didn't play particularly well. I had a bit of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/18241094\" title=\"\">resurgence against West Indies</a> but I felt like I was swimming against the tide.</p> <p>\"If I'm brutally honest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/22/andrew-strauss-england\" title=\"\">by the time we reached world No1</a> I had ticked off everything I'd wanted to achieve. It's then hard to keep yourself hungry and motivated as captain. I also wasn't as mobile in the field. My agility was dropping. One of my favourite shots \u2013 the pull \u2013 was one I wasn't playing very often and I couldn't work out why. So maybe my reactions were slowing down. I loved captaining and trying to win games \u2013 but I wasn't enjoying batting any more.\"</p> <p>Strauss nods at the suggestion that, as a great sportsman, it must be immensely painful to lose your ability and desire. \"It is. There's this nagging feeling at the back of your mind and you redouble your efforts and work harder as a way of masking that feeling. But it's still there in the background. Every time you don't score runs or you dive for a ball and it just evades you, it creeps back. It's one of those things that when it catches hold of you it's just like a cancer \u2013 it spreads.\"</p> <p>Could he discuss his feelings with Flower? \"It's not something you can talk about. You spend most of your time fighting it. I only spoke to my wife and 12 months ago I marked out the South Africa series as a watershed. If we [England] were playing well and I was batting well that would give me the green light to go on for the [2013] Ashes. But if either of us was not playing well it would be a good time to think about going. In truth, England had taken a step back over the last nine months and I wasn't playing well. It became pretty clear in my mind.\"</p> <p>England dipped just as Strauss suffered his personal crisis of confidence. Were his players similarly drained of energy? \"We struggled with knowing our next goal. We never quite worked that out. If you say we want to stay No1 for the next 12 months then by definition you're just trying to hold on. I now think that as soon as we beat India to become No1 we should have made a conscious effort to refresh everything. But it's hard to do that when everything seems to be working so well.\"</p> <p>Flower once said that he wanted to create a dominant legacy that could rival great teams from the West Indies and Australia. \"We discussed it but it was just too big an aim at first. We needed something smaller than that and that's when it becomes trickier. Maybe we could have thought about getting to a certain number of ranking points. Human nature is that when you attain a goal you allow yourself to be happy and content and those emotions are not good in international sport. You have to be unhappy and keep pushing and straining because the opposition will do that.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/sep/18/joe-root-nick-compton-england\" title=\"\">Who does Strauss believe should replace him as Test opener</a>? \"I've heard a lot of good things about Joe Root but it would be hard to say he's the man when I haven't really seen him bat. I've known Nick Compton a long time. He's a fully-formed cricketer and he's scored lots of runs. He probably feels ready to open the batting for England. If KP is back then you have the option of <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/47623.html\" title=\"\">pushing Jonathan Trott</a> up the order. But he's done so well at No3 it seems wrong to swap him round. If it was up to me I would keep Trott at three.\"</p> <p>And that would leave Compton to open the batting with Cook? \"Nick has always been very good technically. I played with him at Middlesex years ago. He's quite an intense character and determined to make the most of his ability. I don't think he'd be overawed. Andy and Cooky will be looking very closely to see how Compton and Root play in the warm-up games and how they adapt to the squad. Sometimes it's how people hold themselves off the pitch that matters most.\"</p> <p>No one in the recent annals of English cricket has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/29/andrew-strauss-quits-england-captain\" title=\"\">conducted himself more admirably both on and off the field than Strauss</a>. England will miss him sorely, both for the batsman he once was and the tough and intelligent captain who steered them to back-to-back Ashes victories and led them to becoming the best Test team in world cricket. He now feels that he is \"on gardening leave\" as he works out what he might do next.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to make any decisions until after Christmas. It's going to be one of four things and quite possibly a combination of media work, cricket administration, corporate speaking and getting involved in a business unrelated to&#xa0;cricket.\"</p> <p>Strauss seems most passionate about safeguarding the Test arena \u2013 which is an&#xa0;aim that he can begin to develop as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/11/andrew-strauss-international-cricket-council\" title=\"\">member of the ICC's cricket committee</a>. \"It's a way of dipping my toe into the water and learning more about the ICC and the corporate governance of cricket. I really want to see cricket flourish and I have concerns that we're putting the game under a lot of pressure.</p> <p>\"My biggest concern is that Test cricket and Twenty20 cricket are competing too much. They should be complementing each other and the more they clash the more damaging it will be for cricket. We have to find a way to get the two forms of the game co-existing \u2013 and that involves administrators sitting down and banging their heads together and working out a framework. I understand the politics but&#xa0;I'm more interested in what's best for the game.\"</p> <p>Strauss seems eminently suited to pursuing a noble cause on behalf of Test cricket. It surely also means he won't be following Michael Vaughan on to Strictly Come Dancing? Strauss pulls a face, perhaps imagining a light entertainment show more geared to Pietersen, and then laughs. \"Definitely not! At the risk of sounding like Steve Redgrave when he said 'Shoot me if I get in a boat again', I'll be very disappointed if I end up doing that.\"</p> <p><em>Andrew Strauss is an ambassador for pensions and investment group MetLife (www.metlife.co.uk)</em></p>",

The EU budget settlement had to be \"rigorous\", he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has sidestepped questions about whether a no vote in the referendum he is proposing on a renegotiated relationship with the EU would lead to Britain leaving the EU.</strong> Although he has not formally committed himself to a referendum, he has said that he wants to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and that a referendum would then be the simplest way of obtaining public consent for that. During the statement, two Tory MPs, Peter Bone and Mark Reckless, asked if a no vote would lead to Britain leaving the EU or whether it would be an \"in/in\" referendum, with a no vote endorsing the status quo. Cameron refused to answer.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ed Miliband has accused Cameron of weakening Britain's influence within the EU.</strong> In his response to Cameron, Miliband said <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eu-britain-finland-idUSBRE89H19J20121018\">Finland's Europe minister, an Anglophile, complained at the EU summit that Britain was waving goodbye to the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister does not seem to realise that all his bluster about fighting for Britiain is meaningless if he alienates our natural supporters ... He really has become the guy who goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room - which is just as well because he normally finds himself in an empty room ...</p> <p>The reality is he has lost control of his party on Europe. We have a prime minister outside the room looking in at Britain's empty seat at the table. There's one thing that our allies in Europe and the British people can agree on: his government's a shambles and it's Britain that suffers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Dunne, a defence minister, has told MPs that Scotland could lose Royal Navy defence contracts if it went independent.</strong> This is what he said when he was asked about the matter at defence questions.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has not built a complex warship outside these shores since the second world war; we remain committed to using UK industry to build UK warships.</p> <p>In the unlikely event that Scotland should decide to separate from the UK, the Scottish defence industry would only be eligible to bid for contracts placed by a future Scottish government, or competed for outside the UK, placed by the UK or other governments.

Redistribution won\u2019t do it. Just 21 per cent want the government to \u201cdo far more to help the poor,\u201d while 27 per cent, would prefer the opposite\u2014cutting welfare payments \u201cbecause the poor should take more responsibility for themselves.\u201d Loyalists prefer redistribution to welfare cuts by two-to-one.</p> <p>There is one radical policy that most defectors support. A law limiting maximum pay to \u00a31m a year is supported by 58 per cent. But two right-wing policies are at least as popular: 59 per cent of defectors want Britain to leave the EU, and a huge 78 per cent want \u201cnet immigration reduced to zero\u201d.</p> <p>Equally, though, activists who reassure themselves that Labour\u2019s core supporters reject such views should think again. As many as 41 per cent of loyalists also want Britain out of the EU, and two-thirds of them back zero net immigration. One of the key findings from this analysis is that Labour defectors generally hold more right-wing views than many party activists like to think\u2014but so do millions of Labour loyalists.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://dpmcbride.tumblr.com/\">\u2022 Damian McBride on his blog says David Cameron should learn from the mistakes Gordon Brown made when he tried to get his government out of crisis mode.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, [Cameron] \u2013 like Gordon \u2013 is trying to announce his way out of the crisis, going into each Sunday morning and each PMQs with a fresh attempt to get on top of the news agenda with some random, focus group designed announcement. At its very least, this is a waste of potentially good stories and speeches which should be held back until there\u2019s a chance of them being heard; worse, it leads to the bungled announcement of half-baked policies, like the fuel bills balls-up; and worse still, it leads to ridiculous headlines like \u201cCameron: Now Mug A Hoodie\u201d.</p> <p>Second, he and his team are fighting forest fires with buckets of sand, when what they need is proper firebreaks, i.e. moments when the pre-existing political news agenda is suspended (or at least turned into a backdrop) while another issue or event comes to the fore. It could be a Budget, a Queen\u2019s Speech, a trip to Washington, a Defence White Paper: anything which obliges the political media to focus their attention elsewhere for a few days, not least \u2013 to put it crudely \u2013 if they want to get an exclusive preview. So where are the Coalition\u2019s firebreaks? The only one I can see on the horizon is George Osborne\u2019s Autumn Statement on 5th December; that feels a long time away.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100185933/boris-johnson-the-obama-campaigns-secret-weapon/\">\u2022 Dan Hodges on his blog says Boris Johnson is now featuring in one of Barack Obama\u2019s ads attacking Mitt Romney.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/#axzz2A2PRFsja\">\u2022 Gavyn Davies on his FT blog explains why the latest thinking from the IMF about fiscal multipliers is so important.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [IMF] authors believe that this is because the fiscal multipliers have turned out to be higher than was assumed when the austerity programmes were designed. In fact, they suggest that the multiplier under current circumstances might be as large as 0.9-1.7, compared to the initial assumption of 0.5.</p> <p>If true, the implication of this would be critical. If the multiplier is 0.5, then an initial public expenditure reduction of 1 per cent of GDP reduces real output by 0.5 per cent. Using normal rules of thumb, this drop in output would in turn reduce taxation or increase public transfers by about 0.2 per cent of GDP, leaving the budget deficit improving by 0.8 per cent of GDP. This ratio of budget improvement to reduced growth might be just about acceptable to democratic governments.</p> <p>If, however, the multiplier is 1.7, then the same initial public spending cut of 1 per cent of GDP would reduce real output by 1.7 per cent. The second round effects of this reduction in output would reduce tax or raise transfers by 0.68 per cent. The net overall improvement in the budget deficit would therefore be only 0.32 per cent. The economy would be in recession, and the budget deficit would hardly improve at all. Even if this were acceptable to governments, it would not be acceptable for very long to their electorates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:48:59.349Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085523a58f96784ee2908c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:08:09.268Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I've already posted some reaction to the David Cameron speech (or pre-reaction, because it was available before the full text of the speech was published).

Rather than simply shift from offending to not offending like an electrical switch, people who offend tend to lead chaotic lives and slip in and out of trouble with the law.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is better measured in whether people are reoffending less seriously or less frequently than before. But that kind of progress would not be measured under current proposals, which raises questions as to what success any providers will be able to produce.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.rapt.org.uk/news22102012.html\">From Mike Trace, chief executive of the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome that David Cameron has made clear his determination to focus on \u2018making prison work\u2019 using effective rehabilitation, but this policy will only work if the government scales up its commitment to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes in prisons that actually succeed in reducing reoffending. It is clear from our analysis that ensuring prisoners get access to good quality drug treatment programmes will significantly help deliver the results he seeks.</p> <p>An intensive recovery approach cuts costs as well as crime. For every 100 individuals, the RAPt programme saves \u00a36.3 million on re-sentencing and re-incarcerating. This would equate to savings of \u00a3440 million a year if the programme was offered to just 10% of drug dependent prisoners.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Rhodri Davies, policy manager at the Charities Aid Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is right that payment by results contracts have potential to help charities use their expertise to tackle intractable social problems such as reoffending.</p> <p>But ministers need to improve the way these contracts are designed so charities are not simply squeezed out in favour of large private sector providers. Most charities simply cannot afford to take on contracts to tackle social problems without up-front funding because they are not allowed to carry large financial reserves and have limited access to capital compared to for-profit businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:13:00.309Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50854e4a58f96784ee2908c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:46:51.036Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a Guardian video with an extract from Cameron's speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"David Cameron on crime: 'Offenders need and deserve punishment' - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5085407dc0e343ef1abc7e21\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:24:20.524Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20022794\">David Cameron has claimed that being \"tough but intelligent\" will be the hallmark of his approach to law and order</a>.</strong> In a wide-ranging speech on law and order which he used to announce the extension of payment-by-results prisoner rehabilitation, Cameron said that the best approach to criminal justice combined punishment with rehabilitation. \"It's not a case of 'prison works' or 'prison doesn't work' - we need to make prison work,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has dismissed some of the government's recent difficulties as \"processology\" and said that he is focusing on the \"big picture\".</strong> This is what he said when asked about claims that the government was losing its grip.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to focus on the big picture.

Around 45% of the inmates are currently in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programmes. <br>The visit allowed the prime minister to view first hand a group putting into action his vision of charities, voluntary groups and private companies providing rehabilitation services to help turn prisoners' lives around and stop them reoffending. <br>Cameron insisted that a lack of money was not an issue in bringing down the reoffending rate, saying that extending payment-by-results schemes for those helping to rehabilitate prisoners would refocus existing resources. <br>In one of the prison's courtyards, the prime minister said: \"We have got to do more for less, every place here costs \u00a340,000, there are 600 staff that work in this prison - it's not a shortage of money, it's that we haven't been focusing people on what really matters, which is the results.\" <br>Asked if it was a gamble to use private companies and charities to plug gaps, Cameron said: \"We spend billions of pounds on prison and probation but we are not getting the right results. <br>\"In terms of getting charities to do more, it's happening now. I've just been sitting in a cell with a very good drug rehab charity that's working with prisoners trying to get them off drugs, get them clean. <br>\"If that works then that prisoner won't be costing us all that money, won't be robbing houses and causing chaos and won't be returning to our prison system.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f14c585-3a7f-4311-94c3-0060b4b1aecc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350910653478/fea47c7f-4c26-47af-a337-3c8a26077c50-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron at Wormwood Scrubs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain's prime minister David Cameron (right) is escorted by prison governor Phil Taylor as he arrives at Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London on 22 October 2012.

They are expected to know what they think, and to be principled and consistent. Yet we (at least, we in the media) are also always expecting them to say something new. It's a hard ask.</p> <p>Today Cameron managed to package his thoughts about law and order into a coherent whole quite effectively. He covered most aspects of the criminal justice system. But, as a speech, it did not really pass the \"new\" test at all. Cameron has been talking about the need for better rehabilitation and the advantages of payment-by-results for years and, although he did announce a national roll-out today, the whole point of piloting these programmes is to pave the way for national implementation, and so this did not come as a huge surprise. (And, by the way, the Peterborough scheme praised by Chris Grayling this morning - see 10.09am - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/mar/19/investors-pay-for-prisoner-rehabilitation\">was launched under Labour.)</a> Cameron also rattled through various \"tougher penalty\" measures, but almost all of them had been trailed before.</p> <p>Politicians can solved the consistent/new dilemma by dreaming up a fresh slogan to explain their approach and Cameron had a go at this. He would be \"tough but intelligent\", he said. Fine.

rhetoric about reducing crime.</p> <p>And, while Tony Blair had all the resources of Government behind him in 1997 to deliver his tough on crime tough on the causes of crime policy, we no longer have that luxury \u2013 and even with all the resources, Blair gave us 3,000 new criminal offences, 25,000 more prisoners and he failed to address entirely the Tough on the Causes of Crime part of the policy at all.</p> <p>Blair left us with even more of the high-crime, inner-city housing estates that existed when he came to power, and with precisely the same degree of unemployment, school exclusions, poor parenting, drug misuse and gang cultures existing when he left.</p> <p>Forced by a lack of resources to fund his policy Cameron is turning to the private and voluntary sector to help him deliver his \u2018Tough But Intelligent\u2019 policy to be announced later today, relying on a \u2018Payments By Results\u2019 method of funding it \u2013 but behind the scenes I can tell you there are huge arguments about what the \u2018Payment By Results\u2019 mechanism actually means \u2013 what \u2018results\u2019 amount to \u2018results\u2019, who assesses those \u2018results\u2019 and what level of \u2018payment\u2019 are we talking about here?</p> </blockquote> <p>From Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This speech was an opportunity to regain the momentum promised at the start of the coalition government to drive forward a genuine rehabilitation revolution to cut crime, prioritise prevention and reduce the damaging levels of reoffending. The danger is the intelligent bit gets lost at the expense of sounding tough.</p> <p>A truly smart approach would be to focus on offenders making amends for their wrongdoing, treating drug and alcohol addictions that can fuel crime and getting ex-offenders back into real work. Much of this relies on wider society \u2013 organisations and people outside of the criminal justice system. The real strength of the Prime Minister\u2019s 2006 so-called \u2018hug a hoodie speech\u2019 is that it recognised that criminal justice and social justice are inextricably linked. Yet several years on, the criminal justice system still often picks up the pieces when others have failed, the high levels of children in care who end up in our youth justice system are a telling example of this ...</p> <p>Criminal Justice Alliance organisations, working in prisons and with offenders and their families in the community, report that prison overcrowding and budget cuts mean rehabilitation is being undermined. Making governors more accountable for what happens after prison is welcome, but this will backfire without efforts to curb huge prison overcrowding that blights much of the positive work in prisons. Overcrowding extracts a heavy price from prisoners, prison staff and voluntary sector working to cut reoffending, and ultimately harms communities to which ex-prisoners will return.</p> <p>The Prime Minister\u2019s speech comes the week after the Chief Inspector of Prisons said that in order to deliver a rehabilitation revolution, government needs to reduce numbers of people in prison or invest more in prison budgets.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/10/cameron-tries-to-avoid-crisis-management-with-tough-crime-announcement/\">From Isabel Hardman at Coffee House</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s clear the government has had a bad week when the Prime Minister pops up on a Monday with a crowd-pleasing policy announcement. Recent re-launches have been shared by senior Lib Dems and Tories following the collapse of Lords reform, for example, to demonstrate that the Coalition is still working well. But today, the Lib Dems are nowhere to be seen: the Prime Minister\u2019s big crime announcement is a response to a terrible week for the Conservative party, rather than the coalition as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/toughbutintelligent.html\">From Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speech is being presented by some in the media as a response to the Government\u2019s difficult week but, in reality, the speech and whole approach has long been in the pipeline. Chris Grayling was thinking about a rehabilitation revolution when he was Shadow Home Secretary. Working with Nick Herbert and the Centre for Social Justice the Tory leadership was interested in reducing reoffending rates for most of the last seven years.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is nothing intelligent or tough about cutting frontline police officers, reducing the power of judges to give tough sentences or cutting support for innocent victims of crime.</p> <p>This is nothing more than a smokescreen to try and cover up Andrew Mitchell losing his job on Friday and 29 wasted months of dithering on law and order. This out of touch Government must think the public are stupid - it\u2019s these kind of actions that makes the public so cynical about politicians.</p> <p>Rehashed announcements, rushed legislation and ill-thought out and evidence-free policies risk undermining public confidence in our criminal justice system.</p> <p>This is empty rhetoric from a weak Prime Minister of an incompetent government, designed only to keep rebellious Tory MPs happy rather than what works in keeping our communities safe.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm off to the Number 10 briefing now.

I've taken the quotes from<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Grayling said that too many prisoners were released without being given help to stop them reoffending.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The reality at the moment, all too often, is that we release somebody on to the streets after prison, with \u00a346 in their pocket, relatively little, if any, support. Probation officers do good work with those who have been in prison for longer periods; those who\u2019ve been in prison for shorter periods get no support at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-14028358\">a pilot payment-by-results rehabilitation scheme in Peterborough</a> had been a success.</strong> He had been to visit this scheme, he said. \"First indications are very encouraging,\" he went on. \"We get the detailed statistics this month, but from what I\u2019ve seen so far, I\u2019m very encouraged that it does indeed work.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted private companies and charities to be involved in running payment-by-results rehabilitation programmes.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected suggestions that providers would be incentivised to fiddle the figures.</strong> \"In many ways the measurements for payment-by-results in criminal justice are very binary,\" he said. \"Do you reoffend or don\u2019t you? if you're back in court, back in a police cell, then it\u2019s not worked and the providers don\u2019t get paid.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said former offenders could play an important role in rehabilitation programmes.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve seen examples in community projects of former offenders, perhaps former gang members, mentoring younger offenders to say, \u2018Well look, I\u2019ve been through it all, I\u2019ve gone straight - there\u2019s a better place to be.' That can be enormously powerful, and you\u2019ve got a lot of that in the voluntary sector.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, having promoted payment-by-results in the work programme as welfare minister, he was keen to apply the same principle in the justice system.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was \"very silly\" of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20020451\">Lord Blair, the former Metropolitan police commissioner, to say that people should not vote in the police commissioner elections</a></strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s a very silly thing to say.

That is just a \"sterile debate\", he will say. See 9.07am. (Unfortunately, this passage of the speech just sounds like a pale imitation of Tony Blair's \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". Cameron might have been better just adopting that slogan wholesale.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that criminals deserve \"retribution\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Retribution is not a dirty word, it is important to society that revulsion against crime is properly recognised.</p> </blockquote> <p>(The use of the word \"retribution\" is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\">one of the elements of the speech that excited the Mail on Sunday </a>because of its Old Testament overtones, but Cameron just seems to be using it as another word for punishment.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that prisoners need rehabilitation because \"being tough isn't a successful strategy in itself\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Come with me to any prison in this country.</p> <p>There you\u2019ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars.</p> <p>But you\u2019ll also meet young men who can\u2019t read, teenagers on drugs, people who\u2019ve never worked a day in their life.</p> <p>These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem.</p> <p>Recognising this isn\u2019t soft, or liberal.</p> <p>It\u2019s common sense.</p> <p>We\u2019ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime.</p> <p>Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime \u2013 everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say the government will extend \"payment-by-results\" as a means of providing prisoner rehabilitation.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When this government came to power we were spending \u00a340,000 a year just on banging people up.</p> <p>With payment by results, your money goes into what works\u2026</p> <p>\u2026prisoners going straight, crime coming down, our country getting safer.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a good idea I want to put rocket boosters under it\u2026</p> <p>\u2026indeed today I have an announcement to make.</p> <p>By the end of 2015, I want to see payment by results spread right across rehabilitation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that rehabilitation programmes will be offered to prisoners serving short sentences, not just to offenders who have been jailed for a year or more, as happens now.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that tackling crime is part of the \"aspiration nation\" agenda he set out in his party conference speech.</strong> \"We will not rise as a country if we leave millions behind and write off whole communities,\" he will say.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:05:34.473Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5084fea658f96784ee2908a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:07:02.151Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron is going to give a speech on law and order later today and in it he is going to complain that politicians who speak on criminal justice are either portrayed as authoritarian, bang-\u2019em-up merchants or soppy liberals.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many people, I\u2019m the person associated with those three words, two of which begin with \u2018H\u2019, and one of which is \u2018hoodie\u2019\u2026</p> <p>\u2026even though I never actually said it.</p> <p>For others, I\u2019m the politician who has argued for tough punishment.</p> <p>So do I take a tough line on crime \u2013 or a touchy-feely one?</p> <p>In no other public debate do the issues get polarised like this.</p> <p>On climate change you don\u2019t have to be in denial or campaigning to get every car off the road.</p> <p>Life isn\u2019t that simple \u2013 so government policy isn\u2019t that simple.</p> <p>And yet with the crime debate, people seem to want it black or white.</p> <p>Lock \u2018em up or let \u2018em out.</p> <p>Blame the criminal or blame society.</p> <p>\u2018Be tough\u2019 or \u2018act soft\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron will argue that this binary approach is simplistic and he will say that he wants to \u201cmove the debate on\u201d. But, judging by the way the speech has been reported so far, he\u2019s not having much luck. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\">The speech was previewed in the Mail on Sunday yesterday in a story that suggested it was all about hellfire-and-damnation authoritarianism. </a>The headline read:<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\"> \"</a>Cameron: 'It's time to mug a hoodie.'\"&#xa0;Having read the speech extracts released overnight, I see that it\u2019s not like that all; it\u2019s mostly about promoting more prisoner rehabilitation by extending the payment-by-results scheme.

  "<p>HELLO! WHAT IS THIS? THE WORK OF A FEVERED MIND, TAKING A BREAK FROM FASHIONING TINFOIL HATS TO SAY SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET? WELL, MAYBE. BUT TODAY IS ALSO <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/121122/YAD-KCOL-SPAC\" title=\"\">INTERNATIONAL CAPS LOCK DAY</a>. O, FRABJOUS DAY \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_lock#International_Caps_Lock_Day\" title=\"\">REJOICE</a>!</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_lock\" title=\"\">Caps lock</a>: a tiny button with the ability to entirely change the tone of whatever missive you're crafting at your word processor. What does caps lock mean? It means you are SERIOUS, that you wish to impart information of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE, that the reader WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS. It means you are SHOUTING, usually borderline racist nonsense beneath a YouTube video. It is largely, but not exclusively, the preserve of the unhinged in the comments section. It is a warning, a SIGN, a useful calling card: HERE BE DRAGONS.</p> <p>A quick search on Amazon throws up this $83 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Control-Christian-Marriages-Priesthood-Children/dp/1425992609\" title=\"\">BIRTH CONTROL IS SINFUL IN THE CHRISTIAN MARRIAGES and also ROBBING GOD OF PRIESTHOOD CHILDREN!!</a> by Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson. Aside from her fearlessness in using caps and double exclamation marks in the title, Strong-Anderson made the bold choice to write the book entirely in capital letters. This is either mad, or genius (reserve your judgment until you have read the book, I say).</p> <p>As someone who grew up on comics and graphic novels, I was always interested to note that the speech bubbles almost always featured all caps. Back then, there were no connotations of caps being shouty. The characters spoke only in urgent cap locks, from my favourite of all time (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider_%28comics%29\" title=\"\">Ghost Rider</a> \u2013 no judgment, please) to the camptastic POW! and BLAM! of the 1960s Batman series. When I saw Christopher Nolan's latest incarnation of the Dark Knight, I liked to think the growly, terse tone Christian Bale used while in costume was his way of capping it up for the screen. It was his way of saying \"BANG!\" and \"WHAMM!\" in these more straitlaced, serious times.</p> <p>Can a work of great literary value be written in all caps? Could you imagine Brideshead Revisited as BRIDESHEAD REVISITED? Could you see a quiet, contemplative book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/25/fiction.features2\" title=\"\">The Amateur Marriage by Anne Tyler</a>, say, written ENTIRELY IN ALL CAPS? The thought stirs up the beginnings of a migraine. It certainly works more often the other way around \u2013 from authors who stylise their names in diminutive lowercase (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings\" title=\"\">e e cummings</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks\" title=\"\">bell hooks</a>, for example), to those who write entire passages in lowercase. Half of John Green and David Levithan's recent book, <a href=\"http://johngreenbooks.com/will-grayson/\" title=\"\">Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a>, is written in lowercase to delineate which of the two protagonists (both with the same name) is speaking. Humorist Don Marquis's collection of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy_and_Mehitabel\" title=\"\">archy and mehitabel</a> columns were written entirely in lowercase \u2013 archy, a free verse poet, was also a cockroach, and lacked the strength to use the shift key on the typewriter.</p> <p>Caps locks are, for me, a nice, useful and occasional way of drawing attention to something. They make a noise and very quickly sit down again. They are a shorthand for drama and intense bursts of activity. International Caps Lock Day is a lovely thought, though. It's here for a short time, a good, noisy time. And then it goes away again. MARVELLOUS.</p>",

  "<p>Britain has ended a 10-year diplomatic boycott imposed on a controversial Indian politician accused of failing to stop anti-Muslim rioting that left at least a thousand people dead.</p> <p>Sir James Bevan, the British high commissioner, spent 50 minutes with Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, in the western Indian state's capital of Gandhinagar on Monday morning. The conversation is understood to have been focused on business and investment.</p> <p>Bevan said the encounter had been \"open, positive and constructive\" and that under discussion were ways to \"develop co-operation between the UK and Gujarat across a very broad range of fields, including education, science and innovation, energy and climate change, and trade and investment.\"</p> <p>Modi, from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, is a divisive figure in India. Some see him as an extremist who sided with mobs who attacked Muslims in towns and cities across Gujarat, following a lethal fire supposedly started by Muslims on a train full of Hindu pilgrims in 2002 \u2013 a charge he denies.</p> <p>Others, including some of the most powerful industrialists in India, say he is an effective, honest administrator who has introduced policies that have boosted development and reduced poverty during three successive terms as chief minister.</p> <p>The 2002 violence led to a de facto travel ban imposed on Modi by the UK, the US and some European nations, as well as the boycott by all but junior officials. In 2005, Modi was refused a US visa as someone held responsible for a serious violation of religious freedom. The British decision to break ranks was described by local journalists as \"<a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE89A0UB20121011\" title=\"\">a major boost to the pro-business leader's quest for mainstream acceptance</a>\".</p> <p>When announcing the move earlier this month, Hugo Swire, the British foreign minister, said it was \"<a href=\"http://ukinindia.fco.gov.uk/en/news/?view=News&amp;id=821126582\" title=\"\">in line with the British government's stated objective of improving bilateral relations with India</a>\".</p> <p>Modi welcomed the announcement by posting a message on Twitter saying: \"God is great.\"</p> <p>Prof Shiv Visvanathan, a respected anthropologist involved with the legal campaign against Modi, said that the timing of the decision was surprising. \"If they had waited a bit longer, the UK's record on human rights would have been better preserved,\" he said.</p> <p>British officials in Delhi explained that a recent court decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge Modi for the violence of 2002, in which three British nationals died, had influenced the timing of the decision.</p> <p>However, Indian commentators were scathing, accusing Britain of moving in order to ingratiate themselves with a potential leader of India. Modi consistently tops polls of India's most popular politicians and is spoken of as a prime ministerial candidate for the BJP, the main opposition. National elections are not due until 2014, but could come much sooner if coalition partners of the ruling Congress party withdraw their support.</p> <p>\"Strictly speaking, the British Foreign ... Office can argue that direct complicity has yet to be established. [Modi's] lack of contrition is outweighed by his rising profile as a possible ministerial candidate. Discretion is, after all, the better part of valour,\" wrote KC Singh in Outlook magazine.</p> <p>Significant private sector investment in Gujarat from the UK and elsewhere also appears to have been a major factor. A British official in Delhi said: \"This is about Gujarat, not about who is chief minister. One reason is to broaden and advance commercial interests. There are opportunity costs to not engaging. But we are looking forward not back. There is a large Gujarati immigrant community in Britain.\"</p> <p>Bevan said he had reaffirmed \"the British government's wish to ensure justice for the families of the three British citizens who were killed in the 2002 riots\" and had raised broader questions of human rights in his discussion with Modi.</p> <p>\"This is about the power of the diaspora,\" said Visvanathan. \"However, I am confident Modi's era will close. The law of the land will prevail.\" A former member of Modi's cabinet was recently convicted of murder and jailed for 28 years for having a leading role in the 2002 violence, in which as many as 2,500 may have died.</p> <p>Witnesses described Maya Kodnani handing out swords to Hindus in the riots. She was later appointed as minister for women and child development. The Gujerati government has always maintained that the violence was spontaneous and did not involve local officials.</p>",
  "<p>We have now come to the end of the Guardian's formal four-year integrated development project in the Ugandan rural community of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine\">Katine</a>.</p> <p>Given the recognition that development is a long-term process and cannot fit neatly into any timeframe, a review of the project has led to a commitment to maintain support for the community until the end of 2013.</p> <p>It has also been agreed to investigate the possibility of setting up a long-term development fund in partnership with the community so that there are resources to call on in times of emergency.</p> <p>When the Guardian launched the project in October 2007, in partnership with NGO <a href=\"http://www.amref.org/\">Amref</a> and Barclays, we committed to demonstrate on a dedicated website the complexities that arise when trying to transform an impoverished African community.</p> <p>A combination of donations from Guardian readers, match-funded by Barclays, raised more than \u00a33m to pay for the project that has taken a holistic approach to development, focusing on education, health, water and sanitation, farming methods and new income-generating opportunities, together with community empowerment to increase engagement in local governance to achieve sustainability.</p> <p>Amref's work has been subjected to unprecedented scrutiny by journalists and the public. Every aspect of its work has been reported and its budgets and expenditure published and often debated online.</p> <p>While it is no longer feasible to commit the same resources to reporting on the project, the Guardian has a commitment to regularly visit Katine to update readers.</p> <p>An independent evaluator, who has been monitoring the project, completed a final report in November 2011, shortly after the completion of the four-year term. It focuses on technical achievements, the formation of sustainable community groups and the progress of activities against both objectives and outcomes. </p> <p>The consultant talked to a range of stakeholders and community members in Katine. Observational visits, one-to-one meetings, both informal and formal discussions at district, sub\u2013county and village level and focus group interviews were held. </p> <p>The key findings were that achievements against outcome indicators show that in every case but two (increasing family planning, and births attended by a skilled attendant), the project reached the target, and, in 18 of the 33 indicators for health, education, water and livelihoods, the target was exceeded. </p> <p>Further investigation of the outcomes against the relevant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\">Millennium development goals</a> and Ugandan national targets shows a similar picture: 16 of the 23 targets were exceeded. </p> <p>The purpose of the community empowerment component was to strengthen local governance using a rights\u2013based approach, and it was found that all committees in local government had been trained and strengthened to operate effectively, and all have submitted plans to the district authorities. This component is the linchpin for sustainability.<br> The project provided training, technical support and supervision as well as monitoring and evaluation support to community health structures. More people are testing for HIV, and those who have the virus are able to access suitable drugs. </p> <p>Immunisation is offered against measles, polio, tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria. BCG vaccination levels are at 100 per cent, measles, polio and DPT3 are all at 80 per cent and above. </p> <p>The success of the vaccination programme can be attributed to the outreach work of community vaccinators who take immunisation services directly to people's homes. </p> <p>School management and governance committees are in place in all 15 schools in Katine. Parent/teacher associations (PTAs) and school management committees (SMCs) were inactive at project start-up. Each school in Katine now has a development plan, and PTAs and SMCs meet regularly to follow up their implementation and assess progress being made to improve performance and facilities in schools. </p> <p>Enrolment has increased by 29 per cent since the project started. More girls are now enrolling in school and, for the first time, in 2009-10 and 2011 the number of girls exceeded the number of boys.</p> <p>The five Katine primary schools \u2013 typically thatched\u2013roofed open rooms with earth floors and without furniture \u2013 were funded wholly by the local community. Teachers' salaries were paid by the community. But, thanks to the project, all are now under the control of the government.</p> <p>Achievements in water and sanitation are outstanding. There is a major increase in the availability of safe water sources (boreholes, shallow wells and rainwater harvesting), from 42% to 93% of the community. The number of latrines in homes and schools has increased from 350 to 4,077. Of extreme importance is the re\u2013establishment of water source committees (WSCs), which ensure the successful operation and management of the new water facilities. </p> <p>Each village within the Katine sub-county now has a farmers' group to improve practices, such as introducing new varieties and increasing crop yields. Groundnut seeds, upland rice, vegetable seeds, sunflower seed and cassava planting material were provided during each year of the programme. </p> <p>To strengthen the ability of rural institutions to access advisory services and markets for their produce, a co-operative was launched to co-ordinate farmers' groups, manage the produce store, support the groups in marketing activities, oversee the animal health service provision and assess the quality of farm produce. A farmers' produce store was fully established in August 2011, employing two staff.</p> <p>The voluntary savings and loans associations (VSLA) programme, funded with a separate grant by Barclays Bank, is a rapidly expanding, highly systematic approach to saving and financial planning. Most of the 152 known VSLA groups in Katine are now well established, and there is now a small cadre of village agents who, having completed two cycles of savings themselves, help groups set up both in Katine and in surrounding sub\u2013counties. The VSLAs have led to modest but significant improvement in household income. </p> <p>There were several recommendations arising from evaluation, including the need for an improved plan for monitoring and evaluation at the start of any project and a recommendation for a review of the VSLA groups.</p>",
  "<p>Fidel Castro has proved he is not only alive but still kicking with a scathing attack on the \"imperialist media\" for spreading rumours that he was either dead or in a neuro-vegetative state.</p> <p>Accompanying a photograph of him reading last Friday's edition of the Cuban Communist party newspaper, the 86-year-old revolutionary issued a personal health bulletin in which he described reports that he had suffered a stroke as \"nonsense\" and claimed he did not even suffer from headaches.</p> <p>The article \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/fidel-castro-ruz/2012/10/22/fidel-castro-esta-agonizando/\" title=\"\">sarcastically entitled \"Fidel Castro is in his death throes\"</a> \u2013 followed a week of rumours about Castro's demise, following his apparent failure to publicly congratulate his ally and friend Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for winning the Venezuelan presidential election on 7 October.</p> <p>The former president of Cuba had not been seen in public since March, when he met Pope Benedict, and had not made a statement since June, when he published the last of what had been a regular column called Reflections.</p> <p>Since he handed power to his brother, Ra\u00fal, in 2006 citing health reasons, there have been repeated false alarms about Fidel Castro's health. But the speculation hit a new level of intensity last week thanks to social networks, the Cuban diaspora and a doctor who claimed to have inside information.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Marquina reportedly lives in Spain, practises in Florida and is neither a specialist in oncology nor neurology, but was widely quoted as saying Castro was in a neuro-vegetative state. \"He has suffered an embolic stroke and recognises absolutely no one,\" he told reporters last week.</p> <p>Marquina \u2013 who says he has close connections inside the Venezuelan medical community \u2013 gained a huge online following earlier in the year for reports that Ch\u00e1vez's cancer had spread to his liver, which would make it difficult for him to campaign. His comments on both leaders have been carried by the Miami Herald and Spain's rightwing ABC newspaper among others.</p> <p>Last week, Castro's children and the Cuban government dismissed the rumours of a deadly or debilitating stroke as \"absurd\". On Thursday, the Cuban media published a congratulatory message from Castro to a medical school on its 50th anniversary. At the weekend, the former Venezuelan vice-president El\u00edas Jaua said he had met Castro for five hours and showed photographs of the encounter in Havana.</p> <p>\"He had the courtesy of bringing me to the hotel,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/21/fidel-castro-appearance-cuba\" title=\"\">Jaua told Associated Press</a>, adding that Castro looked \"very well\". Staff at the Hotel Nacional said the former president's health was \"great\" and that he was \"coherent and affectionate\" to employees.</p> <p>This failed to quash the rumours, especially after Castro failed to vote in person during Sunday's municipal elections.</p> <p>The state-run Trabajadores newspaper reported that Castro had sent in an absentee ballot from his home \u2013 a right it said was extended to all citizens with \"impediments\".</p> <p>\"I don't understand anything. If they said #FidelCastro was at Hotel Nacional, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoanisanchez/status/260169854454231041\" title=\"\">why didn't he go to the Electoral College, to vote</a>?\" asked a dissident blogger, Yoani Sanchez, in a tweet.</p> <p>Castro has now waded directly into the debate with a strident article that characteristically goes far beyond suggesting reports of his death have been somewhat exaggerated.</p> <p>\"Although many people are taken in by the mass media, almost all of which are in the hands of the privileged and wealthy who publish this nonsense, fewer and fewer believe in them,\" he wrote, singling out the \"Venezuelan doctor\" and ABC for criticism.</p> <p>Castro said Cuba had been the victim of a misinformation campaign for more than half a century, referring to the recent 50th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p> <p>Less characteristic was his self-effacing explanation for why he stopped writing a regular column. \"I stopped writing Reflections because it is no longer my role to fill up newspaper pages that should be devoted to other national tasks,\" he said.</p> <p>He signed off with a final poke at those who reported his demise. \"I don't even remember what it feels like to have a headache,\" he writes. \"To prove how much they lie, see the photos accompanying this article.\"</p> <p>The images are credited to his son Alex. One shows him raising his arm in an orchard, wearing a red and blue check shirt, a broad-brimmed straw hat and supported by a metal walking stick. In another, he is reading Friday's edition of Granma.</p> <p>On Monday morning, residents of Havana said they had also seen TV images of Castro at home.</p> <p>\"Last week, I thought he was dead. That's what everyone on the street was saying. But today on TV, he was very well,\" said Carmen Gonce, a retired journalist. \"In Cuba, we are great fantasists. People say many things. Sometimes they are true. Sometimes they are not.\"</p> <h2>Undead Again</h2> <p>Fidel Castro may well hold the world record for not dying in the face of rumours insisting otherwise.</p> <p>In 1957, the New York Times ran a piece declaring: \"Castro is alive.\" It followed a two-month silence by Castro, then described as the \"rebel leader of Cuba's youth\" against General Batista. \"Because of the complete censorship, Havana and the other Cuban cities crackle with the most astonishing rumours. One constantly encouraged by the government has been that Fidel Castro is dead,\" the correspondent noted.</p> <p>The rumours have continued on and off ever since, rising in intensity as Castro aged.</p> <p>In 2004, under the headline: \"Rumours of Castro's death sweep Miami-Dade \u2013 again,\" the Miami Herald said the Cuban expatriate community was abuzz with rumours that Castro had died or suffered a stroke, following comments by the mayor of Bogota that he appeared to be \"very sick\" during their meeting. The Cuban American National Foundation said it received 100 calls about Castro's demise.</p> <p>\"It's wishful thinking,\" the executive director, Joe Garcia, told the paper. \"But it's got to be right some time.\"</p> <p>In 2007, the blogger known as Perez Hilton claimed that an announcement about Castro's death would be released at 4pm on 24 August. The rumour was based on a drill by the Miami police department for the street parties they are expecting when Castro dies. The chief of police in Miami denied his forces were on alert. \"Since I've been here, Fidel has died four times already,\" he told the Wall Street Journal.</p>",
  "<p>It might seem odd but I, a convinced atheist, have recently completed a 10-day fast based on the Hindu festival of <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Navratri-2012-Temples-pandals-get-ready-to-host-ashtami-navami-rush/articleshow/16907754.cms\" title=\"\">Navratri</a>, which is being celebrated this week. Fasting is refraining from eating at all, or more usually certain proscribed foods.</p> <p>These days, if we limit what we eat, it is almost certainly because we are trying to lose weight, detox or realise some kind of health benefit. The idea that we might seek to forgo certain foods for moral improvement seems bizarrely anachronistic. The penance of Catholic Lent and Friday fasting make as little sense to most of us as the once common idea that food should be avoided after a death for fear that food around the deceased would be impure.</p> <p>But there are some real lessons we can learn from spiritual disciplines around food. For the Benedictine former abbot Christopher Jamison, only eating certain things at certain times is a way of countering our tendency to slavishly follow our desires. \"It's a way of exercising choice very knowingly,\" he told me, \"and at the same time a way of exercising discipline around food.\" Similarly, the Buddhist abbot Ajahn Sucitto says that too often eating becomes just one of those \"compulsive activities which on a functional level are not necessary. We do it just because of a psychological habit.\"</p> <p>For reasons like this, I thought fasting was worth a try and Navratri \u2013 literally meaning nine nights in Sanskrit \u2013 looked like a good model. It heralds the start of autumn, and is dedicated to Shakti, the deity responsible for creation. My rules were that I would eat three meals a day, with no snacking in between of any kind. I would forgo meat, seafood and dairy products and would not drink alcohol or eat sweets or cakes. I would strive to eat each meal mindfully and thankfully and on the last evening would have some kind of feast, a celebration of the pleasure and variety of good food rather than an excessive gorging. The idea can be summed up as countering the bad A of automaticity with the three good As of right appreciation, right autonomy and right action.</p> <p>I found the 10 days extremely rewarding. It wasn't meant to be a trial, and when I did feel hungry I reminded myself that such feelings pass, and unless we're really starving, we can always choose to wait until our next meal.</p> <p>I'm not the only atheist learning from religious fasting. The philosopher <a href=\"http://jamesgarveyactually.wordpress.com/philosophers-mag/\" title=\"\">James Garvey</a>, my successor as editor of the Philosophers' Magazine, has also followed a version of the Ramadan fast several times. \"There is some sort of discovery of a part of yourself involved, or maybe a discovery associated with the human experience,\" he told me, \"a feeling of being in control of your appetites for once. I can see why so many religions do it.\"</p> <p>I've become quietly evangelical about it. Some people have no trouble controlling their appetites or just don't care much for food. But I suspect most of us eat too thoughtlessly too often. I plan to repeat my fast twice a year, around the spring and autumnal equinoxes. The next one starts on 14 March. I'd be happy for you to join me.</p>",
  "<p>In 2011, Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) announced that it would undergo a five-year transformation programme designed to ensure that it is sustainable in the long-term, despite the inexorable decline of print sales and advertising. In order to fund the creation of new digital platforms, it announced its intention to make cost savings of \u00a325 million. </p> <p>While the community programme remains a priority for GNM, the financial pressure the organisation is under led to a reduction in the community budget for 2011-12 and it will fall again in 2012/13. </p> <p>Spending on community projects, including salaries, fell from \u00a3140,000 in 2010-11 to \u00a385,000 for the last financial year. Of this, \u00a355,000 was spent directly on community projects and support in 2011-12, with this figure expected to fall to \u00a333,000 in the current financial year (excluding volunteering week costs).</p> <p>Given these constraints, the sustainability department has been looking for innovative ways of supporting our partners, leading to more creative collaborations such as matching volunteer skills to organisations and a better use of existing resources, for example allowing partners to use conference and meeting rooms for events.</p> <p>Project highlights during the last financial year included <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/live-north\">the Live Magazine summer project</a> and the co-delivery of a Level 2 Business BTEC with <a href=\"http://www.globalgeneration.org.uk/\">Global Generation</a>.</p> <p>There were also a number of smaller projects such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-age-uk-camden\">Age UK Camden's Great Croft centre</a> teaching staff how to make Christmas decorations for the company Christmas tree and sessions run in our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/gnmeducationcentre\">Education centre</a> with <a href=\"http://www.socialmobility.org.uk/\">Social Mobility Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openingdoorslondon.org.uk/\">Opening Doors</a>, Global Generation and the construction trainees from Bemerton Villages Management Organisations. To read more about this year's projects, see the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-community-partners-overview \">overview of year's activities section</a>.</p> <p>The sustainability team is not just focused on creating new ways to engage the organisation with its communities but also on ensuring that it demonstrates how these activities benefit our colleagues. We will be developing targets for 2012-15 that will help us achieve this deeper integration with business aims and objectives by helping to develop new skills within GNM. </p> <p>The last year saw the first independent monitoring and evaluation of the community programme, which was a key objective for 2011-12. You can read more about how Acona's methodology was developed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/blog/community-sustainability-shared-value\">here</a> and the findings from this year's report are discussed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainability/sustainability-report-2012-community-monitoring-evaluation \">here</a>. </p> <p>Overall, the number of staff volunteers fell during the last financial year to 210 people, who contributed 1,741 hours. This is equivalent to 13% of staff volunteering. This compared with 307 volunteers and 4,268 hours the previous year when 24% of staff volunteered. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171387\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350663445955/Volunteering_numbers.png\" alt=\"Volunteer_numbers\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>This was largely due to the postponement of volunteering week 2012 from March to September because of company-wide restructuring that took place in March 2011. As a result, the department was unable to meet two key objectives for 2011/12 \u2013 to grow volunteers and hold volunteering week.</p> <p>However, if the numbers from volunteering week for 2010-11 are excluded, the figures for 2011-12 show a similar number of staff volunteering for projects that form our community programme. The figure for 2011-12 of 210 staff compares with 207 staff volunteering in 2010-11.</p> <p>For 2011-12, this figure breaks down to 166 staff volunteering for projects that form part of our ongoing community programme and with 49 taking part in team away days.</p> <p>One highlight of the year was a major award for our payroll-giving scheme, which is one of the most popular in the country. GNM was awarded the platinum award quality mark in recognition of the fact that 26% of staff supported 195 charities, giving a total of \u00a383,320.08.

  "<p>An Amazon Kindle user has had her account wiped and all her paid-for books deleted by Amazon without warning or explanation.</p> <p>The Norwegian woman, identified only as Linn on media commentator <a href=\"http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/\" title=\"Martin Bekkelund blog\">Martin Bekkelund's blog</a>, approached Amazon when she realised her Kindle had been wiped.</p> <p>She was informed by a customer relations executive that her account had been closed, all open orders had been cancelled and all her content had been removed, but has been unable to find out why.</p> <p>The move, which will shock ebook fans, highlights the power digital rights management (DRM) offers blue-chip companies. DRM is used by hardware manufacturers and publishers to limit the use of digital content once it has been purchased by consumers; in Amazon's case, it means the company can prevent you from reading content you have bought at the Kindle store on a rival device.</p> <p>Linn was told by Amazon: \"We have found your account is directly related to another which has been previously closed for abuse of our policies.

What isn't ambiguous is Kitty the Lion's pop heart, with a near-flawless grasp of melody flowing through their indie-folk veins.</p> <p> <em>SINGAPORE</em>: <a href=\"http://wakingupto.wordpress.com/\"><em>I'm Waking Up to \u2026</em></a><br><a href=\"http://galactica.bandcamp.com\"><strong>Galactica</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://wakingupto.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/galactica-sauls-tighs-singapore.mp3\" title=\"Galactica - Saul's Tighs \"><strong>Saul's Tighs</strong></a><br>In a little-known recess in Singapore's music scene, there existed a group of science fiction aficionados with a common love for the space odyssey Battlestar Galactica. They went on to write some dreamily-inspired shoegaze with titles such as Saul's Tighs and Gaius Is Crying \u2026 Again, referencing series characters Colonel Saul Tigh and Dr Gaius Baltar. While the concept is an inside joke, the music is anything but. Their songcraft and taste in melodies evoke an immense sense of loss in the immeasurable vastness of space. It takes you back to the heyday of science fiction when the music was sprawling and searching, as opposed to present-day equivalents of over-budgeted pyrotechnics.</p> <p> <em>SOUTH KOREA</em>: <a href=\"http://www.koreanindie.com/\"><em>Korean Indie</em></a><br><a href=\"http://404seoul.tumblr.com\"><strong>404</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://map.super45.cl/map-2012-10/404_-_Water_-_South_Korea.mp3\" title=\"404 - Water \"><strong>Water</strong></a><br>Two-piece band 404 comes from the most interesting part of Korea's indie music scene.

More than <a href=\"http://www.bikingbis.com/2012/04/01/20-states-require-motorists-give-3-feet-or-more-when-passing-cyclists/\" title=\"\">20 US states already have laws</a> requiring drivers to give cyclists a margin of at least three feet when overtaking.</p> <p>The XFire BikeLane tail light works by projecting two red laser beams onto the ground either side of the bike. You can tailor the width of your \"lane\" from roughly two to four feet depending on how you angle the unit, and you can choose to have the beams flashing if you want.</p> <p>The lasers have a maximum strength of five milliwatts, about the same as most laser pointers. The BikeLane unit also includes a conventional LED that has two flashing modes.</p> <p>XFire manager, Alex Choi, said the design was inspired by the dangers of cycling in Los Angeles, where he lives:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I commute by bike to work most days, and safety is a serious issue here. You hear about at least one accident every day, and the city has recently passed a law making it mandatory for drivers to give cyclists at least three feet of space.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But do the lights really improve rider safety, or are they just bit of fun? Anticipating the winter nights ahead, I tried out a set.</p> <p>The unit can be easily attached to your seat post (bracket supplied) or clipped to your clothing, though I'm not sure how well-defined your \"bike lane\" would be if the latter. I chose the seat post option.</p> <p>From the rider's perspective, the beams are certainly impressive - a pair of lasers projecting a bright red \"force field\" around your bike makes you feel like something out of Star Wars. But if you're not careful, you could easily spend more time looking at them rather than the road ahead, at least until the novelty wears off.</p> <p>It also occurred to me that having your own \"bike lane\" projected around you might give you a false sense of security, <a href=\"http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/02/helmets_make_cycling_less_safe.php\" title=\"\">as some experts believe is the case with helmets.</a></p> <p>A late night dog walker certainly seemed impressed - or surprised - as I pedaled by. But what did my \"bike lane\" look like from a driver's point of view? My neighbour, who volunteered to follow me in her car for the purposes of the trial, reported that she \"didn't really notice\" the lines, so felt no incentive to give me a wider berth than normal.</p> <p>Her view was echoed by Chris Juden, the senior technical officer at the national cycling charity <a href=\"http://beta.ctc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">CTC</a> , who said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The road will reflect only a small fraction of the light that falls on it. And it'll reflect in all directions - but more back to source than other directions - so only a tiny fraction goes towards the driver.<br>\"Then there's the question of whether the driver is looking at the road surface anyway. Research on driver eye fixation confirms the obvious, that they give most of their attention to potential threats and signals, such as oncoming traffic, crossing traffic, traffic lights and road signs, most of which is offside or high above the road, and only some of which is to the left or down on its surface. So their eyes are mostly up and rightwards. The cyclist's challenge is to grab the driver's attention in the few glances he gives to the nearside.\"</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C3zmby5F33g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C3zmby5F33g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In our video, the \"bike lane\" is more visible when the car draws up close to the bike - but we were filming from the passenger seat, not the driver's position.</p> <p>Juden said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Can the driver even see the nearside road surface? Not very near he can't. My bonnet blocks my view of that part of the road for some distance ahead.<br>\"I think this is a mostly harmless gimmick. I'd rather have the extra light directed somewhere more obviously useful instead.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 The XFire BikeLane light is <a href=\"http://www.highonbikes.com/\" title=\"\">available for \u00a329.95 with free P&amp;P</a></p>",

The market is just saturated,\" said Dan McElhatten, executive creative director at Brand, a Las Vegas advertising firm. \"At this point people are confused. This level of banter is going to numb society.\"</p> <p>A combination of factors has made Nevada the fiercest media front in a year that is <a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/never-to-be-outdone-vegas-sets-record-for-political-ads.html?hp&amp;_r=\" 1&amp;amp\";\">expected to set a new record</a> \u2013 $3.3bn, up from $2.8bn in 2008 \u2013 for nationwide political advertising.</p> <p>It has just six electoral college votes but as a swing state in a tight presidential contest it could be decisive, giving the Barack Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns plenty of incentive to hammer each other.</p> <p>Nevada also has a tight senate race, which Republicans and Democrats think could tip control of the Senate, as well as elections for the House, all on the 6 November ballot.</p> <p>The fact that most of Nevada's population is clustered in and around just two cities, Las Vegas and Reno, makes it relatively cheap for candidates and Super Pac allies to buy copious airtime.</p> <p>\"My God, does it ever stop?\" groaned Samuel Sanchez, 44, jogging on a Las Vegas hotel gym treadmill and watching yet another interruption of the quiz show Jeopardy. \"On and on and on.\"</p> <p>Cities in other swing states such as Ohio, Florida and Colorado have also been saturated but none as heavily as Las Vegas, which has notched up 73,000 ads so far this year.</p> <p>Television stations have scaled back programming, including news, to sell more airtime while the bonanza lasts. \"Before there would be a placement strategy, ads placed in certain places, now they're just blanketed all over the place,\" said McElhatten, the executive.</p> <p>Commentators say the volume is matched by the venom. A GOP commercial showed video of Shelley Berkley, a Democratic congresswoman running for Senate, shopping at Saks in Manhattan \u2013 she took a shine to beige stilettos \u2013 to mock her claim to return to Nevada to see recession-hit constituents every weekend. \"Actions speak louder than words, Shelley,\" it said.

  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398202578\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350913773682/WestKenCrop.jpg\" alt=\"West Kensington estate London\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of London's West Kensington estate. Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the beginning of last month the chief executive of Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council - an administration much admired by Boris Johnson and Conservative national high command - was firm in his refusal to commission an inquiry into claims that council officers had offered priority allocation of new, replacement homes in a planned housing development in Seagrave Road to an alleged \"VIP list\" of residents of <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/\">two estates</a> threatened with demolition as part of the massive Earls Court redevelopment project in return for their supporting it. He has now changed his mind. H&amp;F has confirmed this, saying that it is \"perfectly willing to ensure any concerns are considered\" and that accountants Deloitte will undertake the work. Why the about turn?</p> <p>Perhaps the involvement of the police has had some rotational effect. A few days after the chief executive told Stephen Cowan, the leader of the opposition Labour group who has been demanding an inquiry, that he considered the matter closed, a document purporting to substantiate the \"VIP list\" claims and arguing that council officers might have broken the law was <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/west-ken-report-on-misconduct-in-public.html\">handed to local police</a> and is now in the hands of Scotland Yard. The same document also found its way to the chief executive who, having absorbed its contents which include testimonies from mostly unnamed estate residents and parts of his own lengthy email correspondence with Cowan, asked Deloitte to look into the matter as an extension of an existing internal audit role for H&amp;F.</p> <p>In a statement the council repeats that it, \"has not allocated any homes and nobody has received preferential treatment,\" and that, \"if residents are moved it will happen in accordance with a local lettings plan,\" which, it adds, \"will be agreed by a public committee in the normal way and will take into account need and preference.\" The statement also says:</p> <blockquote> <p>During a lengthy two-year consultation process, <strong>the Council noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road</strong> and will continue to note any further interest.</p> </blockquote> <p>My emphasis. The council's stating that it, \"noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road,\" compares intriguingly with an assertion made by the chief executive on 1 August this year in his correspondence with Cowan that although he was \"satisfied\" that \"those who saw themselves as having something to gain from the regeneration of their estates did, of their own volition, gather together a set of names of those they believed to be so interested...any such gathering of names was <strong>not solicited by council staff</strong>...\" </p> <p>My emphasis again. So, two months ago, as part of a correspondence relating to alleged priority allocation of new homes in Seagrave Road, the chief executive said that a set of names of estate residents seeing some advantage in having the estates demolished was gathered together, but not by council officers. Now the council is saying that it has \"noted people interested in moving to Seagrave Road\" over a two years period. </p> <p>Why has it been doing this? The council says that, \"During that [two year] period people indicated various preferences regarding their own housing needs. People will continue to express their preferences. We are keen to talk to all our residents about their housing needs.\" </p> <p>I'm told that the chief executive expects Deloitte's work on this matter to set the council back between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000 for starters. Concerned Hammersmith and Fulham residents will hope that a thorough excavation results. That figure is, though, a drop in the ocean compared with the \u00a31 million H&amp;F has set aside to cover its failure to pay the full amount it owes in tax. The Standard <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/careless-tory-council-admits-1m-tax-blunder-8218332.html\">reported</a> on Friday that the council has admitted to a \"careless\" approach to its own finances having failed to ascertain whether 59 people who work for it were its own staff or hired consultants.</p> <p>As the Standard points out:</p> <blockquote> <p>The mistakes occurred on the watch of former council leader Stephen Greenhalgh, who quit this summer to become Boris Johnson's deputy mayor for policing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Greenhalgh, incidentally, is in charge of the Met's budgets. He was also - and doubtless remains - a passionate backer of the Earls Court project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">telling the Guardian earlier this year</a>, before joining the mayoral team, that it is \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London.\"</p> <p>This view is not shared by the great majority of the large percentage of residents who responded to the council's consultation earlier this year, saying they'd sooner not have their homes knocked down. There are also doubts about the legality of the scheme, with a judge <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/12/earsl-court-project-legal-challenge-go-ahead\">clearing the way</a> for a \"substantive hearing\" at the High Court into the lawfulness of the masterplan for the area. So that's another pile of public money up in flames - posh lawyers, like posh accountants, don't come cheap.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the major planning development committee of H&amp;F's royal and fellow Tory neighbour Kensington and Chelsea (K&amp;C) has put back consideration of the part of the Earls Court project that falls within its boundaries to 20 November, having previously scheduled it for this Tuesday, 23 October. K&amp;C tells me that this is because part of its officers' report to the committee members needs to be revised so that a \"broader view of the transport impacts,\" of the scheme is included. </p> <p>Any other business? Yes. Caroline Pidgeon, leader of the Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly, has <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/west-kenearls-court-libdems-enter-fray.html\">written to business secretary</a> and fellow Lib Dem Vince Cable expressing her concern that local small businesses will be damaged by the loss of the Earls Court exhibition centre buildings, which will also be bulldozed if the project goes ahead, and asking Cable to urge his cabinet colleague Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, to \"call in\" the project for review. </p> <p>During this year's mayoral election the Lib Dem, Labour and Green candidates all expressed concern about the project. The <a href=\"http://www.aeo.org.uk/page.cfm/Link=8/t=m/goSection=3\">Association of Event Organisers </a>think it's a bad idea. So do most residents of the threatened estates. Apart from local Tories, their friend \"Good old Boris\" and proposed developers Capco, almost nobody seems keen on it. It's getting messier too. Will Eric act?</p>",
  "<p>BP is to sell its 50% stake in the Russian oil group TNK-BP to the Kremlin-controlled Rosneft in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/bp-rosneft-deal-russia?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a deal worth about $27bn (\u00a317bn) to the British company</a>, both parties announced on Monday.</p> <p>The transaction, which will eventually see the UK-based group receive $12.3bn in cash plus an 18.5% stake in Rosneft, was unveiled as the Russian oil major announced a separate deal to acquire the other half of TNK-BP for the slightly higher price of $28bn from its owner, AAR.</p> <p>BP chief executive, Bob Dudley, said: \"BP intends to be a long-term investor in Rosneft \u2013 an investment which I believe will deliver value for our shareholders over the next decade and beyond.\"</p> <p>Dudley did not comment on the price and the company declined to explain why AAR appeared to be receiving more for its 50%. However, BP retains the prospect of working on potentially profitable projects with the state-controlled company such as in the Arctic.</p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said: \"This is a good big deal which is important not only for Russia's energy sector but for the entire Russian economy.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/igor-sechin-rosneft-kremlin-hard-man-shadows\" title=\"\">Igor Sechin</a>, president and chairman of the management board of Rosneft and a former spy who flew to London last week to take control of the long-running negotiations, said: \"I strongly believe that we would benefit from BP's experience and its track record of implementing best international practices in Russia. I am especially pleased that BP has chosen to remain as one of the largest foreign investors in the Russian economy recognising the potential of both Rosneft and the Russian oil and gas sector.\"</p> <p>The deal finally gives BP an exit from a venture which has provided a series of difficulties, notably when Dudley was forced to flee Russia in 2008 when he was head of the TNK-BP after threats to his safety. AAR then scuppered BP's hopes of an Arctic tie-up with Rosneft.</p> <p>However, TNK-BP has also being seen as a huge commercial success for BP. In return for its $8bn investment, the British group has taken out $19bn in dividends \u2013 although the frequent rows between the joint venture partners have resulted in those payments being blocked.</p> <p>As a result of the constant tension between each side of TNK-BP, a deal had long been expected by the oil industry and Dudley had already told his board that he backed Rosneft's cash and share offer for the TNK-BP stake.</p> <p>The windfall will eventually allow him to hand out billions of pounds to BP shareholders. The company said: \"BP intends to retain the shares resulting from the proposed transaction and will evaluate how the cash proceeds will be utilised. At minimum, BP's intention is to offset any dilution to earnings per share as a result of the sale of its interest in TNK-BP as well as continue with its progressive dividend policy.\"</p> <p>The agreement to sell BP's 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft, which still has to be signed off by the Russian government, is scheduled to be conducted in two stages: Rosneft will pay BP $17.1bn in cash plus shares in Rosneft, representing 12.84% of the company; then BP will use $4.8bn of that cash windfall to buy a further 5.66% stake in Rosneft from the Russian government. The second deal values Rosneft shares, which were trading at $7.13 last week, at $8 a share.</p> <p>The net result will be that BP will hold 19.75% of Rosneft shares, including its existing stake of 1.25%, as well as receiving $12.3bn in cash, while the Kremlin's stake \u2013 which totalled 86% through two vehicles \u2013 will fall to 70%.</p> <p>There has been speculation the Kremlin will reduce its stake in Rosneft to as low as 50% plus one share. Igor Shuvalov, Russia's deputy prime minister, has said the government would consider further privatisation in an attempt to soothe any concerns among BP investors about the influence of the Kremlin over such a crucial part of the UK oil firm, whose share price is yet to recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the US in April 2010. BP gets a quarter of its production from the existing Russian venture.</p> <p>The TNK-BP announcement was greeted tentatively by the City, with BP's shares effectively remaining steady.</p> <p>Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec, wrote in a note to clients: \"The deal will be viewed positively as it halves exposure to Russia whilst upgrading BP's partnership and reviving hopes of an Arctic entry.</p> <p>\"In accordance with the heads of terms, BP and Rosneft have an exclusivity period of 90 days to negotiate fully termed sale and purchase agreements. After signing definitive agreements, completion would be subject to governmental, regulatory and antitrust approvals, and is currently anticipated to occur during the first half of 2013.\"</p>",
  "<p>Children and young people are posting thousands of sexually explicit images of themselves and their peers online, which are then being stolen by porn websites, according to a leading internet safety organisation.</p> <p>A study by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reveals that 88% of self-made sexual or suggestive images and videos posted by young people, often on social networking sites, are taken from their original online location and uploaded on to other websites.</p> <p>Reams of sexually explicit images and videos are being uploaded by children and young people, the study found. During 47 hours, over a four-week period, a total of 12,224 images and videos were analysed and logged. The majority of these were then mined by \"parasite websites\" created for the sole purpose of displaying sexually explicit images and videos of young people.</p> <p>The original pictures and videos were uploaded by young people on to commonplace websites but then stolen by porn sites for display. Of the 12,224 images and videos monitored on 68 different websites, 10,776 were later found on parasite websites.</p> <p>Organisations warned children and young people of the dangers of \"sexting\" \u2013 sending sexually explicit texts or emails \u2013 and allowing friends to take suggestive pictures or video of them. Young people had to be aware that once an image was available digitally the image was no longer under their control, said Susie Hargreaves, CEO of the Internet Watch Foundation, set up in 1996 by the internet industry.</p> <p>\"This research gives an unsettling indication of the number of images and videos on the internet featuring young people performing sexually explicit acts or posing,\" she said. \"It also highlights the problem of control of these images \u2013 once an image has been copied on to a parasite website, it will no longer suffice to simply remove the image from the online account.</p> <p>\"We need young people to realise that once an image or a video has gone online, they may never be able to remove it entirely.\"</p> <p>The charity gave examples of children whose lives had been devastated because sexually explicit images and videos of them were available online. One young woman explained that she had taken a sexually explicit image of herself when she was 15. She had not posted it to the internet herself but it was now freely available online.</p> <p>\"[It] could jeopardise any future career I have or if any family [or] friends come across it,\" she said.</p> <p>Another found explicit photos of herself online after her phone was stolen, while another admitted to attempting suicide after losing control of sexually explicit images: \"I came to regret posting photographs of myself naively on the internet and tried to forget about it, but strangers recognised me from the photographs and made lewd remarks at school,\" she said. \"I endured so much bullying because of this photograph and the others \u2026 I was eventually admitted for severe depression and was treated for a suicide attempt.\"</p> <p>The organisation has been contacted by young people who want them to help remove explicit photos online. One wrote: \"Please remove this from the internet as soon as possible as one family member has already come across it \u2026 I feel like ending my life as I am so ashamed and embaressed [sic] and this has been put up without my concent [sic].\"</p> <p>Of the sexual content monitored by IWF, 7,147 were images while 5,077 were videos. UK Safer Internet Centre, a group that campaigns for responsible internet use, will use the research to inform new campaigns aimed at children.</p> <p>But the organisation warned that if it cannot provide watertight proof that the young person in a sexually explicit image is under 18 they have no power to remove it from the internet. Sarah Smith, technical researcher at IWF, said the charity had not been surprised by the amount of sexually explicit material available, but added they were shocked by the number of parasite websites taking advantage of images online.</p> <p>\"Young people have to realise that once they take a digital image, once it is uploaded, it essentially becomes public property and is virtually impossible to remove,\" she said. \"The clear message is that if you post this content you are going to lose control of it.\"</p> <p>Will Gardner, director of UK Safer Internet Centre at Childnet, said adults had a responsibility to ensure children and young people knew about the dangers of posting suggestive or sexual images of themselves online.</p> <p>\"In all of our work we see that conversations and education with young people are vital in helping them to stay safe online,\" he said. The organisation has developed a drama-based education programme to address \"sexting\" and support teachers in starting a dialogue with pupils \"to help young people think about, role play and understand the consequences of creating and sending indecent images\", he added.</p> <p>David Wright, the director of UK Safer Internet Centre at South West Grid for Learning, said it was not uncommon for children to \"sext\" despite warnings from adults. \"Much of the advice for children and young people is, quite rightly, to not 'sext',\" he said.</p> <p>\"However, this research, coupled with our experience, demonstrates that it is still not uncommon. We hope that our new resource will help and support those who have shared self-generated content to take positive action.\"</p>",
  "<p>Radamel Falcao had scored 182 goals in his career but not one of them was a free-kick. He made his debut in the Colombian league at 13 and became a starter for River Plate in Argentina at 19, scoring seven in his first seven starts, before joining Porto where he scored in his first four. He scored 24 league goals in his first season in Spain, plus 12 more in the Europa League \u2014 top scorer for the second year in a row, with two different clubs. He scored in both finals too and then tore Chelsea to bits. He had hit well over one hundred goals in Europe. He had curled them and chipped them and hammered them and headed them; first touch and fifth, left foot and right, from inside the area and out. But he had never, ever scored a free-kick. Not even a flukey one.</p> <p>So when Cristian \"The Onion\" Rodr\u00edguez tumbled on the edge of the area in the last minute of the weekend's last game and Falcao rushed across and, to use his manager's own words, grabbed \"desperately\" at the ball, you could have forgiven his team-mates for responding: \"Piss off Radamel, this is the one thing you can't do.\" For pointing at Gabi and saying: \"Leave it to an expert.\" You could have forgiven his team-mates for thinking that Falcao was being a bit selfish; that, never mind the team, what he really wanted was to keep <em>his</em> record going. He had, after all, scored in nine consecutive games and was chasing the perfect 10.</p> <p>You might think that. Especially when you looked up at the scoreboard and looked down at the league table: Real Sociedad 0 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 0. Draw and Atl\u00e9tico would break a run of six consecutive league wins and slip two points behind the leaders Barcelona at the top.</p> <p>This was no time for messing about, no time for personal battles. But Falcao's team-mates didn't say that and they didn't think that either.</p> <p>Because Falcao's team-mates know Falcao and they knew that he was ready. They knew that the time was right and the reason was too: this was not a moment of inflated self- importance, a grab for individual glory.</p> <p>This was logic. The implacable logic of <em>The Tiger</em>.</p> <p>Before this season began, Falcao was asked if there was a part of his game that he could improve. He responded succinctly: free-kicks. He wasn't just saying so either. \"Falcao's hunger for goals led him to take the free-kick,\" said the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid coach Diego Simeone last night, \"he has been working hard on that side of his game.\"</p> <p>\"Whenever we can we stay behind after training to practice them,\" Falcao admitted. And so it was. In the 90th minute, he finally felt that he was ready and in the 90th minute he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOUP4CHC1Wc\" title=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOUP4CHC1Wc\">curled a wonderful right footed free-kick</a> over the wall, swinging away from E\u00f1aut Zubikarai and into the top corner.</p> <p>\"The goal,\" said Simeone, \"was delicious.\" Just when you thought there was something Falcao couldn't do, he goes and does it. 1-0. Another goal, another win. \"I'd scored free-kicks as an amateur,\" he smiled, \"but never as a professional.\"</p> <p>It was the first free-kick Falcao had ever scored but it was also, in a way, the goal that defines him. Falcao's goal was not just a product of Sunday night but a product of all the afternoons before that, of the relentless pursuit of perfection. Of a quiet but iron ambition. Of the predatory skills, part instinct part education, that led to him being nicknamed <em>El Tigre</em>. Sure, it's a cliche but the focus and determination is startling. One member of staff at Atl\u00e9tico told El Pa\u00eds: \"On the morning of the game, he's friendly, open. At lunch time, you can see he's concentrating that bit more. And by the time you leave the hotel for the ground, he's completely different. The contrast is huge. He leaves the dressing room last. And if you see his face at that point, he's no longer Falcao; he's <em>The Tiger</em>. His only thought is the ball.\"</p> <p>Falcao's parents tell him that when he was a kid he played without shoes in the street, bare feet bleeding as he kicked the ball, and he talks of virtually passing up his childhood to play professionally. To play and to work. There's something you're not good at? Get better at it, then. \"Falcao is incredible,\" said his fellow attacker Adri\u00e1n. \"He always shows up and he has done it again. He's been practicing free-kicks for a while. He was confident and it was an incredible goal.\"</p> <p>One of many. \"Falcao has no barriers,\" said the cover of Marca. \"Falcao,\" said AS, \"has no limits.\" On a night when he actually missed a chance, he found another way through, Marca adapting a bullfighting metaphor to declare: \"it's all tiger, right down to the tail.\" Falcao has now scored in every game since 24 August, finding the net 16 times in his last 10, equalling Messi's career high: 12 with Atl\u00e9tico and four with Colombia. In 2012 he has scored 40 times. And he's on nine league goals this season \u2014 level with Ronaldo and two behind Messi.</p> <p>There may not have been a finisher like him in Spain since Hugo S\u00e1nchez, a specialist so clear in his mission, so fine-tuned, so efficient. There is nothing wild about his game. At a goal every 60.44 minutes he has a better goals per minute ratio than Messi (61.09) and Ronaldo (78). He has scored nine times from 28 shots; Messi has 11 from 44; Ronaldo 9 from 54. Goals that matter too: last night's last minute free-kick gave Atl\u00e9tico a seventh consecutive victory in La Liga; Falcao has scored in all bar one of them and he didn't play in that one. He has scored the first goal in four of the six he has played in. Take his goals out and Atl\u00e9tico would drop 10 points. When the difference is fine, Falcao is the difference.</p> <p>Atl\u00e9tico's last three games have been won in the dying minutes \u2013 against M\u00e1laga and Real Sociedad in the league and Pizen in the Europa league \u2013 and they have not played the strongest sides yet. They beat M\u00e1laga and Athletic at home and have beaten Valladolid, Betis and Espanyol. Victory over la Real came after Carlos Vela had wasted the game's best opportunity and Atl\u00e9tico had, frankly, not played that well. They face Madrid and Barcelona in December, both away from home. But still, they have only dropped points once \u2013 on the opening day of the season \u2013 and are level with Barcelona. Eight points ahead of Real Madrid.</p> <p>There is something about Atl\u00e9tico since Simeone took over, with Falcao his spearhead, the boy he knew in Argentina, the man with whom he shares a view of the game: committed, professional, supremely competitive. Since Simeone took over, Atl\u00e9tico have lost only five of 30 league games, they've won the Europa League and the European Super Cup. In all competitions they've now gone 20 games unbeaten. Next weekend, they face Osasuna at home looking to make that 21. They have never done that before.</p> <p>But then Radamel Falcao had never scored a free-kick before.</p> <h2>Talking points</h2> <p>\u2022 Divine madness. Deportivo scored four against Barcelona and still lost; Barcelona scored five away from home but still spent the final minutes hanging on with 10 men, only one of them a defender, and watching worriedly as goalkeeper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2011/feb/21/la-liga-deportivo-goalkeeper-scores\" title=\"\">Dani Aranzubia, who has a bit of previous</a>, came up to head a corner. \"I haven't seen Barcelona play so well for a long time,\" said Tito Vilanova of his team's opening 20 minutes. But then it all went completely bonkers. They were 3-0 up after 17 minutes and cruising. Yet it went from 0-3 to 2-3 to 2-4 to 3-4 to 3-5 to 4-5 with 12 minutes left and with Barcelona down to 10 men since the 48th minute.</p> <p>\"I have a strange sensation,\" said Depor coach Jos\u00e9 Luis Oltra afterwards. He was not the only one. Depor-Bar\u00e7a had it all. Nine yellow cards and nine goals. Three wonderful assists from Cesc F\u00e1bregas, a brilliant free kick from Pizzi, the man who this week it was revealed is now officially an Atl\u00e9tico player for \u20ac13m, and a dreadful fumble from Victor Vald\u00e9s. The finest own goal you could ever wish to see from Jordi Alba \u2013 a soft-shoe control and volleyed lob over his keeper that was part Bergkamp, part Le Tissier. A referee who booked Juan Carlos Valer\u00f3n and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta \u2013 and you know that something funny is going on when that happens. And possibly the best diving performance for years, with Riki \"earning\" a very special hat-trick: a free-kick and a penalty, both of which led to goals, and a red card.</p> <p>Not that it was enough. \"We rowed and rowed only to die on the shore,\" Riki said, probably more appropriately than he intended. It was all so mad that the most sane thing that happened was also pretty insane. Or would be if it wasn't for the fact that Messi has made the extraordinary routine. He hit the post with a free-kick but still scored a brilliant hat-trick, all of them from open play. It was his 17th hat-trick for Barcelona. He now has 11 for the season and is on 71 goals in 2012, 59 with Barcelona, 12 with Argentina. That puts him just four behind Pel\u00e9's best tally, 75 in 1959, 14 off Gerd M\u00fcller's 1972 record. He has now scored 299 for Barcelona.</p> <p>\u2022 Five games were decided by goals in the last five minutes this weekend. The surprise was that Barcelona's was not one of them. Falcao's goal confirmed a trend. Valencia scored two in the last three minutes to beat Athletic 3-2 on Saturday night after Aritz Aduriz, their former player, had given Athletic a 2-1 lead. Christian Stuani scored in the 93rd minute to give Espanyol a desperately-needed 3-2 win against Rayo, the team who play with no defence. Michel scored in the 87th as Levante beat Getafe, and Joaqu\u00edn kept up M\u00e1laga's fantastic start to the season with an 86th-minute winner against Valladolid. M\u00e1laga third, having lost just once. And Joaqu\u00edn is looking more and more like the brilliant and cheeky scamp of his Betis days.</p> <p>\u2022 Gonzalo Higua\u00edn's fluke and Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty, his ninth goal this season, gave Real Madrid a comfortable victory against Celta. In the absence of F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, Marcelo and Alvaro Arbeloa, Michael Essien filled in at left back.</p> <h2>Results<br></h2> <p>M\u00e1laga 2 - 1 Valladolid, Real Madrid 2 - 0 Celta Vigo, Valencia 3 - 2 Athletic Bilbao, Deportivo 4 - 5 Barcelona, Getafe 0 - 1 Levante, Espanyol 3 - 2 Rayo Vallecano, Granada 1 - 2 Zaragoza, Osasuna 0 - 0 Real Betis, Real Sociedad 0 - 1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.</p> <p><strong>Monday night </strong>Sevilla v Mallorca</p>",
  "<p>There has been concern for a number of years about the fate of socially responsible businesses that get swallowed up by larger mainstream corporations. Do they lose their independence and radical edge, or do they help drive innovative thinking within the parent company?</p> <p>The answers are difficult to fully assess in the case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/mar/18/highstreetretailers.retail?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">L'Oreal's takeover of the Body Shop</a> or the purchase of Green &amp; Blacks by Cadbury, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/20/kraft-green-black-cadbury-ethical\" title=\"\">which in turn was bought by Kraft</a>.</p> <p>However, ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's, owned by Unilever, says that it is now showing that a more transparent path is possible with the announcement that it has joined the rapidly expanding socially responsible <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/\" title=\"\">B Corporation movement</a> in America.</p> <p>The company is the first wholly owned subsidiary to be certified by the non-profit B Lab to show that it meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's hopes its leadership will encourage other major corporations to give some measure of independence to their more progressive subsidiaries.</p> <p>The company becomes the 635th business to join the movement, which is gaining critical mass in securing legislation to support its socially responsible business model. Eleven US states have already enacted laws supporting entrepreneurs and investors to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy, and a 12th is on the way.&#xa0;</p> <p>The legislation is needed because US corporate law effectively obliges directors to prioritise shareholder interests above all else.</p> <p>Chief executive Jostein Solheim tells the Guardian: \"As a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever, the B Corp certification may even be a bit sweeter. When Ben &amp; Jerry's was acquired, many folks thought it would be a challenge for the company to keep its values.</p> <p>\"We're thrilled to join the movement. To undergo the process of certification, where every facet of our business is scrutinised to ensure that we're walking the talk, is rigorous but rewarding. It allows an experienced, holistic, values-led third party entity that B Lab is the chance to affirm that we remain true to our mission and look to accelerate our social impact.\"</p> <p>Solheim adds: \"We feel other businesses will learn and benefit from this.&#xa0;That position of being the first wholly owned subsidiary to become a certified B Corp is tremendous. The level of transparency and willingness to be open and honest is a testament to the relationship between Unilever and B&amp;J's, which we continually work for. It really helps put Ben &amp; Jerry's back into the pioneering realm, this time for other businesses who may find themselves in a similar setting.\"</p> <p>As part of its certification, Ben &amp; Jerry's has made its full B Impact Assessment and relevant excerpts from its governing<a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/benjerry\" title=\"\"> documents visible to the public</a>.</p> <p>Highlights show that 45% of the cost of goods sold go toward investing in and supporting small scale suppliers through the Caring Dairy program; its lowest paid hourly worker receives 46% above the living wage, and between half and three quarters of staff took part in an organised community programme in the last year.</p> <p>Between 65%-80% of its staff are \"satisfied\" or \"engaged\" at work, and the highest paid individual earns between 16 and 20 times more than the lowest paid full time worker.</p> <p>Only 4% of suppliers have third-party social or environmental company level certification, but this rises to 24% on the basis of materials or products purchased.</p> <p>Sensitive information that could advantage competitors or prejudice litigation, is blacked out, such as net income and the percentage of under-represented managers.</p> <p>In terms of overall performance, Ben &amp; Jerry's scored 93% of available points for its governance structure, 55% for environment and 45% for community.</p> <p>Does Solheim feel the knowledge the company gains will have an impact up the chain in Unilever?</p> <p>\"We operate in a manner of open communication and sharing,\" he says. \"As both organisations continue to pursue linked prosperity values be it in sourcing, social justice or sustainability we'll learn and succeed together.&#xa0;I've already spent considerable time with the Unilever CEO Paul Polman to discuss why we're proud of this announcement.\"</p> <p>Andrew Kassoy, who came up with the original B Corp idea five years ago with two course mates from Stanford University, said it was too early to predict what impact the certification may have on Unilever, but he is hopeful that \"the B impact assessment, as a tool to engage Unilever's supply chain on sustainability and to measure the increasingly positive impact Unilever has on the world by leveraging its enormous buying power, would be one compelling opportunity.\"</p> <p>With Ben &amp; Jerry's joining soon after outdoor clothing and equipment company Patagonia, Kassoy is hopeful that other large companies will join the fold. \"Anytime a company with a large following like Ben &amp; Jerry's joins the movement, it's a big deal,\" he says.&#xa0;\"We expect Ben &amp; Jerry's to embrace B Corp as they've embraced fair trade and that will help invite tens of millions of new consumers to be the change by supporting a better way to do business.\"</p> <p>Kassoy believes that soon others will follow. \"Larger and publicly-traded companies will begin to join the B Corp movement \u2013 some as certified B Corps, and many more will use the B impact assessment as a tool to engage their supply chains,\" he says.&#xa0;\"There are already more than 7,000 businesses using the assessment as a free and confidential management tool and we expect larger corporations to see this as a powerful way to leverage their purchasing power to engage their suppliers to measure what matters.\"</p> <p>While Ben &amp; Jerry's won the right to have an independent board of directors at the time of the Unilever acquisition more than a decade ago, the relationship has been through stormy times. In the past, the ice cream maker has accused its parent company of trampling on its values by trying to force it to follow Unilever's global policies at the expense of what it believes is right. Those tensions have dissipated since Polman took charge.</p> <p>Jerry Greenfield told the Guardian recently that there has always been \"a fascination with what the relationship is like between Unilever and Ben &amp; Jerry's. Do we have the freedom and how things have changed under their ownership? When we were over here the last time to announce our commitment to 100% fair trade, we thought we were doing this great thing, but the questions were about isn't Unilever trotting you out to make it look good and would you had done this a lot quicker if it was not for Unilever?\"</p> <p>Greenfield recalls company founder Ben Cohen admitting to the press they would have done it earlier and \"Unilever did not really like that. The difference now is that since Polman is so committed to this sustainability programme, he has managed to change the general feeling. Now there is not nearly the same level of distrust.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>First it was Iraq, then Afghanistan. Who is next? Britain and other liberal democracies face the prospect of sleepwalking into endless conflicts as the traditional distinctions between war and peace get blurred.</p> <p>This is the stark warning of an important and thought-provoking study of recent military operations. War from the Ground Up, Twenty-First-Century Combat as Politics, by a Gurkha infantry officer with experience of three tours in Afghanistan, should be read by all aspiring military commanders and their Whitehall masters.</p> <p>War used to be clearly defined \u2013 brutal, decisive, and finite, said Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian military thinker still essential reading at British military academies.</p> <p>Now, we have the War on Terror, and the Long War as tribal and ethnic conflict is often described.</p> <p>Emile Simpson, author of War from the Ground Up (<a href=\"http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/war-from-the-ground-up/\">Hurst Publishers</a>), warns of the \"fusion of war and routine international politics\" and of force being used for political rather than military, outcomes.</p> <p>That is not war in the sense Clausewitz described, but \"effectively a continuation of normal political activity, which is endless\".</p> <p>The result, says Simpson, \"has been a proliferation of violence in the world which has the potential to drag the West into endless conflicts that go beyond political utility, not least in terms of their human and financial cost\".</p> <p>Blurring war and peace has the most serious political and strategic implications and raises huge questions . Yet there has been little public debate about how Britain should respond - should it engage, with other liberal democracies, in one \"global counter insurgency\", only fight when they can defeat the enemy in conventional battle despite the risk to legitimate security concerns, or, as Simpson put its, \"beat the enemy at his own game through armed political activity\"?</p> <p>\"As the issue of how to define war rarely extends beyond specialist discussion\", writes Simpson, \"the public have not been much involved; yet the public's will and taxes must ultimately sustain strategic choices\".</p> <p>\"The question of whether to commit to a 'generational war', to accept an era of 'persistent conflict', without a clear end-state, or conversely, not to engage in countries in which there are genuine security concerns, should surely be an issue of public discussion, as the West seems to be sleepwalking into such a period of global generational conflict\".</p> <p>In Afghanistan, the success or failure of counter insurgency operations is measured by their political impact, often on very local communities. \"The outcome of an action is usually better gauged by the chat at the bazaar the next day, and its equivalent higher up the political food chain, than body counts\", Simpson writes. The control of political space can be more important than controlling physical space.</p> <p>The insurgents see the conflict through different lenses, while Kabul has different priorities. \"For some of the insurgents...their war is part of a wider war against the West. For others, it is a war limited to Afghanistan. For the majority, it is about local issues.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, while the powerful criminal patronage networks might be a target for Nato-led forces, but unless they pose an existential threat to the Afghan state, they may well not bother the government in Kabul, Simpson observes.</p> <p>And if a commander in Helmand tells the local population their opium poppies will not be burned, he may be going against Afghan government policy. But he may need to do this to avoid totally alienating the local population.</p> <p>The insurgency is a franchise movement of many factions and interests.</p> <p>Misconceptions and confusion surrounding the conflict in Afghanistan are also seized on by Julian Lewis, a former Conservative defence spokesman and member of the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.</p> <p>Back in 2010, he says, \"Western strategy seemed determined to restrict itself to the straightjacket of fighting irregular forces by conventional means - that, by trying too much, Nato would achieve too little\".</p> <p>Yet suddenly the scene shifted - an unrealistic commitment to a 40-year campaign was abruptly replaced by an unrealistic commitment to a four-year transition to hand over to Afghan security forces, he writes in a paper, International terrorism: the case for containment, published by the group, Conservative Way Forward.</p> <p>Some western forces, Lewis suggests, should now move to \"strategic bases\" and test the ability of Afghan troops to operate on their own.</p> <p>\"Withdrawal into the selected bases would remove the constant irritant of a uniformed infidel presence in the towns and countryside, thus reducing Western casualties on the one hand and the motivation of Afghans to join the insurgency on the other\".</p>",

That's rather like thinking that circus still means <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xcXrSuN1D0\">sawdust, elephants and nasty smells</a>, or that a play is a form of entertainment in which people <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/jul/22/theatre.artsfeatures2 \">pop their heads around French doors shouting \"Anyone for tennis?\"</a>.</p> <p>In fact, one of the sheer pleasures of cabaret is that it is so all-embracing. It takes in everything from Maria Friedman at the Matcham Room, <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/columns/shenton/2012/10/a-cabaret-revival/ \">a newish space about which the Stage's Mark Shenton and others are raving</a>, and which is bringing some classy old-world glamour back into the West End, to the tongue-in-cheek ribaldry, provocations and downright sexiness that can be found at venues such as the <a href=\"http://www.rvt.org.uk/event/duckie-155\">Royal Vauxhall Tavern</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.workersplaytime.net/\">Bethnal Green Working Men's Club</a>. Cabaret is <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/37576/clive-rowe-roses-front-stalls-bar\">Clive Rowe</a> and it is <a href=\" http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/dance-performance/tickets/meow-meows-little-match-girl-68526\">Meow Meow's Little Match Girl</a>; it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/nov/03/divine-david-hoyle-factory-interview\">David Hoyle</a> and <a href=\" http://www.edfringe.com/whats-on/theatre/rubies-in-the-attic\">Rubies in the Attic</a>.</p> <p>The current boom \u2013 the Edinburgh Fringe now has an entire section of its programme devoted to the genre \u2013 may well be connected with recession (variety and burlesque did well during the Depression), but is probably also not unconnected with the success of shows such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/oct/13/theatre \">La Clique</a> and <a href=\"http://www.la-soiree.com/\">La Soir\u00e9e</a>, which have proved that the lowbrow is terrific fun when delivered with a raised eyebrow. </p> <p>And anyone who doubts that cabaret can ever become mainstream should consider the fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/camille-o-sullivan\">Camille O'Sullivan</a>, one of cabaret's shooting stars, was the lead in the Edinburgh international festival and RSC collaboration <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/23/rape-of-lucrece-edinburgh-review\">The Rape of Lucrece</a> last August. The company <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/dec/15/edinburgh-fringe-explosion-fame-1927 \">1927</a>, which sprung out of the cabaret scene, will be back at the National theatre this December with the glorious <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/dec/17/animals-children-took-streets-review\">The Animal and Children Took to the Streets</a>, a show that celebrates its cabaret roots both in style and in its subversive message. </p> <p>It's this kind of joyous cross-fertilisation that is good for cabaret and more traditional theatre forms as well. Theatre too often tries to box off different forms and genres from each other, while cabaret thinks nothing of putting live art and plate-spinning side by side. Both can be damned good entertainment, and both mean something. </p> <p>So I reckon that cabaret is very much here to stay, and will be around and thriving long after The X Factor has disappeared from our TV screens. Drama and circus training has been transformed in recent years, and we no longer just produce fine actors but also brilliant singers and dancers and<a href=\"http://www.circusspace.co.uk/\"> circus performers</a>; more and more graduates are looking for and finding new ways to survive and thrive. Cabaret is not for the has-beens but for those forging the future. No wonder it's attracting some of our brightest, most entrepreneurial and most talented producers and performers.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/11/bat-for-lashes-haunted-man-review\" title=\"\">The Haunted Man</a>, Natasha Khan's third album as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2012/sep/09/bat-for-lashes-dont-want-hide\" title=\"\">Bat for Lashes</a>, has just been released. At this stage, more people might be familiar with its artwork than the contents. On the Mapplethorpe-esque cover, a <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/47233-check-out-bat-for-lashes-nsfw-album-cover-plus-new-video-and-new-track-laura/\" title=\"\">naked Khan hefts a bloke</a>, also naked, in a firewoman's lift, his spindly limbs strategically draped. Her stare dares you to question this turn of events. If the guy is supposed to be The Haunted Man, it looks as if he's been hunted first.</p> <p>In black-and-white, Khan looks poised but severe. In person, she is more relaxed, and endlessly mobile, pacing the faux-elaborate stage setting \u2013 a bucolic, lantern-lit dell framed by fake rocks \u2013 in a spectacular red cape. She opens with new song Lilies, which sprouts from a few tentative guitar chords into a synthesiser-boosted fanfare, crowned by Khan singing at full volume: \"Thank God I'm alive.\" It sets a suitably celebratory tone, even if the rapt audience takes a little longer to unclench.</p> <p>By the time she is crooning about crystal armour over a martial drumbeat on Glass, Khan has discarded her cape to roam around in a two-tone bodystocking. She resembles a Hollywood actor being motion-captured, and this deliberately stylised performance helps deliver some unashamedly knotty songs. On record, Rest Your Head sounds like an unremarkable cascade of triggered samples. Live, Khan's performance sells it as a terrace singalong. Behind her, a well-drilled quartet of multi-instrumentalists wrangle black boxes, guitars and the occasional cello.</p> <p>Her current single, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXK0Ejzin4c\" title=\"\">All Your Gold</a>, has a touch of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gotye\" title=\"\">Gotye</a> about it, and it helps thaw the reverent crowd. A tale of debilitating relationship angst delivered in a shiny nursery rhyme wrapper, it already feels like a hit. Later, as Khan and her band reconfigure for the glacial space-funk of A Wall, there is a loud but oddly rehearsed-sounding male shout: \"Millions couldn't \u2026 but Natasha Khan!\"</p> <p>He's got a point. Among the crowded field of idiosyncratic female singer-songwriters from the UK and beyond, Khan remains an excitingly restless talent. Her confidence in the new record is palpable \u2013 she plays nine of its 11 tracks. The sleek, breathy, Ivor Novello-winning <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00ZHah-c0hQ\" title=\"\">Daniel</a> remains her obvious, and highly appreciated, encore. But Khan makes the title track of The Haunted Man memorable by brandishing a bulky old wireless above her head. She's an artist unafraid of doing some of the heavy lifting herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\"class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){ varjs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>BioShock Infinite has returned to gaming news radars with an explosive trailer that puts a premium on run-and-gun action. Here it is:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bLHW78X1XeE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bLHW78X1XeE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The intriguing video also confirms that the game, in which players juggle superpowers and antique weaponry in a floating Steampunk city circa 1911, is set for release in February of next year. That last tidbit is likely to please any fans worried about the games production after recent news stories reported quite a few of the game's development team had jumped ship in the last few months. </p> <p>Going by the trailer, BioShock Infinite looks in fine fettle. It opens with a brief respite in which the game's protagonist, ex-Pinkerton Booker DeWitt, alludes to the shady reasons behind his presence in the floating city of Columbia. As DeWitt's gravely tones cut through the opening bars to Nico Vela's 'Beast', Columbia is displayed as a place of otherworldy beauty, where buildings cast in marble tower over cobbled streets flanked with greenery. We also catch a glimpse of one of the game's tougher opponents, the Handyman, which is displayed on stage owned by Betterman's Autobodies.</p> <p>When the action kicks in, it showcases some of the frenetic action glimpsed previously in previews of BioShock Infinite at E3. Players, it seems, will have access to a decently varied arsenal, which includes Gatling guns, submachine guns, shotguns and auto-load pistols. They'll also be mixing up gunplay with supernatural powers \u2013 such as the ability to summon a murder of crows to confound their enemies. The trailer also shows off the game's signature Sky Hook, which DeWitt uses to get around the city on rails that link the different floating platforms. </p> <p>All told, it's an impressive \u2013 and necessary \u2013 sign that BioShock Infinite is on track for its release date next year, and in light of the recent high profile departures at Irrational, this is news that's as welcome as it is unexpected.</p>",
  "<p>A Tory ministerial friend was cross with me for two unlikely reasons when I rang about the latest government mini-shambles on Sunday. One was my censorious assumption that the chancellor of the exchequer and his special adviser should not be watching a DVD comedy on the 15.11 train to Euston during a working Friday in the throes of a prolonged recession.</p> <p>The other was over my casual assumption that George Osborne is privately wealthy enough to fork out for a first-class upgrade without a fuss. \"Why assume that?\" snapped my friend. It's a fair point \u2013 I don't know what access he has to parental wealth, though nor does my friend. I stand by both my complaints with the caveat that I would not begrudge a first-class taxpayers' ticket to cabinet ministers <em>working</em> on a train.</p> <p>Alas, David Cameron stopped that, a bit of gesture politics to match the Labour's government's spiteful ban on senior military officers (\"We're taking them down a peg or two\") travelling in similar style. It is a depressing commentary on our times, especially when organised by newspapers, most of whose proprietors are not UK residents for tax purposes. You know who you are, lads. Hands up.</p> <p>But it's always interesting to feel out of step with majority opinion, more stimulating in my experience. So I was also shocked this weekend when former Met police commissioner Lord (Ian) Blair reminded everyone why he wasn't up to the job from which the Tories sacked him. He advised people not to vote in next month's elections for police commissioners.</p> <p>None of your business, matey, I'd say. It's a half-cock scheme but the duly elected government has ordained it and it's not your job to organise a boycott. I could \u2013 and will \u2013 say the same about the ousting of Andrew Mitchell as government chief whip after a four-week battle with the Tory press and the police, whose behaviour in this affair has also been pretty disreputable.</p> <p>We expect lies and double standards from the newspapers \u2013 the BBC is belatedly showing itself more accountable over the Savile affair than any errant newspaper would \u2013 but the police, currently locked in an industrial dispute with ministers over their pay and conditions, have played this one pretty crudely and may yet regret it.</p> <p>It took campaigning Chris Mullin, a brave ex-Labour MP, hero of several miscarriages of justice, to have the guts to <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3569169.ece\" title=\"\">point this out last week</a>. There again, ministers regret it too if they blink in the face of a resurgent Fleet Street determined to show who's boss and fend off the kind of effective accountability that the Leveson inquiry may \u2013 may \u2013 be poised to propose. Politicians, cops and tabloids locked in an unseemly tussle again \u2013 pretty unedifying.</p> <p>I don't assume that the received media version of what happened when Osborne travelled on the Wilmslow to Euston train is correct. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RachTownsendITV\" title=\"\">ITV journalist who tweeted the altercation</a>, thereby sharing a potential scoop with the world, may have got it wrong. I simply don't know. Virgin Trains obliged the Osborne version, always a smart move in the favours bank.</p> <p>Later, a tweeter calling himself \"Larry\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Larrylarrylal/status/207150475680821250\" title=\"\">claimed the chancellor had tried it on before</a>. True or false, we don't know that either. But in the modern media climate \u2013 Leveson or not \u2013 some stories are \"too good to resist\", especially if they involve elected public officials, always an easy target. As Twitter sources go, \"Larry\" isn't easily verified.</p> <p>By the same token, no one knows exactly who or what to believe: bad-tempered Andrew Mitchell or the police version of what happened when the chief whip tried to ride his bike out of Downing Street as usual and encountered a stroppy cop. Probably both sides are a bit wrong, a bit right, bending the facts as people (and their trades unions) do.</p> <p>But after suffering weeks of torment that pushed some good news off the front pages \u2013 unemployment down, inflation down, crime down etc \u2013 Cameron now has the worst of both worlds. The cabinet is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/21/andrew-mitchell-resignation-cabinet-split\" title=\"\">reported to be divided </a>on the issue. Well done, Dave. If No 10 had an Alastair Campbell or even an Andy Coulson behind the black door Mitchell might have been seen buying the offended copper a drink across the road in the Red Lion next day and the tabloid hunt thwarted.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/20/norman-tebbit-dog-coalition-government\" title=\"\">Norman Tebbit was right in yesterday's Observer</a> to complain that the issue is not that the cabinet is full of toffs \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/18/labour-class-warfare-andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">I explained here last week</a>, it isn't \u2013 but that on a host of issues it doesn't look very competent. Thus <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-initiative-trouble\" title=\"\">Cameron's new crime initiative </a> on Monday appears to contradict last week's message that crime is coming down \u2013 unlike energy prices.</p> <p>Much of government is about authority, which, once lost, usually stays lost. Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair both had a good run before losing their mojos, as John Major did not, losing it after two years over the sterling crisis, and Gordon Brown didn't either: losing it within three months over that botched 2007 election.</p> <p>Cameron is in trouble and his effort to extract himself at his party conference is on the floor again.</p> <p>It will take some firm but fair discipline to get things under control unless the administration wants to suffer the fate of John Major's, once the ragbag of cabinet \"bastards\" and Eurosceptic jihadis were allowed to run wild. On Sunday an obscure backbencher called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Percy\" title=\"\">Andrew Percy</a> popped up on Radio 4's World This Weekend to argue that ministers should listen more to people like him.</p> <p>I'm not sure why Percy \u2013 a class of 2010 MP who hails from Hull and used to be a history teacher \u2013 thinks he's got the answers, though he points out that he used to work in McDonald's as a teenager. When I checked him out, my ministerial friend called him \"not nice, not clever and permanently grumpy\". It's true that Cameron and his allies should make more of an effort to listen to backbenchers \u2013 always a problem for busy ministers \u2013 but not necessarily to take much notice.</p> <p>The idea that any well-meaning novice can do politics as well as the next man or woman is a piece of contemporary nonsense, though the new chief whip, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Young,_6th_Baronet\" title=\"\">Sir George Young</a>, will be far too polite to say so when next he chats with Percy. That self-important Radio 4 interview will have done for young Andy (35) among the colleagues without further help from the ever-civil Young, who was 25 and working for the National Economic Development Office when Cameron was born in 1966.</p> <p>He's an old-school Etonian, nothing flashy, and used to be my MP. It's not ideal to appoint a 71-year-old as your chief whip. But circumstances are not ideal in 2012 and Young \u2013 runner-up for Speaker against both Mick Martin and John Bercow \u2013 is calm and respected, qualities that are always in short supply.</p> <p>The awkward truth is that voters are in no mood to be generous to politicians whom they blame for mistakes that have sometimes been made by others, including voters themselves. The politicians respond by trying to break bad news gently \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/21/ed-miliband-tuc-hyde-park-video\" title=\"\">as Ed Miliband did</a> when he was booed over cuts at Saturday's TUC rally \u2013 and Cameron tried to do at his party conference.</p> <p>But both sides make the mistake of over-blaming each other for policy mistakes and personal failings. It's a mistake that damages the political class as a whole and emboldens the anti-politics lobby, which includes shifty police officers, bankers, newspaper proprietors and their eager minions, neo-fascist street activists and ever-growing numbers of voters who can't be arsed.</p> <p>So what they need is the smack of firm government. Pull yourself together, Dave, you're the only prime minister we've got.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php/malawi-news/headlines/national/11973-tanzania-tells-malawi-where-to-explore-oil\">prospect of oil</a> under Lake Nyasa (known as Lake Malawi in Malawi) holds great promise for one of the poorest countries in the world. With an economy dependent on agriculture and one of the world's lowest GDP per capita, oil wealth could revolutionise the fortunes of Malawi's economy. </p> <p>At the same time, however, the experiences of some other oil rich nations on the continent point to a different possible ending, courtesy of the so-called '<a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1830\">resource curse</a>' whereby instead of contributing to a stronger economy and prosperous society, the valuable asset facilitates the rise of fat cat oil barons, institutionalised corruption and environmental catastrophe while the general populace is left in the same, if not greater, poverty as before.</p> <p><strong>The lucky few</strong></p> <p>Ghana provides one relatively positive example Malawi could follow. In Ghana, awareness of oil management best practice alongside international scrutiny of the fledgling industry has afforded civil society a loud voice. A <a href=\"http://www.oxfamamerica.org/articles/oil-in-ghana-civil-society-groups-launch-countrys-readiness-report-card\">report released by Ghana Civil Society Platform on Oil and Gas</a>, for example, addressed holes in Ghanaian oil law and was trumpeted as \"a big milestone\" for Ghanaian civil society by Moussa Ba, Oxfam America's West Africa regional coordinator for extractive industries.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, even <a href=\"http://www.afjn.org/focus-campaigns/other/other-continental-issues/78-natural-resource-extraction/1054-ghana-leads-the-way-in-managing-natural-resources-in-africa.html\">tentative success stories</a> like the Ghanaian case are few and far between. In West Africa, the roads travelled have been varied, but the ultimate destination for many countries has been the same: The enrichment of a few at the expense of development for the many.</p> <p>In Nigeria, exports of around two million barrels per day has been accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/corruption-in-oil-industry-price-of-military-arbitrariness/116315/\">endemic and institutionalised corruption</a>: oil governs politics, rewarding petroleum \"playboys\" while the <a href=\"http://hdrstats.undp.org/images/explanations/NGA.pdf\">average Nigerian can expect to earn</a> $2,000 per year before <a href=\"http://www.indexmundi.com/nigeria/life_expectancy_at_birth.html\">dying at the age of 52</a>. Not to mention the <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/shell-s-wildly-inaccurate-reporting-niger-delta-oil-spill-exposed-2012-04-23\">environmental catastrophe in the Niger Delta</a>.</p> <p>Just down the coast, the Obiang clan of Equatorial Guinea is filled with poster boys for <a href=\"http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/oil-corruption-in-equatorial-guinea/\">mismanagement and impunity</a>. Imposing journalistic blackout since the mid-2000s, President Teodoro Obiang has provided international guests with purpose built villas and Cadillacs off the back of enormous GDP growth whilst simultaneously providing his people with one of the worst human rights records in the world.</p> <p>Further down the coast, Angola is an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/business/worldbusiness/19iht-angola.4961071.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">oil industry darling</a>. Yet the exclave province of Cabinda showcases the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/25/world/malongo-journal-why-this-pampered-paradise-it-s-oil-stupid.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\">worst of the injustice</a> wrought by the oil industry. On the Malongo compound, oil workers have their pick of facilities: organic vegetables, tennis on manicured lawns and, just outside the gate, a plethora of young destitute Angolan women forced to straddle the fine line between take-away bride and prostitute.But Africa's tyrants are not the only ones to blame. </p> <p>High up in glittering office buildings in Lagos, London and Houston sit oil executives exploiting legal loopholes and corporate social responsibility rhetoric to operate in high risk zones without damage to their reputations, and enormous benefits to their bank balances.</p> <p><strong>Rumours</strong></p> <p>The signs coming from Malawi so far are mixed. According to <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/08/08/lake-malawi-exploration-fuels-ownership-debate/#axzz2A1E3gFhW\">Ibibia Worik, an extractives expert</a> at the Commonwealth Secretariat, \"A discovery would transform the Malawian economy from its current struggles into a multi-billion dollar one in an instant\". </p> <p>The mechanisms by which such enrichment should, indeed must, take place are well known: transparency around the allocation of licenses and revenues; the establishment of an oil revenue management fund; and ongoing investment in other productive areas of the economy. Such measures would provide citizens with the means to hold their governments to account over oil governance, and an assurance of continued stability when wells run dry.</p> <p>President Joyce Banda showed a deft hand and lack of patience regarding rumours of corruption around the allocation of an exploration license. Launching probe in August this year, she told the press, \"We have heard that there were underhand dealings in this contract so we would like to find out the truth\".</p> <p>But aside from launching the probe, Banda has given little signal of how oil will be managed. The lack of discussion around how revenues will be distributed to ordinary Malawians is unnerving, as is the silence on how she intends to safeguard fishing communities dependent on the lake from the inevitable impacts of large-scale oil exploration. Banda will need to show a firm hand here too if the murky waters surrounding contract allocation are anything to go by.</p> <p>If Banda and her cabinet get it right, Malawi could act as a leading light for those others in the region that are being swept along in the gold rush. If they get it wrong, the consequences will be dire not just for the country, but the region as a whole.The oil under Malawian territory does not belong to politicians, oil executives or militia men, but to the people of Malawi. </p> <p>Banda and her government have a duty to ensure ordinary Malawians see the benefits of this wealth, but the buck does not stop there. The international community must also shine a spotlight on Malawi, show no tolerance for opacity around its oil dealings, and support its leaders to allow oil wealth to be a blessing and not a curse.</p>",
  "<p>There's an election taking place in less than a month and I'm worried about it. Something abroad? No, it's happening here, up and down the country, probably where you live, definitely not far from it.</p> <p>In 2010 the government introduced the concept of independently elected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police-and-crime-commissioners\" title=\"\">police and crime commissioners</a> (PCCs), 41 of whom will replace long-standing police authorities in England and Wales. The official list of candidates will be published by the Home Office on Tuesday 23 October and, everywhere outside London, voting takes place on 15 November.</p> <p>The desirability, and indeed sanity, of having a single elected layperson control the local police budget has been debated at length. Former Met police commissioner Sir Ian Blair made his views plain this weekend by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/justice-secretary-defends-probation-outsourcing?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">calling for voters to boycott the elections</a> altogether. But it's not the policy itself that's the greatest cause for concern: there is a real danger presented by some of the PCC candidates.</p> <p>Among the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/19/police-crime-commissioner-list-analysed\" title=\"\">assortment of former MPs, local politics veterans and obscure independents</a>, the far-right English Democrats are putting forward seven candidates in total, from Manchester to Kent. Meanwhile the British Freedom party \u2013 the political arm of the openly racist and often violent English Defence League \u2013 has a candidate standing in Bedfordshire.</p> <p>The fact that far-right groups are standing in an election, however hate-filled their opinions and objectives, is not particularly notable. The point here is that they could win.</p> <p>Voter turnout <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/18/police-commissioner-elections-low-turnout\" title=\"\">is expected to be as low as 18.5%</a>, says the Electoral Reform Society: less than a third of what we would expect in even the least inspiring general election. Political campaigners tell me they fear it could be considerably lower \u2013 somewhere between 9% and 13% \u2013 or lower still if voters follow Blair's advice. Such a turnout means that a police and crime commissioner could be installed with a mandate from just 5% of the electorate. As Daniel Hodges of anti-facism movement Hope Not Hate puts it: \"Anything's possible in terms of outcome if the figures are as low as we've heard. That is the type of turnout that sees people wearing chicken suits get elected.\"</p> <p>So how likely, really, are they to get in? In Bedfordshire, for example, where the EDL-affiliated candidate is standing, the electorate amounts to 432,000 people. Statistics collected by monitoring group <a href=\"http://www.stop-watch.org/\" title=\"\">StopWatch</a> show that far-right candidates have polled 5% in local elections in the past and, in 2011, this was enough for them to come third of 11 candidates in Luton. If they could repeat this success across the county, on a turnout of 18.5% they would pull in something like 10% of the likely votes cast \u2013 possibly enough to clinch a tight election in which Tory and Labour voters stay at home. And if turnout is much below 18.5% this becomes even more likely.</p> <p>Prominent campaigner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicklowles\" title=\"\">Nick Lowles</a>, who was at the heart of Hope Not Hate's success combating the BNP in outer London areas in the 2010 general election, says: \"There are pockets of Luton where the EDL has a lot of support. Though we don't expect them to win, it's hard to think that there won't be a surprise result somewhere across the country.\"</p> <p>We're not talking about any local politician \u2013 after all, far-right councillors are nothing new \u2013 but PCCs will have the power to appoint or dismiss the chief constable. While we are assured that their remit is limited to strategy and cannot interfere with operational matters, ie on the ground policing, the elected individual would set the \"policing priorities\" and control the \"annual police budget\".</p> <p>One English Democrats candidate \u2013 Steve Uncles, who is standing in Kent \u2013 has vowed to criminalise the supply of halal and kosher meat. Even if elected, he may not have the power to do this; but he could remove funding for hate crime initiatives. And the party's calls for \"zero tolerance on antisocial disorder\" could manifest itself as a large increase in stop-and-search tactics, which we know for a fact disproportionately affect black and Asian people.</p> <p>These election looks likely to go by with very little noise. There is precious little government-funded literature on candidates and worryingly few mainstream media profiles of them, and 15 November will very likely be a wet and miserable day. These conditions could easily lead to the quiet election of an extremist, or entirely unknown quantity, to a position of guaranteed influence. This worries me, and it should worry you too. That's why I'd urge all those who believe in equality and democracy to cast their vote and dilute the impact of the far right.</p>",
  "<p>\"If you're not making money, that's a nice hobby you've got there!\" Blunt commercial advice from a blunt commercial adviser. But it was exactly the advice social entrepreneur Jude Ower, founder of online gaming company <a href=\"http://playmob.com/\" title=\"\">PlayMob</a>, wanted. For Jude, a 'highly commercial' approach is the best way to help the charities PlayMob supports.</p> <p>However, for many, fully embracing the dualism required of a social entrepreneur \u2014 do good and make money \u2014 is not easy. This is especially true of social enterprises that have been forced into existence as traditional funding has dried up. Making money is a subservient, if not uncomfortable objective.</p> <p>It's something every social entrepreneur knows they need to do, but it's not what gets them out of bed in the morning. And for many whose background is primarily social, the whole process of building a commercial operation can be bewildering.</p> <p>Our company, <a href=\"http://oneleap.to/\" title=\"\">OneLeap</a>, a global community that introduces entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs to business-leaders, investors and influencers, has just published <a href=\"http://oneleap.to/socent\" title=\"\">'How to build a social enterprise that makes money</a>.' The free book brings together personal tips and stories from 14 of our successful social entrepreneur members.</p> <p>The tips are as varied as the enterprises, but if there's one thread running through, it's the need to confront and embrace the dual nature of your objectives: making money and doing good \u2013 even if the former is a means to the latter.</p> <p>Here's what that dualism might mean.</p> <h2><strong>Horses for courses</strong></h2> <p>You're not going to ask your accountant for advice on how to get ex-offenders into employment. Similarly, don't rely on a board full of social work experts to tell you how to improve your marketing. Baillie Aaron of <a href=\"http://www.sparkinside.org/\" title=\"\">Spark Inside</a>, which provides life-coaching to ex-offenders, counsels developing a diverse network of advisers that includes for-profit professionals who will help you \"develop practical funding models and make you 'investable'.\" Particularly in an established organization that is transitioning to social enterprise, there can be resistance among the 'believers' to make space for the pragmatist 'suits.' The point is a social enterprise needs both.</p> <h2><strong>Stick to your mission, but don't get stuck in your business plan</strong></h2> <p>Having a clear mission is essential if you're to persuade people to back you. But as Jan Matern of <a href=\"http://www.theemergelab.org/\" title=\"\">Emerge Venture Labs</a> warns: \"don't be precious about your business model.\" Social entrepreneurs can be reluctant to pivot, as changing what you're doing to make money sounds an awful lot like 'selling out.' But changing the trading activity that supports that mission is not the same as changing the mission. Many startups need to perform some sort of pivot on the road to success. Social enterprise startups are not immune from this logic in achieving their missions.</p> <h2><strong>Share value, but know how to sell value</strong></h2> <p>There's a culture among people social enterprise and startups of helping each other out, and you should make the most of this. Selene Biffi, founder of <a href=\"http://www.plainink.org/en/\" title=\"\">Plain Ink</a>, which publishes books tackling social exclusion, created a value partnership under which her company gets free stationery in return for providing the stationer with illustrations from Plain Ink's workshops. Be aware though that some large organisations may cheekily suggest 'partnerships' when they can and should pay. Sometimes this means explaining politely, but firmly that you can't do something for free.</p> <p>It's also important you don't forget the commercial value you're creating along the way. For example, the lessons Lily Lapenna's <a href=\"http://www.plainink.org/en/\" title=\"\">MyBnk</a> learnt in establishing its highly successful financial literacy programmes has enabled it to consult to organisations wanting to set up similar initiatives.</p> <h2><strong>Learning to see double</strong></h2> <p>For many, the duality of being a social enterprise means having to focus on two customers. There's your social customer, who it's your mission to serve, and there's also your economic customer, who pays for your mission. Your economic customer may care about your mission \u2013 or they may not. If they do, that's a loyalty bonus, but don't expect them to let you off for sloppy service because you're a 'socent.' If they don't, embrace it. That's the beauty of a social enterprise: unlike asking for donations, you don't necessarily need to convince your economic customer of your cause in order to get their money. So sell the oversize 4WD-owner a great product, happy in the knowledge that even he is helping to fund a lower emissions world. And in meeting you, or in using your product, you might win him over to your cause as well.</p> <p><em>Hamish Forsyth is founder of </em><a href=\"http://oneleap.to/\" title=\"\"><em>OneLeap</em></a><em>, a global community that introduces entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs to business-leaders, investors and influencers.

  "<p>Soaring energy prices are bad politics, so how can they be stopped or at least eased? That question is worrying both political parties, but has produced some bizarre conclusions.</p> <p>The prime minister has announced that the government will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/17/energy-firms-forced-lowest-tariff?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">force energy companies to give the lowest tariff to their customers</a>. Astonishingly, he is admitting that private competition has completely broken down and, even more remarkably, his solution implies there is little point in having six separate companies if they're all required to charge roughly the same price. And that price wouldn't necessarily be all that low if the companies privately collaborated to ensure that their lowest tariff was still high enough to retain most of their present exorbitant profits.</p> <p>Labour for its part, when the competitive market has patently failed, is now asserting it wants more competition. This is odd to say the least when over the past decade or more so-called competitive markets have presided over a continually widening gap between wholesale and retail energy pricing, an unnavigable array of 500 constantly changing tariffs designed to bamboozle the consumer, and multibillion corporate profits alongside the slide into fuel poverty of 5 million households.</p> <p>So between suppressing private competition (David Cameron) and demanding more private competition (Caroline Flint) \u2013 though again, oddly, the normal party responses are here reversed \u2013 how are excessive energy price increases to be curbed? The answer is not confined to energy markets alone.</p> <p>Recent events over the last year or so reveal a similar breakdown in private markets in several other key areas. Despite the doubling of the taxpayer subsidy to the train companies since privatisation, rail fares are now the highest in Europe and about to soar again with a \u00a31,000 hike in the annual season ticket through much of the commuter arc round London during this parliament. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/14/west-coast-fiasco-audit-axed\" title=\"\">fiasco over the west coast mainline</a> has exposed the unreliability and riskiness of rail franchising over a 15-year span, with penalty cost for administrative failure adding perhaps another \u00a3100m. The overwhelming public demand is now for a return to public ownership.</p> <p>The breakdown in the housing market has led to the lowest number of houses built since 1923. With 5 million households now on council and housing association waiting lists and with 2.5 million unemployed including tens of thousands of building workers left idle, the private market has generated what is arguably the biggest single cause of social misery in Britain today. It is clear that only a major public sector-driven house-building programme will harness the labour wasted on the dole, break the stagnation that separates supply from demand, and clear the accumulated mass of unfit, damp and decaying housing over the next 10-15 year period.</p> <p>The pensions private market is equally in very serious disarray. As a result of the gutting of Barbara Castle's state earnings-related pension scheme, nearly half of those in the private sector, between 10-15 million workers, were left with no occupational pension at all. Final salary schemes have been wound up, and pension payouts to private sector workers have fallen by two-thirds through the falling stock market and employers unilaterally taking \"contribution holidays\". Now private sector workers are being herded into occupational schemes that will still leave a large minority with a pension at the end of a lifetime's contributions that is below the poverty line, meaning they will get nothing from all their contributions that they would not get anyway from means-tested benefits. This abject failure of the pensions private market, again accompanied by huge pension and insurance company profits, can only be reversed by a new high-value, high-quality state secondary pension scheme phased in over a 10-15 year period.</p> <p>But perhaps the most flagrant example of private market failure lies in banking. The banks have primarily served their own interests by focusing on property, overseas speculation and tax avoidance rather than the country's need for them to concentrate on promoting on industry, investment and exports. Freed from all but minimalist regulation, they recklessly pursued a bonanza in financial derivatives till the crash generated a bailout expected to push national debt to \u00a31.3 trillion by 2015.</p> <p>Not only should there now be a clean break between investment and retail banking, the big five should be broken up to provide the smaller specialist banks Britain now needs focusing on infrastructure, innovation and science, regional industrial clusters, the green economy and SMEs. And if the rebalancing of the economy is to be carried through, as it must be, control of the money supply must be shifted from the private banks into public hands to ensure that investment is directed on the scale required into the major revival of manufacturing.</p> <p>Alongside this redrawing of the partnership between the public and private sectors must go a review of the present frenzy for outsourcing. The canard that the private sector is always more efficient has been destroyed not only by the G4S fiasco, but also by the exposure of the A4E welfare to work failures compared with Jobcentre Plus and the growing number of examples of poor performance in health service outsourcing. A thorough review is now needed, shorn of ideology, to examine how the roles of the public and private sectors can be rebalanced to secure the fundamental reconstruction required for Britain's recovery.</p>",
  "<p>Like all Nairobians, Jessica Cola\u00e7o hates traffic jams, especially the out-of-nowhere monster tailbacks that make travelling in this sprawling city a gut-clenching gamble. Unlike most drivers, Cola\u00e7o is doing something about it.</p> <p>The 30-year-old is a research manager at Nairobi's <a href=\"http://ihub.co.ke/pages/home.php\" title=\"\">iHub</a>, a tech innovation centre where Kenyans brainstorm ideas. She is helping her team develop intelligent traffic lights to ease the chaos in the city considered to have the <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/35359.wss\" title=\"\">fourth worst commute in the world</a>.</p> <p>\"I hate driving in Nairobi. There is no management on the junctions \u2026 It becomes a deadlock,\" she said. City officials estimate traffic jams cost east Africa's largest economy more than 50m Kenyan shillings (\u00a3365,000) a day. \"It's about measuring the traffic density and congestion \u2026 and instead of pre-programming the traffic lights, you make them intelligent,\" she added. \"The idea is to have them spread across the highway so they are talking to each other.\"</p> <p>What Cola\u00e7o is suggesting is not revolutionary: other cities around the world use smart traffic lights. But if her team is successful, and if drivers buy in, it could spur a mini-uprising in a city where most traffic lights are ignored by drivers, and overruled by poorly trained police.</p> <p>The project grew out of one of the regular robotics boot camps run by the iHub, set up in 2010 by the founders of <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>, a non-profit, open source platform for crowdsourcing information during disasters. The iHub, where wannabe developers huddle together at small tables in an airy fourth-floor room, is part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/kalonzo-musyoka-technology-city-kenya\" title=\"\">Kenya's booming tech industry</a>.</p> <p>Cola\u00e7o says the project is a \"bare bones\" assignment \u2013 and when a research assistant, Juliette Wanyiri, 22, brings out the prototype, it looks more like a child's game than the answer to the paralysis already spreading along Ngong Road four floors below.</p> <p>The model has three coloured pins representing the traffic lights, linked by pink, green and yellow wires to a motion sensor, a camera and a mini-computer. \"It's a simulation model, whereby we have a microcontroller with the traffic lights and we have the sensors that sense the congestion,\" Cola\u00e7o said. The system is due to be tested on Ngong Road soon. \"If the traffic reads higher than our benchmark then the red light should go off and the green light should go on,\" Wanyiri said.</p> <p>Along Ngong Road, one of Nairobi's busiest arteries, people wondered whether drivers could be persuaded to obey traffic lights, even smart ones, in a city where the rules of the road seem to be open to personal interpretation.</p> <p>\"Even if you bring in new [lights], if someone is used to breaking the law, he will continue with that habit,\" said Joseph, a financial services worker.</p> <p>Overtaking on the wrong side of the road, driving the wrong way, or dodging boulders placed to stop vehicles from using unfinished bypasses are common in Nairobi. A few drops of rain can bring the city to a standstill. At night, traffic lights are ignored, not least because in this rich-meets-poor city, stopping is seen as an invitation to be mugged.</p> <p>Cola\u00e7o believes people will change their driving habits if they see the system works.</p> <p>The undisputed kings of highway anarchy are the drivers of <em>matatus</em>, Nairobi's public minibuses, who are widely condemned for speeding, failing to indicate and stopping in the middle of junctions.</p> <p>Dante, who collects money and shouts out destinations, doubts smart traffic lights would hold much sway with <em>matatu</em> drivers, and had his own ideas about what should be done. \"At each and every junction, they should have a cop because then the jams will be easier,\" he said.</p> <p>The iHub project is just part of a broader effort to get Nairobi moving. New bypasses and an eight-lane superhighway have been built and in August, the World Bank said it would invest more than $300m to develop a <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/08/02/kenya-launch-rapid-road-rail-transport-ease-urban-traffic-congestion\" title=\"\">mass rapid transport system</a>.</p> <p>The iHub researchers can only dream of such funding. Laughing, Cola\u00e7o and Wanyiri show off their financial war chest: a glass jar with a couple of shillings rattling in the bottom.</p>",
  "<p>Selling yourself in under 4,000 characters to an academic you've never met is pretty daunting even for the most confident sixth-form student. So we've put together some dos and don'ts to make sure you show yourself in the best possible light.</p> <h2>Here are eight don'ts</h2> <p>\u2022 Don't spend ages trying to come up with a perfect, snappy first line \u2013 write anything and return to it later.</p> <p>\u2022 Don't use cliches. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ucasbooks.co.uk/acatalog/The-UCAS-Guide-to-Getting-into-University-and-College--PU006001.html\" title=\"\">Ucas Guide to Getting into University and College</a>, the most overused opening sentences this year were variations of \"from a young age I have always been interested in\u2026\" This looks formulaic and is a waste of characters.</p> <p>\u2022 Famous quotes should be avoided, as these will be found in countless other applications. For instance, this line by Coco Chanel was found in 189 applications for fashion courses this year: \"Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Don't list your interests, demonstrate them. Professor Alan Gange, head of the department of biological sciences at Royal Holloway, University of London, says: \"Actually doing something, for example joining a national society or volunteering for a conservation organisation, tells me that students have a passion.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Style matters. Don't be chatty and use slang, but on the other hand, don't be pretentious. Cathy Gilbert, director of customer strategy at Ucas, says: \"If you try too hard to impress with long words that you are not confident using, the focus of your writing may be lost.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Don't ask too many people for advice. Input from teachers is helpful, but it is important that the student's personality comes across.</p> <p>Nicole Frith, 19, who has just started a BSc in Geography at the University of Durham, asked two teachers for advice on content. \"I would seriously advise against asking teacher after teacher,\" she said. \"There is no such thing as a perfect personal statement, and everyone has different opinions.\" Most admissions offices are happy to give general advice, and the Ucas website has <a href=\"http://www.ucas.tv/ucas/video/WXSch\" title=\"\">video guides</a> on how to plan and write your statement.</p> <p>\u2022 Don't be tempted to let someone else write your personal statement for you. A recent news report says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/13/sixth-formers-cheat-university-admissions\" title=\"\">sixth-formers are paying up to \u00a3350</a> on the internet for personal statements written by university students. Ucas, which uses fraud detection software to identify cheating, warns of \"serious consequences\".</p> <p>\u2022 Dont' skimp on paragraphs, despite their negative impact on line count. You want your statement to be readable.</p> <h2>And eight dos</h2> <p>\u2022 Organisation is the key. Caroline Apsey, 19, who started a medical degree at the University of Leeds this term, says: \"Before I started writing, I made bullet points of everything I wanted to include, and ordered them from most important to least.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Leave yourself plenty of time for editing. \"Start writing early, so that you have lots of time to re-read it with fresh eyes,\" Caroline says. Then edit and edit and edit again.</p> <p>\u2022 Be specific. Lee Hennessy, deputy head of admissions and recruitment at the University of Bath, says: \"Don't just say, you're interested in a subject because it's interesting. Ask yourself, what it is, specifically, about the subject that interests you?\"</p> <p>Lee Marsden, associate dean of admissions for the faculty of arts and humanities at the University of East Anglia, agrees: \"We want to know what excites the student: perhaps a book they have read or a play they have seen. There needs to be a hook.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Show you are up to date with developments in your subject: perhaps you could analyse a recent journal article or news event.</p> <p>\"You need to tune in to what's current in your subject,\" says Louise Booth, assistant director of sixth form at Fulford school in York. \"For example, if you're a politics candidate: have you been to see the prime minister or your local MP speak?\"</p> <p>\u2022 Around 80% of your statement should be dedicated to your studies and work experience, and 20% to extra-curricular activities. Hobbies are valuable, but must be used to reveal something relevant about the applicant.</p> <p>\"A simple 'I have done' list is not useful,\" says Helen Diffenthal, assistant principal for advice and guidance at the Sixth Form College, Farnborough. \"Saying that you were captain of the cricket team doesn't make any difference unless you use it to show that you can manage your time effectively.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Be original but treat humour with caution \u2013 jokes can fall flat.</p> <p>\"Original is excellent,\" says Gange. \"I once saw a statement written in the style of a tabloid journalism article. It was factual and entertaining; the student gained a place here and got a first.\"</p> <p>\"We let through quirky statements if the student is quirky,\" says Booth. \"Don't try to be funny if that's not you \u2013 it won't work.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Correct spelling and grammar is vital, so use the spell-check on your computer and get other people, such as teachers, to proofread your statement.</p> <p>\u2022 In the end, honesty is the best policy. Tell the admissions tutor, in your own words, why you deserve a place. \"Just be yourself,\" says Nicole. \"That worked for me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Read all about it: academic publishing is changing faster than anyone has realised, according to a new study <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/124\">reported today in BMC Medicine</a>.</p> <p>Before 2000 the vast majority of research papers were published in journals that could only be read by academics if they&#xa0;\u2014 or their university libraries \u2014 paid a subscription. But since the turn of the millennium, the growth of the world wide web has been accompanied by the emergence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access\">open access publishing</a>, by which research papers are made freely available online. According to results published today by <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/124\">Laasko and Bj\u00f6rk</a>, over half* of all research papers may now be available through open access.</p> <p>The academic publishing game has changed irrevocably.</p> <p>The change does not mean that academics have embraced the free-for-all file-sharing mentality that is the bug-bear of the music business. Rather it reflects the deep-seated amateur ethos of scholars, who have always seen the work of producing and reviewing their research findings as an intrinsic part of the job.</p> <p>While the dissemination of that research relied on the printing and distribution of academic journals, the publishers' subscription model was a sensible way to manage this business.&#xa0;But the opportunities provided by the web for instant distribution has fused with the principle that publicly funded research should be freely available and propelled the open access movement to the forefront of academic publishing. The escape from the physical bounds of publishing on paper should also help us to realise significantly better value for money in this core part of the research enterprise.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rise of open access has been hampered by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/02/academics-boycott-publisher-elsevier\">opposition from some publishers</a>, who see it as a threat to a lucrative subscription model, and by some quarters of the research community fearful of jettisoning an established process of publishing in familiar journals. Scientists may have invented the internet but some remain suspicious of its fast-moving and <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\">disruptive nature</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Others, myself included, are more sanguine about the promise of open access, as indeed is the UK government. In July this year science minister David Willetts warmly <a href=\"http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/David-Willetts-comments-on-the-Finch-Group-report-on-expanding-access-to-published-research-findings-67b77.aspx\">welcomed</a> the <a href=\"http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch/\">report</a> of the working group led by Dame Janet Finch on how to expand access to publicly funded research. The government sees open access as a way of accelerating the free distribution of scientific results, not just to researchers but also to businesses looking to innovate new technologies, and as a necessary mechanism for developing new computer-based text and data-mining methods for interrogating research results with a breadth and depth that no individual could hope to match.</p> <p>Finch's recommendations are now being <a href=\"http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/09/28/rcuk-open-access-policy-when-to-go-green-and-when-to-go-gold/\">implemented as policy</a> by Research Councils UK, the body that oversees public spending on science and the humanities. In a bold move, the UK has committed itself to ensuring that from April 2013 all publicly funded research papers will be available free to readers.&#xa0;</p> <p>The policy is not without its <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/09/05/key-questions-for-open-access-policy-in-the-uk/\">critics</a>, many of whom are concerned about the cost implications, since the new policy has a strong preference for facilitating free access by paying publishers an \"article processing charge\" (APC) to ensure the paper is made freely available upon publication (one of the forms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access\">gold open access</a>). The <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/06/27/finch-report-the-question-of-costs/\">cost calculations</a> are uncertain but may be as high as \u00a360m per year, which will have to come from the research budget, a sore point with researchers in these austere times. </p> <p>A cheaper <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-archiving\">green route</a> is also available, whereby the author usually deposits an unformatted version of the paper in a university repository without incurring a publisher's charge, but it remains to be seen if this will be adopted in practice. Universities and research institutions are only now beginning to work out how to implement the new policy (recently <a href=\"http://blogs.rcuk.ac.uk/2012/09/28/rcuk-open-access-policy-when-to-go-green-and-when-to-go-gold/\">clarified by the RCUK</a>).&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398205880\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350897372294/Laasko-Bjork-Fig2.png\" alt=\"Graph showing the rapid rise in online open access journals\" width=\"460\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The rapid rise in open access.

The Finnish researchers found&#xa0;not only that&#xa0;nearly 17% of research papers worldwide are now published in open access journals, a figure that&#xa0;is two to three times higher than was <a href=\"http://sparceurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SPARC-Europe-response-on-Finch-Report.pdf\">previously supposed</a>, but also that the exponential rise in open access publishing shows no sign of slowing down.</p> <p>In the UK, since about 35% of papers are reckoned to be made available through deposition in repositories \u2014 the green route \u2014 the total percentage of open access papers (52%*) looks like it has crossed the half-way mark.</p> <p>Whatever the difficulties universities and researchers might face in implementing the new RCUK policy, it is clear that there is no going back. We can look forward to a future in which there is a much freer access to research results, both for researchers, businesses and the public. The only question now is what can we do with it?</p> <p><em>22-28 October 2012 is Open Access Week around the world. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/\">Open Access Week website</a> for more information</em></p> <p><strong>*Update: 23-10-2012 09:27 - </strong>My estimate that over half of UK research may now be open access has been criticised as over-simplistic, which I accept.

There is strength in breadth as well as strength in depth.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, I wrote a book about intergenerational fairness called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/20/pinch-baby-boomers-willetts-millar\" title=\"\">The Pinch: how the babyboomers took their children's future and why they should give it back</a>. My argument that younger people face unprecedented challenges was built upon a wealth of research from the UK and abroad, in areas like game theory, neurology and demography.</p> <p>Yet too often it can feel as if there is a chasm between the academic community and the world outside. That may be because some researchers talk mainly unto themselves. It may be because the key findings of the latest research are too hard to find, perhaps residing in obscure journals behind high paywalls. Or it may be because there is a paucity of intermediary bodies whose job is to present new evidence to a wider audience. Whatever the cause, I welcome initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.societycentral.ac.uk\" title=\"\">Society Central</a> which serve to bridge the gap.</p> <p>Evidence should be the bread and butter of policymakers. Politicians of all parties have always had to be led by evidence of what works if they want to leave a positive mark behind. Eradicating disease, improving education or incentivising employment are impossible in an evidence vacuum. Countries that have transformed their fortunes against the odds, such as South Korea today or Japan after the Second World War, have done so by focusing resolutely on what works.</p> <p>In the area for which I have direct responsibility \u2013 universities and science \u2013 there is overwhelming evidence that the key to university success is institutional autonomy. We have the best-performing higher education institutions in Europe because we have the most autonomous higher education institutions in Europe. In contrast, some strong German institutions were weakened when, during the 20th century, fascists and then Communists sought to control them.</p> <p>So I resist the temptation to meddle in day-to-day decisions on campus, even when universities have controversially rebalanced their offer. And I resist lobbying designed to make me direct the research councils to fund particular areas. Our new student finance system routes more funding through students and less through Hefce, which will strengthen autonomy by making institutions more accountable to students than to centralised officials.</p> <p>Evidence-based policymaking has become more important in recent decades as greater cultural diversity has forced us to rely less on cultural norms. Moreover, the first peacetime coalition for 70 years has found evidence is a glue that can stick divergent political traditions together. It is the antidote to the sloppy thinking that is encouraged by sofa government.</p> <p>Yet it is not the job of politicians simply to follow the evidence in a tunnel-visioned way. In a democracy, we have to balance the evidence against other factors, such as public opinion and electoral promises (and compromises), as well as wider values. Governments have to respond to fast-paced events that lack a secure evidence base: often it is just not possible to establish a controlled pilot that needs months of subsequent evaluation before taking a decision.</p> <p>Behavioural economics has improved our understanding of how people respond to particular decision-making architecture, but even that doesn't absolve politicians from the need to take decisions about when, where and how to 'nudge' people. Deciding that people should be in employer-sponsored pensions is relatively easy, but you still have to determine which people, which employers and which pensions.</p> <p>Nonetheless, we do need to do more to put evidence in the hands of decision makers if public policy is to improve. That's what the coalition is seeking to do. We have funded <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/tools-and-resources/research-resources/surveys/bcf.aspx\" title=\"\">a new birth cohort study</a>, which will mean Britain continues to have unparalleled information about people's journeys through life. We have delivered a new era of transparency, in which information is more accessible than ever before \u2013 in my own area, we have just made <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/lt/publicinfo/kis/\" title=\"\">17 bits of key data</a> freely available on university courses, which will improve decisions about what and where to study. We have recently announced the most ambitious open-access policy in the world, which will make taxpayer-funded researcher much easier to find and ingest.</p> <p>One particular challenge is that there continue to be some areas of public policy that are much more studied than others. For example, while we have many strong education departments, it often seems as if they focus far more on schooling than the higher education sector itself. Next year is the 50th anniversary of the publication of <a href=\"http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/robbins/\" title=\"\">the landmark Robbins report</a>. Half a century on, it sometimes feels we have less information about areas like teaching within universities than our predecessors did back then. I hope that initiatives like Society Central will help to highlight and fill in such gaps.</p> <p><em>David Willetts is </em><a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/ministers/david-willetts\" title=\"\"><em>minister of state for universities and science</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The French government has announced a 10-point emergency plan to combat the wave of assassinations linked to organised crime on the Mediterranean island of Corsica.</p> <p>The plan follows the shooting last Tuesday of a prominent lawyer, Antoine Sollacaro, as he drove to work. The 63-year-old, who was shot five times in the head at the wheel of his Porsche as he was pulling up at a petrol station near the capital, Ajaccio, was the 15th person to be murdered this year on the Mediterranean island. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/corsica-intrigue-crime-politics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Not one of the killings, believed to be linked to criminal gangs, has been solved</a>.</p> <p>After a meeting of prominent cabinet ministers in Paris on Monday morning, the office of the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced a \"global strategy to fight Corsica's rampant criminality\".</p> <p>\"Economic and financial dealings are behind most of the murders \u2026 particular attention will be paid to the fight against money laundering, especially in the fields of property and including sport as well as the procedures for public contracts and urban authorisations,\" Aurault said.</p> <p>The 10 measures include appointing more investigating judges and setting up a special unit of the national gendarmerie to investigate and oversee criminal cases and \"co-ordinate internal security\". Ayrault also announced tighter controls on financial and fiscal dealings on the island.</p> <p>Ayrault called on Corsicans to show a \"spirit of responsibility\".</p> <p>\"The immense majority of Corsicans are suffering in this situation, each must ask themselves where are the roots of this violence,\" he said.</p> <p>After Sollacaro was murdered last week, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said the scale of violence on the so-called Ile de Beaut\u00e9 was \"intolerable\". Ayrault described the problem of organised crime on Corsica as a \"scourge that undermines [the island]\". <br>Corsica has been riddled with internal violence for decades. Previously it was linked to the nationalist movement but in recent years it has been blamed on criminal gangs who have made fortunes from bank robberies and large-scale drug trafficking.</p> <p>An historian, Antoine-Marie Graziani, has blamed the French state for the lawlessness, accusing Paris of washing its hands of Corsica. He also said it was wrong to describe the gangs as mafia.</p> <p>\"The attitude has been that the republic isn't bothered if it's Corsicans killing each other,\" said Graziani. \"They use the terms 'mafia' and 'vendetta' that are not just wrong but dangerous because they allow the state to say it cannot do anything about such things, which is scandalous.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Every time there's a murder they say it is 'intolerable'. I have lived here for 30 years and I must have heard this 50 times. We've had enough of hearing the same thing.\"</p> <p>Graziani said Paris had to take more active control of the island to stamp out ingrained corruption, money laundering, drug dealing and the black economy.</p> <p>\"It will be painful but it is the only way,\" he said.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Paccou, head of the island's Human Rights League, accused successive French governments of \"utter incompetence\" in dealing with Corsica's problems. He said the fact that French detectives investigating organised gangs were based in Marseilles meant they were often \"completely out of touch with the realities of Corsican life\".</p> <p>Paccou told broadcaster France 24 the key to ending the gangs' \"reign of impunity\" was to stem the flow of their money.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5166498.stm\" title=\"\">\"hug a hoodie\" speech in 2006</a> is largely remembered for his striking call \"to show a lot more love\". Putting right the damage in young people's lives, he told his audience at Iain Duncan Smith's Centre for Social Justice was \"about relationships ... about trust ... about emotion and emotional development\".</p> <p>He had another message for his audience that day too; one that operated on a more familiar trope: those who played by the rules against those who did not. \"Justice is about setting boundaries\", he said. Those who stepped into \"the territory beyond the pale\" should expect \"painful consequences\". Love, it seems, was for those young people who conformed, or tried to do so. Those who crossed the line could expect sanctions, penalties and pain.</p> <p>As the prime minister gears up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/21/david-cameron-law-and-order\" title=\"\">a speech on criminal justice</a> this week that is widely anticipated as signalling a rejection of the \"hug a hoodie\" approach, it is worth remembering that the attempt to balance the competing demands of punishment and reform, love and pain, has always been one of the central tensions, if not outright contradictions, of the coalition's criminal justice policy.</p> <p>The most striking indication of reform, though not love, has been the falling prison population. Indeed, in the UK as a whole the prison population has this year fallen by an average of nine a day since the end of March. The youth custody population in England and Wales has likewise fallen, by around 20% in the first two years of the coalition. Whether this can be put down specifically to coalition policies is a moot point. The numbers in youth custody fell in the final years of the Labour government too.</p> <p>On other matters, the demand for more pain has been notable. The August 2011 riots were a pivotal moment in this respect. The overly punitive sentences handed out to convicted rioters have been much commented on. Less discussed was the warning by Unicef that the imprisonment on remand of children suspected of rioting was likely to put the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/09/unicef-britain-riots-children-jailed\" title=\"\">UK in breach of its UN obligations on children's rights</a>. Understanding and nurture was not much in evidence here. But then in the Manichean view articulated by David Cameron back in 2006, suspected rioters had crossed the line and could expect pain, not love.</p> <p>A shift towards greater pain was also under way before the riots. Two months earlier, in June 2011, Cameron devoted a <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/pm%E2%80%99s-press-conference-on-sentencing-reforms/\" title=\"\">Downing Street press conference to sentencing reform</a>. The prime minister promised tougher sentences for violence and sexual offences and a crackdown on knife crime. He also signalled a subtle, though important, shift in the coalition's approach to sentencing and the prison population. The government would \"not reduce the prison population by cutting prison sentences\" he said, sending out a clear message that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/21/prison-reform-debate-ken-clarke\" title=\"\">modest agenda of reform initiated by Ken Clarke had run into the sand</a>.</p> <p>Those who mourn the loss of Ken Clarke as justice minister and fear what Chris Grayling might bring in his place should, though, remember that the Conservative party approach to criminal justice has for some years sought uneasily to balance off the incompatible calls for nurture and the demands for punishment.</p>",
  "<p>At the eastern tip of the Israeli settlement of Ariel, cranes and earth-movers are at work on the college campus, which stretches across a hill overlooking the villages and valleys of the West Bank. Eleven miles from the internationally recognised Green Line separating Israel from the Palestinian Territories, construction is under way of buildings to accommodate a projected growth from 13,000 to 20,000 students over the next 10 years.</p> <p>In September, the college passed a significant milestone when the Israeli cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/israel-west-bank-ariel-university-upgrade-row\" title=\"\">upgrade the college to a university</a> as a matter of \"national importance\". Backing the move, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the cabinet that Ariel was \"an inseparable part of Israel\" and would remain so in the future.</p> <p>The decision, concerning a settlement which is illegal under international law and whose future is a key determinant of a viable Palestinian state and the peaceful resolution of a decades-old conflict, was not universally acclaimed. Urging Israel to reconsider, British foreign secretary William Hague said it would \"deepen the presence of the settlements in the Palestinian territories and will create another obstacle to peace\".</p> <p>Deeper inside the West Bank, a few miles east of Ariel, construction workers are also busy. Earlier this year, Israel approved <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/west-bank-settlement-of-shiloh-gets-initial-approval-for-600-new-homes-1.414215\" title=\"\">plans for 600 homes</a> in the settlement of Shiloh and its outpost, Shvut Rachel. \"This community has doubled in size in 20 years, and there is no question that there will be further growth. The demand for homes is much greater than supply,\" said Shiloh's former mayor, David Rubin.</p> <p>Further south, Israel a year ago announced plans for a settlement across the Green Line close to Jerusalem. The 2,600 homes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/israel-settlement-isolate-arab-jerusalem\" title=\"\">Givat Hamatos</a>, plus expansion of neighbouring Gilo and Har Homa, will increase the separation of Palestinian areas of the city from the West Bank, reducing the likelihood of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>These three places illustrate a pattern of settlement growth that mocks Barack Obama's demand, issued early in his presidency, that Israel should halt expansion as an impediment to peace.</p> <p>Entrenchment of \"facts on the ground\" has led a growing number of people, on both sides of the conflict, to declare that creating a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state to resolve the conflict is now impossible. The \"two-state solution\", they say, is dead.</p> <p>In June 2009, less than six months into his presidency, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1902738,00.html\" title=\"\">Obama addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> in his keynote speech on the Middle East in Cairo. Restating US commitment to a two-state model, he said the Palestinians must abandon violence, and develop their capacity to govern. By most reckoning, the Ramallah leadership has ticked both boxes.</p> <p>On the Israeli side, Obama said the US did not accept the legitimacy of Jewish settlements. \"It is time for these settlements to stop,\" he said bluntly.</p> <p>There followed protracted negotiations between the US and Israeli governments which resulted, in November 2009, in Netanyahu reluctantly acceding to a temporary construction freeze in West Bank settlements. East Jerusalem was exempt, with the completion of any buildings whose foundations were already laid. In anticipation of the moratorium, the number of construction starts rose significantly in the run-up to November.</p> <p>Critics denounced the freeze as a farce, but the settlers were incensed and relations between Netanyahu and Obama nosedived. Relations between the two allies were \"in the state of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/27/israel-us-relations-tectonic-rift\" title=\"\">a tectonic rift </a>in which continents are drifting apart,\" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the US, memorably said in mid-2010. The freeze ended in September 2010, despite US efforts to secure an extension. Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians swiftly broke down as settlement construction resumed, since when the \"peace process\" has been in a catatonic state.</p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised for his early focus on settlements. But, according to one observer, \"the problem was not Obama's identification of the settlement issue as a critical obstacle to the resumption of talks and, beyond that, to the two-state model itself \u2013 it was his failure to stick with it in the face of Netanyahu's intransigence\".</p> <p>In the past two years, US officials have issued routine condemnation of settlement expansion plans but real pressure from Washington has eased. In June, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/jewish-population-west-bank-up\" title=\"\">the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank</a> had risen by 15,000 over the previous 12 months, to a record 350,000. Most of the growth was in small hardline settlements deep inside the West Bank. An additional 200,000 Jews live in settlements in East Jerusalem. In the New York Times, s ettlers' leader Dani Dayon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/opinion/israels-settlers-are-here-to-stay.html\" title=\"\"> pronounced the Jewish presence across the Green Line \"an irreversible fact\"</a>. Predicting the numbers in Jewish colonies in the West Bank would top 400,000 by 2014, he wrote: \"Trying to stop settlement expansion is futile.\" The international community should relinquish its \"vain attempts to attain the unattainable two-state solution\".</p> <p>He said: \"Our presence here has now passed a point of non-return. It's irrevocable, a fait accompli.\" The status quo, while not ideal, was \"immeasurably better than any feasible alternative\".</p> <p>In the face of the \"facts on the ground\", others are proposing alternative courses of action. Some on the Israeli right have called for annexation of the West Bank. The Palestinian population can either accept living under Israeli rule with limited rights or leave, they say. Critics say this would be akin to apartheid and make Israel a pariah state.</p> <p>Others have called for a more modest, but unilateral, annexation of the 9.4% of the West Bank which will lie between the Green Line and Israel's separation barrier when it is complete. Defence minister Ehud Barak recently proposed that settlers outside the three main blocs \u2013 Ma'ale Adumim, Gush Etzion and Ariel \u2013 should be evacuated or choose to live under Palestinian rule. The barrier would become what its critics have always charged \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5880\" title=\"\">Israel's new border</a>. \"It would be best to reach agreement with the Palestinians but, barring that, practical steps must be taken to begin the separation,\" he said in a newspaper interview.</p> <p><a href=\"http://bluewhitefuture.org/\" title=\"\">Blue White Future</a>, a relatively new organisation, also argues for \"constructive unilateralism\", by which it means Israel withdrawing to the security barrier, with voluntary evacuation and compensation for those in settlements beyond. \"Once Israel announces it has no sovereignty claims east of the fence, most [settlers] will move westwards,\" said Orni Petruschka, co-chairman.</p> <p>Some have even suggested the \"cantonisation\" of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority would be given autonomy in five cantons around the main West Bank cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron, with Israeli sovereignty over the rest of the territory.</p> <p>There are also growing Palestinian voices declaring the end of the two-state model. \"The two-state solution died long ago, with Israel's refusal to confront the settlement movement,\" said Palestinian analyst Diana Butto. \"Unless this colonial project is addressed completely, there cannot be two states, only apartheid.\" The battle now, she said, was for universal rights within the one state that is in de facto existence.</p> <p>Among those still fighting for a two-state model are European diplomats in Jerusalem who have identified a handful of West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements as \"game changers\". Significant growth in these places would signal crossing a red line, they say. \"There's a year, or 18 months maximum, before it's over,\" said one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.molad.org/\" title=\"\">Molad</a>, a young leftist Israeli thinktank, says it is fighting an \"irreversibility thesis\". According to director Avner Inbar, \"talk of the end of the two-state solution is irresponsible. The two-state solution is not only the best framework, it's the only one that will work. None of the advocates of one state talk of the likely consequences. It would result in dramatic and possibly catastrophic violence.\"</p> <p>Barring the unexpected, the most likely course is continuation of the status quo \u2013 Netanyahu's preferred option and so, it seems, Republican candidate Mitt Romney's, judging by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-israel-palestinian-solution\" title=\"\">recently leaked video</a>. But as many analysts and diplomats point out, the \"status quo\" in practice means the entrenchment and growth of settlements.</p> <p>A reinvigorated second-term Obama presidency could change that. In an interview with ABC in July, the president was asked if there was anything he believed he had failed at, that \"has you desperate to get that second term to atone for?\" There were \"a bunch of things that we didn't get done that I think were important,\" replied Obama. On foreign policy, he said, \"I have not been able to move the peace process forwards in the Middle East in the way I wanted\".</p> <p>Faith, as well as time, has been lost. \"Obama has learned this is not an issue that will win him any votes. I am not someone who believes a second-term president will act any differently that he did in his first term,\" said Butto.</p> <p>According to Dayon, \"Obama has learned the limitation of his powers to make change here. President Obama of 2012 will not be the same as President Obama of 2008 because he now realises he cannot deliver.\"</p> <p>Back in Ariel, students are hurrying between classes at the start of term. At the Moskowitz School of Communications, named after the US bingo magnate Irving Moskowitz, who has spent millions of dollars funding the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, 24-year-old Adi said she was thrilled at the institution's new university classification. \"It will give graduates better status and better job prospects. Yes, of course, we are situated in the middle of a conflict, but a city like Ariel is very valuable to Israel. We cannot give it up.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Shiloh, David Rubin dismissed the idea of evacuating any settlements. \"We're supposed to hand over our heartland? This is my country, where my roots are, where my history is, where my destiny is, where the Jewish people were born, exiled from and returned to. This community will never be destroyed. There will never be a deal with the Palestinians.\"</p>",
  "<p>You might think being punched, strangled and having your head slammed against the skirting board so hard you need eight staples in your forehead is good enough reason not to allow your attacker a second chance.</p> <p>Yet the government wants to give Sarah's abusive ex-partner the option of choosing to make child support payments directly to her for their toddler son's upkeep \u2013 even though he has a record of non-payment. If he fails to keep up with payments the government will charge Sarah for collecting the money on her son's behalf.</p> <p>Sarah (not her real name) endured three years of abuse, and only found the courage to escape the relationship when she became pregnant. After her partner beat her, took her money and phone and locked her in their house, she escaped through the front window and ran down the road, blood streaming from her face.</p> <p>Despite that, she tried to establish a relationship between her son and his father, allowing him access to the baby in the first few months. This ended when an argument led to her ex attacking her through her car window and trying to snatch the baby from his car seat as she drove off. Two years on Sarah and her son have no contact with her former partner and have succeeded in keeping their location secret from him.</p> <p>When the couple first separated Sarah's ex said he would set up a bank account for their son and pay into it. When he failed to do so, she was forced to contact the Child Support Agency (CSA). It is a huge battle to get what is due to her son: some months they get the full payment, some months they don't. Currently, the CSA takes the payments directly from her ex's bank account because of his past failure to pay.</p> <p>But the government is winding up the CSA and replacing it with the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) on a new IT system; its consultation on the final details \u2013 what it will charge those using its services \u2013 ends on 26 October.</p> <p>The changes will, from 2014, involve closing the 1.2 million cases of parents currently receiving money through the CSA and stopping payments currently taken directly from their ex-partners' wages or bank accounts. All non-resident parents \u2013 the ones not looking after the children \u2013 will be given the chance to make the payments directly to the parent with care, rather than having them collected by the new CMS, regardless of their previous payment record.</p> <p>The government emphasises that parents escaping violent relationships need not have direct contact with their former partners or provide any information about their bank accounts. The CMS will calculate the amount due to them, and they can use the Direct Pay money transfer system to receive money without revealing their bank details.</p> <p>But Janet Allbeson, a senior policy adviser with the single parent charity Gingerbread, says this policy will be very worrying to a women who has been a victim of abuse, as money is frequently used as a form of control by the abusing partner: \"The government has accepted that domestic violence can take the form of financial abuse, yet it intends to put a victim in the position where she is potentially exposed to further attempts at manipulation and control, by the payer altering payment dates or withholding money. This runs the risk of perpetuating the abuse.\"</p> <p>If the non-resident parent fails to pay through Direct Pay, the CMS will step in to enforce payments, and both parents will be charged for the collection of maintenance \u2013 a service that until now has been free.</p> <p>Sarah does not for a second think this will encourage her ex to pay up: \"He wouldn't pay anyway. He's got five children, and he doesn't pay voluntarily for any of them. It's just disgusting that the government intends to charge for collecting the money. I feel like my son is being punished for the actions of his dad.\"</p> <p>The government has defended its plans for charging, saying the new system is designed to encourage separated parents to take responsibility for making their own maintenance arrangements, rather than relying on the state to collect payments. It is putting \u00a320m towards helping separating parents do this by setting up a new website providing advice, and to fund relevant voluntary organisations.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says: \"The needs of vulnerable parents are central to our reforms of the child maintenance system, which for too long has let down children, parents and taxpayers. That is why the government is undertaking the biggest overhaul to the child maintenance system in a generation.</p> <p>\"In future, separated families will be helped and encouraged wherever possible to come to their own arrangements, which evidence shows is in the best interests of children. Where this is not possible, a new more efficient and effective statutory service will be in place for those who need it, and we are doing everything we can to ensure vulnerable parents are protected.\"</p> <p>But the government also wants to simplify and reduce the \u00a3500m annual cost of running the CSA. The DWP has calculated that the taxpayer pays 35p for every \u00a31 of maintenance collected.</p> <p>It believes most of the parents already using the CSA would prefer to make their own arrangements given the right support, and should therefore escape these charges. But Allbeson says the government's own research indicates that the majority of CSA applicants do not have the kind of relationship with their former partners that will enable amicable negotiation over payments: 29% said their relationship was not at all friendly while 30% had no contact whatsoever. \"So the chances of these parents being able to forge a meaningful payment arrangement are negligible,\" she says.</p> <p>One mother who will have no choice other than to use the CSA's services is Alison Bradford \u2013 even though her relationship was not violent. The father of her 15-year-old daughter made it clear from the outset he wanted nothing to do with his child, and has even on occasion given up work to avoid paying maintenance. \"He works in catering, so it's easy for him to get cash-in-hand work that the CSA can't trace,\" says Bradford.</p> <p>In 15 years the only money she has received on behalf of her daughter is about \u00a31,000 in arrears that a bailiff appointed by the CSA managed to extract during the past year. As soon as the arrears were collected, the father again stopped paying towards his daughter's upkeep. \"There's no way he would ever sit round a table and discuss this,\" she says. \"I'm sure we're not unique: the government is putting all of us in an impossible position.\"</p> <p>In the US, child maintenance is taken directly through payroll deductions from the non-resident parent's salary in most states \u2013 in the way that auto-enrolment pension contributions have started being deducted in the UK.</p> <p>When asked why this could not be extended to all child maintenance payments, the DWP spokesman said: \"It's a completely different thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs employee who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/goldman-sachs-director-quits-morally-bankrupt\" title=\"\">infamously quit Wall Street via a New York Times article in March</a>, says the investment bank routinely took advantage of charities and pension funds in order to increase its profits.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50133578n\" title=\"\">an interview on CBS News' 60 Minutes</a> on Sunday to promote the release of his book called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9781455527472/why-i-left-goldman-sachs-a-wall-street-story\">Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story</a>, Smith said that securing an unsophisticated, or \"muppet\" client was the top goal of the bank's salespeople. His frustrations with that culture meant he \"literally wanted to hit the board of directors over the head\".</p> <p>\"Getting an unsophisticated client was the golden prize,\" he told the programme. \"The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client.</p> <p>\"What Wall Street will do is they will approach one of these philanthropies or endowments or teachers' retirement pension funds in Alabama or Virginia or Oregon and they'll say to them: 'We have this great product that is going to serve your needs'. And it looks very alluring to these investors but what they don't realise is that upfront they are immediately paying the bank $2m (\u00a31.2m) or $3m because of their lack of sophistication.\"</p> <p>Smith was no more than a mid-ranking employee when he penned his March article, which is best remembered for his claim that Goldman bankers in London frequently dubbed unsophisticated clients as \"muppets\".</p> <p>\"Within week one [of arriving in the London office] I met a junior guy who was 24, 25 years old and the first thing he'd told me was that he had just traded a sophisticated derivative with a 'muppet client' who'd paid the firm an extra million dollars because the client was so trusting that he didn't check the price with other banks,\" Smith recalled. \"Now you could think to yourself, is this some rogue guy who is just talking callously about clients, but his boss who's a managing director was sitting right next to him nodding and chuckling along.\"</p> <p>Smith also recalled how he and a Goldman partner travelled to Asia to meet a major client, described as the \"head of one of the biggest funds in the world\".</p> <p>\"[The client] looks me and the partner in the eye and says: 'Let me be honest with you guys. We don't trust you at all. But don't worry, there's nothing to worry about, we're going to keep doing business with you because you're the biggest bank, you're the smartest and factually we have to do business with you'.</p> <p>\"Now my jaw almost dropped because hearing from one of your biggest clients that they don't trust you when your whole mantra and reputation is built on trust, to me was the worst possible thing that you can hear. And then I leave the meeting and the partner from Goldman Sachs, who I was with, is jubilant. This is great news. The client is going to keep doing business with us because they have to.\"</p> <p>Goldman declined to give CBS a response to its Smith interview. However, the bank's board has already been told that an internal investigation triggered by Smith's resignation \u2013 which was dubbed the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/22/goldman-sachs-muppet-hunt\" title=\"\">muppet hunt</a>\" \u2013 had found little substance to the allegations.</p> <p>The bank has also been briefing that Smith had been angling for a promotion and for the bank to double his pay to $1m, although Smith claims he would have quit even if his pitch had been successful.</p> <p>\"What I can say to you, and this may sound stupid, is that I didn't go to Wall Street purely to make lots of money,\" he said. \"I definitely wanted to make money, but I left because things had veered so far from what I actually believed was right. I could have just left and walked out and said nothing about it but I would have felt that that was not the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>Along with several other major Wall Street banks, Goldman has been widely criticised for making money at the expense of clients who did not fully understand the complex financial products they were dealing with.</p> <p>In 2010 Goldman was fined <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/16/goldman-sachs-record-abacus-fine\" title=\"\">$550m as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> \u2013 the largest in the US regulator's history \u2013 when the bank accepted that the marketing materials it issued to investors for its infamous Abacus transaction gave \"incomplete information\".</p> <p>The Abacus case had called into question the integrity of Wall Street after the commission alleged Goldman had packaged up mortgages into Abacus and then sold them to investors without telling them that one of its powerful clients, the hedge fund Paulson, had been taking a trading position intended to profit from a fall in the value of US house prices and had even selected some of the mortgages included in the product.</p>",
  "<p>Ambition and confidence are two of the great drivers of career success; confidence will often trump competence and ambition will often get you ahead where ability doesn't. Conversely, even the most capable will languish if they lack one or both.</p> <p>Confidence is perhaps the more obvious of the two traits. Most of us can think of people who have created a virtuous circle of confidence and success \u2013 and people whose confidence has been eroded to the point where they believe they can do nothing right, meaning they can't.</p> <p>Confidence can be innate. Some people have it from their genes and upbringing. But confidence also breeds more of itself. Who has not experienced a success that bolstered self-belief and led to further successes? And people tend to follow confident leaders, which makes them likely to become yet more successful and confident.</p> <p>The good news is that confidence can be created and even feigned. If you're unsure of the ground you stand on at work, you can start by trying to adopt the feeling of somebody who is control. Tell yourself you can do it \u2013 and envision success, like a golfer imagining a ball going into the hole. Although this might sound rather trite, your brain really does latch on to it and it will boost your confidence. If you then succeed, this fake confidence will become real.</p> <p>There are plenty other tricks you can use too:</p> <p>\u2022 Remember, even when you're nervous, others can't see your nerves<br>\u2022 Think about the times when you have succeeded, even in totally unrelated situations<br>\u2022Preparation can make you far more confident. Arriving for a meeting five minutes early and reading the topic being discussed will give you a big psychological boost, as well as being practically useful.</p> <p>Confidence might seem straightforward, but ambition is harder to nail down. We all agree that we need it \u2013 and even that it often makes the difference between chief executives and non-chief executives. But can you improve and develop your ambition in the same way you brush up on your IT skills or your confidence?</p> <p>You need to be realistic. You're unlikely to turn yourself from an ordinary employee into an entrepreneur who goes from one stellar start-up to the next. If it makes you feel better, ultra-ambitious types are never satisfied by their success. They don't quite believe it, which is why they keep on going.</p> <p>You can build your own ambition by looking at people who enjoy their work and are enthused by it, like James Dyson. People like this have often stuck with one area they believe in and love. They work hard because they're interested, they enjoy it and because they are in an area that's right for them. Also, understand your other motivations. You might think your strongest motivator is money, when actually you're more motivated by security for your family.</p> <p>Don't let yourself get stuck in a rut. Apply for new positions that interest you, network and get out of your comfort zone. Think about where you want to be and the steps you need to take to get there. Don't wait for jobs to come to you and don't make excuses. Successful people tend to accustom themselves to taking risks that others shy away from.</p> <p>Remember that ambition and confidence can only take you so far. While both act as career accelerants, they must work with the talent you already have. Boundless ambition and endless self-confidence without much ability are what makes cringe-worthy reality television. But well-channelled ambition and properly developed confidence are often what separates organisational superstars from also-rans.</p> <p><em>Rhymer Rigby is the author of a new book, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780749465926\" title=\"\"><em>The Careerist</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The justice secretary has defended David Cameron's plan to outsource large swaths of the probation service to private companies, such as G4S and A4e, along with charities and voluntary groups.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Chris Grayling said changes must be made to the current situation, which has seen reoffending rates <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18188610\" title=\"\">soar to record levels</a>. Private companies and charities would give offenders mentoring and support when they were released from prison and help show them that there was a \"better place to be\" than in jail, he said.</p> <p>In his first speech on crime since becoming prime minister, Cameron is to call on Monday for tougher sentencing and more rehabilitation.</p> <p>Grayling said the system would be run along the same lines as new welfare-to-work schemes operated by private companies to get the long-term unemployed back into work, which are paid on results.</p> <p>\"We have to do things differently,\" he said. \"Prisoners coming back on to the streets after prison are as likely to reoffend as not reoffend.\"</p> <p>Prisoners, including those on short-term sentences who are currently not covered by rehabilitation, would be given mentoring before they left prison and support when they left. Pilot schemes testing the new rehabilitation programmes had shown \"very encouraging results\" and would be rolled out throughout the country, Grayling said.</p> <p>He added that former prisoners or gang members could be employed to persuade prisoners leaving prison that there were alternatives to crime.</p> <p>\"[Former offenders can say:] 'I've gone straight, there is a better place to be,'\" he said.</p> <p>Grayling also criticised the former Metropolitan police chief Lord Ian Blair, who called for voters to boycott next month's elections for police and crime commissioners in a bid to stop the scheme because he believed each commissioner would have to control too large an area.</p> <p>\"It is a silly thing to say and I am sorry that he said that,\" said Grayling. \"We should not have a former senior police officer making silly claims like this.\"</p> <p>Cameron's speech is being billed as \"tough, but intelligent\", with the prime minister expected to argue that \"the primary, proper response to crime&#xa0;\u2026 is punishment \u2013 proportionate, meaningful punishment\", but the prime minister will also argue that \"prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime\".</p> <p>It is being viewed as an attempt by Cameron to get tough on crime, with the prime minister arguing that retribution \"is not a dirty word \u2013 it is important to society that revulsion against crime is properly recognised\".</p> <p>No new money is expected to be announced for the rehabilitation schemes, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-initiative-trouble\" title=\"\">aides saying</a> the prime minister's speech would focus on \"more long-term vision stuff\", though suggestions that the government may scrap the \u00a346 currently given to offenders when they leave prison have been quietly discarded.</p> <p>Cameron is also expected to reveal plans to tackle gang gun-runners with a new criminal offence of possessing firearms with intent to supply.</p>",
  "<p>If the transfer merry-go-round had a theme tune, the Mill, like most people, likes to imagine it would sound a bit like this:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8fI7zm7RXHs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8fI7zm7RXHs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Unfortunately, it seems more likely to sound rather more like this:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gJdq-UbQWcs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gJdq-UbQWcs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Mill, being a liberal-minded purveyor of transfer nonsense, will leave it up you, dear reader, to decide which one to have playing in the background as you read today's missive. We begin at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where the merry-go-round is set to crank into full swing in January. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are bracing themselves for the departure of <strong>Radamel Falcao</strong> to the Premier League (Manchester City and Chelsea are both in a lather over the Colombian) and will turn to Manchester United's Javier Hern\u00e1ndez.</p> <p>So Atl\u00e9ti will look to replace <em>El Tigre </em>with <strong>Little Pea</strong>, a deal in which they get the raw end of the deal when it comes to nicknames. Falcao may not be the only forward to leave the Calder\u00f3n, though - Arsenal are keen on adding <strong>Adrian L\u00f3pez</strong> to their band of twinkle-toed attacking dandies. Heading for the Emirates exit, on the other hand, and stomping in the vague direction of Finsbury Park station with a look of thunderous bemusement on his Chevy Chase is <strong>Andr\u00e9 Santos</strong>, who is wanted by Galatasaray.</p> <p>They shoot horses, don't they? Not if you're Frankel they don't. Once you've run your course at the top level you get put out to stud with more carrots and sugar lumps than you can shake a stirrup at. Football's equivalent, though presumably without quite as much carefully scheduled sex, is the MLS where LA Galaxy want to give <strong>Frank Lampard</strong> a cosy pasture in which he can canter out his final playing days.</p> <p>In transfers-that-won't-happen-but-are-doing-rounds-regardless news, Brendan Rodgers wants Arsenal's <strong>Theo Walcott</strong> and Chelsea's <strong>Daniel Sturridge</strong> and, perhaps more realistically, Everton-supporting Schalke midfielder <strong>Lewis Holtby</strong> to join his Liverpool project. And universally popular Barcelona midfielder <strong>Sergio Busquets</strong> is a target for Chelsea.</p> <p>Last but not least, the first (and only) instalment of a new series we're calling Championship Manager, a name we believe someone should use that for one of those new-fangled video games. The latest man on Blackburn Rovers' hitlist is Fulham coach (and former Blackburn midfielder) <strong>Billy McKinlay</strong>. Over the past two years, no manager in the Championship has done a better job than <strong>Dougie Freedman</strong> at Crystal Palace. Bolton are the latest to take notice of the cerebral Scot's work and will offer him a three-year deal at the Reebok.</p> <p>And Ipswich have learned their lesson. Having erred in overlooking fresh young coaches in favour of appointing an old hand with his best days long behind him when naming Paul Jewell as manager, the Tractor Boys will turn to <strong>Alan Curbishley</strong> if Jewell throws in the towel this week.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will this week throw themselves into frantic, almost non-stop tours of the battlefield states that will help decide what is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested elections in recent US history.</p> <p>In a sign of the intensity of the campaign in the final fortnight, after Monday's third and final presidential debate, Obama is to travel to six swing states and his hometown, Chicago, in 48 hours. The president, who normally returns to Washington overnight, is to sleep aboard Air Force One to save time for campaigning and will also make election calls while the plane is in the air.</p> <p>A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows that after trailing Obama all year, Romney is now tied with him on 47% of the likely vote. The last WSJ/NBC poll, taken before the first presidential debate in which Romney dominated the president, had Obama ahead by 49% to 46%.</p> <p>One of Obama's chief advisers, David Axelrod, expressed scepticism about the polls when he appeared on NBC on Sunday, pointing to huge variations in findings.</p> <p>\"I do think that this is going to be a very close race, and we've said that consistently,\" he said. \"We feel good about where we are. We feel we're even or ahead in these battleground states.\"</p> <p>An election that had seemed listless is entering its last phase with re-energised Republicans finally believing that their candidate might make it to the White House and Democrats panicking at the thought that Obama might be slung out of office after a single term.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of volunteers, many of whom had been disinterested for much of the year, turned up at campaign offices over the weekend, conscious at last of what is at stake on 6 November.</p> <p>The two candidates go into Monday's debate in Boca Raton, Florida, with Romney having won with a knock-out in the first in Denver and Obama winning on points in the second in Hempstead, New York. The 90-minute Boca Raton debate will be devoted to foreign affairs.</p> <p>As president, with daily access to briefings on foreign affairs and security, Obama goes into the final debate as favourite, not least because it gives him another chance to remind voters that Osama bin Laden was killed on his watch.</p> <p>But Romney, after two botched attempts to force Obama onto the defensive over Libya, will try again over the assault on the US consulate in Benghazi that left the ambassador and three other Americans dead.</p> <p>The US response to the stand-off with Iran over its nuclear programme is almost certain to be debated. The New York Times reported on Sunday that the Obama administration had achieved a diplomatic breakthrough with an agreement in principle to one-to-one talks with Tehran after the election. The Iranian government has long argued for one-to-one negotiations rather than the international coalition of the US, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany.</p> <p>The White House denied there had been an agreement, but said it was open in principle to such negotations.</p> <p>In a sign of how engaged voters have become, an estimated 65.5 million people watched the second debate, one in which the figures normally drop off substantially. It was only marginally down on the first one, which was watched by 67 million people, and well up on 2008 viewing figures. Even amid the excitement then at the prospect of the first African-American president, the three debates averaged audiences of around 57 million.</p> <p>Obama spent the weekend in debate rehearsal at Camp David, while Romney held his last fundraising event at a donor's home in Palm Beach, Florida, freeing himself for debate preparation at a hotel in Boca Raton and the campaign sprints that will follow.</p> <p>With the debate over, Obama will on Wednesday embark on a two-day campaign blitz of six swing states: Iowa, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, Virginia and Ohio. He will also drop into his hometown Chicago to cast his ballot early.</p> <p>\"As the president crisscrosses the nation, he will spend time on Air Force One calling undecided voters, rallying national team leaders and volunteers and continuously engaging with Americans,\" his campaign said in a statement.</p> <p>Romney will head for two days of campaigning in Nevada, Colorado and Ohio on Tuesday.</p> <p>The Republican campaign has been underway since at least the Ames straw poll in Iowa in summer last year, a traditional early test for candidates seeking the party's nomination. The Republican nomination race produced lots of headlines, from allegations of sexual harassment by Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich's proposals for a colony on the moon, but the election failed to capture the public imagination in the same way as 2008.</p> <p>But Romney's victory in the Denver debate and the subsequent tightening in the polls has changed all that.</p> <p>Both campaigns having raised close to $1bn (\u00a3625m), meaning that the candidates go into the final fortnight with funds to saturate ad markets in every swing state. It is the costliest election in US history.</p> <p>An analysis by the Politico website suggested the Obama campaign had raised $969m in funding and the Romney campaign $919m. Both will be asking for more donations over the final two weeks.</p> <p>Filings by the Republicans over the weekend to the federal election commission, as required by law, showed Romney and the Republican party ending September with $183m in hand, compared with $149m for Obama and the Democrats. The Obama campaign spent heavily over the summer in a pre-emptive strike while Romney has been hoarding cash for a final ad blitz.</p> <p>As alarming for Democrats as the WSJ/NBC poll is one by Public Policy Polling in Ohio, the bastion on which Obama rests his hopes if the east coast swing states - Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and New Hampshire - fall to Romney. PPP has Obama on 49% and Romney on 48% in what is a predominantly working-class state in America's industrial heartland.</p>",
  "<p>US sports and events giant AEG, owner of London's O2 arena, has launched a new online booking service to take on industry heavyweight Ticketmaster and has plans to tackle eBay-style resellers such as Viagogo and Stubhub.</p> <p>AEG, which owns assets including David Beckham's LA Galaxy and is up for sale with an $8bn-plus pricetag, says that the new service will mark the end of fans' frustrations at websites crashing and touts snapping up the best tickets.</p> <p>\"It is high time someone took a stand and developed a platform that is more fan-friendly,\" said Dean DeWulf, vice president of AEG Europe. \"Fans are disillusioned by the 'big bang' process with a tidal wave of computer programme requests for tickets by touts. The view is that it is the lonely punter versus thousands of touts and that they don't stand a chance.

What isn't is touts using computer scripts [to snap up tickets]. We need to make sure fans have at least one place they know for sure is safe and secure. That they feel comfortable buying in\".</p> <p>DeWulf said that a major part of AEG's desire to launch AXS, which went live in the US last year, is to empower promoters and venues who don't have control over ticket buyers' data.</p> <p>\"From a strategic standpoint we realised we had a problem,\" he said. \"One thing that begins on every customer interaction is ticketing and we didn't have a proper seat at the table. From a promoter and venue standpoint we aren't getting our share of consumer data, it was just untenable.\"</p> <p>AEG says it is responsible for 20m tickets through people attending its venues or events it promotes.</p> <p>The company will start by selling tickets for events at its own venue, London's O2, but is keen for AXS to be seen as a platform for all venues and promoters of acts.</p> <p>It will not stop promoters who hold events at AEG venues from selling tickets on rival websites.</p> <p>One of the first acts in the UK to use AXS is Girls Aloud. The girl group's concert promoter is subsidiary AEG Live, and it will use the platform to sell tickets for the reunion tour.</p> <p>DeWulf said that the sale of AEG, which has attracted the interest of suitors <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/us-aeg-ellison-idUKBRE89B03720121012\" title=\"\">including Oracle's multi-billionaire Larry Ellison</a>, will not impact its aggressive roll-out plans for AXS.</p> <p>\"There really are no implications for us from the sale process,\" he said. \"[Ticketing] is a growth area for the business\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

A patent is a government-granted monopoly to an invention. It's bestowed on the inventor who files for it with the relevant patent office. As Patent Baristas <a href=\"http://www.patentbaristas.com/archives/2012/10/11/honey-let-me-tell-you-about-what-i-learned-about-patents-today/\">put it</a>: \"Patent applicants must show that the invention is new and non-obvious and applicants must describe the invention such that a person in the industry would know how to make and use the invention.\"</p> <p>Let's unpack that. To qualify as a patent, something must be </p> <p>a) novel - so a patent application can be disqualified by \"prior art\" showing the same concept portrayed elsewhere at or before the application </p> <p>b) non-obvious - the test being that someone in the field in which it's filed, at the time at which it is filed, wouldn't see it as a direct extension of what exists (so adding an extension to a paint roller is \"obvious\", but you might find a \"non-obvious\" way to attach that extension to the existing roller) \u2013 this is exactly the same as the idea of an \"inventive step\"</p> <p>c) feasible - so you can't patent a perpetual motion machine or something else that, say, breaches the Second Law of Thermodynamics. </p> <h2><a name=\"same\">Are all patents the same?</a></h2> <p>Nope. Although they're all awarded by patent offices, they cover different things and have different applicabilities. Here we'll deal with four kinds: software patents, functional patents, \"standards-essential\" patents, and \"trade dress\" patents.</p> <h2><a name=\"tradedress\">What's a \"trade dress\" patent?</a></h2> <p>Software patents are mostly code, but have some physical outcome; <br>functional patents can cover anything, from vacuum cleaner parts to software to gigantic trucks to processes for identifying genes;<br>\"standards-essential\" patents are, well, essential to standards;<br> registered designs (confusingly called design patents or \"trade dress\" patents in the US) cover how a product looks and its aesthetic appearance</p> <h2><a name=\"infringement\">What's \"patent infringement\"?</a></h2> <p>Producing something that has the same features or performs the same function in a way that's covered by the patent that's already been granted. </p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> take Apple's \"slide to unlock\" system for the iPhone, which has been patented in the US and Europe. (Ignore for a moment the question of whether it should have been awarded. Just accept that it has.) If you produced a phone interface that looked and functioned exactly the same, you could expect Apple to come after you. But if you produced a touch interface with a thin line along which you slide a ball to unlock the screen, you could expect that that too would be judged \"infringing\". That's why HTC and Motorola changed the interface of their Android phones in Germany: a court there reckoned that their interfaces infringed Apple's patent. (We'll explain why it was Motorola and HTC, not Google, which was sued in a minute.)</p> <p>However, if you can find a way to get the same outcome but by a different route (ie, avoiding the existing patent's \"inventive step\") then you aren't infringing. But often that has to be decided in a court, either by a judge or jury - an expensive outcome that's generally to be avoided.</p> <p>To show infringement in registered designs, you'd have to show that the infringing object looked very similar to the registered one. </p> <h2><a name=\"defence\">How do you defend yourself from patent infringement claims?</a></h2> <p>Assuming you can't do it in a friendly way (which if someone is claiming you're using their patent, you probably can't), your options are: \u2022 invalidate the patent by showing that there is prior art<br>\u2022 invalidate the patent by showing that it shouldn't have been awarded because it fails one of the three \"tests\" - where \"obviousness\" is a common line of attack<br>\u2022 show that what you do is different from the patent.<br>\u2022 show that you've already paid to use the patent through some existing licensing agreement; in this case the principle of \"patent exhaustion\" comes into play, which boils down to \"you shouldn't have to pay twice to use the same thing\".</p> <p>One point: if the claim is over \"standards essential\" patents (SEPs), only the last of these is an effective defence There is another defence in \"standards essential\" patent (SEP) claims, which is that the amount being demanded is unreasonable. This is only a defence in SEP-related cases; in any other situation, a patent owner can charge what the hell they like. They can even refuse to license a patent and demand the withdrawal of infringing products via a court injunction. (Apple <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=apple+injunction\">does this a lot</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nasdaq.com/article/appeals-court-upholds-microsoft-request-for-injunction-against-motorola-20120928-00955\">So does Microsoft</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/motorola-apple-injunction/\">not to forget Motorola</a>. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/htc-sues-apple-over-patents-wants-injunction-and-lots-of-damages/\">And HTC</a>.) </p> <p>Cases over patent infringement will often end up in court, which both sides will (or should) know is generally like going blindfold into a casino with all your money and credit cards stuffed in your pockets. You might come out even richer, or with less than nothing.</p> <h2><a name=\"softwarepatents\">What are software patents, and how can they possibly be valid?</a></h2> <p>Strictly speaking, in Europe, you can't patent software as such, but you can patent software that achieves a technical effect. The precise rules differ from country to country, and the rules in the USA are more lenient than in Europe.t. </p> <p>The \"software patents\" that the US Patents and Trademarks Office (USPTO) grants are for the <em>implementation</em> of something through software. So in the US, Amazon's (controversial) 1-Click patent on its store is granted on the combination of a piece of code which implements easy ordering by user interaction, plus some manipulation of what the site already knows about you, plus the fact that you have to interact with the code. It's a \"business process\", and in the US Amazon has that patent. (Apple, for example, licenses it from Amazon for the iTunes Music and App Store in the US.)</p> <p>There's a key difference here between the US and Europe. Amazon has repeatedly tried to patent 1-Click in Euope. But it has been rebuffed just as repeatedly because 1-Click doesn't satisfy the European standard for patentability, which is that to be patentable, a piece of software has to cause some <em>physical</em> manifestation. (This difference is why Apple has been able to patent slide-to-unlock to some - though not universal - effect in Europe: the slide-to-unlock system has the physical effect of allowing you to interact usefully with the rest of the screen with your fingers or whatever.)</p> <h2><a name=\"sued\">So you can't be sued for software? Then how can all these lawsuits be going on?</a></h2> <p>You can't be sued for the fact that some code exists, but once you embody it in something - a smartphone, say, or a tablet - and make it do something, you <em>might</em> be infringing on the invention that is embodied by another piece of code. </p> <p>Thus Apple has sued HTC and Motorola over \"slide-to-unlock\" implementations on their phones. But it hasn't sued Google, because Google only wrote the code. It was up to HTC and Motorola to figure out whether their implementations infringed Apple's patent. (This isn't easy.)</p> <p>Note, by the way, that nobody is suggesting that HTC or Motorola (or Google) <em>stole</em> Apple's code from the iPhone and implemented it. It would be shocking if the actual program looked anything like the same. But it's the implementation - what it enables and how it enables it (in this case, sliding a finger along a displayed track on a multi-touch screen in order to enable the rest of the screen) - that infringes. </p> <p>This is why, for example, modern versions of Android's unlock system let you pull a lock icon in pretty much any direction. There's no line to even hint about how you should drag the lock - only a target to show where to aim for. That cleverly lies outside the patented \"slide-to-unlock\" functionality.</p> <h2>This stuff is boring.</h2> <p>Come on, Mr Schmidt, give it your best! Lots of people don't get past this point, which means they miss out on the really important bits, of standards-essential and \"registered design\" (aka trade dress) patents. </p> <h2><a name=\"sep\">What are \"standards-essential\" patents, then?</a></h2> <p>They're patents that are essential to a standard. That might sound tautologous, but it's key to understanding many of the fights that are going on. </p> <p>A standard such as Wi-Fi (802.11a,b,g,n\u2026) or GSM or GPRS or 3G/UMTS or 4G/LTE consists of lots of interlocking pieces of code. Take Wi-Fi, which involves things like frequencies of transmission, data encoding, frame rates, SSID transmission, channels, naming methods, and hundreds of other software engineering elements put together in a lattice that has to be robust enough that it will work when implemented by multiple vendors in a wide range of conditions.</p> <p>You don't want Wi-Fi compatibility to be like operating systems, where Android programs won't run on Windows because they're essentially part of competing ecosystems; you want any device that is certified as Wi-Fi compatible to be able to communicate with any other device with the same certification.</p> <p>That means standards. But how do you standardise something like that? Through long, arduous negotiation, that's how. Be grateful you're not part of the committee with that task (unless you are, in which case we salute you). Frequencies and tolerances for frequency variability are agreed. Data transmission formats are agreed. And so on.</p> <p>Part of the input into these discussions is the patents that will be used to implement them. Imagine that you're working on a standard where you want to have a circuit whose output will vary by no more than 5kHz over five seconds. Turns out, someone on the standards committee works for a company that has written a generator that will do just that. It's patented, of course. But you need that patent so you can have the standard you're working on.</p> <p>Rival bids will probably come in from other members - and then the haggling will start too over how important the patent is in the overall scheme of things. By the time the (exhausted) members of the committee have finished their job, they'll have a collection of specifications, and patented processes, which uniquely identify the standard they've been working on. So Wi-Fi embodies a ton of patents, often for boring things like making sure that chips output a signal within two given frequencies. As patents go, they might not be particularly thrilling; it may be perfectly feasible to get the same result without infringing the patent. </p> <p>But if you do that, <em>you won't be adhering to the standard</em>. By not using the patents essential to the standard, you're putting yourself outside the standard. This is why companies like Microsoft (which has lots of smart programmers) and Apple use really quite old software for systems like 802.11b: they have to, to comply with the standard. </p> <p>Do all the processes in a standard have to be patented? No; but in implementing new commercial standards, it's a lot easier to get companies to agree to take part if they feel they'll get financial benefit from it. Otherwise they might as well go and build their own, new, proprietary standard.</p> <h2><a name=\"frand\">What's FRAND?</a></h2> <p>So: you have a new standard, and it comes with a series of patents. As part of the standards approval process run in Europe by the ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), the holders of those patents agree that they will license them to anyone who wants to implement the standard on a \"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\" (FRAND) basis. In the US it's often known just as RAND - the \"fair\" element isn't thought to add anything special to the description.</p> <p>\"Non-discriminatory\" means that you'll license it to anyone - Microsoft, Apple, Joe Bloggs - who asks to license it. This is very important: if someone offers to license your standards-essential patent to meet the standard, you're required to license it. Refusing to do so is frowned on by the US government, the European Commission, ETSI, and possibly your mother.</p> <h2><a name=\"sepvalue\">How much is a SEP worth? It's a \"standard\", so it must be valuable, right?</a></h2> <p>\"Reasonable\" is becoming the sticking point for many court cases. How much should you be able to charge for holding a standards-essential patent? </p> <p>What's clear is that if you charge too much, you'll put people off using it. Here's an example from recent history: two companies, X and Y, managed to get standards built around their competing communications technologies. Company X's technology was much faster and, at a time when PCs were pretty feeble, didn't tax the CPU much. Company Y's technology was slower, and chewed up a lot of CPU time when being used. </p> <p>However Company X tried to charge a substantial amount for the use of its patents - far more than Company Y. That, allied to other factors (particularly the relative sizes of X and Y) meant that Company X's standard didn't thrive, and eventually it was left as almost the lone user.</p> <p>(X was Apple, with FireWire; Y was Intel, with USB.)</p> <p>The question of \"how much should an SEP be worth?\" is ticklish. In one sense, an SEP is a lottery ticket: suddenly everyone has to license your patent, which does nothing more than (say) count clock cycles on a quartz chip, if they want this whizzy new Wi-Fi wireless technology! You control the world! You can demand any price you want!</p> <p>Oh, wait. Apple and Firewire. Right. Not <em>any</em> price. Then again, if you're providing something that is going to be part of a mobile phone communications standard, you're going to have millions and millions of licensors. </p> <p>So how do you value a patent such as <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,362,867.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,362,867&amp;RS=PN/7,362,867\">this Samsung one</a>, described as \"Apparatus and method for generating scrambling code in UMTS mobile communication system\"? (By the way, looking at it, you'd think it is pretty much a piece of code - software - described in words. Yet it can be patented, because in reality it is a patentable idea that just happens to be implemented in practice using software.)</p> <p>The argument put forward by Judge Richard Posner in the US, in dismissing a case brought by Apple (which didn't have an SEP in the case) and Motorola (which did), was that the way to calculate the value of an SEP is to ask: how much was it worth <em>the day before</em> it was nominated a standard? (Or alternatively, how much would it be worth if it hadn't become part of a standard?)</p> <p>On that basis, you'd have to say that for many SEPs, the answer is: not much. Any decent coder can write a program that will monitor the output of a quartz chip and use modern feedback systems to control the variability - hell, they might even do it better than the one in the standard. Similarly for the scrambling code patent above. This argument applies all over the patents used in a standard: though collectively they're crucial, on their own each might be trivial. It's like building a very large club from hundreds of twigs.</p> <p>Here for example is the <a href=\"http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/pat802_11.html\">IEEE's list for the 802.11 standard</a>, which covers multiple wireless standards. If you look at the <a href=\"http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/loa-802_11-uc_davis-01jul1994.pdf\">first letter linked from the list</a> (which involves more than 100 companies, including Apple, Samsung, Fujitsu, Nokia, RIM and Microsoft among many others), it asks the patent holder to agree that \"the technology will be made available at minimal cost to all who seek to use it for compliance with an incorporated standard\".</p> <p>So even though it's true to say - as Google does - that a smartphone embodies thousands of patents, that doesn't mean that the ownership or use of many of those patents is necessarily in dispute. For those used in standards, their application is pretty straightforward, and the patent holder is required to agree to provide it without challenge. </p> <h2><a name=\"exhaustion\">What's patent exhaustion?</a></h2> <p>If Company B licenses Company A's patent, and includes it in a product that Company C then includes in its own product, then Company A (the patent owner) can't chase Company C for a patent licence. Its claim to the rights is \"exhausted\". This is one defence that Apple used in the Samsung-Apple trial over some standards-essential patents owned by Samsung. Samsung said that Apple hadn't licensed the patents. Apple said it had a contract with Intel to buy chips which had licensed Samsung's patents, which meant the claim was exhausted. The jury accepted that argument.</p> <h2><a name=\"seplawsuit\">Why would it be bad to sue someone for not paying for the use of SEPs, or to injunct them from selling things which used SEPs?</a></h2> <p>It wouldn't be bad, and it's perfectly legal to do seek an injunction, <em>once other avenues have been tried and failed</em>. (That second part is important.) The convention however is that you don't seek an injunction if a company is willing to pay. Then the problem comes down to one of how much should be paid. And it's that point - the \"how much?\" - which has seen the real disputes. </p> <p>For example, you could argue that Nokia kicked off the \"smartphone patent wars\" when it <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8321058.stm\">sued Apple in 2009</a>, claiming Apple was using a number of its SEPs without paying royalties. Apple denied it, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/14/apple-nokia-patent-case\">in June 2011 eventually coughed up</a> hundreds of millions of euros in back payments. Nokia however never sought to injunct Apple from selling the iPhone. It just let the sales - and future royalties - mount up. The price seems to have been a few euros per handset sold.</p> <p>By contrast Motorola, which holds SEPs that are part of the H.264 MPEG-4 video decoding standard, has been demanding 2.5% of the <em>retail</em> price of Microsoft hardware such as Xboxes, and other devices - such as PCs - that use Microsoft software which uses H.264. On the \"bundle of twigs\" premise, it's hard to see how that price is reasonable. It certainly doesn't sound like \"minimal cost\".</p> <p>Samsung, meanwhile, used SEPs to fight back against Apple, which was suing it in Europe over <em>non</em>-SEPs - that is, patents which Apple is claiming to itself and hasn't made part of a standard. </p> <h2><a name=\"seplawsuittwo\">And what's wrong with that?</a></h2> <p>Using SEPs like that in effect looks like bullying. In particular, seeking an injunction <em>before</em> you offer FRAND licensing terms is the highwayman's method and breaches the standards agreement. </p> <p>Apple has argued that Samsung did that in Europe, and Microsoft that Motorola did it in the US, and both those SEP-holders are being investigated for antitrust abuse - by the European Commission's competition arm, and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p> <h2><a name=\"antitrust\">Why might that be antitrust abuse?</a></h2> <p>Because SEPs constitute a sort of automatic monopoly: as said earlier, if you want to meet a standard, you have to use them. And denying a company the opportunity to use them on the same terms as other companies means you're using the monopoly to wield market power. That's abuse. Neither the EC nor the FTC has announced whether they think Samsung or Motorola has acted in breach of any acts.</p> <h2><a name=\"seplawsuitthree\">Why shouldn't someone who owns SEPs use them in a court fight against someone who doesn't, and is suing for alleged infringement of their patents?</a></h2> <p>They can, but SEPs <em>have</em> to be licensed, whereas non-essential patents don't. That puts the SEP-holder at a disadvantage in legal terms; their benefit comes from the payments they're guaranteed. By contrast, non-SEPs don't have to be licensed. So the SEP-holder might end up with just the standard payment, and no licence to the other side's patents. It's tough - but that's the payback from patents.</p> <h2><a name=\"sepnonsep\">So SEPs are really different from non-SEPs?</a></h2> <p>They're all patents. What's different is the licensing obligation. SEPs aren't <em>intrinsically</em> more valuable than non-SEPs. In fact, non-SEPS can often get bigger prices, per licence, than SEPs.</p> <h2>This is really long.</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398341859\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/1/21/1295629942332/Cute-kittens-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cute kittens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kittens: easier to think about than patents.

Here's some pictures of kittens.</p> <h2><a name=\"registereddesigns\">OK. Enough of standards. Let's move on. Why do \"registered designs\" matter?</a></h2> <p>\"Registered designs\" or \"design patents\" cover, roughly, \"what something looks like\" rather than what it does; form, not function. They are different from regular \"patents\", but they are a form of intellectual property, and do cover tangible things, and as they have been important in the smartphone wars, it seems good to talk about them here . Really, as <a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120814110227662\">this piece on Groklaw</a> points out, it's really a part of trademark law: </p> <blockquote> <p>Trade Dress is not really a \"subset\" of trademark law. It is trademark law. Lanham Act Section 43 allows protection against any use of a mark or device that might confuse as to origin of goods or sponsorship. Trade dress is that device, so if the trade dress causes confusion, then it will generally be actionable. But the story doesn't end there. You must have distinctiveness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Apple has argued in US and English courts that its iPhone and iPad designs have registered designs, specifically for elements <em>including</em> its rounded corners. That is, it argues that, for example, the rounded corners - at a particular radius - are visually distinctive features that were unusual when they first introduced them. </p> <h2><a name=\"somany\">Why are there so many patent battles? It seems like they're always in the news</a></h2> <p>There are so many because the smartphone business is really valuable. Getting a few points of share or installed base is very valuable. Winning court battles hinders rivals.</p> <p>Plus Steve Jobs felt very strongly about the patents that Apple did have on the iPhone - and probably knew that Apple would really need them, because it was the entrant in the phone market, setting itself against a number of gigantic incumbents then including Microsoft, RIM and Nokia, as well as the existing players such as LG, Sony Ericsson and Motorola (the latter having pretty much created the mobile phone market). </p> <p>Jobs had already been burned badly by Creative Labs - which sued Apple in 2005 for its use of hierarchical menus on the iPod, something on which Creative Labs had <a href=\"http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6928433&amp;id=sJoVAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=6,928,433\">filed a patent application in January 2001</a>, when the iPod was barely a gleam in Apple's eye. (The iPod was launched in October 2001.) </p> <p>He then saw Android's use of techniques such as pinch-and-zoom, and double-tap to expand, as infringements of implementations Apple had patented (or filed for). And so he first approached Eric Schmidt to try to settle it - without effect - and then began launching lawsuits, starting with HTC and then moving on to Motorola and Samsung. (Motorola sued Apple first, though it may have been a case of getting its retaliation in first.)</p> <h2><a name=\"onecourt\">Is there a single court that will decide all this, so we can say that it's all finally finished?</a></h2> <p>Sadly, no. The main battlegrounds are the courts in the United Kingdom, regional courts in Germany, the International Trade Commission (ITC) in the US, federal courts in the US, and appeals courts in the US. None is definitive (though some are more senior than others) and the deliberations and decisions of one aren't necessarily binding on another. What the ITC decides doesn't affect what a US appeals court decides, and it's risky to think that anything one says will influence another. </p> <h2><a name=\"carryon\">So we should expect these patent battles to just carry on?</a></h2> <p>Perhaps. There have been reports that Google has been making overtures to Apple for some sort of peace, although its acquisition of Motorola Mobility - which was meant to give it a big patents warchest - doesn't seem to have worked out quite as straightforwardly as expected. If Apple wants this to go on, it could do. But there are some signs that doing so is hurting its public reputation, while heightening that of the companies it sues: in Australia, for example, many people had no idea that Samsung had a tablet offering until they began hearing news reports about Apple seeking to ban it. And the billion-dollar win in the US over Samsung may have brought the Korean company to the attention of people who didn't previously know of it as a worthy rival in the smartphone space.</p> <h2><a name=\"gods\">That's depressing. What can I do to make these companies stop doing this?</a></h2> <p>Sadly, this is like being an ancient Greek; they imagined there were multiple gods who were often at war with each other, leaving mere mortals as spectators. That's the situation we find ourselves in.</p>",

  "<p>BP remains on the verge of agreeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/21/bp-rosneft-deal-kremlin-ties\" title=\"\">a $27bn (\u00a317bn) deal</a> that would allow the oil company to extricate itself from a troubled joint venture in Russia, but force it to forge closer ties with the Kremlin.</p> <p>The transaction with Rosneft, the oil firm which is 75%-owned by the Russian state, will involve BP selling its stake in the profitable but problematic TNK-BP joint venture it forged in 2003 to Rosneft.</p> <p>With the City expecting an announcement early this week, the UK-based company said in a holding statement on Monday: \"BP confirms it is in advanced discussions with Rosneft regarding the sale of its 50% interest in TNK-BP. No agreement has yet been reached. A further announcement will be made if and when an agreement is reached.\"</p> <p>Under the terms Rosneft is likely to become the biggest stock market-listed oil company in the world, while BP will become the second biggest investor in the company after the Russian state.</p> <p>BP is expected to end up with a stake of as much as 20% in Rosneft, securing a major presence in the world's biggest oil and gas province, and taking at least one seat on the board of the company which is led by an ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The transaction is crucial to BP as it provides an exit from the TNK-BP venture which has posed a series of difficulties for the firm, including the departure of Bob Dudley from Russia in 2008 when he was head of the venture. It has required $8bn of investment by BP which in turn has taken out $19bn in dividends.</p> <p>Dudley, now chief executive of BP, has told his board that he backs the cash and share deal for the 50% TNK-BP stake, which will eventually allow him to hand out billions to BP shareholders.</p> <p>Rosneft is expected to buy out the other half of the TNK-BP joint venture from the local oligarchs known as AAR, which had previously prevented BP from taking a larger stake in Rosneft.</p> <p>BP will receive $10bn-$14bn in cash from Rosneft and take shares in the Russian company in which it already owns a 1.25% stake after the partial sell-off in 2006.</p> <p>While there has been speculation that the Kremlin will reduce its stake in Rosneft to as low as 50% plus one share, this is yet to happen. Igor Shuvalov, Russia's deputy prime minister, has said that the government would consider further privatisation in an attempt to soothe any concerns among BP investors about the influence of the Kremlin over such a crucial part of the UK oil firm whose share price is yet to recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the US in April 2010. BP gets a quarter of its production from the existing Russian venture.</p> <p>Dudley's Rosneft counterpart, Igor Sechin, is a former spy who flew to London last week to take control of the long-running negotiations and whose company has long been attractive to BP. In January 2011 BP and Rosneft announced a share swap to enable them to explore in the Russian Arctic until AAR blocked the transaction. BP's technical expertise is likely to be essential if the Russian Arctic is to be explored, although this is likely to anger environmental campaigners. BP is also keen to get more expertise from Russia, a market which produces 10m barrels of crude oil every day, and is considering whether to appoint a Russian national to its board. An announcement on the identity of any new board members is not thought to be imminent.</p>",
  "<p>Syria, more than anywhere else, is sorely testing Barack Obama's hands-off policy in the Middle East. So grave is the crisis in the Levant that it will go close to defining the success of the US president's second term \u2013 or Mitt Romney's first.</p> <p>If Obama was to be judged now on how he has dealt with the ever-worsening Syrian civil war, history would likely be harsh. The US has remained largely on the sidelines of the most violent episode of the Arab spring, shaping its response through the regional policy it laid down before the first stirrings of uprising in Tunisia.</p> <p>Soon after replacing George W Bush, Obama rubber-stamped the Republican president's policy shift, which pledged to recast the way the US dealt with the entrenched Arab world order. From 2006, Bush had said, the 50-year approach of favouring stability over democracy was to be turned on its head. Democracy was to be paramount. Stability, it was suggested, was to play second fiddle.</p> <p>Bush's resolve was barely put to the test, apart from some faltering steps towards nation-building in Iraq. Not so Obama. Almost everything about the first few heady months of the Arab spring spoke directly to the values Obama had first championed in his landmark 2009 address to the Arab world in Cairo: tyranny needed to defeated by self-determination, state repression trumped by accountability, violence checked by the rule of law.</p> <p>After rumbling through north Africa, the same themes soon took root in Syria, where they were confronted with a withering rearguard from the regime and its backers \u2013 primarily Iran and Hezbollah, as well as an old enemy, Russia. The US knew from the outset that this was to be no romp through the desert like Libya. After readily agreeing to send jets and missiles to bomb Gaddafi, Obama's administration has steadfastly refused to do the same to Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>A soaring death count, the growing threat of regional spillover, expectations from Sunni allies that Washington take the lead in stemming the chaos, and rising belligerence from Tel Aviv to Tehran have done nothing to shift Obama. And nor will they as he fights the last three weeks of a presidential campaign fought largely on domestic issues and his belief that the US should no longer take a stake in all the world's core problems.</p> <p>A president who won office partly on getting out of giant misadventures in the Middle East clearly doesn't want to campaign on the merits of getting the US involved in another one.</p> <p>The US military, its institutions \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 have learned some key lessons from Iraq, especially the perils of taking a power stake in a sectarian state. Almost 10 years on from the second Iraq war, there is nothing to suggest that intervening in Syria would be any easier. Far from it.</p> <p>The vacuum that would follow the fall of Damascus would become a high-stakes contest for myriad players. Two of them, Hezbollah and Iran, have an enormous amount to lose if Assad is ousted. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have a lot to lose if he stays.</p> <p>Add to that the slowly growing presence of global jihadists, who for now remain a minority voice among an insurrection that started as a nationalistic push but is losing some ground to a sectarian agenda.</p> <p>Arming the rebel groups opposed to Assad remains fraught. Attempts by the US and Turkey to organise the many groups under a functional command haven't worked. Without that, a re-elected Obama is unlikely to change his first-term opposition to sending the heavy weapons that rebel fighters need to mount a serious threat to what remains of the regime's military.</p> <p>Obama spent much of his first term recalibrating what he deemed to be his national security interests. Filtered through the realpolitik of getting re-elected, Syria has remained in the too-hard tray with neither him or his inner court conceding that what is happening as the country crumbles directly affects the US.</p> <p>That position cannot last. Syria is perilously close to the abyss and its likely descent further will affect all corners of the region and far beyond. From the inauguration on, Syria will be central to the stage, along with its key backer, Iran. What to do about it will prove a defining chapter for US interests.</p>",

Researchers from a pair of German universities conducted a detailed analysis of thousands of Android apps and found that better than 15% of those apps had weak or bad SSL implementations.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232396/Survey_of_IT_managers_suggests_preference_for_Microsoft_mobile_platforms\">Survey of IT managers suggests preference for Microsoft mobile platforms &gt;&gt; Computerworld</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Almost half of IT managers in a survey last month said that they plan to standardize their company's mobile platform on devices running Microsoft operating systems, including smartphone OSes Windows Phone 7.5 and Windows Phone 8 and tablet OS Windows RT, according to ThinkEquity, a research and institutional investment banking services firm.</p> <p> 48% of respondents said they would choose Microsoft technology as their corporate mobile standard, up from 44% in a similar survey three months before, according to a research note from ThinkEquity financial analyst Yun Kim. Google's Android OS dropped to 8% from 11%, while Apple's iOS grew from 10% to 14%.</p> </blockquote> <p> Two thoughts: (1) this leaves 30% who either aren't standardised, or use RIM - down from 35% previously; (2) if their intention was so high before, why haven't they already done it?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3289-some-advice-from-jeff-bezos\">Some advice from Jeff Bezos &gt;&gt; 37signals</a></h2> <p>Jeff Bezos gave a talk at 37Signals: </p> <blockquote> <p>He said people who were right a lot of the time were people who often changed their minds. He doesn't think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It's perfectly healthy -- encouraged, even -- to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.</p> <p> He's observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking.</p> </blockquote> <p> Fantastic advice.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bgr.com/2012/10/19/rim-nokia-strategy-financial-analysis/\">Who's in worse shape: RIM or Nokia? &gt;&gt; BGR</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Looking past the financials, I think that Nokia is in worse shape than RIM in terms of long-term business strategy as well.

But here's the key: RIM is in exclusive control of its own operating system and it has a loyal customer base who will stick with it to the very last. This is important because people who still want the RIM experience have nowhere else to go: It's BlackBerry 10 or bust for them and they will shell out cash to get it.</p> </blockquote> <p> This might be the crux of it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_tILqds7-jg\">Gangnam Style from Hitler &gt;&gt; YouTube</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_tILqds7-jg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_tILqds7-jg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>This is great.

The social web was still abuzz from the spectacular achievement in human ingenuity from the night before, brought to you by Red Bull and science. People continued to predictably politick and Rainn Wilson did an AMA. However, for an infinitesimal segment of the human population, October 15th was marked by a frenetic search for answers fueled by an anxiety that can only come from leaked photos of an up-and-coming piece of shiny new tech.</p> <p> I faked the Sony Nexus X.
