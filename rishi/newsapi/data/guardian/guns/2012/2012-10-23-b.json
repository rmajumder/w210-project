  "<p>All major supermarkets will finally adopt a version of \"traffic-light labelling\" to help end confusion about which are the healthiest and unhealthiest foods, the government will announce on Wednesday.</p> <p>Ministers have agreed with industry officials that leading food producers and retailers will use a consistent, UK-wide form of front-of-pack labelling from the middle of next year.</p> <p>Called a \"hybrid system\" by the Department of Health, it will combine colour coding, guideline daily amounts \u2013 which research has shown many consumers find baffling \u2013 and the words high, medium or low to describe certain ingredients, though the exact form has not yet been finalised.</p> <p>The aim is to make it much easier for consumers to quickly tell the fat, salt, sugar, saturated-fat and calorie content of particular foods from the colour used. Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl, which had opposed traffic lights, have now agreed to introduce them in some form.</p> <p>Health campaigners welcomed the move. \"We are delighted that the government has finally agreed to recommend front-of-pack traffic-light labelling,\" said Charlie Powell, director of the Children's Food Campaign. \"You won't have to be a maths genius any more to work out which is the healthier product to buy.</p> <p>\"Of the top 10 supermarkets, only Iceland is left out in the cold and is still refusing to commit to using traffic-light labelling. Big food manufacturers must now also confirm their commitment to traffic lights, or else be shamed.\"</p> <p>Anna Soubry, the public health minister, said: \"The UK already has the largest number of products with front-of-pack labels in Europe but research has shown that consumers get confused by the wide variety of labels used. By having a consistent system we will all be able to see at a glance what is in our food. This will help us all choose healthier options and control our calorie intake.</p> <p>\"Obesity and poor diet cost the NHS billions of pounds every year. Making small changes to our diet can have a big impact on our health and could stop us getting serious illnesses \u2013 such as heart disease \u2013 later in life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's Olympic and Paralympic medallists capped a summer of sporting success as guests at a Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday night.</p> <p>About 225 athletes attended \u2013 and, for some, the event presented unexpected challenges. \"I swear walking across that gravel should actually be an Olympic event,\" said swimming star Rebecca Adlington as she teetered across the palace quadrangle in Kurt Geiger high heels. \"This is the last time when we all get together so it's quite sad.</p> <p>Boxer Nicola Adams, whose nifty footwork helped power her to a historic gold, had been in training for the reception hosted by the Queen: \"It was excellent. I was excited and nervous all at the same time. But I got my curtsey right so that was OK. I'd been practising\"</p> <p>On life after the Games, Adams said: \"I've been here, there and everywhere. In a helicopter, in Rio with the prime minister and now I'm topping it all by meeting the Queen. \"</p> <p>The Duchess of Cambridge who, as an official ambassador for Team GB and ParalympicsGB ,was a regular spectator at British triumphs at London 2012, was among the royals attending.</p> <p>\"She said she had seen my first race in the velodrome,\" said cyclist Sarah Storey, who became the UK's most decorated female Paralympian this summer. \"It was fantastic to chat to them and hear their experiences of our races.\" The reception was \"the icing on the cake\", she said.</p> <p>Paralympic equestrian Lee Pearson provided the exclusive of the night with news that the duchess was taking riding lessons. \"I had a right good chat to her. We were chatting about horses. She said she was learning to ride. I said 'if you ever want a dressage class, come up to Staffordshire'.\"</p> <p>Team GB won 65 medals \u2013 29 of them gold \u2013 while ParalympicsGB claimed 120, including 39 golds. Both came third in the medals tables.</p> <p>The organising committee chairman, Lord Sebastian Coe, who is expected to be confirmed as new chairman of the British Olympic Association next month, said: \"It is just another opportunity to say thank you for those extraordinary performances.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Coe attended a cabinet meeting in Downing Street to urge ministers to help shore up the UK's Olympic legacy.</p> <p>Ellie Simmonds, the Paralympian swimming gold medal winner, said she was already back in training. \"I am really getting back into it,\" she said.</p> <p>Peter Wilson, Team GB's shooting gold medallist, said: \"If you had told me on 1 January 2012 that I would be an Olympic gold medallist and be meeting the Queen, I would say 'pinch me'. It's mega.\"</p> <p>A British Olympic Association spokesman said: \"In an extraordinary year that began with a celebration of the diamond jubilee, it is an honour for our Olympic and Paralympic medallists to be welcomed to Buckingham Palace by her majesty the Queen.\"</p> <p>British Paralympic Association chief executive Tim Hollingsworth said: \"Our medallists are honoured to attend today's royal reception and it constitutes another memorable occasion for those who helped to make 2012 a year in which Great Britain has been so hugely proud of the achievements of our Paralympic and Olympic athletes.\"</p> <p>The reception was hosted by the Queen, who played her own part in the celebrations when she made her acting debut to become a Bond girl in a scene for the Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>It will not be the last time at the palace for some of the guests. Britain's Olympians and Paralympians are to get their own honours list after the prime minister, David Cameron, decided to place awards from the Games outside the usual quotas.</p> <p>A Buckingham Palace garden party next year will be held in honour of the athletes, Gamesmakers and others who helped make the London games so successful.</p> <p>In the palace's 18th Century Room, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh met Cameron, Coe and other senior figures who made the Games possible.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"It was an amazing summer and I think people will cherish those memories, you know, almost more then the 1966 World Cup.</p> <p>\"I think people will look back and just think, what an incredible summer! Success after success, medal after medal and the whole country putting on its very best face for the world.</p> <p>\"What matters now is that we maximise the momentum and the legacy following the Olympics and Paralympics.\"</p> <p>He said the meeting with Coe had discussed the physical legacy for east London, economic benefits and the sporting legacy. \"There's also the legacy in terms of attitude to disabilities, which I think is a real chance of a step change in our country,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The return of John Terry to the Chelsea team and captaincy had been steeped in controversy, coming as it did while he served his four-match domestic suspension for the racial abuse of Anton Ferdinand. As this vital Champions League tie emphatically got away from him and the defending champions, it seemed almost appropriate that a Shakhtar Donetsk player called Fernandinho should not only star but conjure up the decisive blow.</p> <p>There had been bitter irony at the outset when Terry saw the ball rear up against the captain's armband, which was embroidered with an anti-racism slogan, to drop for Alex Teixeira to score Shakhtar's opening goal. Terry played well, making characteristically brave interventions, but his team were second best in all areas and once Fernandinho had punished the substitute Eden Hazard to score their second it appeared to be a question only of the victory margin.</p> <p>The surprise at the end was how narrow it was. Shakhtar missed chances, Petr Cech distinguished himself in the Chelsea goal and it was Oscar, stealing in to meet Branislav Ivanovic's cross, who reduced the deficit and sparked brief alarm inside a jubilant stadium. An outlandish escape for the visitors, however, was not to happen.</p> <p>Roberto Di Matteo, the Chelsea manager, had suggested that this was a journey into the unknown as, despite Shakhtar's 100% domestic record from 12 games this season, little was known about the strength of the Ukrainian league. The home team's performance represented an exhilarating statement while Chelsea, so exciting during their encouraging start to the season, suffered a jolting blow.</p> <p>The consolation, though, which was significant, arrived in Denmark, where Juventus could only draw 1-1 against Nordsjaelland, the weakest team in the group. Chelsea remain in second place although a win for Shakhtar at Stamford Bridge next month would see the Ukrainian side through.</p> <p>It felt as though all eyes were on Terry at the start and even the TV director who supplied the cut for the stadium's big screen focused on him during the pre-match build-up, when Uefa's anti-racism message was read out over the Tannoy. There were not even three minutes on the clock when the captain tasted misfortune, too, his block-tackle on Luiz Adriano seeing the ball hit an arm and fall kindly for Teixeira, who calmly shot low into the far corner.</p> <p>There was a swagger about the home team's football with their technique, comfort on the ball and threat most pronounced in the three-man line behind Adriano, where Teixeira and Willian flanked the Armenian Henrikh Mkhitaryan.</p> <p>Willian was magnificent and showed Chelsea, who have tried to sign him, why Shakhtar value him at a prohibitive price for most. The Blues, who lost Frank Lampard to an 18th-minute muscle pull and had Ashley Cole needlessly booked, saw their frustration encapsulated in Fernando Torres' performance.</p> <p>The team sprang him into good areas in the first half but the Spaniard failed to fashion shooting opportunities and early in the second period his touch and decision-making completely broke down. It seemed a relief when he was substituted.</p> <p>But for Cech, the game might have been over at half-time. He tipped over Mkhitaryan's drive following Willian's lovely flick and after a Dario Srna corner had led to chaos and Oscar had failed to clear, the goalkeeper thwarted Tomas Hubschman brilliantly at point-blank range. Chelsea could also be grateful to Terry for a couple of vital interventions.</p> <p>Fernandinho was an all-action presence, snapping at Chelsea heels and helping to set Shakhtar's tempo with his intelligent distribution. He started and finished the move for the second goal, crashing into Hazard to win the ball on halfway and driving forward on the break. The Belgian was crestfallen, Chelsea horribly exposed. Fernandinho swapped passes with Adriano, taking the return smoothly despite stretching, and hit his shot inside the far post.</p> <p>Chelsea had their moments in the second half. Ramires exploded a shot from distance, Hazard nearly exposed Olexandr Kucher \u2013 who fouled him and was booked \u2013 Mikel John Obi pivoted and lifted over and Hazard, having wriggled through, was denied a one-on-one by Andriy Pyatov. Yet it was Shakhtar's night.</p> <p>Fernandinho, Mkhitaryan and Hubschman will ask themselves how they did not add to the lead, although Cech might help them explain. For Chelsea the tests continue to come. It is the potentially defining Premier League fixture at home to Manchester United on Sunday. They must regroup.</p>",

Now he's just another partisan squabbler who, after he loses this election, will probably follow losers like Mike Huckabee and Al Gore into a career in cable punditry. Maybe get a time slot on MSNBC.</p> <p>This is (a dramatized version of) the case laid out by John Cook in a<a href=\"http://gawker.com/5954125/2008-called-it-wants-to-know-what-happened-to-barack-obama\"> lament </a>on Gawker reacting to Obama's joke last night that \"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\" Cook writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's a middling joke. It should by no means be coming from the president of the United States, let alone one who promised to put away childish things. It's a dumb \"zinger,\" transparently crafted to appeal to the Mark Halperins and Politicos of the world. That's not to say that humor has no place in political rhetoric or that Obama betrays his promise every time he deigns to insult his opponent. But to graft a pre-planned VH1 <em>Best Week Ever</em>-level joke onto a nationally televised discussion about life and death and our role on the world stage is scarcely less pathetic than the desperate flailings of the McCain campaign that I smugly scoffed at four years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cook has a point, and it is this: the McCain campaign was capable of scoff-able flailing. Where Cook is wrong is in his earnest notion that a dumb debate joke sullies the presidential stole.</p> <p>In a tortured essay of personal disillusionment, Cook finds equal fault with Obama's recent stump speech laugh line about how Mitt Romney has so much trouble keeping track of his policy positions that he must be suffering from \"Romnesia.\" The pun, Cook writes, is \"too juvenile and jokey to be coming from the president.\"</p> <p>The attack over \"Romnesia\" is coming at the president today from the right, too:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Please, would somebody who isn't simply an Obama fan explain to me why \"Romnesia\" is a smart, voter-getting crack?</p>&mdash; John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:10:54+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>First, here's why Obama says \"Romnesia\" on the stump:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BBEXB1Wf9c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=45\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The crowd loves it.</p> <p>Politics plays out in arenas. Sometimes in stadiums. It increasingly plays out across social networks in which buzzy material spreads and boring material dies. The point is to win the crowd. Few politicians have been as good at it as Obama is. That YouTube clip has 400,000 views and change, and there are many vigorously viewed copies.</p> <p>Second, the notion that Obama has ever been above dumb jokes is a wrong notion. This is a president who, talking about a regulation that classifies milk as oil, said, in a State of the Union address: \"I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\" Michelle had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdjwD2LEGOo\">to close her eyes</a> at that one.</p> <p>This is a president who cannot resist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fzpcgRfc0CI\">dumb baseball jokes</a>, and dumb jokes about how he finds it reassuring that his daughters, as they approach dating age, are in the constant company of men with guns.</p> <p>But in Cook's eyes the dumb debate joke is only a symptom of a larger affliction. Obama, he writes, has lost the \"sense of himself as the adult in the room.\"</p> <p>Obama may have adjusted his rhetorical style from 2008. It would be an occasion for unearthly discomfort had he not. Obama cannot, in 2012, stand behind a lectern and say, \"We are the change we've been waiting for.\" He said that before he was elected as the nation's first black president. He said that at the end of eight long years of George W. Bush. It was a statement of patent truth whose force has dissipated as the novelty of Obama's first candidacy has turned into the reality of his presidency.</p> <p>A couple dumb jokes aren't ruinous to the Obama brand, because the brand is no longer built on the promise of a more adult politics. It's now built on the health care law, the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and a cold-blooded policy of assassination by flying robot. It's built on getting slapped around by Republicans in Congress. If he doesn't win re-election, it will be built next to Jimmy Carter's retirement home.</p> <p>Grown-ups don't judge Obama on his jokes. They judge him on his record.</p> <p>P.S. And also, let's not forget what aggressively dumb political speech actually sounds like:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3VXXN-fF2A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3VXXN-fF2A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=20\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T21:01:11.662Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086d6b5c0e376c4a1112e39\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T17:41:09.365Z\">6.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama narrows gap in Gallup poll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president is on the improve in Gallup's national 7-day tracking poll, in which he has recently trailed by as many as 7 points among likely voters.</p> <p>Today Gallup <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx\">finds</a> a 5-point margin, with Romney out front 51-46 among likely voters.

It's Tuesday, with two (2) weeks to go before election day. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Governor Romney and President Obama met on a Florida stage last night to debate foreign policy, a topic that turned out to encompass the state of Wisconsin's schools and of Detroit's car factories.</strong> The foreign policy discussion centered on the Middle East and North Africa: Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Egypt.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Foreign policy debate spent more time on Israel than on Europe, India and Africa combined. That's not our world.</p>&mdash; Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:33:45+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Who \"won\"?</strong> The snap polls picked the president. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/22/cnn-poll-who-won-the-debate/?hpt=hp_t1\">CNN</a> found Obama out front 48-40; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57537795/poll-decisive-win-for-obama-in-final-debate/?tag=MaxDeep\">CBS</a> found Obama on top 53-23 with 24% of respondents calling the debate a \"tie\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Obama repeatedly accused Romney of being \"all over the map\" with his stated policy positions, and indeed Romney had significantly amended his stances on core questions of war and peace from what they were two weeks ago.</strong> Questions like should the US have kept tens of thousands of troops in Iraq and should we commit to leaving Afghanistan by 2014. Voters who care where the Republican candidate stands will have to guess.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The anticipated debate over the administration's arguably poor handling of the aftermath of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 never materialized.</strong> Obama was not pressed to explain why there was not more security in place at the US mission or why the White House originally peddled a false version of events.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney said the Middle East had slid toward chaos under the Obama administration.</strong> He said Iran is \"four years closer\" to a nuclear weapon and al-Qaida is resurgent in North Africa. Romney's best line: \"We can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 A<strong>part from his utter aqueousness on policy, Romney came in for criticism for seeming lightweight or unpracticed next to the president in discussing how to steer the ship of state.</strong> Romney laid out a bullet-point prescription for intervention in Syria that sounded like the work of a management consultant proposing to fix Acme, Inc. Romney stutteringly confused Iran and Iraq, and he said that Syria was the non-contiguous Persian Gulf state of Iran's \"route to the sea\". He ventured criticism of the president's record but seemed unable to imbue his critique with the force of knowledge or vision or belief.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>There were zingers.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Obama: \"In the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know, the cold war's been over for 20 years.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney: \"I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.\"</p> </div>   </div>",

For example, in the section on \"protecting social security\", there is no mention of Romney-Ryan policies. But there is a promise to \"stop proposals to turn Medicare into a voucher system\", a reference to one version of Romney/Ryan proposed reforms.</p> <p>The document is a clear attempt to rebut criticism that Obama has failed to offer an agenda for a second term. But much of the \"plan\" is really a restatement of the Obama administration's positions, achievements or policy aspirations. Hence the section on healthcare, titled \"putting you in charge of your health care,\" has a quote from Obama warning of the consequences of scrapping what the plan calls Obamacare, two paragraphs of background, five paragraphs of existing Obamacare benefits, and then ends with a \"policy box\" summary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Obamacare is working to rein in insurance companies and give people more control over their health care. Starting in 2014, the Obamacare Law:</p> <p>1. Ensures that all Americans can purchase health coverage, even if they have a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>2. Creates a marketplace that offers group rates and new tax credits so everyone can afford insurance.</p> <p>3. Prohibits discrimination in premiums so women don't pay up to 50% more for the same policy as men.</p> <p>4. Further cuts taxes for small businesses to cover 50% of their premiums.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is nothing in those proposals that is new, which explains why today Obama's senior advisor David Axelrod described it as the plan that Obama has been \"running on and talking about for months, in written form.\"</p> <p>The single mention of Mitt Romney by name comes in the most conventional part of the document: a small panel offering a side by side comparison between \"Tax Savings Under Obama\" versus \"Tax Increase Under Romney,\" itself using familiar figures of a $3,600 tax cut for a \"typical family\" under Obama compared with an estimated $2,000 tax increase on \"middle class families with kids\" under Romney.</p> <p>The concentration on Obama, rather than attacking Romney, at such a late stage of the election cycle suggests a nervousness about what George HW Bush once derided as \"the vision thing\". Meanwhile, the subject headings betray where the Obama campaign feels it needs to more vigorously compete with Romney: the headings \"Building an Economy from the Middle Class Out\" jostles alongside \"A Tax Plan That Cuts the Deficit and Creates Jobs\" to produce \"Improve Education for Middle-Class Jobs\".</p> <p>After four years as president Obama does have a record to run on, rather than the vague policies that appear from the Romney campaign. But if there's a big difference it's in the modesty of Obama's plan. While Romney is chock full of impressive boasts \u2013 12m more jobs, tax cuts for all, a bigger military and a lower deficit \u2013 the Obama effort is muted. The new plan also does mention 12m new jobs in the next four years \u2013 but undercuts that by noting this is what \"independent economists\" have projected will happen anyway.</p>",
  "<p>First of all, the motion says \"would\". I take this to mean \"would, if we could\". Science requires experiment, and there are some questions we do not have the means to address scientifically, at least at the moment. </p> <p>But I support the aspiration and I hope you will too. </p> <p>\"Scientific Investigation\" is a technique for achieving knowledge which is as unbiased and objective as possible. </p> <p>It is not infallible, it is not always particularly efficient, but it is quite simply the best way we have of not fooling ourselves.</p> <p>Are there any areas of knowledge that we want to fool ourselves about?</p> <p>I don't think so. Knowledge may be uncomfortable, but ignorance can be catastrophic.</p> <p>Given the background and profile of the other speakers, I suspect much of this debate will focus on research around human life. When it comes to life, I'm an amateur. But I think a couple of examples from physics might help.</p> <p>The most stunning one, I think, is the development of quantum mechanics. From the point of view of physicists at the time, this was a complete car crash.</p> <p>The model - of seeking underlying mechanisms for physical processes - which had served incredibly well from at least the time of Copernicus through Newton, Kelvin and even Einstein (who participated in its overthrow but never accepted its consequences) came about through repeated application of the scientific method. </p> <p>In the face of the most massive cultural biases, the fact was established. </p> <p>Nature stubbornly behaved in a way which could only be understood by rethinking pretty much every assumption ever made by the most influential physicists - the heroes. In the end quantum mechanics rules. It works. It lies behind the whole digital technology of our civilisation, and more besides. And it went counter to every established scientific prejudice of the days, except for the prejudice that the method works.</p> <p>The physicists of old might be horrified by the outcome, and by the cultural miasma that allows, for example, homeopaths to claim quantum mechanics gives water memory. But they would I hope be proud of the success of the scientific method. (Which of course also tells us that water is water, sugar is sugar, and placebos are placebos.)</p> <p>There are moral debates to be had about the uses to which knowledge is put. There are moral debates to be had about the development of specific technologies from knowledge. But the debate around the morality of nuclear weapons would not be well-served by declaring the study of fundamental physics off limits. Nor would the debates about cloning, or genetic engineering, be well served by declaring the study of life off limits.</p> <p>The scientific pursuit of an understanding of the universe in which we live, the basic constituents, life itself, and the farthest galaxies, is an interconnected and unpredictable activity. Incremental advances in one area can cause sudden revolutions in another. To declare some areas out of bounds would not only be unpredictably damaging in its impact, but would probably be doomed to failure. </p> <p>A rear-guard action against some uncomfortable areas of knowledge may succeed in delaying the inevitable; but surely it is better to seek the knowledge, and face the moral issues which follow with open eyes and minds.</p> <p>None of that is intended to imply that the very pursuit of knowledge is such a high imperative that it negates all other considerations. In particular, we are back to the \"means\" here, and the \"would\" in the title of the motion.</p> <p>An example close to my heart: The Large Hadron Collider and the discovery of a Higgs boson - in fact the whole of particle physics together - costs the UK taxpayer about \u00a32 a year. There are no significant environmental or existential risks, and many benefits.</p> <p>If the cost were an order of magnitude higher, one might start to ask whether the money could be better spent. It may be that the returns would also rise, and we would all benefit. Certainly the endeavour much more than pays for itself at present. But a net financial outlay would raise moral and practical questions about priorities for public expenditure. </p> <p>And if there had been any credible risk of creating, for example, black holes which might consume the world (or even a suburb of Geneva), that would clearly have been a problem. </p> <p>None of that would have been reason to label the Higgs boson itself off limits in principle. But they may have been reasons to halt that line of research until better (safer, more affordable) methods were available.</p> <p>Similarly, considerations about damage or risk to humans, to animals or to the environment, might impact upon efforts to understand biology, psychology or related areas. Knowledge, the ends, do not justify all means. But regulating means and methods is a very different matter from declaring certain areas closed in principle to scientific inquiry.</p> <p>So I would have all areas of knowledge open in principle. If no acceptable means exist to address, scientifically, some important area, I would have us develop better means. But to declare any area closed in principle to scientific inquiry is to declare that we wish to be fooled. </p> <p>And nature, the universe, does not treat fools kindly.</p> <p>I urge you to support the motion.</p> <p><br><em>The debate also featured Lewis Wolpert (on the same side as me) with Caroline Harrison and Michael Reiss opposing, plus some good speeches from the floor.

  "<p>The 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis falls at a time of election; of uncertain political transition in North Korea; of <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/growing-russiapakistan-ties-a-reality-that-india-will-have-to-live-with/article3975260.ece\">rising</a> geostrategic ambitions in Putin's Russia and during a <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/2012107151246788109.html\">heightened standoff </a>between America and Iran. Today's global tensions make it particularly important that we understand what really happened during the 20th century's most dangerous moment. All too often, however, the wider historical truths of the cold war's most dramatic showdown are obscured by self-serving myths of the event itself.</p> <p>The first of these myths has been the tendency to see the missile crisis as proof of the underlying good judgment of liberal democracies, especially when confronted by irrational foes. Of course, it was far from a wise move for Khrushchev to attempt to smuggle dozens of ICBMs halfway across the world in the hope of installing them, undetected, just a short hop away from the North American mainland. But the truth is more nuanced than this. And even the phrase \"the missile crisis\" can be misleading here.</p> <p>Not only were there actually several rather distinct crisis moments (from the game of diplomatic cat-and-mouse that took place prior to Kennedy's public challenge to Khrushchev, to the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28584.html\">naval blockade</a>, the shooting down of a <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/06/missile_crisis_excerpt200806\">U-2 plane over Cuba</a>, and the fallout between Moscow and Havana before the missiles were removed), but far more importantly, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/kennedy_cuban_missile_01.shtml\">the road to October 1962</a> was much longer in the making than we tend to recall.<br> On this point, the Soviet historical term \u2013 \"the Caribbean crisis\" \u2013 is a far better shorthand, since the missile crisis was above all a crisis about Cuba. When Khrushchev took the decision to place ballistic missiles on the island, it was not simply on a whim, as American cold war historians long claimed. Nor was it a diversionary play in the ongoing superpower <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/kennedy_cuban_missile_01.shtml#four\">struggle</a> over Berlin, as they also suspected. It was chiefly to respond to the Cubans' requests for military support in light of American aggression, as well as the snippets of intelligence that Moscow was already picking up about Operation Mongoose \u2013 the CIA's covert plan to topple Castro.</p> <p>Putting missiles on Cuba was also a way for Khrushchev to <a href=\"http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS242/Notes/SinoSoviet.html\">square off </a>against Chairman Mao, who had been criticizing his lack of revolutionary internationalism. So, framing the crisis as set in motion by an act of Soviet irrationality and Cuban hotheadedness obscures the significant role that American interventionism and Chinese belligerence also played in precipitating events.<br> The second pervasive myth about the missile crisis that has set fast over these past 50 years is that in diplomacy, you win by standing your ground. This is well encapsulated in the<a href=\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/dobbs/\"> popularity of the phrase</a> attributed to Kennedy's Secretary of State Dean Rusk: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We've been eyeball to eyeball and the other fellow just blinked.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not to mention in films like Kevin Costner's 2001 production, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Days_%28film%29\">Thirteen Days</a>. The archival record of the way that Soviet and American decision-makers actually dealt with the crisis reveals how inaccurate this picture is. As the historians James Blight and Philip Brenner show in their book, <a href=\"http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=7106\">Sad and Luminous Days</a>, it was precisely by failing to compromise, let alone acknowledge the motives of the other side, that the various actors \u2013 Soviets, Americans and Cubans alike \u2013 actually helped escalate the October crisis. The real lesson ought to be, as Robert McNamara himself later <a href=\"http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub_detail.cfm?id=134\">admitted</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Empathize with your adversary, or you may regret it!\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A third way in which we misremember the missile crisis is the still-pervasive myth in America that national security is best ensured through military-technological superiority. This rendering of the crisis takes its rhetorical force from the<a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no1/cubamisslesite.jpg\"> famous image</a> of ICBM missile sites under construction at San Cristobal in western Cuba. This, of course, was the evidence that Kennedy was able to confront Khrushchev with via the American public, his diplomatic ace-in-the-hole. And it inspires a recounting of the crisis as a fable of the careful use, and ultimate value, of covert intelligence as provided by America's then game-changing U-2 spy planes.</p> <p>Again, closer attention to the facts urges caution here. It was intelligence reports on the ground that first led to Kennedy being apprised of the plot in the first place: the now-famous photos were just the final confirmation, with bad weather and internal political wrangles over \"the birds\" having kept the U-2s on the ground for a number of crucial days. Moreover, the U-2s themselves actually escalated the crisis at various points: with one shot down over Cuba at the very height of the crisis on 27 October, and another <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/06/missile_crisis_excerpt200806\">erroneously</a> straying into Soviet airspace.</p> <p>But the inevitable risks of such technology, and the fact that yesterday's surveillance aircraft is now today's expendable drone \u2013 and an armed one at that \u2013 have long been downplayed in favour of a vindication narrative. Indeed, Kennedy's famous public airing of the photographs showing cleared palms and vehicle tracks scored into the earth still had sufficient public currency to have been mimicked by Colin Powell when <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Archives/video/feb-2003-colin-powell-wmd-12802420\">asserting</a> graphic evidence of Iraq's WMD to the UN in February 2003.</p> <p>Which brings us on to the fourth, and perhaps most ironic, way of misremembering the missile crisis. Namely, the way in which so many accounts of it contribute to the idea of the cold war as a largely bloodless affair: not a hot war of real combat, but an ideological and faintly romantic war of spies, diplomacy and geopolitical grandstanding, of which the missile crisis stands as the ultimate example. For all that the crisis may have been, as the late historian Eric Hobsbawm put it, the historical pivot of the 20th century, its sheer prominence in the popular memory has tended to obscure the far greater amounts of money that were spent by the two sides of the cold war to produce and distribute smaller \u2013 and ultimately more deadly \u2013 arms the world over: a legacy many parts of the world still suffer from today.</p> <p>Indeed, one consequence of the missile crisis was to usher in a period in which the superpowers made sure to engage one another well away from their own populations and by proxy if possible: from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Central America.</p> <p>In short, the popular memory of the missile crisis, as the central mise-en-acte of cold war confrontation, has tended to sanitise and to moralise that wider conflict in a way that it is all too easy to overlook. We would do well to bear this in mind today in our own, not so unpolarised times.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>7.10pm: Hello and welcome to live exclusively-typed coverage of Manchester United v Braga in the Champions League. Also available tonight: Barcelona v Celtic <a href=\"http://cms.guprod.gnl/tools/minbymin/398206211/edit\">here</a> with Sean Ingle and Shakhtar v Chelsea <a href=\"http://cms.guprod.gnl/tools/minbymin/398206594/edit\">here</a> with Rob Bagchi. And wait... the teams are in: <strong>Man Utd</strong> De Gea, Da Silva, Carrick, Evans, Buttner, Kagawa, Fletcher, Cleverley, Rooney, Hernandez, van Persie. <br><strong>Braga</strong> Beto, Leandro Salino, Nuno Andre, Paulo Vinicius,<br>Elderson, Custodio, Hugo Viana, Ruben Amorim, Alan, Ruben Micael, Eder<br>From which, it looks like Michael Carrick will be playing in central defence. What could possibly go wrong? I wonder how he'll cope with the dangerous Alan.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>7.32pm: It's a nice, attacking-looking United team, with Rooney the tip of what it is fashionable to call \"a diamond\" behind Van Persie and Hernandez, who you don't really hear so much about these days. As Gareth Southgate has said on ITV just now, the diamond is perhaps a good idea in Europe where United will be keen to keep possession in central areas. Of course, it's only really a diamond when you draw a diagram with blobs in the shape of a diamond. In reality it's more of a flee-floating morass of interchangeable bodies. But I'll call it a diamond if it helps.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.38pm: And what of Braga? They won in Galatasaray, they keep the ball well, they have West Ham legend Hugo Viana in their ranks and they like to play on the counter attack. And that's, um, about it from me.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.44pm: The players are out and ready to go. United, by the way, look surprisingly short, maybe as short as I for one have ever seen them. Not that it matters particularly, ahem, these days...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong>Braga kick off in a terrible mint-green and black kit and immediately win a corner off Carrick who, we are told, is absolutely fine playing at the back. Alan's corner is scuffed and it's hacked away by Robin. But Braga still have it on the left..</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> <strong>GOAL!! Man Utd 0-1 Braga</strong> and it's a lovely goal, scored after 90 seconds by Alan. Elderson plays it back to Hugo Viana on the left wing and his deep, high cross is headed in very nicely by Alan/ Although to be fair it was far too easy, Alan nipping in front of Buttner and scoring from eight yards out. United, who have barely touched the ball, are behind again.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 mins</strong> It was the goal you might have expected, with United fielding a defence made up of a tyro left back, a languid passing midfielder and the notably un-Jaap Stam-like Jonny Evans. United immediately force a corner but you get the feeling this is going to be a long night. It's tempting to say Rio Ferdinand might have stopped that. But, well, you know. It's not 2008.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 mins</strong> Braga are flooding the centre of the pitch and clogging up United's rather laboured short-passing movements. In fact Ruben Micael almost scores again for Braga, breaking quickly and then having a shot that whistles just wide as Carrick ran backwards in front of him for a bit in the name, apparently, of \"defending\". United look quite lightweight. But they have a lot of good movement when they attack. And Paul Bergin offers: \"Can I be the first to predict that the aforementioned Mr. Wilson will soon be releasing an article insisting that it is not a diamond but rather a throw-back to the 1970 Brazil side and their lopsided 4-2-2-2 to the sound of 'ooohs' and 'ah's' alike.\" Yup. The first all right.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12 mins</strong> Buttner has one very heavily tattooed arm. His other arm is, as yet, unruined. To me it looks a little lop-sided. All a little disjointed and cagey at the moment. Paul Bergin adds: \"Oops. Turns out that mention of Jonathon Wilson was in the Shaktar versus Chelsea thread. Mea culpa.\" No. Me neither. And Matt Dony writes, rather unnkindly, \"Maybe this game will be worthwhile afterall, Fiver-be-damned. I could watch teams score past Man Yoo for a very long time before I succumbed to boredom...\" Personally I lasted about 80 seconds tonight.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>16 mins</strong> Braga are in control of this game right now, making United chase the ball and looking far too comfortable in a stadium almost devoid of any noise whatsoever (apart from some chanting - in fluent Braga - from one corner). It's walking pace at the moment. Braga forward Alan, by the way, has very long braided hair in the style of a very muscular Floella Benjmain.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>18 mins </strong>Ryan Dunne writes: \"As well as being aesthetically dodgy (unlike the colours of my team, the Glorious Glasgow Rangers, who have recently released a pink top, with some proceeds going to charity) surely a green outfield kit is basically cheating? It's like camouflage!\" It is almost exactly the same shade as the grass. And not in a nice way.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>20 mins</strong> <strong>GOAL!! Man Utd 0-2 Braga</strong> and it's <strong>Alan</strong> again! It's also a terrible moment for Michael Carrick as Eder Jinks and then finally muscles his way past him with chastening ease before centering for Alan to prod home very neatly. Disastrous, this, for United, who have been almost entirely absent from this match, and who are being outplayed and out-smarted tactically. Frankly they look dreadful.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>23 mins</strong> Perhaps, technically, there ought to be an assist for John Terry in that goal. JT racism storm + T-shirt furore + Ferdinand \"rested\" = Michael Carrick in defence. They need to get straight back into this.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>26 mins</strong> <strong>GOAL!! Man Utd 1-2 Braga</strong> and they are back in it thanks to a goal from Hernandez that owes a lot to Van Persie, Kagawa and also the ref, who lets play go on as RVP is fouled after a nice jink inside, the ball runs to Kagawa who crosses accurately and Hernandez bundles it in bravely. Blimey. Maybe it's going to be one of <em>those</em> games.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>29 mins</strong> United are now, if not quite at the races, then hurrying towards the races a sedan car, silk scarf flapping. Rooney finally picks up the ball in space and finds Van Persie with a nice pass. It;s on his right foot and flies wide. But there is a soft center there. At the other end United totally fail to clear a corner, the absence of a proper aggressive centre half absolutely obvious, and Alan has a go from 30 yards out, the ball skewing wide. It's <em>all Alan </em>out there.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>34 mins</strong> Great chance for Hernandez after lovely one-touch stuff from Rooney and Van Persie. He can't quite get a proper stab on it. This game could end up 14-12 at this rate, or 27-35. And if alan doesn't get an Old Trafford hat trick from here I'll be amazed. It's a case of Towering Alan out there right now. United have the ball in the net but it's offside.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>38 mins</strong> Ashwini Dubey still has hope: \"Oh come on Barney! We all remember Turin, 1999\". Hmm. Who's the Roy Keane, then? Show me your Andy Cole. Cleverley produces some unexpected dribbling skills and ends up being tripped/falling over/stumbling over his own feet on the corner of the box. No penalty. But encouraging stuff from the occasionally baffling midfielder, both for tonight and the longer notion of what exactly he does apart from passing the ball nicely over short distances.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>42 mins</strong> Rooney's playing quite nicely, seems to be finding some space, his touch looks decent. He's a little deep ,aybe. Van Persie puts a decent cross in and five United players are closer to it than the their top scorer from last year. I think this diamond is going to die a death tonight. There will be changes. There will be wingers. When in doubt get it in the box a bit quicker. Someone with a fairly strong accent keeps shouting \"No foul!\" and \"Offside!\" and so on when the play is near the dugouts. I hope it's one of the assorted Dudes in Tracksuits and not the manager. Where's the dignity?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>44 mins</strong> Nice little spell of passing by Braga ends with Hugo Viana shooting wide. Keeping the ball nicely still. They can certainly shift the ball about. They've got moves like Braga.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>45+1 mins HALF TIME Braga 1-2 Man Utd</strong> And that is that for now. United were nowhere for the first 15 minutes. They played some nice stuff in spells after that, but it is all terribly flat, and they look a team totally lacking in bloody-minded will to win. Carrick as a center back has not been a success and Alan will wish he could play against him every week.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>I'll be back in a moment with some more of your \"thoughts\" and a few slot-mouthed platitudes of my own.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>I haven't really had any thoughts. Not even really simple Gareth Southgate-level ones like \"they've got to get tight\" . Luckily Justin Kavanagh has: \"When he's finished with the half-time hair-dryer, I reckon Lord Ferg will go into the Braga dressing room and demand they change out of that green camouflage strip that's stopping his players picking up their runners.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>Ian Copestake has this, to be filed under too-Cleverley-by-half: <br>\"In response to your damning of Cleverley, the great hope of all English football, sir, I give you this (with apologies to Yeats):<br>Had I Fergie's' embroidered cloths,<br>Enwrought with red and white light,<br>The blue (away kit) and the dim and the dark cloths<br>Of night and light and the half-light,<br>I would spread the cloths under Cleverley's feet:<br>But I, being a manc, have only my dreams;<br>I have spread my dreams under Cleverley's feet;<br>Tread softly, Barney, because you tread on my dreams.\"<br>He likes Cleverley.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>Nani has come on for Kagawa. I told you. Wingers. Diamond be damned.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>46 mins</strong> <strong>United kick us off again</strong> and they've reverted to a 4-4-2, so much for fancy tactics, they'll be spending this half shouting \"I'm POMO!\" and making the third man run. Gary Wraith writes: \"Anyone who's watched United in the past 2 years or so at this level will know that there's a huge gaping hole in this team. Its called Central Midfield. United don't have one, frankly. They frequently get found out at this level by average teams, let alone a decent one. They will need an entire midfield of Roy Keane's just to get out of the grou..\" It was all going so well but you fell into the football mania trap. They will get out of it. But after that...</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>48 mins</strong> Custodio is booked for a foul 35 yards out. United fanny about with Nani rather than getting the ball in the box, but do win a corner in the end. Braga whump it clear. And United to look a bit better in their new shape, less flaky and lightweight in the middle. It is what they know. Also, you need two players in the middle unless one of those players is a super-human one man do-it-all midfield generalissimo, like nobody I can really think of ever doing that job successfully before. But Fletcher looks happier already anyway and United are playing the ball quicker.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>52 mins</strong> Rafael, who looks very good on the ball tonight, beats two men and is then body-checked out of it. Van Persie's free kick is scythed in from the right and punched away slightly pointlessly by Beto in the foreign style. Braga are now defending with all eleven players camouflaged deep in their own area. Alan's hat-trick is looking a little distant now. Poor Alan.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>57 mins</strong> Hernandez squirts through in space inside the Braga right back but can only force a corner, which Nani heads wide. United are completely on top now. Tim Smith asks \"Why would Man U yell I'm \"Permanent Open Market Operations?\". No, no. It's Position Of Maximum Opportunity. England players used to shout it - \"I'm POMO!\" - under the long ball coachings of Charles Hughes to signify that the ball should be hoofed towards them at that exact moment. When Trevor Brooking lectures you about teaching 7-year-olds how to backheel a grape, remember that he used to shout \"I'M POMO!\" in England coaching videos.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>61 mins</strong> Rooney makes a nice little break down the left after robbing Salino and crosses well, but the ball just evades Van Persie. United are still on top, but they need to score while Braga are playing like terrified hamsters. Beto claws Cleverley's cross away precariously. A goal would seem to be coming.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>62 mins</strong> <strong>GOAL!! Man Utd 2-2 Braga</strong> and it was too.<strong> Jonny Evans</strong> with an amazing piece of skill, deliberately air-kicking in front of goal as Van Persie's corner comes in, and then burying the rebound as the Braga defence fails to clear. Might not have been totally deliberate on reflection. But Evans prodded home when it mattered and United have, for now, rescued this and really ought to win it from here.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>66 mins</strong> And predictably Braga have taken a breath and got a little foothold back in this, remembering that they can, actually, pass the ball quite well. I wonder if United have it in them to keep that momentum going without having to gather themselves again. Rooney is playing on the left by the way, and totally dominating Salino. Harry Tuttle, harrumphs, presumably pre-equaliser, \"Too many Andy Coles, and not a single Roy Keane in sight. Tom Cleverley not a patch on Ben Thornley.\" Andy Cole was fantastic. Hernandez is not yet half an Andy Cole. He's not even Andy Cole's leather jacket.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>70 mins</strong> Alan gives away a free kick and produces an extraordinary display of hand-wringing, little-pleading-gesture-making arm-waggling frustration. He's changed. And Rafael continues to look potent on the right, where he has done nothing but bomb forward for the last 40 minutes. Braga have faded like a disappointing relationship.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>72 mins</strong> United break brilliantly down the <em>left wing</em>, switch to the <em>right wing</em>, and a powerful shot from Nani is palmed away by Beto. That is United playing like a Ferguson United team, right there, counter attack down the flanks, great pace and purpose, nothing over-embroidered in the middle, and looking like their old selves rather than a fourth rate Barcelona impersonator. Hernandez did very well there to find Nani. And Adam Lecznar sends a long and detailed tactical email that ends with \"We need to stop trying to unlock teams like Braga and remember how to batter them.\" Which, for now, sounds about right.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>75 mins</strong> There you go. <strong>GOAL!! Man Utd 3-2 Braga</strong> and it came from the flanks. A lovely deep cross swung in by Cleverley, Beckham-style, and Hernandez is moving while everyone else stands still, running on to the ball and heading powerfully past Beto. A lovely finish and great movement from the Mexican goal-pea. What a bizarre game. Diamond. Oh <em>really</em>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>79 mins</strong> Just to recap. United were awful for 15 minutes at the start, utterly dominated by a jaunty looking Braga who seemed to have a lovely balance, forcing them back down the flanks, while United stumbled about with no urgency at all. Braga went 2-0 up. United pulled it back to 2-1, changed to 4-4-2 and have totally dominated ever since. Hernandez goes off and is replaced by Giggs. Seems a shame and he looks disappointed. He wanted to score again. Brian Kitt has a transcript of Ferguson's half time team talk: \"\"Alan, alan, alan, alan, alan, alan, alan\" (\u00e1 la Partridge when he's correcting the girl calling him Alec) \". And a horror-clearance from De Gea almost lets Braga in there. It's a corner that is then cleared.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>83 mins</strong> Van Persie hoofs over with his right foot well-placed on the corner of the box. He often goes for the straight hoof on his weaker side. He has been weirdly anonymous tonight. Not a bad performance but i just don't believe in him yet as an actual United player. It's like he's a consultant or a freelance or a hired entertainer.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>87 mins</strong> Braga are having a bit of a go, Viana leading the charge. Taking Hernandez off has taken the steam out of United a bit. And Alan is off. Shame for the boy Alan that it ends like that. It was Alan Trafford for 20 minutes there in the first half. Still Braga pressing. United will be keen for this to end now.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>90 mins</strong> Ze Luis almost sneaks in but he fouls Rafael and it's a free kick to United. De Gea wastes a bit of time and you sense it might all be all right now for United. Braga have turned out to be a paper tiger here to be honest, and a better team would not have allowed United to overwhelm them so easily after they changed the shape. This was a defeat that somehow didn't quite happen, but it will not always be so. David Wall has a theory: \"s this season's somewhat cavalier approach by United a response to concerns about maintaining ticket sales? If nothing else, they're trying to stop people leaving early to beat the final-whistle rush, perhaps so they get an extra cup of tea and bag of crisps for the journey home.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins</strong> <strong>FULL TIME Man Utd 3-2 Braga</strong> And that is that. United deserve great credit for the wonderful surge they produced to come from 2-0 down to win this, but really this was a very up and down affair, tactically bungled in the first half, but rescued by that familiar fighting heart. Diamonds, you would hope, are not for ever.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>With that United have all but qualified from their group having played three and won three. There is a lot to be done still and Michael Carrick is not - repeat, not, a center half. But there was real verve in their attaching in the second half and Ferguson has always taken most heart from that kind of thing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>That is all from me for now. Thanks for your emails. Barney</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Kick off is at 7.45pm (BST)</strong>. Evening everyone. Having been rather surprised to be asked to write the Fiver \u2013 I hadn't read the email \u2013 I had a rather unhinged rant about ITV using its first pick on Tuesday nights to show Man Utd v Braga. It then dawned on me that I ought to read the emails to make sure that I wasn't actually MBMing it myself. Thankfully I'm not or I'd look even more of a tremendous ar$e than normal. </p> <p>Any road. This looks like a corker, the defending champions against Shakhtar. You can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/22/henrik-mkhitaryan-shakhtar-donetsk?newsfeed=true\">this fine piece</a> by Jonathan Wilson on Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Brain muesli. You can also read this neat<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/22/chelsea-shakhtar-donetsk-john-terry\"> Dave Hytner preview on Chelsea</a>. Armband has become synonymous with captaincy. Perhaps it was ever thus. I don't like it, or the fetishisation of it. </p> <p>Back with the teams asap.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>7.00pm: <strong>Here are your teams:</strong><br><strong>Shakhtar Donetsk:</strong> Pyatov; Srna, Kucher, Rakitskiy, Rat; Hubschman, Fernandinho; Alex Teixeira, Mkhitaryan, Willian; Luiz Adriano. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Kanibolotskiy, Stepanenko, Eduardo, Gai, Douglas Costa, Kryvtsov, Ilsinho. <br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Ivanovic, Terry, David Luiz, Cole; Ramires, <br>Mikel; Lampard, Oscar, Mata; Torres. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Turnbull, Romeu, Hazard, Sturridge, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Bertrand. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Damir Skomina (Slovenia) </p> <p>Hazard on the bench. Ooh.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Three 99s please: </strong> Did you know that both Darijo Srna and Ashley Cole have 99 caps? Oh. How about that Chelsea have conceded 99 goals in the Champions League to date? That's absolutely fascinating.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Where've you been? </strong>\"Is now the time to congatulate Mr Wilson on a fine double? Having been a contestant on University Challenge in the 90s,\" writes Gary Naylor, \"his biog of Brian Clough was the subject of a question last week. And some call Man Utd's 1999 season an achievement.\" I saw that, Gary. Paxo on Wilson. Was he really on UC as a contestant? I was dressed down by Bamber Gascoigne and removed to the back row of the audience many years back when it was still filmed at Granada. Not my finest hour. </p> <p>\"Fiver clairvoyance,\" writes Philippa Booth, \"I note that of the three MBM-ers on duty this evening, Barney 'Man U v Braga' Ronay is the last to check in. Looks like he agrees with you. Nivver bother, Phil. He has arrived <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKfbSHW9uGA\">a la Lord Flashheart</a>. Knocked off a preamble, embarked on an eloquent discourse on his abhorrence of the \"riff\" concept and shot off to the canteen.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Make this golf</strong> go away. It has hurrah. And been replaced by Razor Butchmondo Wilkins. Double hurrah. John is fully focused apparently.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Bobby D</strong> as I believe Gabriele Marcotti calls him on the Game podcast \u2013 other podcasts are available \u2013 has had a tactical tweak. He's gone for 4-3-3 with Frankie Lampard Jr, as he was once known, Mikel and Ramires as the trio. \"Lovely threesome they make\" as a colleague once said, oblivious to the rest of us going all Finbarr Saunders puce.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>We're off. Proper main camera angle here which is more than can be said for Chelsea's last match. The central camera at White Hart Lane is far too high. It gives me the right hump. Shakhtar have won the toss and elected to bat \u2026 er \u2026 kick off. Kucher sends up a huge volleyed clearance and Chelsea come back with Torres and Oscar linking up with Mata who hooks in a cross behind the centre-forward and Shakhtar bustle it up field.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Shakhtar 1-0 Chelsea (Alex Teixeira)</strong> David Luiz cut out a pass from Rakitskiy intended for Willian and gave away a throw. Chelsea didn't get organised with any particular haste and when the throw came in to the left of the box, Willian cut inside, claimed for a handball when he moved it across the area and it was intercepted by Terry and fell to Alex Teixeira who steered it across Cech and into the kkeeper's right-hand corner.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min: </strong>You might have to refresh to get that Pulitzer-prize winning goal description. Very sloppy defending from Chelsea. But they look much better going forward, Mikel getting a foot in and recycling it quickly forward to Oscar who shoots from 22 yards, with little power, and Pyatov gathers.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min: </strong>\"As with captaincy not being the same, so with Scrabble,\" writes Ian Copestake. \"I have just dragged myself away from an online Scrabble game with someone who is amassing huge scores using words like yu and um. My blood is boiling so much that wondering what a Being John Terry documentary would be like is offering sane distraction.\" You forgot the colon, Ian. Friday night, Channel 5. The only thing more embarrassing than Thursday night, Channel 5. Torres slips the ball past Srna but gets it tied up between his feet.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min: </strong>Mata brings the ball out of defence, makes 30 yards and feeds Torres who seems to slip with his back to goal on the edge of the box. He tries to slow the counter by committing a foul and gets a lecture from the ref for his infraction.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 min: </strong>Willian looks very lively, moving from left to centre, occasionally over to the right. Just then he almost played in Alex Teixeira breaking past Cole on the left of Chelsea's defence but David Luiz hooked his pass away.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 min: </strong>Chelsea enjoy a prolonged period of possession, shuffling the ball from flank to flank with Lampard as the pivot distributing but when the ball is at last knocked forward it comes back at them far too quick, Lampard goes down and Willian storms into the space left by the midfielder and shoots over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Lampard is injured, self-inflicted partially when he slipped and kicked his own ankle which then twisted. Before Eden Hazard comes on, Mkhitaryan and Willian link up with Willian's shot blocked out for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> Apologies \u2013 having a bit of a nightmare here over timings, the clock on our feed is cropped off at the side. Anyway. Hazard almost immediately bursts through the middle on to Mata's pass but Pyatov sprints out to dive and smother it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> Deep cross from Ivanovic after more clever, quick work from Mata. Pyatov gathers at the far post, picking it off Torres's head. Cole puts his hands on the keeper's shoulders, who goes down like Neil Warnock's sack of spuds. Cole is booked.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>23 min</strong> The impressive Fernandinho again gets time on the ball just past the centre-circle and dinks a pass to Willian's feet on the left of the area. He jinks inside and tries to curl a ball inbetween Ceceh and his left-post but it's too close to the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Quick break from Chelsea with Torres beaten to the ball by Pyatov when put through the middle but the Spaniard recovers the ball, moves right, keeps it with fine control but all the while Shakhtar have begun to regroup so that when he crosses it's cut out and Shakatak break like lightning with H\u00fcbschmann and Willian playing in Mkhitaryan on the left. He sprints into the box, drags it back towards the penalty spot and Chelsea clear.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Both sides are very gung ho. I haven't seen a Champions League slugfest like this for years. Some clever passing, too, but loads of quick breaks upfield by both sides.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Fernandinho now brings the ball past halfway, looks up and diddles it through to Mkhitaryan who spins and sort of slices his shot, dragging the top pf his boot across it which makes it swerve but without the power.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Luiz Adriano wins a free-kick, claiming that John Terry cuffed him. Speaking of him, Ian Copestake has gone all profound: \"(<br>I'm pretty convinced that a documentary of our once proud England captain would show that he does not in fact exist, that he is modern football's worst nightmare made real, a projection of all our worst fears and secret desires. Basically he's football's Tyler Durden.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Luiz now wins a free kick off David Luiz by backing in. They used to call that \"making a back\" for the defender and the referee keeps buying it. Jack Charlton in the 1966 World Cup final: \"He's made a back, ref. He's made a back.\" Cue quizzical look. Torres again scampers through when Mata gets it into the box. His runs are dangerous but the ball finds him in areas that are just too wide at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Good saunter from Ivanovic who tries to Ricky Villa his way into the box from the right but has the ball nicked off his toe by Hubschmann. Shakhtar break quickly but Mikel drops back to cover Ivanovic's raid and stops the momentum.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Mkhitaryan shoots from the right of the 18-yard box, just from the edge having been played in by Willian. He moved his body right to try and throw the defender then clips his shot and Cech parries it over. The corner pinballs around the box for a minute or so until Chelsea finally manage to get a biggish boot on it.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> Chelsea are wearing the Emperor's New Clothes at the back tonight, giving up a corner thanks to Srna's attacking raid up the right.

Shakhtar have seven. Excellent performance from Shakhtar, thrilling link-up play between Willian, Fernandinho, Mkhitaryan, Alex Teixeira and the evergreen Srna. Chelsea looked good in patches going forward but the speed with which the Ukrainians shifted the ball on the edge of the final third caused lost of problems. Fine game to watch, though. That's me done for a few weeks. Thanks for your emails (well, most of them). Good night.</p>",
  "<p>The government is planning a draft bill introducing limited prisoner voting rights to comply with the European court of human rights, despite fierce opposition from Eurosceptic backbenchers.</p> <p>But embarrassed government ministers are likely to defer the hugely controversial announcement until just before a late-November deadline, allowing it to be made after the police commissioner elections on 17 November.</p> <p>One government source said: \"No party wants to put this in their 'last week grid' for these elections. The final decision will be made very late.\"</p> <p>The announcement is still causing friction, with one coalition source saying most of the dispute is now \"a blue-on-blue row\", within the Conservative party.</p> <p>David Cameron has said it would make him sick to give prisoners the right to vote, but he allowed the then Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to propose that prisoners serving a sentence of four years or less should be given the right.</p> <p>Harder-line Tory backbenchers, such as Dominic Raab, have argued there is practically no danger of a fine by the European court should Britain not introduce votes for prisoners, and absolutely no chance of the UK being kicked out of the Council of Europe. But the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told ministers they have to accept the ruling of the European court in Strasbourg after repeated appeals have failed. Grieve has been an exponent of reform of the court, but not UK withdrawal, saying that would make Britain a pariah state.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat ministers still support compliance with the court, but do not want to be seen any longer to be in the vanguard on an issue that is likely to make them deeply unpopular. Labour does not favour prisoner voting rights but does not want to be seen to be ignoring the court.</p> <p>The political advantage of agreeing to publish a draft bill is that the government would not be seen to be in open defiance of the European court in that it would be taking steps with the court order to introduce legislation on prisoners' rights.</p> <p>Yet, in practice, a draft bill might take years to reach the statute book, since it would require wide consultation and allow amendment by a joint committee of both houses. The two alternatives are to table a fresh Commons motion, or to publish a bill.</p> <p>In a marathon legal battle going back to 2004, the court has repeatedly ruled that a general and automatic disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners was incompatible with European law.</p> <p>The UK government was given six months from a judgment in Scoppola v Italy on 22 May 2012 to bring forward legislative proposals to amend the law.</p> <p>But the court has also accepted that member states should have a wide discretion as to how they regulate a ban on prisoner voting, in terms of the kind of offence, length of prison sentence, and the discretion given to individual judges to determine a prisoner's right to vote.</p> <p>The British government's already acute dilemma has been deepened by the Commons overwhelmingly passing a motion in February 2011 stating that it supports \"the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt default or reprimand\". The motion was passed by 234 to 22.</p> <p>The debate was led by the prominent Tory backbencher David Davis and by the former Labour justice secretary Jack Straw. Davis argued: \"If you break the law, you cannot make the law.\" Straw asserted: \"The issue of prisoners voting rights was by no stretch of the imagination a breach of fundamental human rights but was a matter of penal policy which the minority of judges at Strasbourg said should be left to the UK parliament.\" He accused the Strasbourg court of trying to set itself up as \"the supreme court of Europe\".</p> <p>Ministry of Justice sources denied they would comply with the ruling by publishing a draft bill, and stressed they were the lead department on the issue and opposed the right of prisoners to vote. They refused to discuss the state of internal negotiations, or whether a draft bill might be a means of deferring a decision. No 10 also deniedthere had been any decision to give prisoners voting rights.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended to 24 October 2012 to make clear that the ruling on prisoner votes was from the European court of human rights rather than the European Union.</p>",

My role was to keep in regular touch with all BBC news and current affairs outlets, acting on his behalf as a consultant on controversial matters. I could react directly on my own authority, but anything of real moment was reported to him immediately. We investigated personally. A decision often came within minutes, sometimes longer.

  "<p>The chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, has responded emphatically to claims made in a document released by the UCI on Monday, saying that cycling's governing body are \"simply diverting attention away from their own failures\".</p> <p>On Monday, the UCI president, Pat McQuaid, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/22/uci-lance-armstrong-press-conference-live\" title=\"\">convened a press conference to deliver the UCI's verdict on the Usada report, published two weeks ago,</a> which had revealed the extent of the doping scheme that enabled Lance Armstrong to win seven consecutive Tours de France. The report's publication followed Armstrong's decision not to contest Usada's case against him in an arbitration hearing \u2013 even though that decision meant he would be stripped of all his titles.</p> <p>In Geneva, McQuaid said the UCI recognised the Usada ruling and that Lance Armstrong now \"had no place in cycling\". But in a document published later the same day on the UCI's website, and personally signed by McQuaid, he delivered a different message. The UCI's \"Decision\" document accepts Usada's sanction against Armstrong, but calls its evidence and methods into question, and raises grounds for a possible appeal \u2013 either by Armstrong himself, or by the World Anti-Doping Agency \u2013 against the report's conclusions.</p> <p>After first welcoming the UCI's announcement on Monday, Usada's Tygart reacted indignantly on Tuesday, once he had reviewed McQuaid's critique. \"The truth&#xa0;is Lance Armstrong, on their&#xa0;watch, pulled off the greatest heist sport has ever seen,\" said Tygart. \"Instead of attempting to explain or justify their inadequacies, the UCI should acknowledge their responsibility and failures and find ways to make it right.\"</p> <p>During the press conference McQuaid had to field uncomfortable questions over the UCI's acceptance of $125,000 in donations from Armstrong. In the four-page \"Decision\" document, however, McQuaid refers to the Usada report's \"overstated language\", \"incorrect and incomplete statements\", and questions whether Usada had a sufficient \"degree of detachment\" to make a disciplinary judgment.</p> <p>\"The UCI does not point to any specifics in making this ridiculous claim,\" responded Tygart, via email from Usada's Colorado headquarters, after reviewing the document. \"They simply are trying to divert attention away from their own failures in this whole sad saga, and those that love the sport of cycling and clean sport should not allow that to happen.</p> <p>\"Our report was straightforward and produced the natural and logical conclusion based on a simple review of the evidence,\" he continued. \"Maybe they do not like the outcome but it is the simple sad truth, nothing more and nothing less and their effort to undercut is obviously a transparent attempt to continue to run from the truth.\"</p> <p>In the document, McQuaid also challenged the jurisdiction of Usada in stripping Armstrong of his titles under the Wada Anti-Doping Code and publishing its report after Armstrong waived his right to a court of arbitration for sport (Cas) hearing. McQuaid suggested that Armstrong \"could have contested not only the allegations that Usada made against him but also the jurisdiction of Usada\". According to McQuaid, the UCI should have been given Usada's case file for the UCI to decide on what action to pursue.</p> <p>\"We set forth our position on why they were conflicted in this case on many different grounds,\" said Tygart, \"They accepted money from him [Armstrong], they accused us of a witch-hunt (without seeing any evidence), they sued the chief whistleblower, they discouraged witnesses from participating.\"</p> <p>In the UCI \"Decision\", McQuaid claimed that if his body had had prior sight of Usada's evidence, it would have concluded that Armstrong \"had a case to answer\" and would have advised Armstrong's national governing body, USA Cycling, to institute proceedings. Tygart has little confidence that an investigation led and controlled by the UCI would have produced the same result.</p> <p>\"All in all, given what was at stake for the sport,\" said Tygart, \"I was very doubtful this day would ever come\".</p> <p>Perhaps the most serious of McQuaid's claims is that Usada deprived Armstrong of the benefit of an eight-year statute of limitations under Wada's Code. Theoretically, this would rule out of court all Usada's evidence of doping violations prior to 2004, the year of Armstrong's penultimate Tour de France victory. McQuaid goes on to note that this statute of limitations could have formed the basis for a partial defence if Armstrong had accepted a Cas hearing on his case. The UCI president adds that while the UCI itself would not appeal to Cas on the basis of this claimed infringement of the statute, Wada should, or could, in his view, make such an appeal for the sake of enforcing compliance. In short, the UCI advises Wada that it has a responsibility to appeal against Usada's ruling against Armstrong's doping operation.</p> <p>\"Armstrong denied himself the benefit of any statute because he lied under oath and many other forums, swearing that he did not dope, in addition to bullying witnesses into silence,\" Tygart responded. \"If he had not done this, he might have benefited from the statute of limitation. To raise this now, only further shows their reluctance to do the right thing for the sport going forward.\"</p> <p>Tygart added that he would have been happy to have seen the case go to Cas, rather than be settled by Armstrong's waiving of his right. \"We welcomed a Cas proceeding for all the evidence to be presented under oath and in public for the world to see, and we were confident the world would know the truth, as it does today.\"</p> <p>In a section in the \"Decision\" commenting on Usada's evidence, McQuaid casts several aspersions. Implying duress, he notes that witness statements \"have been under penalty of perjury\" and \"have not been submitted to cross-examination\".</p> <p>\"Even if, purely as an assumption,\" noted McQuaid, \"some statements made against Mr Armstrong would be incorrect, vague or confusing, the UCI does not have the elements to show that this would be the case.\"</p> <p>\"[This is] another example of the UCI attempting to escape responsibility for their failures and it is quite sad they would continue to resort to such underhanded tactics at this time,\" said Tygart. \"This is absolutely fiction, made up by them to justify their ineptness at failing to prevent this 'great heist' in their sport.\"</p> <p>McQuaid closed the UCI document with the proviso that the UCI's recognition of the Usada ruling is conditional \"on whether Mr Armstrong or Wada will appeal Usada's decision to Cas\". Given the history of tension between the UCI and Wada \u2013 McQuaid and his predecessor Hein Verbruggen even sued Wada's former head, Dick Pound, over his criticism of their anti-doping efforts \u2013 an appeal by Wada seems very unlikely.</p> <p>According to Jay K Reisinger, a Pittsburgh-based sports law attorney, Armstrong would have 21 days to lodge an appeal \u2013 notwithstanding the fact he declined a hearing. As Usada's \"Reasoned Decision\" was published on 10 October, that would give the disgraced cyclist until the end of the month.</p> <p>Despite what might be seen as the encouragement offered by McQuaid to Armstrong in the UCI document, Tygart is not losing any sleep over a move by Armstrong himself. \"Armstrong has waived his right to any appeal,\" he said. \"He does not have any right to appeal at this time.\"</p> <p>Tyler Hamilton, Armstrong's former team-mate and self-confessed doper, believes McQuaid should now step down. \"Pat McQuaid's comments expose the hypocrisy of this leadership and demonstrate why he is incapable of any meaningful change,\" said Hamilton. \"Instead of seizing the opportunity to instil hope for the next generation of cyclists, he continues to point fingers, shift blame and attack those who speak out. Tactics that are no longer effective. Pat McQuaid has no place in cycling.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US presidential campaign still has two weeks to run, but it is already possible to say that whichever man wins, democracy will be one of the losers. There has of course never ever been a perfectly fair and honest election in any of the countries which claim the democratic title. Dirty tricks are part of the process, understood, fallen for, seen through, and sometimes even relished by the voters. Trollope wrote of an election agent profoundly puzzled by the proposition that bribing citizens with free beer was in some way unethical, while Mark Twain satirically advised politicians to \"Get the facts first. You can distort them later.\"</p> <p>Yet the failings evident in the American contest this time may be of a new order, and they could be critical. To put it at its simplest, the election is so close that its outcome may be determined by whether the lies told during the campaign, above all by the Republican side, stick or not. Because the candidates are so close, because the country has been so submerged by wave after wave of negative advertising, and because the falsehoods and unacknowledged shifts of position have come so thick and fast, mendacity could triumph over merit. If it does so, it will be because democracy's main tool for checking deception, the media, have fallen short of their duties. When politicians find they can make assertions and perpetrate falsehood without fear of being exposed, or at least of being exposed in front of the broader public, some of them will do so.</p> <p>The reasons are various. Elements of the American media, like Fox News, are partisan to the point of outright distortion, while others are hampered by what Paul Krugman has called the \"cult of balance\", refusing to directly contest misleading statements by politicians and instead only offering the other side the opportunity of rebuttal, or leaving to columnists and commentators the task of judging political assertions. Contradicting politicians in news stories was not done. Barack Obama has himself justifiably complained of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/04/03/president-obama-speaks-associated-press-luncheon#transcript\" title=\"\">\"false balance\"</a>, implying that this so-called \"he said, she said\" narrative, ostensibly even-handed, misleads, confuses and bores the citizen. Both partisanship and the problem of false equivalence, assigning equal weight to each side's position in the search for balance, have contributed to a steep decline in trust in the accuracy of reports in the American <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2009/09/13/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low/\" title=\"\">media.</a></p> <p>The United States is not alone in these developments, but it is, unfortunately, further down this road than other nations in the democratic family. Where the partisan press cannot be trusted to check the facts offered by the politicians they favour or accept the versions offered by those they do not, and the more independent or liberal press will not do so in either case, democracy is clearly in trouble.</p> <p>It is true that, as the campaign has run its course, some American journalists have raised their game, nudged along, in part, by the social media. Political assertions have been contested in news stories, while one moderator, Candy Crowley, brusquely contradicted Mitt Romney in the second presidential debate when he tried to maintain that Mr Obama had not termed the attack on the Benghazi consulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/candy-crowley-republicans-benghazi-interjection\" title=\"\">an act of terror</a>. The stunned expression on Mr Romney's face when she did so showed, however, how rare such interventions remain. Republicans then heaped abuse on her, helped by the fact that she was herself guilty of an error, although a lesser one.</p> <p>Whatever the rights or wrongs of that incident, the fact checkers have got their act together rather late in the day. American voters will thus soon be deciding on issues that have been presented to them in a particularly distorted way, and making a judgment on character clouded by the way in which one candidate, Mr Romney, has segued from the aggressive right of the spectrum to somewhere near the centre, particularly in foreign policy, as Monday night's debate showed.</p> <p>Emerson said that if you threw a fact out of the window you would come back later to find it sitting in the chimney corner.

The strip club then took the case to court, arguing the dances should be tax-exempt because some of the dancers are trained in ballet, jazz and gymnastics. </p> <p>In the petitioner's brief, Nite Moves' lawyer W Andrew McCullough also argued that the strip club is comparable to a theater because it has dressing rooms, ushers and a wait staff. </p> <p>Nite Moves is different from most strip clubs because it does not sell alcoholic drinks and therefore is held to different standards of tax-exemption. </p> <p>An administrative court judge initially ruled in favor of Nite Moves and said: \"The fact that the dancers remove all or part of their costume \u2026 simply does not render such dance routines as something less than choreographed performances.\"</p> <p>A New York tax appeal tribunal opposed the ruling saying their was not enough proof that the strip club should be exempt from taxes. The New York court of appeals agreed to hear the case last year.</p>",
  "<p>Parents of more than 40,000 children living outside the UK are receiving child benefit, according to figures released by the Treasury just months before more than one million parents face having their benefits cut or axed.</p> <p>The payments \u2013 worth up to \u00a336m a year \u2013 have been revealed amid fears that changes to the UK's welfare system, due to come into force in January, are too complicated.</p> <p>David Gauke, the Treasury minister, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0001.htm#12102228001482\" title=\"\">published the figures</a> for payments to 23,855 families, who live outside the UK but in the European Union, in response to a question from the Conservative MP Priti Patel.</p> <p>By far the biggest proportion of children for whom claims are being made \u2013 nearly two-thirds \u2013 are living in Poland. The remaining third of claimants are in the other 25 EU countries and three others: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In all cases, families can claim \u00a320.30 for the first child and \u00a313.40 for each subsequent child.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.priti4witham.com/\" title=\"\">Patel</a> said the figures were \"alarming\". \"Hard-pressed taxpayers are going to be absolutely appalled to see money leeching out of their pockets to pay these payments at a time when [they] are squeezed anyway,\" she said.</p> <p>The Treasury defended the overseas payments, saying that they were obliged under European law, and pointed out that claims could only be made if at least one parent was working in the UK and paying National Insurance.\"These payments make up less than 0.5% of child benefit awards,\" added a Treasury spokesman.</p> <p>In response, Patel said the EU law should be challenged. \"This is about the sustainability of our welfare state and benefits system,\" she added.</p> <p>HM Revenue &amp; Customs will send out letters next week to millions of families claiming child benefit explaining<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/child-benefit-threshold-rises-50000-2012-budget\" title=\"\"> the new rules</a>, under which mean families with one parent earning more than \u00a350,000 will lose part of their child benefit. Families with a parent earning more than \u00a360,000 will lose all their benefit.</p> <p>The letters will include new self-assessment forms which will compel parents to declare their income and opt to either keep receiving the child benefit and repay some of it through a tax, or forfeit it entirely.</p> <p>HMRC denied reports that the letters had been delayed because of a confusion over how to explain the changes. The new system has also been criticised because a family with two incomes of just below \u00a350,000 would keep their full payments.</p> <p>On this issue, the Treasury spokesman said: \"The unprecedented scale of the deficit has meant that the government has had to make tough choices to reduce public spending. In a period when the government is having to reduce welfare spending, it is very difficult to justify continuing to pay for the child benefit of the wealthiest 15% of families in society. 85% of all families with children are unaffected and will continue to receive child benefit in full. Ninety percent will benefit in full or in part.\"</p> <p>Separately, the introduction of the new combined benefits payment, universal credit, by the Department of Work and Pensions in a year's time is also causing growing concerns, despite government assurances that the complicated switchover was on track and on budget.</p> <p>Asked by MPs on Monday whether universal credit should be scrapped, Nick Macpherson, the Treasury's most senior civil servant, appeared to offer no reassurance or proactive support for the policy. After a long hesitation, during which Macpherson said he was \"considering his response\", the permanent secretary <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=11570\" title=\"\">told the public accounts committee</a>: \"The universal credit is government policy. The government is committed to it. The challenge is to implement it in a way which works. Some of us have had personal experience of tax credit at the time of the last century [in the 1990s], and we do want to get these things right.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani is used to basking in the limelight. But when the emir of Qatar arrived in Gaza on Tuesday \u2013 the first Arab leader in years to visit the impoverished coastal strip \u2013 he was hailed for breaking its siege, demonstrating his country's huge and growing influence in the Middle East.</p> <p>Palestinians rolled out the red carpet for the emir as his black Mercedes bumped along a rutted main road that he has promised to rebuild, past white and maroon Qatari flags, the song Thank&#xa0;You, Qatar playing endlessly on&#xa0;local radio and TV.</p> <p>Sheikh Hamad flew to Egypt and crossed the border into Gaza, a move billed as breaking the blockade in force since the Islamists of Hamas took power in 2007. It also underlined the ability of the tiny, fabulously rich Gulf state to punch above its weight internationally.</p> <p>He arrived with 90 tonnes of aid and pledged $400m (\u00a3250m) to invest in housing and infrastructure to replace property damaged in the 2008-09 war with Israel.</p> <p>Flanked by his wife, the elegant and high-profile Sheikha Mozah, he spoke to a large crowd at Gaza's Islamic University, the biggest event of a six-hour stay.</p> <p>The last head of state to visit the strip was King Abdullah of Jordan, who went there in 1999 for talks with then Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat.</p> <p>Predictably, the brief royal visit was the top news item on al-Jazeera, the satellite TV channel owned by the emir's family and which has been an unabashed and influential cheerleader for the uprisings of the Arab spring from Tunisia to Syria.</p> <p>Qatar's ambitious move was a stunning boost for Hamas, shunned by Israel, the US and western countries as a terrorist organisation. Ismail Haniyeh, its deposed prime minister, called it a historic event that had broken the \"unjust blockade\".</p> <p>\"The visit gives Hamas legitimacy in the Arab world and internationally,\" said Mkhaimar Abusada, an independent analyst at Gaza's al-Azhar university. It was further striking evidence that Qatar, whose per-capita income is now the highest in the world, is in effect using its enormous oil and gas riches and close ties to Islamist organisations to expand its regional influence in the wake of its involvement in the uprisings against Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p> <p>\"The emir is confirming that Qatar is the principal supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood takeover in Egypt and everywhere else,\" said Ahmed Asfahani, the respected al-Hayat newspaper columnist. \"Qatar is using the Brotherhood to promote its own interests. It also shows that Qatar is trying to replace Iran as a major player on the Palestinian issue.\"</p> <p>Observers in the region also see the visit in part as a reward to Hamas for ending its support for Assad. Until a few months ago, the movement's exiled leadership was based in Damascus, helping bolster Syria's credentials as a key member of the \"axis of resistance\" confronting Israel, along with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p> <p>But its veteran leader, Khalid Mish'al, decamped to Doha. And Haniyeh came out in open support of the right of the Syrian people to oppose Assad.</p> <p>Mahmoud Abbas, the western-backed Palestinian president and leader of Fatah, had let it be known from his headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah that he was furious about the visit, which plays into the hands of his bitterest rival. \"Nobody's happy about it,\" said one Palestinian source. \"It definitely makes a statement. And of course there is a track record of Arab regimes playing into intra-Palestinian politics.\"</p> <p>The PLO welcomed any help with reconstruction in Gaza, but called on \"all Arab brethren to \u2026 use their leverage to ensure an end to the division and the policy of creating a separatist entity in the Gaza Strip, as [this] principally serves the Israeli agenda.\" There is also an unspoken fear of eroding the claim of Abbas's Palestinian Authority to be the sole representative of the Palestinians.</p> <p>Israel angrily condemned the Qatari visit as well. \"We find it weird that the emir doesn't support all of the Palestinians but sides with Hamas over the Palestinian Authority [in the West Bank] which he has never visited,\" said its foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor. \"The emir has chosen his camp and it is not good.\"</p> <p>In the background, it is possible to discern a new pattern of relations emerging in a political landscape transformed by the Arab spring in which a key player is the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>In the era of Hosni Mubarak, Qatar was often at loggerheads with Egypt, which, like many other Arab governments, hated al-Jazeera and saw it as a disruptive instrument of Qatari policy. Even now, Doha is being more radical than Cairo. Formally, Egypt considers Abbas as the representative of Palestinians and Gaza as under PA authority (or that the end state of Palestinian reconciliation should be a West Bank and Gaza united under PA control). The emir called publicly for efforts to promote reconciliation between the Palestinian rivals to confront Israel. \"It will be interesting to see if Qatar is now going to play a more active role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah, or even Hamas and Israel,\" said Abusada.</p> <p>Doha has won admiration and irritation in equal measure in the Middle East and beyond. Uniquely, it maintains cordial, if low-key, relations with Israel as well as Iran, hated by other Gulf Arabs. It is also home to a large US air base. Its wealth speaks eloquently. In September, it announced plans to invest $18bn over five years in Egypt. Its aid also helped reconstruction in south Lebanon after the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. At that time, the emir worked closely with Assad, only to turn against him when the Syrian uprising began 19 months ago. In Libya last year, Qatar bankrolled the anti-Gaddafi rebels but channelled resources through Islamist brigades only to face criticism later that it was behaving in a manipulative manner. Now Qatar has become a key supporter of the armed Syrian opposition, amid growing concern in the west that the weapons it pays for are reaching jihadi-type groups rather than democratic forces.</p> <p>Among its other accomplishments, Qatar is to host the 2022 World Cup, having defeated bidders including the US and Japan. Following intense lobbying it also recently managed to join La Francophonie \u2013 the 57-member bloc of French-speaking nations \u2013 as an associate member. French is barely spoken in Qatar but it insists it is committed to promoting use of the language.</p>",
  "<p>Mulberry, the luxury handbag maker, took a battering with nearly \u00a3190m wiped off the Somerset company's value after falling out of fashion in Asia.</p> <p>Mulberry warned annual profits would be below last year's after a double whammy of weak orders from overseas department stores and the decision to stop supplying small retailers in Italy and Belgium whose stores it considers too downmarket.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan cut his profit forecast for the year from \u00a342m to \u00a331m. Last year Mulberry made \u00a336m profits. \"Given that it has had a tremendous run in terms of both share price and profits, it is now at the crossroads,\" said Dorgan. \"Either, we are wrong about the scale of its international opportunity, or this is just a blip. While we are not entirely satisfied about all of the reasons given for the profit warning, we tend towards the latter view.\"</p> <p>The shares closed down 314p, nearly 24%, at \u00a310.06.</p> <p>The scare comes after luxury fashion house <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">Burberry issued its own profits warning last month</a>, blaming stuttering demand in the Chinese market over the summer. China is the big prize for the luxury goods industry and is expected to become the biggest single market by 2015. The prospect of weakening demand has sparked fears of another downturn in the sector.</p> <p>The profit warning is a fresh setback for Mulberry - whose bags are carried by, and indeed named after, celebrities including Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey - which has been a stock market darling. Disappointing annual results in June jolted the shares and combined with Tuesday's warning the stock has lost 60% of its value since May.</p> <p>Total sales increased 6% to \u00a376.5m in the six months to 30 September. Within that, retail sales rose 13% to \u00a346.5m but wholesale shipments fell 4% to \u00a330m.</p> <p>The finance director, Roger Mather, said Mulberry was not a brand in trouble but was experiencing growing pains under Bruno Guillon, who joined as chief executive from Herm\u00e8s earlier this year.</p> <p>Mulberry's Bayswater and Alexa bags usually sell for \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 and Guillon sees scope to move further upmarket, designing bags commanding price tags of up to \u00a31,500. He was behind the decision to cull wholesale accounts though the result is a \u00a35m sales shortfall this year. Its handbags were being sold alongside cheaper labels rather than the likes of Gucci and Prada which it regards as its rightful competitors. Some wholesalers had also been selling on unsold goods without permission. \"It's important to keep the sales channels pure and under control and not have wholesalers misbehaving,\" said Mather.</p> <p>Mulberry is pressing on with plans for a new factory in Bridgwater which will create 300 jobs and double its manufacturing workforce in the UK. Mather said it would break ground in 10 days with the plant expected to open in May. \"In Asia if customers think they are buying a bit of English craftsmanship and design they want the label to say 'made in England,'\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Is Jimmy Savile and the BBC the biggest story on Earth? Apparently so. Today the British media placed it above Romney versus Obama, above the implosion of Lebanon and above the birth of the world's largest oil company. Savile was bigger than killer drones in Lincolnshire, bigger than Cameron's prison policy, bigger than the sensational Birmingham terrorism trial. The mere \"standing down\" of the editor of Newsnight led the BBC news, as if the corporation had sub-contracted itself to its house journal, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/\" title=\"\">Ariel</a>.</p> <p>While Britain's domestic and overseas predicament cries out for clarity from those who purvey public information, the purveyors have lost all proportion. The media has gone collectively tabloid. Savile clearly did terrible things to young people, which authorities failed to notice or investigate. But he is dead, damned, gone for ever.</p> <p>Those who promoted and, to some degree, protected Savile, which included the BBC, the NHS and some charities, bear a portion of the culpability for the harm he caused to young people. It is right that they come clean and apologise on Savile's behalf to those who suffered. It is also right that they review how his doings were concealed and, in the BBC's case, how a programme about him was not aired. That is happening.</p> <p>This does not make the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, a manager of a paedophile ring, or an appeaser of sexual harassment, as implied by much of today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">questioning by the Commons culture committee</a>. His artlessness seemed honest and was plausible. What&#xa0;appeared a conspiracy over the cancelling of Newsnight was, on his evidence, a regretable cock-up.</p> <p>The trouble is that the media hates cock-ups as they dilute guilt. A mistake must be rendered a lie, a cover-up and a crisis, so that the cry can go up for heads to roll. As we saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"\">in the Andrew Mitchell case</a>, when the blood is up, nothing will satisfy the political community but a body in the street. Entwistle gave the appearance of a man who can count angels on the head of a BBC pin, but is at a loss to notice when the pin is skewering him. He now knows&#xa0;what it was like to be James Murdoch in the same seat last&#xa0;spring, giving much the same answers, if less&#xa0;elegantly.</p> <p>The BBC is an archetypal case of corporate elephantiasis, an organisation too big to take clear and swift decisions. Its&#xa0;senior managers are lost in a corporate maze of directorates, divisions, Chinese walls and spectrums of delegation. He could not begin to explain how an \"editor-in-chief\" was not a chief editor, or how the head of television was not, in fact, the head of television. The BBC makes the Vatican seem like a corner shop.</p> <p>The corporation may be commended for the vigour with which its disparate empire, from news to Panorama, reported on the miseries of its elders. But if there is one group that BBC journalists hate even more than the Murdoch family, it is their own bosses. For two days, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today</a> radio programme revelled in their distress. Its presenters could not stop talking about it, hauling in fellow employees to declare the crisis \"the worst in 50 years\", and their superiors to be \"close to toast\".</p> <p>The reality is that the BBC's survival depends on its self-abasement. Given its unique status as a statutory body and its near monopoly of broadcast news, anything less than total disclosure would be inexcusable. Jimmy Savile mesmerised the BBC in life, as now he does in death. Its metropolitan programmers indulged him outrageously, assuming him to be the authentic voice of working-class eccentricity. Their problem was that they could not tell a Savile from a Cilla&#xa0;Black.</p> <p>It is hard to see what real benefit will come from any of this. The case is awash in malice, vilification, exaggeration and litigation. After today's grilling, the BBC might well decide never again to let a child near a male studio presenter. Hospitals will be advised to recruit chaperones for males in children's wards. MPs would apparently deplore anyone permitting children near adult strangers.</p> <p>Nor are children the only consideration. The Commons today elided paedophilia with sexual harassment. Again the consequence must surely be for the BBC, and any entertainment organisation, to deny lone females entry to men's dressing rooms unaccompanied, for fear of having \"permitted\" sexual harassment. This already applies to school and university tutorials, irrespective of the age of those involved.</p> <p>Soon doctors, lawyers and priests will have to practise, like the police, in pairs. Responsibility for our behaviour apparently no longer rests on us as individuals but on anyone whom a lawyer can claim was \"responsible\" for our contact with others. We are no longer our own masters. This is the royal road to Orwellian hell.</p> <p>The recent disproportionate treatment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">phone hacking</a> is threatening the media, not with the already existing criminal law, but with statutory restrictions on its work in respect of personal (and perhaps corporate) privacy. These&#xa0;restrictions seem likely to&#xa0;be out of all proportion to the harm they seek to avert. The same may now apply after Savile.</p> <p>Those running big organisations, in the public and private sectors, face a lethal pincer movement. On the one side is a rising tide of risk aversion, seeping into every factory, office and profession, stifling enterprise, \"reassessing\" risk, clogging decision. On the other is a fear of what happens should this process fail. Just as the concept of an accident has slid from legal status, so has the \"honest mistake\". When Entwistle today admitted and regretted his mistake in not asking in more detail about the Savile programme, his tormenters hardly noticed. Honest mistakes do not exist, being replaced by only the most serious and probably criminal negligence, fit only for the pillory, the stocks or the gallows.</p> <p>We now have a new form of accountability, to an \"inquiriat\", a cackle of inquisitors and lawyers jumping to the bidding of public opinion, flapping round every executive's head and piling accusation on every error. This can only lead to ever more defensive behaviour in every sphere of public life. It is the paranoia of the modern state. Every document is \"open\", every conversation \"on the record\" and your friend today is tomorrow the witness against you.</p>",
  "<p>The company linked to the deadly meningitis outbreak had repeatedly escaped harsh sanctions from health regulators in the years leading up to the scandal, raising fresh questions about oversight of the compounding pharmacy sector.</p> <p>Problems at the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts stretched as far back as 1999, according to state records released amid a wave of legal action from patients who received contaminated or potentially contaminated steroid injections made by NECC.</p> <p>One lawyer told the Guardian that information in the documents could expand the scope of the lawsuits against the company to include punitive damages.</p> <p>On Tuesday the US Centers for Disease Control updated the number of cases to 304, including one new case in Georgia, bringing the number of states affected to 17. No new deaths were reported.</p> <p>Regulators stopped short of imposing the harshest sanctions available to them, such as putting the firm on a three-year probationary period and issuing a formal reprimand, even as the list of complaints continued to grow, the documents show.</p> <p>Released under a freedom of information request and <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/provider/licensing/occupational/pharmacy/necc-application-inspection-and-investigation-documents.html\">published on the Massachusetts department of health website</a>, the documents show a litany of complaints against the company, ranging from allegations of an NECC official handing out blank prescriptions in 1999 to inadequate documentation and inadequate process controls in 2006.</p> <p>In 2004, the pharmacy board of the public health department in Massachusetts initially proposed sanctioning NECC with three years of probation and a public reprimand, amid allegations that the company violated accepted standards for compounding methylprednisolone acetate, the steroid linked to the current fungal meningitis outbreak.</p> <p>But two years later, the board agreed to a non-disciplinary settlement. It also agreed not to report the agreement to the National Association of State Boards of Pharmacy or other outside agencies. NECC's lawyer had pleaded with the board not to issue a public reprimand because it could put the company out of business, according to Reuters.</p> <p>The documents reveal that in 2006 an outside evaluation firm, Pharmacy Support Inc, was sent to NECC. In a letter to NECC, it concluded: \"Although your facility has seen significant upgrades in facility design for the sterile compounding operation, there were numerous significant gaps identified during the assessment.\"</p> <p>A follow-up letter was sent to Barry Cadden, NECC's chief pharmacist, in April 2006, by George Cayer, then president of the state pharmacy board charged with regulating the compounding industry. The letter praised the company's progress in responding to the inspection. The company was placed on probation for one year, but the probation was stayed as part of a consent agreement and no fines or other punitive action were ordered.</p> <p>However, according to the Associated Press, a letter from the congressional committee indicates that the company received a warning letter from the FDA in December 2006.</p> <p>Among the issues cited was NECC's manipulation of a sterile injectable product that led the FDA to be \"especially concerned about potential microbial contamination\".</p> <p>A congressional committee, which sought 10 years of documents relating to the NECC on Monday, said the company's actions \"call into question whether the NECC was operating as a traditional compounding pharmacy or on a commercial scale as a drug manufacturer\".</p> <p>Fred Pritzker, an attorney representing 40 patients across several states who have been affected by the outbreak, said that the documents could expand the scope of the lawsuits against NECC. He has filed one lawsuit already, but expects those lawsuits to be consolidated into one multi-district litigation action to be dealt with in one court.</p> <p>\"This is not an isolated case,\" said Pritzker. \"This is a pattern practice of abuse.\"</p> <p>He said: \"It could expand the scope of the lawsuits to include punitive damages. The real problem is that the company is not going to have enough assets to cover all those affected. It is a very complicated mess, and it is usually the victims, the families of people who have been killed or people who have suffered horrible injury who are left out.\"</p> <p>NECC is widely expected to file for bankruptcy, which would lead to all legal action against it to be halted.</p> <p>The complaints against NECC dated back from 1999 and appeared to follow the company as it expanded from a small family business owned by Cadden and his brother-in-law, Gregory Conigliaro, into the company that, in 2012, sold products in bulk to hospitals and clinics across 50 states.</p> <p>Several investigations are already underway into NECC, which appears to have broken at least one state law, according to state authorities earlier this month, by providing the steroid to patients without prescription.</p> <p>Compounding pharmacies such as NECC are only allowed to produce drugs based on a specific prescription written by a physician for an individual patient and are not generally allowed to solicit business or to promote products that have not been requested by physicians.</p> <p>The documents show that in 2004, pharmacists in Iowa and Wisconsin complained to the board that NECC and Cadden were soliciting out-of-state prescriptions for office use and using a form unapproved by the Massachusetts department of public health. The same year, the board also issued another advisory letter, noting that it had received a complaint from a \"concerned Texas pharmacist about products being solicited by Barry Cadden\".</p> <p>An investigation revealed that NECC was offering an eye treatment and improperly included promotional material and terminology in the advertisements.</p> <p>A complaint in 1999, a year after the pharmacy became operational, which was investigated by the complaints committee, also concerned prescriptions. The \"New England Compounding Center providing a practitioner with prescription blanks\" in \"violation of board regulations\", the documents said.</p> <p>On Monday, a congressional committee sought a decade's worth of records from the company. In a letter sent to a lawyer for NECC, the House committee on energy and commerce noted that as far back as 2002 and 2003 officials from the food and drug administration and the state had conducted joint probes of the company after receiving a report about a steroid shot. Those probes preceded a 2004 joint investigation of the centre by FDA and the Massachusetts board of registration in pharmacy.</p> <p>In a statement on Monday, NECC said: \"New England Compounding Center worked cooperatively with the Massachusetts board of registration in pharmacy to resolve to the board's satisfaction any issues brought to the company's attention.\"</p>",

  "<p>One could have been forgiven for assuming that, in the course of four and a half hours of combined presidential debates, all policy bases would have been covered.</p> <p>Big Bird, binders full of women and battleships all featured, after all. </p> <p>But a surprising number of major issues failed to warrant a mention in any of the three head-to-heads. Here's a guide to what was not discussed \u2013 and the candidates' stances on the forgotten topics.</p> <h2>Gay rights</h2> <p>Despite Obama making a high-profile U-turn on the issue of gay marriage just months ago, the topic of same-sex unions didn't get a look in. The closest Obama got to an attack was a snide jab at Romney getting his social policies from the \"1950s\".</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pushed through a progressive agenda in terms of gay rights, having jettisoned the \"don't ask don't tell\" policy of previous administrations. His conversion to being pro same-sex marriage has been welcomed by the LGBT community, as has his direction to government bodies not to defend the Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) in the courts.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> His agenda of gay rights has been built on shifting sands over the years. In the mid-1990s he told Log Cabin Republicans that he supported \"full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens\". But he has veered towards social conservatism over the last year, repeatedly asserting his belief that \"marriage is between a man and a woman\". He has said he will defend Doma.</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349292779789/marijuana-medical-angeles-006.jpg\" alt=\"marijuana medical angeles\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Los Angeles city council opted to reverse the ban rather than face an expensive and possibly doomed referendum fight. Photograph: Mario Anzuoni /Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Anzuoni /Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>America's war on drugs could have been brought up in the debate on domestic agenda or in the foreign policy encounter. </p> <p>But despite absorbing massive federal funds \u2013 some $51bn annually, according to the Drug Policy Alliance \u2013 no mention was made of America's longest war.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama: </strong>The White House has failed to scale down the expensive enforcement-based approach on drugs legislation. Obama has also come out against legalisation. He did, however, bring in legislation to reduce the disparity between sentences given to those caught with crack cocaine, compared to users of powder cocaine. He has also diverted more funds to prevention and treatment programmes.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Likewise anti-legalisation, Romney blames demand in the US for the cross-border violence in Mexico. In a recent forum organised by the Univision TV Network, the Republican reportedly said that the US president has to make \"a priority of reducing demand in this country and communicating to our young people, and older people, that when they use these illegal drugs, they are contributing to the deaths of people around the world\".</p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>In the course of the presidential debates, the topics of gas prices and energy independence came up. But neither candidate turned the issue around to green energy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/us-president-debates-climate-change\">and the issue of climate change.</a></p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pledged to reduce emissions which cause global warming and hit out at sceptics, warning at the Democratic national convention: \"Climate change is not a hoax.\" Obama has also pumped money into the green sector through government grants and loans.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Has called for the phasing out of subsidies for the wind industry and has mocked Obama for wanting to help \"heal the planet\". Although not an outright denier, Romney has said that we \"do not know what's causing climate change on this planet\".</p> <h2>Domestic surveillance</h2> <p>Discussion on homeland security during the first debate failed to nail the candidates on creeping surveillance of US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> According to the American Civil Liberties Union there has been a 60% increase in electronic surveillance under Obama's watch. He also extended the controversial patriot act, with authorises the wiretapping of US and non-US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has said that he supports the patriot act. Meanwhile as governor of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/09/15/wiretap_mosques_romney_suggests/\">he advocated the wiretapping of mosques</a> and carrying out surveillance on foreign students. </p> <h2>Housing</h2> <p>With the economy very much central in the election campaign, it is surprising that some of the main victims of the recession \u2013 homeowners left underwater by falling house prices and those foreclosed on \u2013 didn't get a look in.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has introduced legislation that has helped millions of struggling homeowners, but not as many as he would have hoped. The home affordable modification programme has helped an estimated 1 million families refinance their home loans, but it's goal was to help up to 4 million. </p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has criticised attempts to interfere with the housing market. Indeed his free-market approach appears to extend to giving no help to those facing repossession. \"Don't try to stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom,\" <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/romney-dont-try-and-stop-the-foreclosure-process-video.php\">he said in reference to housing</a>. </p> <h2>Abortion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346274868810/abortion-colorado-personh-006.jpg\" alt=\"abortion colorado personhood\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-life activists march in Washington on the anniversary of Roe V Wade.

  "<p>BAE Systems says it remains \"fully supportive\" of its directors after receiving a letter from its largest shareholder demanding the resignation of the chairman, Dick Olver, and the senior independent director Sir Peter Mason.</p> <p>Invesco Perpetual, which controls 13.3% of BAE shares, was joined in its call by two other institutional investors, understood to be Artemis and Henderson. The trio argue \"significant change\" is needed in the boardroom after the collapse of BAE's attempt to merge with aerospace giant EADS.</p> <p>BAE said it intends to stick with its plan for Olver, chairman since 2004, to depart in 2014 and claimed most shareholders are supportive. \"The company is aware that a minority of its institutional investors have recently made public their own views on board succession planning, which differ widely from those of the board and the majority of the company's principal shareholders,\" it said.</p> <p>The row came as a senior executive at Airbus, owned by EADS, said BAE and the Franco-German group have missed the \"last opportunity\" for consolidation in the European defence and aerospace sector.</p> <p>G\u00fcnter Butschek, chief operating officer at Airbus, said the maker of the A380 and A320 planes would now focus elsewhere, indicating that the failed \u20ac34.5bn (\u00a328bn) merger between the UK's largest defence contractor and the European industrial conglomerate would not be revived.</p> <p>\"We have missed an opportunity, possibly the last opportunity to consolidate on a European level. It is a critically important industry for Europe \u2026 The world will still spin and we are re-focusing on new opportunities,\" said Butschek. The A350 will carry up to 350 passengers and is a European manufacturing project, with wings made in the UK, a fuselage built in Hamburg, Germany, and final assembly at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.</p> <p>The merger would have lessened BAE's reliance on UK defence and EAD's on civil aerospace, giving the Airbus maker access to the US defence market and reintegrating BAE with Airbus \u2013 the arms firm sold a 20% stake in the superjumbo maker in 2006.</p> <p>Speaking in Toulouse at the inauguration of the final assembly line for the long-distance A350 plane, Butschek said Airbus \"doesn't have any need to change our industrial footprint\", referring to the company's pan-European manufacturing strategy. Because Airbus has no advanced plans for an entirely new plane, Butschek said, there is no need for a decision on the location of future Airbus work.</p> <p>\"As long as the decisions are not made [about next generation programmes] there is no need to decide on the allocation of the work package,\" said Butschek. However, the A350 carries an additional boost to UK manufacturing: it uses Trent XWB engines made by Derby-based Rolls-Royce.</p> <p>The UK accounts for around 15% of all Airbus manufacturing \u2013 and the company has a workforce of 10,000 in Britain, largely at its wing manufacturing plant in Broughton, north Wales, and at its design and testing facility in Filton near Bristol.</p> <p>The company's wide production footprint is a legacy of its complex origins as a combination of aerospace manufacturers. EADS, the Airbus parent, is controlled by the French and German governments, who control 22.35% each of the business through direct and indirect shareholdings. Concerns over their influence in a combined BAE/EADS helped scupper the deal, with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, considered the most implacable obstacle.</p> <p>The Airbus chief executive, Fabrice Br\u00e9gier, indicated that the company will focus on emerging markets such as China and increasing its presence in the largest aerospace market, the US, where it recently announced plans for a factory in Alabama. \"I am disappointed that EADS-BAE couldn't happen. It would have created a fantastic leader in both commercial aerospace and defence and this would have contributed to a more balanced group,\" said Br\u00e9gier.</p> <p>\"However, Airbus didn't expect any industrial synergies so what counts is our market, is our international development, in China, in the United States. So it has no impact on the business and the people of Airbus.\"</p> <p>The A350 order book \u2013 with more than 550 orders so far \u2013 indicates the growth trajectory of the international airline market, with Qatar Airways the biggest customer, alongside orders from Air China, Singapore Airlines, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, and Vietnam Airlines. By comparison, the Airbus A380 superjumbo has had 253 orders so far. According to Airbus, the Asia-Pacific region will account for 35% of new aircraft deliveries over the next 20 years, with China overtaking the US as the world's largest domestic airline market from 2031.</p> <p>The first A350, a test aircraft, will take to the air in mid-2013 with the first delivery to Qatar taking place in the second half of 2014. The A350's carbon fibre fuselage helps make it 25% more fuel-efficient than its counterparts that are in operation currently. The entire A350 programme will cost around \u20ac11bn. Airbus hopes to complete 10 A350s a month by 2018. The Toulouse facility, the size of nearly 300 tennis courts, has been named after Roger B\u00e9teille, the Airbus technical director who oversaw the first Airbus aircraft, the A300.</p> <p>The A350 comes in three versions: the 270-seater A350-800; the 314 seat A350-900 and the 350 seat A350-1000.</p>",
  "<p>A glowing green disc hovers high in the sky at night, casting an eerie glow over a forest of minarets, cranes and concrete frames that seem to stretch endlessly into the dusty distance, like a vast field of dominoes. The disc is the largest clockface in the world \u2013 and not only does it adorn the tallest clocktower in the world, it also sits atop a building boasting the biggest floor area in the world. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wahrIMGNRR4&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\" title=\"\">Visible 30km away, this is the Abraj al-Bait</a>, which rises like <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/bigben\" title=\"\">Big Ben</a> on steroids to tower 600m over the <a href=\"http://www.hajinformation.com/main/j10.htm\" title=\"\">holy mosque of Mecca in the spiritual heart of the Islamic&#xa0;world</a>.</p> <p>This thrusting pastiche palace houses an array of luxury hotels and apartments, perched above a five-storey slab of shopping malls. Completed last year at a cost of $15bn (\u00a39bn), it stands where an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1748711.stm\" title=\"\">Ottoman fortress</a> once stood. A stone citadel built in 1781 to repel bandits, the Ajyad fortress's demolition sparked an international outcry in 2002, but this was quickly rebuffed by the Saudi Islamic affairs minister. \"No one has the right to interfere in what comes under the state's authority,\" he said. \"This development is in the interest of all Muslims all over the world.\" The&#xa0;fortress wasn't just swept away \u2013&#xa0;the hill it sat on went, too.</p> <p>Shooting 26 searchlights 10km into the skies, and blaring its call to prayer 7km across the valley, the Abraj&#xa0;al-Bait is also the world's second tallest building. Encrusted with mosaics and inlaid with gold, it is the most visible (and audible) sign of the frenzied building boom that has taken hold of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/saudiarabia\" title=\"\">Saudi Arabia</a>'s holy city over the last 10 years. \"It is truly indescribable,\" says Sami Angawi, architect and founder of the Jeddah-based <a href=\"http://www.amarcenter.net/hajj-research-center.html\" title=\"\">Hajj Research Centre</a>, who has spent the last three decades researching and documenting the historic buildings of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/travel/mecca\" title=\"\">Mecca</a> and Medina, few of which now remain. In particular, the house of the prophet's wife, Khadijah, was razed to make way for public lavatories; the house of his companion, Abu Bakr, is now the site of a Hilton hotel; and his grandson's house was flattened by the King's palace. \"They are turning the holy sanctuary into a machine, a city which has no identity, no heritage, no culture and no natural environment. They've even taken away the mountains,\" says&#xa0;Angawi.</p> <p>Geological features have proved no match for dynamite and concrete, which are being liberally deployed to make way for the burgeoning number of visitors. Three million Muslims arrived in Mecca this week for the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/hajj\" title=\"\">annual hajj pilgrimage</a>, an event that has mutated from a simple, spartan rite of passage, in which pilgrims give up their worldly goods, into a big-bucks business worthy of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/lasvegas\" title=\"\">Las Vegas</a> \u2013 with the overblown architecture to&#xa0;match.</p> <p>Along the western flank of the city are the first towers of the <a href=\"http://www.jabalomar.com.sa/portal/index.php?lang=en\" title=\"\">Jabal Omar development</a>, a sprawling complex that will eventually accommodate 100,000 people in 26&#xa0;luxury hotels \u2013&#xa0;sitting on another gargantuan plinth of 4,000 shops and 500 restaurants, along with its own six-storey prayer hall. The line of blocks, which will climb to heights of up to 200 metres and terminate in a monumental gateway building, share the clocktower's Islamic-lite language: a&#xa0;cliched dressing of pointed arches and filigree grillwork plastered over generic concrete shells.</p> <p>The developers have somehow transformed a type of architecture that evolved from a dense urban grain of low-rise courtyards and narrow streets into meaningless wallpaper: an endlessly repeatable pattern for the decoration of standardised slab after standardised slab. Flimsy rows of concrete arches hang above swaths of blue mirror glass, punctuated by stick-on timber trellis screens. These are modelled on traditional mashrabiya panels, those beautiful latticework openings designed as ventilating veils, but here they become meaningless&#xa0;applique. \"If we are imitating, why can't we imitate the best?\" asks Angawi, in a tone of desperation. \"Why are we imitating the worst mistakes of 60 or 70 years ago from around the world \u2013&#xa0;only even&#xa0;bigger?\"</p> <p>Another development of repetitive slabs, echoing Jabal Omar's toast-rack urbanism, is slated for the northern side of the Grand Mosque, at <a href=\"http://alshamiyah.com/en/\" title=\"\">al-Shamiya</a>, while a $10bn plan to provide an extra 400,000 sq metres of prayer halls there is almost complete. Standing like a gigantic triangular slice of wedding cake, this building will accommodate 1.2m more worshippers each year, but it has come at a price.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398922371\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/23/1351012204259/al-Shamiya-010.jpg\" alt=\"al-Shamiya\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toast-rack urbanism ... how the al-Shamiya area will look</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"This was the most historic part of the old city,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/irfan-al-alawi\" title=\"\">Irfan al-Alawi</a>, executive director of the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.islamic-heritage.org/\" title=\"\">Islamic Heritage Research Foundation</a>, who has worked in vain to raise the profile of his country's historic sites. \"It has now all been flattened.\" Residents were evicted, he says, with one week's notice, and many have still not been compensated \u2013 a common story across Mecca's developments. \"They are now living in shantytowns on the edge of the city without proper sanitation. Locals, who have lived here for generations, are being forced out to make way for these marble castles in the sky.\"</p> <p>Alawi describes the imminent arrival of yet more seven-star hotels even closer to the mosque than the al-Bait clocktower, as well as proposals to develop <a href=\"http://www.phase1.de/projects_jabal-khandama_e.htm\" title=\"\">Jabal Khandama</a>, on the hills to the east, which will likely see the erasure of the site where the prophet Muhammad was born. Alawi says this wilful destruction of Islamic heritage is no accident: it is driven by state-endorsed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/08/islam-pakistan-rahman-baba\" title=\"\">wahhabism</a>, the hardline interpretation of Islam that perceives historical sites as encouraging sinful idolatry. So anything that relates to the prophet could be in the bulldozer's&#xa0;sights.</p> <p>\"It is the end of Mecca,\" says Alawi. \"And for what? Most of these hotels are 50% vacant and the malls are empty \u2013 the rents are too expensive for the former souk stall-holders. And people praying in the new mosque extension will not even be able to see the Kaaba.\"</p> <p>The Kaaba is the holy black cube in the centre of the Grand Mosque, around which pilgrims walk; proximity to it has become the ultimate currency, allowing hotel suites with the best views to charge $7,000 per night during peak seasons. This unique concentricity, with everything determined by its orientation towards the hallowed centre, has spawned a strangely diagrammatic radial urbanism. From above, like a sea of iron filings pulled by a magnet, the whole city appears to crowd round a core, the vortex of pilgrims giving way to an equally swirling current of tower blocks. It is the axis of prayer writ large in concrete.</p> <p>The road to Mecca funnels traffic into two lanes: the one marked \"Muslims only\" goes to the holy city; the other, marked \"Non Muslims\", bypasses it, since the latter \u2013 me included \u2013 are forbidden entry to Mecca (and Medina) under Saudi law. Soon after this hajj, work will start on the expansion of the mataf, the open area around the Kaaba, to triple its capacity to 130,000 pilgrims per hour. But to create this, the historic centre of the mosque will be obliterated. \"They want to get rid of the brick vaults and stone columns that have stood there since the 17th century,\" says Alawi. \"These are the oldest part of the holy mosque, designed by the great architect Sinan. The pillars are inscribed with stories and the names of the prophet's companions, so the wahhabis want to see them&#xa0;bulldozed.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398922372\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351012326661/Toast-rack-in-the-sky-...-004.jpg\" alt=\"Toast rack in the sky ... a CGI construction of what the Jabal Omar project will look like\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jabal Omar project</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desperation to be, or feel, as close as possible to the Kaaba has forced buildings to become ever higher, ever more ridiculously tapered, so everyone can have a view, however notional, of the sacred centre. This has given the sanctified \"mother of villages\" the most expensive real estate in the world: a square foot around the Grand Mosque now sells for up to $18,000, mayor Osama al-Bar said last&#xa0;year, dwarfing the Monaco average&#xa0;of&#xa0;$4,400.</p> <p>As the influx of pilgrims increases, land values will continue to rise: 12&#xa0;million visit the city every year, a figure expected to swell to 17 million by 2025. They will be eased on their way by a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQtWlPxRwo\" title=\"\">new high-speed rail link that will connect gateway city Jeddah with Mecca and Medina</a>. Jeddah's <a href=\"http://www.jed-airport.com/en/\" title=\"\">King Abdul Aziz international airport</a> is itself undergoing expansion to quadruple its capacity to 80 million passengers a&#xa0;year.</p> <p>Fuelled by petrodollars, all of these vast projects are now either completed or well under way. So it seems strange that King Abdullah should only now be ordering the creation of a masterplan for Mecca and its surroundings, covering buildings, transport and infrastructure \u2013 given that most of the city's holy mountains have been dynamited into dust, and all but a handful of its ancient monuments buried beneath soaring structures. As Angawi says: \"There is no other place in the world where development starts with bulldozing before planning. But it is not too late if we stop now. Otherwise, we risk the sanctity of Mecca being gone for ever.\"</p> <h2>Prayer room with a view: a pilgrim's perspective</h2> <p>Everything about the hajj is overwhelming \u2013 the numbers, the logistics, the infrastructure, the stakes \u2013 so it's no surprise that the architecture is catching up. Its sleek and state-of-the-art towers offer butler services, designer toiletries, entire floors reserved for Saudi royalty, wet rooms, helipads, quality linens, plush carpets and thick&#xa0;bathrobes.</p> <p>During my 2010 visit to Mecca, a number of hotels in the Abraj al-Bait complex (left, with clocktower) were at 100% capacity. The hotel employee showing me around one presidential suite said I could pray in front of the Qibla without ever leaving the room, gesturing to a window with priceless views to prove his point. The sense of exclusivity extended to the reservation system, too. Rooms could only be booked through the hotel, but not as part of a package, the traditional if not the uniform way of securing accommodation in&#xa0;Mecca.</p> <p>None of this is visible at ground level. Pilgrims occupy every available space and the dimensions of the projects are too grand to be appreciated simply by craning the neck. Instead, the best views are from the Jeddah-Mecca Highway, where the clocktower appears to rear out of the barren landscape in such an outlandish fashion it looks as if it has been drawn on to the skyline. The vast floor-to-ceiling windows of al-Safa Palace, perched on a hill above Mecca's holy sites, fully reveal the audacious vision to reshape the&#xa0;pilgrimage.</p> <p>The building work has inevitably changed the hajj experience for everyone. Aside from the increased pollution and heavy machinery, there is more segregation along economic and class lines. Muslims cannot choose where or when to perform the hajj \u2013 it can only be done in Mecca, at a certain point in the year \u2013 but they can choose where to stay.</p> <p><strong>Riazat Butt</strong></p>",
  "<p>Kuwait's rulers have banned public gatherings of more than 20 people after clashes between riot police and demonstrators over electoral law changes that opposition figures labelled a \"constitutional coup\".</p> <p>The protests on Sunday were among the largest ever seen in the Gulf state.

Other accounts of today's events include this post on the <a href=\"http://ukcampaign4change.com/2012/10/23/cornwall-council-votes-for-more-time-to-consider-outsourcing-plans/\" title=\"\">Campaign4Change blog</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.lgcplus.com/topics/procurement/cornwall-joint-venture-plans-put-on-hold/5050988.article\" title=\"\">this report</a> by Local Government Chronicle (LGC).</p> <p>The decision will cast further doubt on the future of large scale local government-led privatisation plans. Proponents of mega-outsourcing deals argue that in a climate of huge cuts to funding in local government there is no alternative.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.lgcplus.com/briefings/why-outsourcing-wont-happen/5049893.article?utm_source=twi/er&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=lgc\" title=\"\">here's an interesting counterblast to that orthodoxy</a> from Stephen Hughes, the chief executive of Birmingham council, the UK's biggest local authority. He wrote in LGC last week that while \"traditional outsourcing\" might have had a role to play in the council funding good times, \"in the current circumstances\" it:</p> <blockquote> ...doesn't cut the mustard </blockquote> <p>This observation came just days before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/23/birmingham-city-council-cuts-warning\" title=\"\">today's announcement by Birmingham council </a> that it expects to have had to have found \u00a3600m in savings by 2017 as a result of swinging government cuts and rising costs. The impact of cuts on this scale signalled \"the end of local government as we know it,\" the council leader Sir Albert Bore declared.</p> <p>It seems unlikely, however, given Hughes's comments, that a huge outsourcing deal is regarded as the solution to Birmingham's cuts problems. As Hughes argues:</p> <blockquote> When what is needed is a 30%+ reduction in costs in double quick time, with more to come, the traditional outsourcing model doesn't cut the mustard. <br>Local authorities find it hard to specify future operational requirements, they are worried about fixing costs too far ahead, and outsourcing doesn't address the scale of savings required or the areas where it is needed. <br>With this scale of reduction, local authorities have to change from servicing all demand they face, to finding ways to manage and reduce demand for services. <br>This probably means developing social investment models, payment for results for preventative interventions, better collaboration across public sector agencies, and radical service redesign. <br> </blockquote> <p>In effect, he was arguing that when cuts come in on this colossal scale, merely privatising it to make it cheaper won't work; more fundamental changes are required.</p> <p>In a clear challenge to the big outsourcing companies, he adds:</p> <blockquote> An offer to do better what authorities currently do and make marginal savings on that activity is just inadequate. </blockquote> <p>All of this doesn't mean outsourcing is dead, or that local government can return to the supposed good old days. But - and I may check Serco , BT and Capita share prices over the next few days - it does suggest that attitudes in local government towards who can deliver real reform and how in the age of austerity are shifting.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond has been accused of misleading voters about the legal advice given to his government about the right of an independent Scotland to join the European Union.</p> <p>The first minister has repeatedly said that Scotland would be an automatic member of the EU, be free to adopt sterling as its currency and would inherit all the UK's opt-outs on EU immigration and border controls. He has asserted that this position was supported by his government's legal advice.</p> <p>But Salmond was forced to make a statement to the Scottish parliament late on Tuesday after opposition leaders accused him of \"lying\" and \"covering-up\" following an admission from his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, that no specific legal advice had been given by Scottish law officers on EU membership.</p> <p>His critics highlighted an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1pt-zOnU9c\" title=\"\">interview by Salmond with Andrew Neil on BBC1's Sunday Politics earlier this year</a> in which the first minister said he had been given clear legal advice by Scottish law officers. Asked by Neil whether he had sought advice from the Scottish government's own law officers on membership of the EU, Salmond replied: \"We have, yes, in terms of the debate.\"</p> <p>Asked what that advice said, Salmond responded: \"Well, you know I can't give you the legal advice or reveal the legal advice of law officers, but what you can say is that everything we publish is consistent with the legal advice we have received.\"</p> <p>But in an unexpected disclosure to the Scottish parliament, which capped an already difficult day for Salmond after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/msps-resign-snp-nato-stance\" title=\"\">two SNP backbenchers resigned over Nato</a>, Sturgeon revealed that the Scottish government had only sought legal advice from its law officers in the last week.</p> <p>The Scottish government was due to appear at a two-day hearing in Scotland's highest civil court in December in an attempt to overturn a historic ruling by Rosemary Agnew, the Scottish information commissioner, that this legal advice should be published in the public interest. However, this court action \u2013 which has so far cost nearly \u00a312,000 in legal expenses \u2013will now be dropped, Sturgeon said. \"I can confirm that the government has now commissioned specific legal advice from our law officers on the position of Scotland within the EU if independence is achieved,\" she said. \"[The] Scottish government had previously cited opinions from a number of eminent legal authorities, past and present [but] has not sought specific legal advice.\" She also suggested that getting legal advice was only possible now that Salmond and David Cameron, the prime minister, had signed the \"Edinburgh agreement\" to legally establish the independence referendum.</p> <p>She told MSPs that ministers had only recently requested that advice from its chief law officer, Frank Mulholland, the lord advocate, provoking audible gasps from opposition benches.</p> <p>In a brief statement to MSPs, Salmond denied misleading voters but again said every Scottish government statement and policy paper on EU membership had drawn on its own legal advice, appearing to contradict Sturgeon's earlier statement. He said he was talking about \"general advice\", adding: \"All of these documents are underpinned by legal advice by our own law officers. They have to be. That is the reality.\"</p> <p>Many legal experts argue that an independent Scotland would have to reapply as a new state, a view that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">appeared to be supported by the European commission's president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, last month</a>, leading to suggestions it must then join the euro.</p> <p>Paul Martin MSP, Scottish Labour's business manager, said: \"It appears the first minister is a liar and used taxpayers' money to try to cover up his lies. [Alex] Salmond has started the debate on Scotland's future within the UK with barefaced lies that even embarrass his deputy.\"</p> <p>Catherine Stihler, the Labour MEP for Scotland whose first freedom of information request led to Salmond's legal challenge, said: \"When I attended the court of session in September the Scottish government must have known that their legal advice was just a blank sheet of paper. Thousands of pounds later and now we are told they are seeking legal advice. You couldn't make it up; it's lies, lies and more damned lies.\"</p> <p>Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said the disclosure undermined the Scottish government's stance on EU membership, which contracted other legal opinions that Scotland would have to reapply to join the EU, may be forced to use the euro, and adopt the Schengen agreement on border controls.</p> <p>\"This strikes at the heart of Alex Salmond's credibility,\" Darling said.</p> <p>Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, stopped short of accusing Salmond of lying, but said: \"This has been a cabinet cover-up right from the beginning, using taxpayers' money to try and hoodwink the Scottish people. This is conduct unbecoming of a first minister and his government and exposes the depths to which they will sink to realise their independence dream.\"</p> <p>The controversy added to what was already a difficult day for Salmond, which saw his overall majority at Holyrood reduced to two seats.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, two rebel MSPs Jean Urquhart and John Finnie, resigned from the party in protest at an SNP conference vote at the weekend to join the nuclear-armed military alliance Nato.</p> <p>Finnie, a former police officer who joined the SNP at 16 and has been an open critic of other Scottish government policies, said: \"I cannot belong to a party that quite rightly does not wish to hold nuclear weapons on its soil, but wants to join a first-strike nuclear alliance.\"</p> <p>It also emerged on Tuesday that a long-delayed Scottish government consultation on its independence referendum, which received 26,000 responses, had found widespread and at times heavy opposition to some of Salmond's key proposals for the referendum \u2013 particularly his desire for a two-question poll.</p> <p>The document, published by Sturgeon, disclosed that 59% of respondents did not want a two-question referendum which included an option to vote for greater devolution \u2013 one of Salmond's main objectives. A two-option poll was only backed by 25%.</p> <p>It found that 53% of respondents supported votes for 16- and 17-year-olds but once \"standard campaigns\" were taken out of the calculation, support fell to 45% in favour and 48% against. It found voters were split 33% to 27% in favour of voting on Saturdays.</p> <p>The biggest vote in support of Salmond showed that 63% of respondents favoured his proposed referendum question: \"Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?\", and 59% agreed the vote should be held in autumn 2014.</p> <p>Richard Baker, a Labour shadow minister, said: \"Tuesday was a three-part 'scomnishambles' for this government.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's the newest parliamentary ritual, now as fixed as the Churchill statue in the lobby and the old cry of \"who goes home?\" Someone in charge of an enterprise in trouble \u2013 a bank, perhaps, or G4S, or in this case the BBC \u2013 is dragged in front of a select committee and humiliated. Like a miscreant in the pillory, they can't fight back at their tormentors even while the rotten fruit splats. They are terrified that any show of defiance would only rile the MPs and make their report more horrible.</p> <p>Mind you, George Entwistle, the director general of the BBC, did not make life easy for himself. American pre-school children follow an inquisitive cartoon monkey called Curious George. The BBC seems to be headed by Incurious George.</p> <p>The most excruciating moment came at the end, when he was asked repeatedly about a brief conversation he had last year with Helen Boaden, the head of news. He himself was in charge of television. At a lunch, she warned him that Newsnight was investigating Jimmy Savile, \"and if it stands up, it may have an impact on your Christmas schedule\". She meant the Savile tribute programme due to go out in the festive season, when schedules are as fixed as protocol at a Japanese royal funeral.</p> <p>Anyone else might have wondered what Newsnight was investigating. A tax fiddle perhaps? Membership of a terrorist organisation? Maybe he had been caught lighting up in a no-smoking area. Or something worse. But Mr Entwistle didn't even ask. It never occurred to him to consider pulling the tribute when he still had time. He assumed that if there were anything to worry about he would have been told. In the meantime, it would have been wrong for him to show \"an undue interest\". He made it sound as if asking Ms Boaden about Newsnight's plans would be like inquiring about her underwear.</p> <p>MPs are now well-practised in histrionic expressions of astonishment and disbelief. Labour's Ben Bradshaw looked like a man who sees an out-of-control steamroller crashing down his garden path. The Tories' Philip Davies, never knowingly undersmirked, just looked very happy as another apparatchik squirmed under his questioning.</p> <p>It had all started quite well. Mr Entwistle arrived with an aide and two enormous men \u2013 one had a sort of cauliflower nose \u2013 who sat behind him. If he had been an East End gangster, we'd have known why they were there. As it is, they are unlikely to be retrained as presenters on CBeebies.</p> <p>Mr Entwistle himself has a high, domed head, which gives him the air of a distracted scholar, and a light unassuming voice, possibly deployed in the hope that a soft answer might turn away at least some of the committee's wrath.</p> <p>He was not lucky. It soon became clear that he was a perfect bureaucrat, for whom the rules were overwhelmingly important. The Savile case was \"a grave matter\". \"But we have done the proper things and in the right order.\"</p> <p>The Panorama programme on Monday night gave the appearance of a BBC at war with itself, the MPs said. No, he was \"incredibly proud\" of the BBC for investigating itself.</p> <p>He had missed vital facts. Paul Farrelly said that the \"central question\" \u2013 that Jimmy Savile was a paedophile \u2013 would have been obvious to \"a one-eyed Albanian\". (They should find one, and get him to head the next investigation.)</p> <p>Over and over again he repeated that he had stuck to BBC procedures. (Which, he admitted, needed to be \"calibrated more carefully\", whatever that management jargon means.) So pleased and so precise was he about the regulations that a scornful Damian Collins said the BBC seemed to be run \"by structure and process\", rather than by \"seeking information and making decisions\".</p> <p>Near the end, he said that he had been anxious \"not to do anything to show excessive interest\". He meant, I suppose, to avoid interfering with the news, but it came out all wrong.</p> <p>Philip Davies said, \"your determination not to show an interest applies to&#xa0;everything at the BBC,\" and the whole room burst out laughing, which must have hurt.</p>",
  "<p>'Cameron has been one of the most disappointing Conservative leaders.\" During his tenure, \"error has been piled upon error\". His party is still seen as \"a party of the rich\". His big society \"has been a complete failure as a message\". In office, as well as lacking a plan, his party \"has lost a sense of social justice \u2026 Conservative rhetoric often borders on social Darwinism\". Instead of \"a rightwing party with a heart\", Cameron has \"created a centrist party with cuts\".</p> <p>Even after months of Tory troubles, it is still something of a shock to hear these things from a lifelong Conservative. And not from some disgruntled activist or marginalised, anonymous cabinet dissident, but from one of the party's dominant figures, on the record, in the New Statesman, this newspaper and the Spectator over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Yet Tim Montgomerie is not like previous important Tories. Instead of a parliamentary constituency or ministry, or a personal fortune used for strategic donations, he has an unofficial party website, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome</a>, and an increasing ubiquity in the rest of the political media. At 42, he is a fluent, seemingly inexhaustible writer, broadcaster, thinker, alliance-builder and campaigner. Over the past dozen years, he has played multiple, apparently contradictory Tory roles: internal critic and cheerleader; intimate of the party elite; self-appointed voice of the grassroots; polemicist for a more populist Conservatism \u2013 sometimes more, sometimes less right wing \u2013 and dispassionate analyst of the party's ups and downs.</p> <p>\"It's a new role in British politics,\" said Max Wind-Cowie of the Progressive Conservatism Project at the thinktank Demos. \"Without being elected, originally without the endorsement of a national paper, standing outside the official structure of one of the main parties, he has established himself as one of the foremost voices about what that party should do.\"</p> <p>Robert Halfon, Tory MP for Harlow, who has known Montgomerie since university, said: \"I've never met anyone like him. He's got so much energy in his head. He is a political entrepreneur.\"</p> <p>Montgomerie founded the ambitiously named ConservativeHome in 2005. Since 2009, it has been funded by the wealthy, perpetually manoeuvring Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. Edited by Montgomerie and four other staff, written by them and scores of contributors, it serves as a unique one stop shop for hundreds of thousands of rightwing Britons. \"ConHome\", as it is known in Tory circles, offers punditry, gossip, political philosophy, policy wonkery, a comprehensive roundup of Westminster news, appeals for help with Conservative causes, sales pitches from ambitious MPs, and sometimes raw contributions from party members and supporters.</p> <p>\"I and almost everyone else I know in the party read it at least once a day,\" said Wind-Cowie. Jesse Norman, Conservative MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, said: \"Very few younger MPs don't check it.\" Halfon added: \"There are a lot of people in the Commons who say 'we don't look at it' when they look at it 50 times a day.\" Wind-Cowie, Norman and Halfon are all contributors \u2013 few prominent youngish Tories are not \u2013 but the site is also respected by bloggers on the left. Sunny Hundal, editor of <a href=\"http://liberalconspiracy.org/\" title=\"\">Liberal Conspiracy</a>, said: \"As a political operation I think ConHome sets the benchmark for everyone else.\"</p> <p>One well-connected Tory-watcher calls the site \"a party within a party\". A Tory MP said: \"Being a ConHome reader has almost replaced the party membership. I don't think I've looked at the official Conservative party website for about six months.\"</p> <p>Strikingly, senior Tories heavily criticised on ConservativeHome, such as the former health secretary Andrew Lansley, the former Tory chair Lady Warsi, and the former justice secretary Ken Clarke, often lose their jobs. On BBC Question Time in February, Clarke railed against \"Tim Montgomerie, who sets himself up as representing every active Tory in the country on his blasted website\". Sometimes mockingly, sometimes fearfully, many Tories have started referring to Montgomerie as \"the high priest of Conservatism\".</p> <p>In truth, ConservativeHome is a little too broad in tone and content to be simply a personal mouthpiece. It publishes hostile reader responses to Montgomerie's more controversial stances, such as support for a wealth tax (\"This is madness\") and gay marriage (\"You've sold your soul\"). Yet an argument for a particular sort of Conservatism pervades the site. Montgomerie and his online allies are sceptical about the EU, and about Cameron and his Tory \"modernisation\", which they consider too metropolitan and \u2013 gay marriage aside \u2013 too socially liberal. Most Britons, they argue, want the Conservative party to be tough on crime, welfare and immigration; but also more socially concerned and less elitist \u2013 \"rightwing with a heart\", in Montgomerie's phrase.</p> <p>\"He's got a robust, highly intelligent, well-organised critique of Conservatism from within the right,\" said Norman. \"The hybrid that Tim is pulling together is \u2026 rediscovering arguments from the 80s and 90s, but explicitly actuated by concern for the less well-off. The political effect of that is to reach out across political, class and emotional lines.\"</p> <p>Recently, there have been signs that the government is paying these ideas close attention. \"Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor,\" Cameron told his party conference this month. Montgomerie and ConservativeHome were even more prominent at the event than usual, their large, showily positioned marquee hosting events featuring Tory stars such as Michael Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and, most noisily, Boris Johnson \u2013 whose party leadership credentials Montgomerie has been pointedly talking up in recent months.</p> <p>At Tory gatherings, Montgomerie is easy to spot: tall, more casually dressed than more conventional Tory players, speaking in a seductively calm voice that combines politeness and attention-getting jolts of candour. At conference this month, \"he was just king of the whole place, striding about as if he really was running the party\", said one attendee.</p> <p>Montgomerie denies any such intention.\"I do not want ConservativeHome to be a party within a party,\" he said. \"I want it to be the conference fringe that never stops.\" Have he and the website prompted the Tories' current populist turn? \"It is possible that I was a little bit ahead of time \u2026 on the need for the party to support Britain's strivers. But the focus groups and opinion polls have been telling them similar things.\"</p> <p>Conservative unpopularity, and trying to find ways to end it, have been the near-constants of his political life. Born into an army family in Hampshire in 1970, his politics were Tory from the start. But his teenage Thatcherism was tempered, he says, by discovering evangelical Christianity at 16. At Exeter University, he helped run the Conservative Association with Halfon and two other current Tory MPs, Sajid Javid and David Burrowes. It was the end of the 80s and support for the Tories was ebbing. \"We used to talk about making the party not just for the rich,\" said Halfon. \"Tim had a BBC computer with an old-fashioned printer. He'd produce leaflets, newsletters, posters. A complete workaholic. ConHome is just an outgrowth of that.\"</p> <p>At Exeter, Montgomerie and Burrowes also started the Conservative Christian Fellowship, a still-extant organisation for uniting and expanding the party's Christian membership. Influenced by the US religious right, Montgomerie fiercely promoted what he now calls \"traditional views on homosexuality. That was my upbringing. I don't hold those views any more.\" After working briefly in the 1990s as a Bank of England statistician \u2013 for a polemicist, he retains an unusual, and potent, zest for figures \u2013 Montgomerie moved into full-time politics at Conservative central office, first under the leadership of William Hague, then under Iain Duncan Smith. Influenced by the \"compassionate conservatism\" of pre-9/11 George W Bush, Montgomerie saw his mission as strengthening the Tories' social conscience while keeping them as a strongly rightwing party. Duncan Smith increasingly relied on him, first as a speechwriter, then chief of staff. The fact that Duncan Smith's leadership went so badly has provided ammunition for Montgomerie's enemies ever since. As one MP put it: \"Tim is part of the problem, not part of the solution, some would say. The last time he had influence, the party was not in a beautiful place.\"</p> <p>To some of his critics, Montgomerie combines a restless search for ideological purity with electoral naivety: \"The Conservative version of Michael Foot's Labour party,\" wrote Matthew Parris in the Spectator last year. Others find Montgomerie's ever-quotable outspokenness sly or baffling or self-indulgent, given the already-buffeted government. \"He does cause a lot of angst, particularly in No 10,\" said the Tory blogger Iain Dale. \"But they still deal with him.\" Montgomerie is still invited to Downing Street drinks parties, and Cameron still talks to him at them. \"They are civil, but you can tell there's an underlying grievance,\" said one observer.</p> <p>Few doubt that Montgomerie would prefer a different leader. He was one of the earliest and strongest Tory pessimists about the party's chances at the next general election, and ConservativeHome, some Tories speculate, will play a pivotal kingmaking role if Cameron fails to win. Montgomerie said carefully: \"One day, we could bring two huge assets together, Boris, as a presidential PM, and the [very rightwing] class of 2010.\"</p> <p>Yet Montgomerie is a more complex person than sometimes imagined. Disarmingly mild-mannered, he \"never forgets if he feels you've let him down\", said Halfon. A veteran Westminster player, he lives in Salisbury, not London, most of the week, in the same otherworldly cathedral quarter as the former residence of Edward Heath. He is single, and able to work six days a week, he says, following \"biblical principle\": on the seventh, he gets the train with his sister to watch Manchester United and their famously Labour-supporting manager.</p> <p>Like many obsessive activists \u2013 Montgomerie insists he never wants to be an MP \u2013 he oscillates between optimism and pessimism, dissidence and loyalty. He recently launched another website, <a href=\"http://www.strongandcompassionate.com/\" title=\"\">strongandcompassionate.com</a>, straightforwardly dedicated, it appears, to campaigning for a Tory majority in 2015. He has described his political trajectory as a journey. He said: \"Perhaps I've moved leftwards on the NHS and rightwards on crime.\"</p> <p>His long-term ambition, he said, \"is for ConservativeHome to be handed over to someone else\" to run. Then what? There is an uncharacteristic pause. \"Maybe something in the [international] development world.\" Whoever is Tory leader then may breathe a sigh of relief.</p> <h2>Highs and lows<br><br></h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> 24 July 1970</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Son of a soldier who discovered Thatcherism and Christianity in his teens, rose and then fell as an influential behind-the-scenes Tory, then reinvented himself as a new kind of political player through ConservativeHome.</p> <p><strong>High point </strong>Predicting before the 2010 general election that the first-ever televised party leaders' debates would be \"a big boost for Nick Clegg\", and that the Tories might \"live to regret\" agreeing to participate.</p> <p><strong>Low point </strong>Failure, as Iain Duncan Smith's chief of staff, to help protect the Tory leader in 2003 from an internal party coup has been cited ever since by critics who say he is too cerebral and naive.</p> <p><strong>What he says</strong> \"I'm not worried about ConservativeHome being too powerful.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>EU plans to enforce a much higher profile for women in the European business elite have been thrown into disarray, with a Brussels commissioner being told to try again on legislation to compel female quotas on company boards.</p> <p>The defeat for Viviane Reding, the commissioner for fundamental rights, came amid another row over sexism at the apex of the EU. Herman Van Rompuy, the European council president, pleaded with the parliament in Strasbourg to endorse the appointment of Yves Mersch (a man), from Luxembourg, to the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB).</p> <p>Mersch's appointment, which looks inevitable despite being delayed by parliamentary opposition on grounds of gender, would make the six-strong ECB executive all male, and its governing council of 23 also exclusively male.</p> <p>Reding has been pushing though new draft EU legislation insisting on 40%-female quotas for company boards across Europe, with stiff penalties for noncompliance. The proposals fell foul of British-led opposition among the EU member states, with at least 10 governments reluctant to impose quotas.</p> <p>Those countries argued that the issue should not be legislated at EU level but rather left to national policy-making, and that policies already being pursued in member states to redress the gender imbalance should be given time to work.</p> <p>But Reding's biggest immediate problem was a lack of consensus within the European commission on the contentious draft legislation. This split caused some to question why she was trying to force the issue, if she was unable to get it past this first hurdle. It is highly unusual for the commission to draft a law that will not pass muster among the 27 commissioners.</p> <p>The dispute was not split along gender lines. Quite the contrary: on Monday, Reding said she had constructed a formidable coalition, with the support of five prominent male commissioners. But four leading female commissioners \u2013 from Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark \u2013 opposed the proposals.</p> <p>Reding said she refused to give up on the issue, and the topic would be returned to the commission next month.</p> <p>The European parliament is to vote on Thursday on Mensch's appointment to the ECB, after the chamber's influential economic and monetary affairs committee rejected the German-style inflation hawk on Monday on gender grounds.</p> <p>Van Rompuy told the parliament on Tuesday that female under-representation in top posts was \"blatant\", and that he was working to remedy it, but still believed Mersch should get the job.</p> <p>Mersch's appointment would delay any real chance of redressing the total imbalance in the ECB executive until 2018.</p> <p>Sharon Bowles, the Lib Dem MEP and economic committee chair who is running for governor of the Bank of England, said: \"What we heard today is no different to all the promises on equality that have universally failed: we need more than just talk and promises. We are objecting to the EU's most powerful institution being run by only men for the next six years.\"</p> <h2><strong>Existing examples</strong><br></h2> <p>France, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Italy have introduced quota laws, as have non-EU nations Iceland and Norway, which has had a quota system since 2006 that requires at least 40% of either sex on all listed company boards. Firms were given only two years to comply. The Spanish law, passed in 2007, obliges quoted firms with more than 250 employees to aim for a 40%-female minimum on their boards by 2015. France passed its law in 2011, forcing large companies to reserve at least 40 % of boardroom positions for women by 2017. It applies to 2,000 companies in France that are either listed, have more than 500 employees or revenues over \u20ac50m.</p>",
  "<p>An Italian physicist handed a six-year jail sentence for giving falsely reassuring statements over an earthquake has condemned as \"medieval\" the court that convicted him.</p> <p>Claudio Eva, who was sentenced on Monday along with five other scientists and a government official over the earthquake in 2009 that killed more than 300 people and levelled the city of L'Aquila, said the verdict was an \"eye for an eye\".</p> <p>The ruling by a court in the shattered city, which defied the commonly held view that earthquakes cannot be predicted, has prompted outrage from the world's scientific community.</p> <p>\"It was a very Italian and medieval decision,\" said Eva, 74, who added he had received messages of support from colleagues in the UK, elsewhere in Europe and the US. \"The judge was local, the prosecutor was local and the public were local \u2013 which judge would not have been persuaded by the atmosphere?\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Fellow expert Enzo Boschi \u2013 also sentenced \u2013 who was head of Italy's national geology and volcanology institute in 2009, compared himself to Galileo, the Italian scientist who was tried by the Vatican in 1633 for claiming the Earth revolved around the sun.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Luciano Maiani, head of the Italian commission that monitors seismic risk, resigned, saying: \"I don't see the conditions are there for working serenely.\" His deputy also quit.</p> <p>Stefano Gresta, the current head of the geology and volcanology institute, said: \"From today on, it will be very difficult to appear in public to speak about seismic activity in Italy.\"</p> <p>Eva said: \"From what I hear, colleagues saying, no one wants to join commissions.\"</p> <p>Alessandra Stefano, a lawyer representing Gian Michele Calvi, one of the experts convicted, said: \"This verdict could lead to the continuous raising of alarms in Italy since there are so many seismic zones here.\"</p> <p>Italy's environment minister, Corrado Clini, on Tuesday, said: \"The risk is of confirming the principle that no doubt is permitted in any scientific evaluation.\"</p> <p>The scientists sentenced \u2013 who represent the cream of Italy's earthquake experts \u2013 formed part of the seismic activity committee, known as the Major Risks Commission, in 2009. They were summoned six days before the 6 April quake by Italy's civil protection agency to consider a series of tremors in the L'Aquila area.</p> <p>Prosecutors alleged they gave \"incomplete, imprecise and contradictory\" information on the dangers locals faced.</p> <p>One of those convicted, the former deputy civil protection chief Bernardo De Bernardinis, who organised the meeting, told journalists scientists had told him \"the situation was favourable\".</p> <p>He was also quoted as advising locals, before the meeting, to relax with a glass of good red wine. \"That's just not true,\" he said on Tuesday. \"A journalist asked me if he should have a glass of wine while awaiting the end of the meeting and I agreed.\"</p> <p>Lawyers now await the judge's explanation of the sentencing \u2013 expected in 90 days \u2013 to find out if the group were convicted for actively playing down the risk that a quake was on the way.</p> <p>The local official Stefania Pezzopane, who backed the verdict, claimed that the experts had been called in by the civil protection agency specifically to reassure people. Scientists, she said, \"should be scientists and not buffoons\".</p> <p>\"They reassured us and then we died in our homes,\" said a resident, Domenico Di Giamberardino.</p> <p>But Eva insisted neither he nor his colleagues had given any reassurances in their brief, 40-minute meeting. \"We always maintained it was not possible to predict or exclude an earthquake,\" he said.</p> <p>With two appeals permitted under Italian law, the scientists will not be going to jail immediately, but Eva said his morale was devastated by the verdict. \"I do not feel guilty from a scientific point of view,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In court the prosecutor referred to the failure in predicting hurricane Katrina, but it is a lot easier to predict a hurricane than an earthquake,\" he said.</p> <p>L'Aquila, which still lies in ruins, was also damaged by earthquakes in 1349, 1461 and 1703. \"An earthquake is like an assassin that returns to the scene of a crime after centuries,\" said Eva, \"but you can never tell when.\"</p>",

Our colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking to a Sunni resident of Mezzeh district who gave her name as Yasmin Hamdi.</p> <p>Two of her brothers were kidnapped by rebel fighters, she said. One was brutally killed and the family sold their house to pay a ransom for the other.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I cannot say that things in Damascus are rosy. There are problems for sure and things are not like before but the situation now is much better. I feel so glad and comfortable when I see the Syrian army around. This is the feeling of most of the people, including the opposition.</p> <p>I walk from where I live in Mezzeh district to my work in Kfar Sousa. It is about 5km \u2013 I do it for exercise. We used to stay out till three in the morning but now we cannot do that for security reasons.</p> <p>My brother, who was 21 and a student at the political studies college, was kidnapped at one of the checkpoints set up [by rebel fighters] near his college a few months ago.</p> <p>We were not sure who they [the kidnappers] were and kept asking about him everywhere. Then the kidnappers contacted us asking for a ransom, but we were late in paying as we were shocked and suspicious. After a while, the kidnappers contacted us and said: \"You can get your man at the graveyard.\"</p> <p>My father and other members of the family went to the graveyard. They found my brother's body in many pieces. He was tortured badly. We asked the help of the security forces and they told us later that the militants who kidnapped my brother were Ahfad al-Rasoul brigade. It is a Salafi brigade and they killed him because they regard any student in the political studies college as pro-regime.</p> <p>We were just trying to adjust ourselves to the reality that we had lost a member of our family when my other brother, who works at the Political Security, was also kidnapped and we had to pay five million Syrian pounds [$71,500] to get him back. My father had to sell the house to get the money.</p> <p>My brother said that he was kept blindfolded for more than 10 hours for interrogation and he could hear the accent of men who could hardly speak Arabic. They were asking him to memorise the Holy Qur'an. They used to put a knife under his chin as they were interrogating him.</p> <p>We cannot deny that there are wrong practices by some members of the army but you cannot say that they arrest women and children and kill them.</p> <p>I know a friend who lives in Darayya. He said all the people you saw in the videos who were killed in Darayya were not killed by the Syrian army but by the FSA. When the FSA recognised that they were losing, they gathered the people there, shot them and filmed them afterwards to say that there was a massacre.</p> <p>Yes, when the planes fire shells they do not differentiate whether the target is FSA or civilian and can kill civilians. But the Syrian army do not kill people at random as the FSA claim.</p> <p>I live in a place where you can find different sects of Syrian people, but we never feel that there is a sectarian division between us as the opposition is trying to show to the outside world.</p> <p>Now, it has become a crime if you work for the government, but how can you live? This is the only secure source of money for the people. Before, we used to have tourism and agriculture, now nothing. So it is good that the government is still paying us.</p> <p>There is a big exaggeration about what is happening in Syria and I believe the Syrian people will overcome this crisis and will be able to have shisha again in Jebel Qassioun.</p> <p>Most of the schools are open in Damascus except a few at the outskirts but families are afraid to send their kids to school for fear of kidnapping. Today the universities started here \u2013 come and see the heavy traffic near the College of Law, it's unbelievable. Also Damascus is busy now as people are shopping for Eid.</p> <p>I know districts where people started to kick out FSA men and accuse them of all the problems. They do not have any place in Damascus any more.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T16:39:28.998Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086b53258f96784ee2909f2\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:19:41.274Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Smoke coming from military HQ</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Residents of Muadamiyeh confirm that something has happened in the headquarters of the Syrian regime's 4th Brigade, but they are unsure what it was.</p> <p>Our colleague Mona Mahmood has spoken to Suha Salih, an activist in the area.

I tried to relay the voices of activists on the ground and he immediately dismissed me, and in fact lost his temper with me. He did not want to hear bad news from activists on the ground. I felt that as an allegedly neutral party, and one who should be a negotiator, he had an obligation to listen to what the people on the streets are saying, and he flatly refused.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she ruled out future negotiations with Brahimi, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we should always pursue discussions and dialogue, but it has to lead to concrete results. We can\u2019t come out with soft plans that do not address the fact that there is something approaching genocide taking place in Syria. We cannot discuss in diplomatic or political terms any sort of a solution that does not include the removal of Bashar al-Assad and his regime apparatus.</p> </blockquote> <p>She roundly rejected Brahimi\u2019s idea of a truce over the Eid al-Adha holiday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Brahimi ceasefire proposal is really dead on arrival. To us it is nothing more than version three of the Annan plan. It is a sign that the United Nations wants to beat its head against the wall again and again and expect a different outcome. Assad has demonstrated through the Kofi Annan plan, and before that the Arab League initiative, that he has no intention of pulling back tanks, or allowing unfettered access to media, or allowing peaceful protests to continue.</p> <p>A call for a ceasefire now that has no teeth, no consequences, and no real timetable is just a waste of time. Brahimi has requested a ceasefire during the Eid holidays. That implies that it is OK to kill up until the holidays begin, and it implies that post holidays there is no restriction on killing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jouejati said last night\u2019s US presidential debate suggested there was unlikely to be any increase in US support for rebel groups in Syria after the election.</p> <p>\u201cIf Romney were to be elected I would not expect air strikes against Syria. I believe it\u2019s just campaign rhetoric,\" she said.</p> <p>Asked about human rights abuses by rebel fighters,&#xa0;Jouejati said 40 rebel units had now signed up to human rights charter. But she added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After four decades of Assad rule, there is no such thing as human rights in Syria. The defected soldiers who belong to the Free Syrian Army have the same level of education as the regular regime soldiers. So it\u2019s a process of educating, dialogue and showing them that there is a way to win this and be better than the Assad regime ...</p> <p>If members of the Free Syrian Army are committing atrocities, of course they need to be held accountable. They need to be educated in terms of human rights. We are looking to transition into a state that respects human rights and international laws. So it begins with us.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the opposition Syrian National Council, of which the LCC is a member, was preparing to announce \u201cindications\u201d of a possible transitional government over the next few days.</p> <p>The LCC has withdrawn its threat to pull out of the SNC over frustrations with the organisation under former leader Burhan Ghalioun.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to contribute to all efforts to bring about democracy to Syria, so we recognise that the SNC is a major political player in the Syrian agenda. We were a bit distressed with some of the dysfunction of the SNC. So we are looking forward to a restructuring and perhaps the rendering of a more functional organisation that can lead the way to a transition in a post-Assad Syria.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1021494-brahimi-lost-temper-with-lcc-when-it-rejected-assad-talks-and-syria-ceasefire-says-rafifj/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1021494-brahimi-lost-temper-with-lcc-when-it-rejected-assad-talks-and-syria-ceasefire-says-rafifj&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Brahimi &amp;#x27;lost temper&amp;#x27; with LCC when it rejected Assad talks and #Syria ceasefire says @RafifJ&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:35:42.852Z\">at 4.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a3e5c0e343ef1abc7f53\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:04:21.371Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'100 arrested by Lebanese army'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese army has arrested more than 100 people in connection with recent clashes in Beirut and Tripoli, <a href=\"http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=450130\">Now Lebanon</a> reports citing a statement issued by the military today.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The army said that among the detained were 34 Syrian nationals and four Palestinian nationals, adding that 13 soldiers and two officers were injured during the raids to arrest the suspects.</p> <p>Also in the Beqaa, the army arrested five men for possessing and trafficking arms.</p> <p>The army added that it would continue conducting raids in both Beirut and Tripoli until calm was restored.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50869ea7c0e343ef1abc7f52\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:41:59.685Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Twenty dead' as Aleppo bakery is hit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least 20 people \u2013 including women and children \u2013 died today when shells fired by government forces hit a bakery in the Hananu district of Aleppo, Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-syria-crisis-bakery-idUSBRE89M0QD20121023\">reports</a> citing opposition activists.</p> <p>Majd Nour, an opposition campaigner in Aleppo, told Reuters&#xa0;Free Syrian Army fighters were guarding the bakery at the time:</p> <p>\"It was quiet all day and suddenly Assad's forces fired three shells.

The town of Amouda supported the revolution from the beginning.</p> <p>The concern now is that the Assad regime is using the PKK [the Kurdish Workers Party] to put pressure on Turkey. The regime has given the PKK the right to control the town and arm themselves. It has become an official ally of the regime.</p> <p>The Kurds are divided. Kurdish political parties want federalism and independence, while young Kurds here want a unified Syria.</p> <p>There is a high level of co-ordination between the regime and PKK. The military security compound used to be in the centre of the town, but it was moved to the outskirts and is now under the control of PKK.</p> <p>The PKK set up a so-called House of the People, and separate courts and security forces, as if the town were liberated. All the schools here have been teaching Arabic for 80 years. But this year, the PKK insisted on adding Kurdish lessons to the curriculum.</p> <p>Only a tiny minority of people support what the PKK is doing.</p> <p>The PKK are trying to impose their control on other neighbouring towns like in Malkiyia which is close to the Iraqi border. A charity society in the town was raided by PKK forces and sealed off under the pretext that it was receiving money from Turkey and Islamists.</p> <p>The PKK are also suspected of being involved in the assassinations of Kurdish activists and intellectuals who challenge them. For example, a month ago, Ra'as Bashou, an activist from Hassaka, fell out with PKK.

  "<p>Airlines face payouts of millions of pounds to passengers after a European court upheld a ruling that compensation should be paid for flight delays as well as cancellations.</p> <p>The EU's court of justice ruled that passengers whose flights arrive more than three hours late are entitled to compensation of up to \u20ac600 (\u00a3488) each unless the delay is due to extraordinary circumstances outside the airline's control, such as strikes or bad weather.</p> <p>In confirming its interpretation of EU law, the court reiterated that passengers delayed could suffer similar inconvenience to those on cancelled flights and therefore should be similarly recompensed.</p> <p>The judgment resolves a grey area in regulation and potentially opens up airlines to millions of pounds in claims, including many put on hold pending the European ruling.</p> <p>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the verdict provided \"much needed clarity\".</p> <p>Iain Osborne, CAA director of regulatory policy, said: \"Every year around 200 million passengers travel on 2m flights to and from the UK, with the vast majority experiencing no problems. However, when something does go wrong, there are regulations in place to protect travellers, and the CAA is ready to ensure companies abide by them.\"</p> <p>The CAA can help passengers bringing complaints against airlines or airports, although it stressed that passengers should first contact airlines to give them an opportunity to consider their claim before getting the authority involved.</p> <p>The EU is separately reviewing its regulations on what assistance and compensation should be provided.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://flight-delayed.co.uk/\" title=\"\">flight-delayed.co.uk</a>, a website that specialises in helping passengers seek compensation, the hassleof making claims \"probably will not change even after the verdict\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for easyJet, which has challenged the CAA's interpretation of due compensation, said the airline was disappointed by the outcome but also welcomed the clarity.</p> <p>Airline sources said that while the cumulative bill would be sizeable, the majority of delays \u2013 such as those due to fog which disrupted dozens of flights at Heathrow and elsewhere on Monday and Tuesday this week \u2013 would not lead to airlines being liable for compensation. Constraints on crew working hours and the nature of short-haul scheduled services mean many flights are in any case cancelled when delays loom.</p> <p>However, long-haul and charter flight customers on holiday packages, whose economics dictate that planes would fly even with long delays, are most likely to benefit from the additional rights. Passengers will still have to pursue claims individually.</p>",

In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/jan/13/channel4.broadcasting\">an interview in the Guardian in 2006</a>, he explained: \"I'm proud of the fact that I've revved up the board,\" at Channel 4. \"The quality of debate and vigour with which we call the executives to account is far greater than it used to be.\"</p> <p>Johnson says that people treat the NHS \"like a religion\"; journalists wanting stories, efficiency savings, an older population with more complex problems and a complaining society mean that \"these are tough times\" for that religion.</p> <p>\"You need to make sure that your board is brave enough\" despite this, Johnson explains. He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is the temptation to play it safe, which means no one gets sacked and no one gets chased by the media. But speaking as someone who has been sacked and chased by the media, it's not as bad as it sounds. If you're not innovating then you're going backwards. If someone is watching their personal reputation then they will surely discourage everyone in a board from being dynamic. Cowardly stuff will not do in the public service. The single overwhelming code for every public sector worker is to leave the place they join in a better position than they found it.

But it's really just less bad, rather than good.</p> <p>The European commission said confidence edged up from -25.9 points in September to -25.6 this month. That's the eurozone figure. In the wider European Union confidence fell from -24 to -24.2. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>October\u2019s marginal rise in consumer confidence followed a marked overall decline through the previous four months and sentiment is still at its second lowest level since May 2009. Furthermore, it follows on from other latest surveys showing drops in business confidence in October in both France and Belgium.</p> <p>The likelihood is therefore that Eurozone consumers will remain extremely careful in their spending in the fourth quarter, and the suspicion is that the single currency area will struggle markedly to avoid further GDP contraction. This would highly likely be a third successive GDP decline as we estimate that GDP fell by around 0.2%-0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter after a drop of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.</p> <p>Certainly, the economic fundamentals currently make up a largely unhealthy cocktail for consumer spending across the eurozone - high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tightening fiscal policy in many countries. Furthermore, Eurozone consumer price inflation moved back up to 2.6% in September and August from 2.4% in July, thereby adding to the squeeze on their purchasing power. On top of this, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis likely remains a serious concern for many consumers.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:54:26.214Z\">at 4.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a28b58f96784ee2909e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:01:44.413Z\">3.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Latest from Greece</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As the Greek coalition government's meeting continues (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/23/eurozone-crisis-greek-cuts-spanish-bailout#block-50868cc3c0e343ef1abc7f3f\">see 13.25</a>), politicians have been discussing the need to agree the cuts demanded by the Troika (our Athens correspondent <strong>Helena Smith</strong> reports)</p> <p>Development minister <strong>Costis Hadjidakis</strong> set the scene for further painful austerity by predicting:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Winning] the next aid instalment is a national effort that we are doomed to win</p> </blockquote> <p>adding that \u201cLiquidity is key.\u201d</p> <p>But main opposition leader <strong>Alexis Tsipras</strong> said while Greece needed the money \u201cnot one euro will go to the real economy\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, he said, almost all of the \u20ac31.5bn instalment will go to banks which stand to be recapitalised to the tune of \u20ac25bn.</p> <p><em>And with that, my colleague Nick Fletcher will see you home.

  "<p>Saudi Arabia is the place where law firms have flocked over the years, eager to take advantage of the lucrative legal opportunities in the oil-rich kingdom. Most major international law firms have a presence and they are all merrily doing business somewhere their female lawyers would not be welcome.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia is introducing <a href=\"http://www.menafn.com/menafn/1093570461/Women-lawyers-to-be-allowed-Saudi-courts-next-month\" title=\"\">new laws allowing women to work in the legal profession</a> on an equal footing to their male peers. From early next month female lawyers will be able to secure licenses to practise law from the Ministry of Justice. They will be permitted to enter the courtroom and argue cases directly, have their own offices and, for the first time, represent male clients.</p> <p>It is a hugely important step along the long and bumpy road Saudi Arabia must travel if it is to achieve anything like gender equality. In theory, female lawyers will enjoy exactly the same professional rights as their male counterparts. In practice, however, it might not be so straightforward.</p> <p>Women will still need approval from their male guardian plus the requisite legal degree and three years' experience in a lawyer's office. Not easy in a strictly gender-segregated country where women are seen as belonging in the home. Around 60% of Saudi women now have university degrees, according to an Oxford Strategic Consulting study, yet they only make up <a href=\"http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/uploads/Womens_Employment_in_Saudi_Arabia.pdf\" title=\"\">15% of the workforce</a>.</p> <p>Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia remains the only country in the world where women are forbidden from driving. They are currently excluded from holding prominent political positions and will get the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15055066\" title=\"\">vote for the first time in 2015</a>. Women still cannot travel, open a bank account or access health care without male permission. And Saudi Arabia languishes in 131st place out of 135 countries in the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-2011/\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Gender Gap report</a>, and rock bottom among high-income countries.</p> <p>The international firms with Saudi offices are the very same that trumpet diversity credentials and produce slick pamphlets detailing commitments to closing the gender gap.</p> <p>Back in 2010 Freshfields was one of first firms to make diversity a buzzword, with an initiative aimed at increasing retention of female lawyers, earning it a <a href=\"http://www.rollonfriday.com/TheNews/EuropeNews/tabid/58/Id/1662/fromTab/36/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">lovely award from Glamour Magazine</a>. More recently it has been considering quotas to up the number of female partners. Yet since 2008 it has also boasted an associated office in Riyadh, where its only female legal consultant is barred from obtaining a license to practise until the law changes.</p> <p>And there are swathes of other firms in similar positions, enjoying close partnerships with Saudi firms, while making earnest commitments to diversity.</p> <p>According to Freshfields' Middle East and North Africa regional managing partner, Pervez Akhtar, diversity is a \"business imperative that we take very seriously\" and the firm has a \"number of initiatives in place to help women raise their profile and succeed\", including a recent decision to take on two female interns in Riyadh. But, he says, how the legal profession deals with the advancement of women \"needs to be tailored to the many different circumstances and jurisdictions in which our clients and global law firms operate.\"</p> <p>This seems reflected in the slow pace of efforts by international firms in Saudi Arabia to include women. Clifford Chance's Saudi partner firm, for example, has built a separate space for women in its Riyadh office. But as it is only for visiting female lawyers, and not for female recruits, it is hardly a great stride towards equality.</p> <p>Clearly law firms are not charities dedicated to women's rights. They are businesses and it would be na\u00efve to suggest that they should only work in countries with unimpeachable human rights records. Some might even suggest that they are pushing forward women's rights by just being there, but this too seems na\u00efve. How many law firms are piling into Chad or Yemen, countries with a similar disdain for equality?</p> <p>Despite recent progress, those firms with a longstanding presence in Saudi Arabia seem to have made a clear statement that access to riyals comes before concerns about doing business in a place which tramples over women's rights.</p> <p>That is their prerogative, but should we then take their commitments to diversity as much more than lip service?</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p>",

  "<p>The pickup halted in Kidal, the far-flung Malian desert town that is home to members of the Grammy award-winning band Tinariwen. Seven AK47-toting militiamen got out and marched to the family home of a local musician. He wasn't home, but the message delivered to his sister was chilling: \"If you speak to him, tell him that if he ever shows his face in this town again, we'll cut off all the fingers he uses to play his guitar with.\"</p> <p>The gang then removed guitars, amplifiers, speakers, microphones and a drum kit from the house, doused them with petrol, and set them ablaze. In northern Mali, religious war has been declared on music.</p> <p>When a rabble of different Islamist groups took control of the region in April there were fears that its rich culture would suffer. But no one imagined that music would almost cease to exist \u2013 not in Mali, a country that has become internationally renowned for its sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262203\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351060787835/Toumani-Diabat--Malian-ko-007.jpg\" alt=\"Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Malian kora player in Bamako\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Malian kora player, in Bamako.

There isn't a single major music prize in the world today that hasn't been won by a Malian artist.\"</p> <p>\"Music regulates the life of every Malian,\" adds Cheich Tidiane Seck, a prolific Malian musician and producer. \"From the cradle to the grave. From ancient times right up to today. A Mali without music? No \u2026 I mean \u2026 give me another one!\"</p> <p>And yet that is the bland reality dawning on this once joy-filled land. International observers claim the leaders of the three armed Islamic groups who now control the northern Malian cities of Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao are motivated by money and power rather the dream of a caliphate in the Sahel. There are strong ties between these groups and the less than holy interests of major drug-traffickers and arms smugglers.</p> <p>But many of the mujahideen who have zoned in on the conflict from all over the Muslim world are fired by an unquestionable religious zeal. The same goes for Iyad Ag Ghaly, a Touareg strongman and born-again Salafist, who founded the Ansar-ud-Deen movement at the end of last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"He believes in what he's doing,\" says Manny Ansar, director of the Festival in the Desert that has been taking place every January in and around Timbuktu and Kidal since 2001. \"And that's what frightens me. I'm not convinced that he wants to kill everyone who is not a Muslim, like the people in al-Qaida do, but I've seen him giving up the fruits of this life for God.\"</p> <p>Back in the 1990s, before he succumbed to the preaching of the Pakistani proselytising movement Tablighi Jamaat, Ghaly liked to smoke cigarettes and hang out with musicians from <a href=\"http://youtu.be/N2B8wIOIeO8\">Tinariwen</a>. He even composed songs and poems of love, rebellion and the beauty of his desert home. Now music, and with it a major source of communal cohesion and well being, has either disappeared or gone underground throughout the territory under his control.</p> <p>An official decree banning all western music was issued on 22 August by a heavily bearded Islamist spokesman in the city of Gao. \"We don't want the music of Satan. Qur'anic verses must take its place. Sharia demands it,\" the decree says.</p> <p>The ban comes in the context of a horrifically literal and gratuitous application of Sharia law in all aspects of daily life. Militiamen are cutting off the hands and feet of thieves or stoning adulterers. Smokers, alcohol drinkers and women who are not properly attired are being publicly whipped. As one well-known Touareg musician from Kidal says: \"There's a lack of joy. No one is dancing. There are no parties. Everybody's under this kind of spell. It's strange.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262204\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351060966001/Tinariwen-performing-at-t-009.jpg\" alt=\"Tinariwen performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinariwen, seen here performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa.

But the menace of al-Qaida started to have an effect on us in 2007. That's when al-Qaida people started to appear in the desert. They came to the nomad camps near Essakane [the beautiful dunes to the west of Timbuktu where the Festival in the Desert used to be held] and at first they were pleasant and said, 'Don't worry, we're Muslims like you.' Then they began to say, 'We have a common enemy, which is the west.' That's when I understood that things were going to get difficult.\"</p> <h2>The Kel Ansar<br></h2> <p>Remarkably, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) never targeted the festival or any of the thousands of westerners who braved the journey to attend it. According to Ansar, some people put this down to the fact that his tribe, the Kel Ansar, are said to be descended directly from Muhammad and are highly revered. \"Others even thought that we cast spells to block their route,\" he says with a wry laugh. In truth, Aqim knew that if they wanted to keep the locals sweet and compliant, they were well advised not to mess with the Kel Ansar.</p> <p>Not all music events were so blessed. Returning from the Tamadacht festival near the eastern town of Anderamboukane in January 2009, a British tourist, Edwin Dyer, was kidnapped and sold to Aqim, who beheaded him four months later because the UK government refused to pay a ransom. It forced the Festival in the Desert to move into the safe confines of Timbuktu city limits in 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351061177889/U2-singer-Bono-attends-Ma-005.jpg\" alt=\"U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu.

The event was attended by Tinariwen, a host of other Touareg and Malian musicians and Bono.</p> <p>\"I was impressed by Bono's courage and that of his team,\" Manny says. \"He asked the soldiers who were assigned to protect him to leave him be and let him roam around the town freely or go and drink tea out on the dunes. But I wondered if I wasn't a bit mad myself to let him do that. I mean, Bono, kidnapped! Imagine that.\" La Maison, the hotel in Timbuktu where Bono and his entourage stayed, is now the headquarters of the city's Islamic tribunal.</p> <p>Manny felt like giving up when the rebellion erupted a few days after the end of the festival. But after talking to many musicians, as well as friends and international backers, he decided to organise a Caravan of Peace and Unity that will tour west Africa and visit refugee camps in February next year. He will also be promoting the Festival in the Desert in Exile in Europe, the Middle East, the US and elsewhere. \"It's my way of fighting back,\" he says. \"Before our music was heard in Essakane. Now it'll be heard in all the big festivals in the world. So it's the opposite of what the Islamists want. It's our victory and their defeat.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, almost all the musicians in the north have fled the country like more than 500,000 of their fellow Malians, most of whom languish in refugee camps in Algeria, Mauritania, Niger or Burkina Faso. It is the biggest humanitarian crisis the Sahel has ever known. \"There's no music up there any more,\" says Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9, son of the king of the West African blues, the late Ali Farka Tour\u00e9. \"You can't switch on a radio or a TV, even at home.\"</p> <p>The town of Niafunk\u00e9 just south west of Timbuktu, where Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 was mayor for many years, is now under Islamist control. \"I know that if Ali were to awake from his tomb today,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/7UGaGY9ulP0\">Afel Bocoum</a>, Tour\u00e9's former sidekick and Albarn's partner on the 2002 Mali Music project, \"he would just go straight back into it. He would die twice.\" Both Bocoum and Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 have fled south to the safety of the Malian capital, Bamako, with their families.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But down south, music is also in crisis, for related reasons. The military coup that toppled President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 on 23&#xa0;March and kissed goodbye to one of Africa's most lauded democracies has left the capital, Bamako, fearful and economically depressed. \"People just aren't used to meeting soldiers in the street, so they tend to stay at home,\" says Adam Thiam, one of Mali's leading journalists.</p> <p>Many live music venues in Bamako, such as Le Diplomat, where Diabat\u00e9 and his Symmetric Orchestra used to play every weekend, have closed. The same goes for hotels and restaurants, starved of their once plentiful foreign tourist clientele. Nightclubs and weddings are still thriving but the trend is to save money by hiring sound systems and DJs rather than live musicians. \"People use what they earn to feed themselves, not to have fun,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9rDQYImnzwU\">Bassekou Kouyate</a>.</p> <p>But in west Africa, when the going gets tough, the rappers get going. Like Y'en A Marre, a collective that ignited nationwide debate during Senegal's election crisis last year, rappers in Mali have stepped up to denounce political skulduggery, Islamism and military rule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351062118292/Malian-singer-Rokia-Traor-006.jpg\" alt=\"Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9.

We don't need them to teach us how to be Muslims. We're a secular tolerant country, where everyone declares their religion according to their feeling. And in any case, they know that a Mali without music is an impossibility.\"</p> <p>Amkoullel set up his own pressure group of rappers, activists and friends called Plus Jamais \u00c7a (Never Again). So far he has released a couple of videos, including one called SOS, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMJWoDeBRcg\" title=\"\">which has become a YouTube hit</a>. It has also been censored by the state broadcaster ORTM, which is still under the heavy hand of the military.</p> <p>\"We had this feeling that a heavy blow had been dealt to democracy,\" Amkoullel says of the 23 March putsch. \"And it had been done in a period of popular disillusion. It's as if in the collective consciousness, democracy was a failure in Mali.\" Like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/De8vJbYIWjA\">Les Sofas de la Republique</a>, the other rap collective raising the standard in rhyme for unity, democracy, peace and good governance, Amkoullel and his team have been organising demonstrations, debates and gigs. He has also received three death threats.</p> <p>\"I knew that our phones were being bugged,\" he says. \"Then I got this call that was like, 'Yeah \u2026 we're watching you, so you'd better calm down or take the consequences.' The second message wasn't from the same person. 'You're talking too much,' they said. 'Shut up or you'll disappear and won't understand a thing.' That was much clearer!\"</p> <p>And yet, despite the twin-pronged threat to the culture they have made world famous, all the musicians of Mali agree it remains at the core of their identity. \"I'm a Muslim, but Sharia isn't my thing,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3DydY8bHTyg\">Rokia Traor\u00e9</a>, one of Mali's most famous international stars. \"If I couldn't go up on stage anymore, I would cease to exist. And without music, Mali will cease to exist.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>What got you started?</strong></p> <p>[The director] Brian Astbury made me do it. He ran Arts Threshold, a basement fringe theatre in Paddington.

  "<p>MPs have finally recognised what has been blatantly obvious for a long time: human rights and arms exports do not go well together.</p> <p>This conflict always made a nonsense of the Labour government's call for an \"ethical dimension\" in foreign policy though the late Robin Cook did his best to try and reconcile Britain's role as one of the biggest sellers of weapons with its stated aim of protecting human rights around the world.</p> <p>Now, the House of Commons foreign affairs <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/foreign-affairs-committee/news/human-rights-substantive/\">committee</a> has called on ministers to be \"bolder in acknowledging contradictions between the UK's interests overseas and its human rights values\".</p> <p>The government should not be trying to assert that the two can co-exist freely, said the crossparty committee of MPs. It should instead explain publicly its judgments \"on how to balance them in particular cases\".</p> <p>The MPs pointed out that the Foreign Office human rights reports name Saudi Arabia a \"country of concern\" adding that there have been \"incremental improvements\" in the country's human rights (albeit, as the MPs observe,\"from a very low base\".)</p> <p>Yet the FO does not include Bahrain as a \"country of concern\" despite the fact that significant number of people were killed there in 2011 in the violent repression of demonstrations which included widespread use of torture.</p> <p>And despite being designated as a \"country of concern\", Saudi Arabia is described by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), as being a priority market for UK arms exports.</p> <p>The value of arms-related goods for which licences for export to Saudi Arabia were granted in 2011 was \u00a31.7bn, greater than the value of comparable licences for export to any other single country, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT).</p> <p>BAE, Britain's biggest manufacturing company in terms of number of employees reeling from the failed merger with EADS, Europe's biggest arms company, is currently trying to negotiate a \u00a37bm arms deal involving the sale and maintenance of 48 Eurofighter/Typhoon jets to Saudi Arabia, for long one of the most lucrative markets for British arms.</p> <p>The latest official figures show that Whitehall approved a further \u00a38m military exports to Saudi Arabia in the second quarter (April to June) this year. It sold nearly \u00a33m to Bahrain over the period.</p> <p>It included some assault rifles and pistols. A footnote on the list now on the BIS website, states: \"HMG exceptionally agreed to a number of firearms and associated accessories to Bahrain for personal sporting use. They are not for use by the Bahraini security services, law enforcement agencies, or armed forces.\"</p> <p>The government at least seems to be sufficiently \"concerned\" to negotiate conditions on the sale of arms to Bahrain. Indeed, so sensitive is it that when it signed a defence cooperation agreement with Bahrain earlier this month it did so with the absolute minimum of publicity. What publicity there was came from the Bahraini side with the Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, hailing it as \"mirroring deep-rooted historic relations bonding Bahrain and the UK\".</p> <p>With friends like that...</p>",

I am proud of having gone through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged, falsely convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind, becoming irrational, ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and smashing your face in.\"</p> <p>When a slightly flummoxed Paxman interjected: \"Well, you go ahead\", Black replied: \"No, I don't believe in violence.\"</p> <p>Earlier he told Paxman: \"I've been persecuted half to death. I don't have any shame. I am proud of what happened. I am proud of being in a US federal prison and surviving it.\"</p> <p>Throughout his Sky News and Newsnight appearances, Black's line of defence is that he was a victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>\"Everything I did was legal, I didn't misunderstand [the law]. It as a smear job from A to Z because 99.95% of prosecutions are convicted, the whole [US legal] system is a fraudulent fascistic conveyor belt of corrupt prison system,\" he told Newsnight.</p> <p>When Paxman reminded him he was nonetheless a convicted criminal, Black turned to him: \"You're a fool, you're just a gullible fool; a priggish, gullible British fool, who takes seriously this ghastly American justice system that any sane British person knows is an outrage.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, he popped up for his second round on Sky News's Boulton &amp; Co. \"Stop being a jackass, you're just being abrasive,\" he chided menacingly when Boulton asked him where he was going to live when his native Canada, where he is on a one-year temporary visa, turfed him out. \"I am not a refugee.\"</p> <p>\"Let me tell you something,\" he chided, before stopping to ask Boulton \"What's your name again?\"</p> <p>Later when asked why he had agreed to appear on BBC2's Have I Got News for You to be mocked, he said: \"I am here to sell books; I am not here to enjoy your somewhat predictable questions.\"</p> <p>He branded Boulton's employer, Rupert Murdoch, \"a sleaze-mongerer\" and insisted he wasn't a criminal because the US legal system had no \"validity\".</p> <p>In 2007 Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders of $6.1m (\u00a33.8m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper assets without the approval of the company's board. He had been forced out of the company by shareholders in 2003.</p> <p>Black was released on bail after serving two-and-a-half years while his case was under an appeal, which resulted in two of his three fraud convictions being quashed. His original 78-month sentence was reduced to three years.</p> <p>He returned to jail last September to serve another 13 months and with time off for good behaviour he has completed his sentence.</p> <p>It is clear he does not see this as a bar to returning to public life in the UK, or resuming his seat in the House of Lords. He compared his plight to that of Nelson Mandela when he was released from Robben Island.</p> <p>\"First of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting [in the Lords],\" Black said on Newsnight. He told Boulton that he would \"presumably\" return to the upper house but hadn't decided yet.</p> <p>When Paxman moved to the subject of the extravagance of his wife Barbara Amiel, he feigned biliousness: \"Oh, God, I'm going to throw up.</p> <p>\"My first morning back in Britain and am I to be subjected to this? She wasn't extravagant. She's a magnificent wife \u2013 she visited me every week in prison, even when she had to come back from China to do it.\"</p> <p>Tom Bower, author of a book about Black, told Newsnight: \"What is so comical about Conrad Black is when he was in London he was always saying how genius capitalism is, but when shareholders said that he was stealing money in 2001, he said he was the victim.</p> <p>Five years ago he was convicted of defrauding the company he ran, Hollinger. He still claims to be innocent of all crimes. In the end Conrad Black believes he is god and everyone must bow to him.\"</p> <p>\"The one thing you can't say is he is a coward, he comes back again and again to suppress his critics.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

And for once you can hear it: her songs are quirky and rarely go where you imagine, with delightfully unexpected arrangements (her own) that put them more in a baroque pop than a retro-soul category. Ironically, Mvula's voice is the least interesting thing about them. It's impressive, strong, rich, resonant and all the other things you'd want from a post-Winehouse voice, but what's particularly striking is the presentation of it in the context of those subtly orchestrated arrangements.

The track itself opens with delicate chimes before strings and a switch of metre, to a martial pace, completely change the mood of the song, but by the end there is a return to the winsome motif, a circular construction that confirms that, yes, Mvula actually studied this stuff. Songs from a forthcoming four-track EP are also excellent, with shifts of rhythm and vocal clusters that do more than merely make the voice the focus.

  "<p>Mitt Romney used Monday night's debate to try and paint Barack Obama's foreign policy as weak, indecisive and dangerous for America on everything from confronting al-Qaida and Iran's nuclear weapons programme to Russian obstinacy.</p> <p>But on the detail, the Republican candidate frequently found himself in agreement with Obama as Romney tried not to scare voters weary of protracted and unnecessary wars, and confused and unsettled about events in the Middle East.</p> <p>On the big issues, Romney was often unable to draw a significant difference in how he would handle things as president. Take Iran. Romney has frequently accused Obama of being too slow and weak in applying pressure on Tehran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>But in the debate, the Republican candidate was forced to concede that he would pursue much the same policy as the president \u2013 ever stronger sanctions in tandem with diplomacy \u2013 and that military action is a very last resort. </p> <p>Obama pounced.</p> <p>\"I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking. You know, there have been times governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that would make a difference,\" he said.</p> <p>It was much the same on Syria. Romney has attacked Obama for not arming the rebels trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad, and for not intervening more after 30,000 deaths.</p> <p>The president \u2013 with one eye on Libya, and the flood of guns to Islamist rebels in Mali \u2013 said he is hesitant to send heavy weapons to Syrian insurgents about which little is known and with no control over where they might end up.</p> <p>\"What we can't do is suggest that giving heavy weapons to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that will make us safer in the long run,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney conceded the point.</p> <p>\"We do need to make sure that the arms do not get in the wrong hands,\" he said.</p> <p>He also agreed with Obama that he does not want to see the US military \"involved in Syria\".</p> <p>Romney went on to back the president on drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere, an increasingly used military strategy that has drawn criticism in part over the large numbers of innocent civilians killed which in turn may be a spur to terrorism.</p> <p>\"I believe we should use any and all means necessary,\" Romney said. \"I support that entirely and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy.\"</p> <p>Obama gave little ground. When Romney praised the president for the killing of Osama bin Laden, the president turned it on him.</p> <p>\"I'm glad that you recognise that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia not al-Qaida,\" he said. \"You said Russia, in the 1980s. They're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the cold war's been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>Obama also highlighted Romney's shifting positions on Iraq and Afghanistan. Romney said he wanted to avoid similar wars in the future. The president used the opportunity to highlight that the Republican supported the invasion in 2003, and that he does not have the experience to have thought through many of his positions which were \"all over the map\".</p> <p>\"You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now,\" Obama said. \"I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.</p> <p>\"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.\"</p> <p>Romney found it difficult to shake off Obama's accusation of inconsistency while trying not to sound belligerent.</p> <p>Even on Israel, where the Republican candidate failed to land a punch. Romney repeated a a common maxim on the right that Obama has soured relations with the US's most important ally in the Middle East.</p> <p>But Israeli officials have said that whatever the differences on Iran and the Palestinians, the present White House has been unstinting in military and security assistance. Obama picked up the point, referring to \"unprecedented military and intelligence co-operation, including dealing with the Iranian threat\".</p> <p>Romney let it go.</p>",
  "<p>Walter Harrison, the long-serving Wakefield MP, who has died aged 91, established an unequalled record in his 13 years as Labour's deputy chief whip, from 1970 until 1983. In particular, he kept in power the minority 1976 Callaghan government for two and a half years rather than the few months it might have expected.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\" title=\"\">James Callaghan</a> confirmed the debt he owed Harrison by inscribing a copy of his memoirs to \"Walter, who made it all possible\" and in 1977 elevating him to the privy council. Harrison's achievement was to mount a fierce campaign to keep Labour in power and Margaret Thatcher out, establishing a one-man intelligence system and exploiting with minimum scruple every weakness of his opponents.</p> <p>There had been no advance indication when Harrison reached Westminster as Labour's new MP for Wakefield in 1964 that he was other than a run-of-the-mill loyalist sponsored by the electricians' union. He was distinctive only for his rolling gait, friendly grin and his frisky attitude in Annie's Bar, where he declared that he would never mix London tap water with his spirits.</p> <p>He was born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the 10th child of Henry Harrison, an electrician with the Yorkshire Electric Power Company and a Labour councillor, and his wife, Ada. After Dewsbury and Castleford technical colleges, and an apprenticeship in the company where his father worked, he did his four-year wartime stint as an RAF electrician, serving in 20 countries.</p> <p>Released early because of his civilian skills, he went back to Yorkshire Electric, before switching to Richard Costain's as a site electrician and then as a welfare and personnel officer. This involved a wandering life to which his new wife, Enid, whom he married in 1948, objected. He returned to the Yorkshire Electricity Board, becoming active in the Electrical Trades Union (<a href=\"http://www.etuvic.com.au/\" title=\"\">ETU</a>).</p> <p>The backing of a union was crucial for his political ambitions. He started in 1952 as a councillor in Castleford, becoming a West Riding county councillor in 1958. He went on to the Yorkshire regional executive of the Labour party. A parliamentary seat seemed to elude him, though, as he missed out on Kingston upon Hull West, Newark, Ilkeston and Rotherham. He was finally belatedly adopted for Wakefield and elected in 1964.</p> <p>He made a cautious start in the Commons, but after the 1966 election was named an assistant whip in charge of pairing. He became a full whip in 1968. Some thought Harrison's career might be cut short when Harold Wilson dropped his soft-left chief whip, John Silkin, for a rightwinger, Bob Mellish. But both Mellish and Harrison were trade union loyalists, united in their opposition to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Barbara Castle</a>'s union-curbing In Place of Strife legislation.</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/18/guardianobituaries.conservatives\" title=\"\">Edward Heath</a> won the 1970 election, Mellish made Harrison deputy chief whip. Harrison showed his toughness in 1971 when he could be seen tongue-lashing and finger-jabbing the Tory chief whip, gentlemanly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/07/3\" title=\"\">Francis Pym</a>, for five minutes for \"guillotining\" the Tories' industrial relations bill without having discussed this through the \"usual channels\".</p> <p>Mellish and Harrison worked harmoniously until Heath began his 1971-72 push for Britain to join the EEC. As a pro-Marketeer, Mellish seemed to run a different intelligence network in the whip's office from anti-Marketeer Harrison. In the end the unexpectedly large vote for entering the EEC was a bigger shock for Harrison.</p> <p>Harrison's Machiavellian side was restricted to Westminster and unknown in his constituency. There he was a genial Yorkshireman with a genius for organising publicity for the party.</p> <p>When Wilson unexpectedly resigned in 1976, Harrison backed his fellow Yorkshireman Denis Healey for the succession. But when Callaghan won, Harrison devoted himself to his survival. His obsession with keeping Thatcher out of power was such that he frequently sailed close to the wind. He once threatened a police sergeant that he would be directing traffic on the North Circular unless he released Ian Mikardo, needed for a close vote. In January 1978 he was involved in an incident in the voting lobby while trying to prevent a government defeat on Scottish devolution. But despite his efforts, the Callaghan government collapsed after a vote of confidence was lost 311 to 310 in March 1979.</p> <p>By the 1983 election, Harrison's majority in Wakefield was reduced to 360. He declined to stand again as deputy chief whip. But although he no longer had the job, it was difficult for him to shake his long-fixed habits; he still padded around the Commons corridors as if hunting for errant Labour MPs. He stood down in 1987, after 23 years, partly due to the poor health of his wife. After Enid's death in 1990, he married Jane Richards, long the popular secretary of the Labour whips' office. She died in 2000. Harrison is survived by his son and daughter.</p> <p><strong>Julia Langdon writes: </strong>It was a source of some surprise at Westminster that after his retirement as an MP, Walter Harrison was never offered a seat in the House of Lords. It was a position he had unquestionably earned, having made such a huge contribution to the survival of the Callaghan government and having clearly deserved such elevation rather more than many others among his less distinguished colleagues who were so preferred. It was a personal slight attributed to a longstanding disagreement with Neil Kinnock, who was Labour party leader at the time, and one which was bitterly resented on Harrison's behalf by his many friends.</p> <p>Despite the tough dealings in which he engaged as the deputy chief whip during those immensely difficult years in which he helped keep Labour in office, there was a considerable nobility to Harrison's personal role. It has only recently been revealed that in order to try to spare the dying Labour MP Sir Alfred Broughton from being brought into the Commons for the vote of confidence which precipitated the 1979 general election, Harrison approached his opposite number in the Conservative whips' office, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/may/08/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Bernard \"Jack\" Weatherill</a>. He asked the Tory deputy chief whip to observe the convention under which a member of the other party would abstain to match the absence of a sick MP.</p> <p>According to a new play, <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/this-house\" title=\"\">This House</a> by James Graham, currently being staged at the National Theatre, Weatherill asserted that the convention was not applicable in such a critical vote and no Tory MP could possibly agree to abstain; he then offered to do so himself out of his own sense of honour. Harrison, motivated by a similar decency, recognised that such a gesture would certainly affect Weatherill's future career and refused to accept the offer.</p> <p>Broughton was not obliged to attend the vote and the government lost by one vote. Broughton died five days later and Weatherill was subsequently elected Speaker of the Commons, despite the opposition of the new prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to his candidacy. Harrison always treasured a letter from a defeated but unresentful Callaghan assuring him that he had done the right thing in deciding not to bring Broughton to Westminster for the vote.</p> <p>\u2022 Walter Harrison, politician, born 2 January 1921; died 19 October 2012</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Roth died in 2010</p>",

It's disgusting. They've put us through all this, promised they're going to sort out the problem and then at the last minute they give up.\"</p> <p>For once, people on both sides of the debate agreed. Whether they were for the badger cull or opposed to it, they tended to agree the policy had been badly botched. \"I can't believe that at the very last moment they've said it's not going ahead,\" said Wainwright, who farms in the planned cull area in Gloucestershire. \"It's a disgrace.\"</p> <p>Steve Jones, a farm manager in the Forest of Dean and a vocal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">critic of culling</a>, said he had thought the shooting would at least begin. \"I thought it would be derailed. But I thought the train would at least get out of the station,\" he said. \"This just goes to show how flawed the cull was. Public opinion is against it, science is against it, common sense is against it.\"</p> <p>Jones feels hugely sorry for the farmers who are having to cope with bovine TB but believes they need to do more \u2013 and be helped to do more \u2013 to improve animal husbandry and biosecurity on their farms. \"Dairy farmers have a really big problem. The price of milk is so low that these farms are becoming more and more impoverished. They can't afford to look after the animals in the way they need to be looked after,\" he said.</p> <p>Roger Yeates, a Forest of Dean farmer and Conservative councillor, said the planned cull had been badly handled. \"I didn't think shooting badgers was the way to go \u2013 that would mean killing the healthy ones that were running about; the infected ones tend to stay underground. I'm pleased it's off.\"</p> <p>The Forest of Dean district council had voted to ban badger culling on its land and was calling on all landowners within its boundary to do the same.</p> <p>Jackie Fraser, the Labour councillor who proposed the motion to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">ban culling</a>, gave a tentative welcome to the government's move \"I'm pleased but cautious. I hope the government is going to look seriously at other ways of tackling bovine TB, like vaccinating cattle and improving biosecurity.\"</p> <p>The campaign group <a href=\"http://glosagainstbadgershooting.webs.com/\" title=\"\">Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting</a> expressed delight. Liz Gaffer, a spokeswoman, admitted she had tears in her eyes when she heard. \"We are so, so pleased to hear this news. We hope the government will not just delay but will decide not to pursue a cull as the evidence is clear that culling badgers is not the most effective, efficient or humane way of reducing bovine TB.</p> <p>\"People in Gloucestershire have voiced their concern over the rationale behind it and the safety issues involved. We believe the government may have taken this on board and we will continue to campaign for a vaccination programme of cattle and badgers that we believe will really support farmers who are faced with this awful disease.\"</p> <p>For now, the saboteurs, who had been ready to get out into the cull zones wearing in high-visibility jackets and carrying horns and rape alarms, can stand down.</p> <p>Over the last few months experienced saboteurs have been joined by many newcomers to the animal rights scene, keen to map setts and disrupt the cull.</p> <p>Kayleigh, an activist who took the Guardian out on a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/19/badger-activists-setts-fightback-cull\" title=\"\">sett-mapping expedition</a>, spent the morning handing out leaflets outside a supermarket in Bristol to flag up the fact that it stocked milk from places where badgers were going to be culled.</p> <p>The plan was for a few drinks later to celebrate. \"It's fantastic news; it takes the pressure off us a bit and we can have a bit of a break but we'll continue to survey setts and continue to prepare. We'll also be making sure farmers don't start taking the law into their own hands.\"</p> <p>Jay Tiernan, a leader in the <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull organisation</a>, which champions direct action, said he would carry on fighting the cull until the government announced that it had been dropped permanently. \"There are a lot of new people who have come to the movement in the last few months. They won't be going anywhere and will be ready to get out there if needed.\"</p>",

The government has been twisting the evidence to fit their policy. We warned for two years that this cull was bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.\"</p> <p>Paterson and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) will have to overcome a series of major problems if the cull is to proceed next year. Scientific and public opinion are strongly against the cull, likely legal challenges remain and the cost and logistics of culling remain difficult.</p> <p>NFU president, Peter Kendall, said: \"For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today's decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do.\"</p> <p>The musician Brian May, whose successful e-petition won the first Commons debate scheduled for this Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/badger-reprieve-abandon-cull\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"This is by no means the end of the line. What we need is a complete abandonment.\" He pledged to work with farmers on a pilot vaccination scheme that \"could come in months, not years.\"</p> <p>Gavin Grant, the RSPCA's chief executive, said: \"Hopefully this marks the beginning of the end for these unscientific, foolish and cruel plans to cull badgers.</p> <p>\"This must not be a temporary reprieve, but must mark an end to all cull plans.\" The RSPB's conservation director, Martin Harper, said: \"Today's announcement suggests that farmers and badgers will be in exactly the same situation next summer.\"</p> <p>The cull delay follows a major U-turn in 2011 by the environment department on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\" title=\"\">the selling off of public forests</a>. It also follows a difficult week for the government with David Cameron being criticised over an apparently bungled announcement on energy bills and the resignation of chief whip Andrew Mitchell.</p> <p>Ministers and farmers have argued that a cull is essential to help stop the spread of TB, while opponents maintain that the main problem is transmission between cattle and warn that a badger cull could result in fleeing badgers spreading the disease more widely. Last year, 26,000 cattle were slaughtered and the disease cost taxpayers \u00a390m, including compensation to farmers.</p> <p>The planned cull had suffered a series of blows recently, including the discovery of up to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">twice as many badgers in the culling zones</a> than expected, driving up the cost and complexity of the cull. Whitehall sources said the department had been in \"panic\" and \"chaos\" over the problems. The cull also faced a legal challenge from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/21/badgers-bovine-tuberculosis\" title=\"\">Badger Trust</a> over costs and public safety around the unmarked cull zones.</p> <p>The government's claim to a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">\"science-led\" policy was derided by Lord John Krebs</a>, the architect of a landmark 10-year badger culling trial. He called it \"mindless\" and signed a letter with 31 other eminent scientists demanding the government reconsider its plan. But Paterson said: \"The decision we have taken wholly conforms to the science.\"</p> <p>Opponents argue vaccination and improved biosecurity are better ways of tackling TB. The coalition government cancelled five of its six badger vaccination trials, but work also continues with the Wildlife Trust and the National Trust. A cattle vaccine is in development, but would require changes to EU law to be used. Paterson said: \"Everyone would like to press a button labelled vaccine today, but sadly we don't have one.\"</p> <p>On Friday, ministers announced a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/19/cattle-movement-bovine-tb-testing?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">crackdown on biosecurity</a> measures to take effect from January. But Paterson said such measures could only go so far. \"They [the control measures announced last Friday] are significantly tougher than before but it gets to a point where it is very hard to run the business [ie in terms of cost and moving cattle around].\"</p> <p>A European commission inspection in September 2011 had revealed a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">catalogue of failures on English farms</a>. Mark Jones, a vet at Humane Society International, said: \"Paterson should use the next months to implement genuinely science-led measures including improved testing and compliance, better biosecurity and the development of vaccines for cattle and for badgers. It will be a tragedy if a supposedly protected wild mammal is sacrificed for the sake of political expedience.\"</p> <p>Joe Duckworth, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"At the moment, badgers are on death row for nine months. We need the government to change their policy.\"</p>",
  "<p>When private care group Castlebeck was sold for \u00a3255m in 2006, it was seen as the UK's leading provider of specialist health and rehabilitation services for adults with learning disabilities and complex needs. On 31 May last year a television <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222\" title=\"\">expos\u00e9</a> demolished the company's reputation and shredded its value.</p> <p>The BBC's Panorama uncovered a shockingly abusive regime at Winterbourne View, a Castlebeck \"assessment and treatment\" hospital near Bristol. The company was charging an average \u00a33,500 a week for each of up to 24 patients but providing an environment that, in the words of a subsequent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/07/winterbourne-view-abuse-report-failures\" title=\"\">serious case review</a>, \"raised the continuous possibility of harm and degradation\".</p> <p>Eleven former members of staff of Winterbourne View have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/06/winterbourne-view-abuse-staff-guilty?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">convicted</a> of criminal offences of abuse and are being sentenced this week. The unit has been closed, as have two others run by Castlebeck, but Panorama is preparing to broadcast another programme containing further revelations about the scandal, the company and the system that enabled it to boast, as it did in 2006, of its \"five-fold value growth\" in just four years.</p> <p>Restoring Castlebeck's good name may seem like mission impossible, but Sean Sullivan has been giving it his best shot. He is a \"business turnaround\" specialist, brought in last November at the instigation of what he calls the company's stakeholders \u2013 taken to mean not only its owner, <a href=\"https://www.duedil.com/company/LP008676/lydian-capital-partners\" title=\"\">Lydian Capital Partners</a>, an investment club for entrepreneurs including Irish tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus, but also the banks that largely funded the purchase of Castlebeck six years ago.</p> <p>Sullivan, 51, is a no-nonsense character with an earlier career in utility management, whose past assignments have included sorting out the wholesale electricity market in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the water corporation in South Australia. But his family runs care homes and he was responsible for turning <a href=\"http://www.carehomesguide.com/GroupDetails.aspx?gp=96\" title=\"\">Care Principles</a>, another leading UK provider, around, as well as large efficiency projects in the NHS. So he reckons he knows poor care practice when he sees it \u2013 when others may not.</p> <p>So what did he find at Castlebeck when he was initially appointed as the company's chief restructuring officer?</p> <p>\"A lot of half-blind people,\" Sullivan says, referring to managers who weren't seeing what was wrong.</p> <p>In March, having drawn up a detailed action plan, he was made executive chairman and told to go ahead and implement the 51-point plan. Since then, he has swept through the organisation, spending \u00a38m, instituting new practices and clearing out most of the management. He thinks his task is almost complete.</p> <p>\"Since March we have had a full-on, A-to-Z turnaround of all and everything that Castlebeck involves to get it into some sort of shape that is attractive for [care] commissioners, right for patients and has some commercial reality to it,\" he says. \"It's not 100% yet \u2013 you can't change every unit immediately \u2013 but we have turned around now in over 80%, perhaps 90%, of the units. I think we reached that point about three or four weeks ago. It is a repaired business.\"</p> <p>Many will be sceptical of his claims. It is an open secret that Lydian and/or the banks are seeking a buyer for the company and there will be suspicions that the makeover is only skin-deep. But the company is being unusually transparent about the transformation it says it is undertaking, and some influential voices in the care sector are impressed.</p> <p><strong>Support and endorsements</strong></p> <p>\"Can we put our hand on our heart and say they are changing? Yes, we can,\" says Ann Chivers, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.bild.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Institute of Learning Disabilities </a>(Bild). Her organisation is working with Castlebeck to offer support on advocacy and last-resort use of physical restraint, but it remains opposed in principle to the assessment-and-treatment model of care by which people with challenging behaviour are taken out of the community for indeterminate periods. This is still practised at some of the company's remaining 20 units. \"We have a reputation to protect and we had to really think about whether we should get involved,\" Chivers stresses. \"But they are definitely in turnaround mode. There is some very solid and robust stuff going on there.\"</p> <p>Another endorsement comes from Sukhvinder Kaur-Stubbs, a trustee of the <a href=\"http://www.scie.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Care Institute for Excellence</a>, who has joined Castlebeck as a paid independent non-executive director. \"I've been impressed with the approach that has been taken and the speed with which change has been made,\" she says. \"I think there is some learning from it for the care sector as a whole around what good governance should look like.\"</p> <p>Kaur-Stubbs sits on a Castlebeck board that has been revamped radically: Sullivan says that half its members now have a medical or nursing background. These include Debra Moore, brought in as director of nursing and patient safety, who was a learning disability nurse adviser to the Department of Health and joint lead of Valuing People, a programme for learning disability. Lee Reed, who had recently been appointed as the company's chief executive at the time of the Winterbourne View scandal, and who declared himself \"personally ashamed\", remains on the board as group director responsible for the separate mental health business.</p> <p>Moore has taken the main responsibility for quality, audit, clinical risk and compliance across the organisation. But Sullivan sees the unit managers as the key to the success of his action plan \u2013 built on the findings of consultants PwC, called in after the scandal broke \u2013 and he has felt it necessary to take drastic measures. \"Probably 70% [of managers] have exited the business,\" he says euphemistically.</p> <p>\"You have got to have people who used to be a commissioner, or a senior nurse, and who are able to engage with commissioners in that same field. Suddenly they click and they get it.\" He found some familiar faces among the managers he inherited. \"There were individuals that I had let go at other organisations I turned around,\" he says. \"They have moved on again.\"</p> <p>Sullivan is poor management was at the root of Castlebeck's malaise. \"Winterbourne View was a photograph in time,\" he says. He describes the abuse as \"appalling\" but says that culture \"had been allowed to build up over a long period\". He says he has found some \"stars\" among the 1,100 staff, who have been rewarded with promotion, but he has relied heavily on bringing in experienced interim managers (\"I have a little black book\"), about half of whom he expects to stay on permanently.</p> <p>All 20 remaining units in England and Scotland operating under the Castlebeck brand, and with a total capacity of about 350 people, have been refurbished and re-equipped from top to bottom at a cost of \u00a33m. More importantly, though, all users of services are now reassessed regularly, with the involvement of their families and care commissioners, to try to make sure they do not languish in the system. Some, Sullivan admits, ought to be receiving different care elsewhere. Various outside organisations, including Bild, have been contracted to offer support on a range of issues.</p> <p>Occupancy of the units, which dropped sharply after the revelations, has been rising again and, Sullivan says, is exceeding his target of 80% at 12 of the sites. For the first time in 16 months, care professionals are said to be calling unprompted to inquire about job openings, while internal satisfaction ratings by commissioners and families, shared with Society Guardian, show a positive score \u2013 though complaints about standards persist.</p> <p>The unanswered question is whether Castlebeck will wholly abandon the assessment-and-treatment model, as critics demand. Sullivan, who expects to remain at the company for only a few more months, says part of the turnaround involves placing the units on <a href=\"http://www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/section2/pathways.asp\" title=\"\">care pathways</a> so that they play a clear, time-limited role in an individual's progress. He cites Thornfield Grange, formerly what he calls a \"generic learning disability\" facility in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, which has been converted into a rehabilitation unit for people with autism moving on from the company's service near Darlington.</p> <p>However, he believes there is a continuing need for long-stay units for some people who have been in hospital-type settings for most of their lives. \"It's a very difficult area, but we do have people in the UK, perhaps aged 60, who have a 40- year background in these services and may have been heavily medicated for much of that time,\" Sullivan says. \"What is the future for them if we do not provide a safe and supportive home for life?\"</p>",
  "<p>The British government's support for US drone operations over Pakistan may involve acts of assisting murder or even war crimes, the high court heard on Tuesday.</p> <p>In the first serious legal challenge in the English courts to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/drones\" title=\"\">drones</a> campaign, lawyers for a young Pakistani man whose father was killed by a strike from an unmanned aircraft are seeking to have the sharing of UK locational intelligence declared unlawful.</p> <p>Noor Khan, 27, is said to live in constant fear of a repeat of the attack in North Waziristan in March last year that killed more than 40 other people, who are said to have gathered to discuss a local mining dispute.</p> <p>The British government has declined to state whether or not its signals intelligence agency GCHQ passes information in support of the CIA drone operations over Pakistan, although the court heard that media reports suggest that it does.</p> <p>The case opened as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-double-drones-afghanistan\" title=\"\">RAF confirmed that it is to double the number of its own drones</a> flying combat and surveillance operations over Afghanistan. The five additional aircraft will be operated from the UK for the first time, rather than the US. The UK's existing Reaper drones, which are used to target suspected insurgents in Helmand province, have been operated from Creech air force base in Nevada because the RAF has not had the capability to fly them from Britain.</p> <p>Martin Chamberlain, counsel for Khan, said that a newspaper article in 2010 had reported that GCHQ was using telephone intercepts to provide the US authorities with locational intelligence on leading militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The report suggested that the Cheltenham-based agency was proud of this work, which was said to be \"in strict accordance with the law\".</p> <p>On the contrary, Chamberlain said, any GCHQ official who passed locational intelligence to the CIA knowing or believing that it could be used to facilitate a drone strike would be committing a serious criminal offence.</p> <p>\"The participation of a UK intelligence official in US drone strikes, by passing intelligence, may amount to the offence of encouraging or assisting murder,\" he said. Alternatively, it could amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity, he added.</p> <p>Chamberlain said that no GCHQ official would be able to mount a defence of combat immunity, but added that there was no wish in this case to convict any individual of a criminal offence. Rather, Khan was seeking a declaration by the civil courts that such intelligence-sharing is unlawful.</p> <p>Between June 2004 and September this year, according to <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/\" title=\"\">research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, drone strikes killed between 2,562 and 3,325 people in Pakistan, of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children.</p> <p>With the number of drone strikes increasing sharply under the Obama administration, the London case is one of several being brought by legal activists around the world in an attempt to challenge their legality of the programme.</p> <p>In Pakistan, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220828/US-drone-attacks-CIA-chiefs-face-arrest-horrific-evidence-bloody-video-game-sorties.html?ITO=1490\" title=\"\">lawyers and human rights activists are mounting two separate court claims</a>: one is intended to trigger a criminal investigation into the actions of two former CIA officials, while the second is seeking a declaration that the strikes amount to acts of war, in order to pressurise the Pakistani air force into shooting down drones operating in the country's airspace.</p> <p>During the two-day hearing in London, lawyers for Khan are seeking permission for a full judicial review of the lawfulness of any British assistance for the US drone programme.</p> <p>Lawyers for William Hague, the foreign secretary, say not only that they will neither confirm nor deny any intelligence-sharing activities in support of drone operations, but that it would be \"prejudicial to the national interest\" for them even to explain their understanding of the legal basis for any such activities.</p> <p>For Khan and his lawyers to succeed, they say, the court would need to be satisfied that there is no international armed conflict in Pakistan, with the result that anyone involved in drone strikes was not immune from the criminal law, and that there had been no tacit approval for the strikes from the Pakistan government \u2013 another matter that the British government will neither confirm nor deny.</p> <p>The court would also need to consider, and reject, the US government's own legal position: that drone strikes are acts of self-defence. It would also need to be satisfied that the handing over of intelligence amounted to participation in hostilities.</p> <p>The government also says that Khan's claim would have a \"significant impact\" on the conduct of the UK's relations with both the US and Pakistan in an \"acutely controversial, sensitive and important\" area, and also impact on relations between the US and Pakistan.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below)</strong></p> <p>On MSNBC's Morning Joe program this morning, which focused on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/foreign-policy-presidential-debate\">Monday's night presidential debate</a>, the former right-wing Congressman and current host Joe Scarborough voiced an eloquent and impassioned critique of President Obama's ongoing killing of innocent people in the Muslim world using drones. In response, Time Magazine's Joe Klein, a stalwart Obama supporter, offered one of the most nakedly sociopathic defenses yet heard of these killings. This exchange, which begins at roughly the 7:00 minute mark on the video embedded below, is quite revealing in several respects.</p> <p>Here are the relevant portions of the exchange, which was triggered when regular guest Mike Barnicle announced how amazing he found it that so little public attention and debate is paid to the fact that Obama simply kills whomever he wants \"without any kind of due process\":</p> <blockquote> <p><br>SCARBOROUGH: \"What we're doing with drones is remarkable: the fact that over the past eight years during the Bush years - when a lot of people brought up some legitimate questions about international law - my God, those lines have been completely eradicated by a drone policy that says: if you're between 17 and 30, and within a half-mile of a suspect, we can blow you up, and that's exactly what's happening . . . . They are focused on killing the bad guys, but it is indiscriminate as to other people who are around them at the same time . . . . it is something that will cause us problems in the coming years\" . . . .</p> <p>KLEIN: \"I completely disagree with you. . . . It has been remarkably successful\" -- </p> <p>SCARBOROUGH: \"at killing people\" -- </p> <p>KLEIN: \"At decimating bad people, taking out a lot of bad people - and saving Americans lives as well, because our troops don't have to do this . . . You don't need pilots any more because you do it with a joystick in California.\"</p> <p>SCARBOROUGH: \"This is offensive to me, though. Because you do it with a joystick in California - and it seems so antiseptic - it seems so clean - and yet you have 4-year-old girls being blown to bits because we have a policy that now says: 'you know what? Instead of trying to go in and take the risk and get the terrorists out of hiding in a Karachi suburb, we're just going to blow up everyone around them.' </p> <p>\"This is what bothers me. . . . We don't detain people any more: we kill them, and we kill everyone around them. . . . I hate to sound like a Code Pink guy here. I'm telling you this quote 'collateral damage' - it seems so clean with a joystick from California - this is going to cause the US problems in the future.\"</p> <p>KLEIN: \"If it is misused, and there is a really major possibility of abuse if you have the wrong people running the government. But: the bottom line in the end is - <em>whose 4-year-old get killed? What we're doing is limiting the possibility that 4-year-olds here will get killed by indiscriminate acts of terror</em>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There are several points worth noting about this exchange:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Klein's justification - <em>we have to kill their children in order to protect our children </em>- is the exact mentality of every person deemed in US discourse to be a \"terrorist\". Almost every single person arrested and prosecuted over the last decade on terrorism charges, when asked why they were willing to kill innocent Americans including children, offered some version of Joe Klein's mindset.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/06/22/terrorism_22/\">Here</a>, for instance, is what the Pakistani-American Faisal Shazad said after he pled guilty to attempting to detonate a bomb in Times Square, in response to an angry question from the presiding US federal judge as to how he could possibly be willing to kill innocent children:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq, they don't see children, they don't see anybody. They kill women, children, they kill everybody. It's a war, and in war, they kill people. They're killing all Muslims. . . .</p> <p>\"I am part of the answer to the U.S. terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people. And, on behalf of that, I'm avenging the attack. Living in the United States, Americans only care about their own people, but they don't care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The mentality of Faisal Shazad and Joe Klein are completely identical and indistinguishable: it is justified for us indiscriminately to kill even your innocent children because doing so will help stop you from killing ours.</p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.justresponse.net/Bin_Laden3.html\">here's what Osama bin Laden had to say</a> on the same topic:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The call to wage war against America was made because America has spear-headed the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and above its meddling in its affairs and its politics, and its support of the oppressive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control. These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target. . . . </p> <p>\"Besides, terrorism can be commendable and it can be reprehensible. Terrifying an innocent person and terrorizing him is objectionable and unjust, also unjustly terrorizing people is not right. <em>Whereas, terrorizing oppressors and criminals and thieves and robbers is necessary for the safety of people and for the protection of their property</em>. . . . </p> <p>\"The terrorism we practice is of the commendable kind for it is directed at the tyrants and the aggressors and the enemies of Allah, the tyrants, the traitors who commit acts of treason against their own countries and their own faith and their own prophet and their own nation. Terrorizing those and punishing them are necessary measures to straighten things and to make them right. . . . </p> <p>\"It is not enough for their people to show pain when they see our children being killed in Israeli raids launched by American planes, nor does this serve the purpose. What they ought to do is change their governments which attack our countries. The hostility that America continues to express against the Muslim people has given rise to feelings of animosity on the part of Muslims against America and against the West in general. Those feelings of animosity have produced a change in the behavior of some crushed and subdued groups who, instead of fighting the Americans inside the Muslim countries, went on to fight them inside the United States of America itself.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>When it comes to justifying the killing of civilians, the only difference between the Joe Kleins of the world and Osama bin Laden is that they're on different sides. To the extent one wanted to distinguish them, one could say that the violence and aggression brought by the US to the Muslim world vastly exceeds - vastly - the violence and aggression brought by the Muslim world to the US. That's just a fact.</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> Leaving aside the sociopathic, morally grotesque defense of killing 4-year-olds with a \"joystick from California\", Klein's claims are completely false on pragmatic grounds. Slaughtering Muslim children does not protect American children from terrorism. The opposite is true. That is precisely what <em>causes </em> the anti-American hatred that fuels and sustains terrorism aimed at Americans in the first place, as even a <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/10/20/terrorism_6/\">study commissioned by the Rumsfeld-era Pentagon</a> recognized almost a decade ago.</p> <p>The reason American 4-year-olds are in danger from terrorism - to the very limited extent they are - is precisely because those empowered in US government and media circles think like Joe Klein does. Soulless cheerleaders for indiscriminate killing like Joe Klein - who once went on national television and <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2006/04/16/joe-klein-nukes-should-be-on-the-table\">advocated that the US should preserve the right to launch a <em>first-strike nuclear attack</em></a> on Iran in order to stop their nuclear program, prompting host George Stephanopoulos to label that statement \"insane\" - are the reason there is a terrorism risk to Americans, not the solution for that risk. </p> <p>If you want to understand why there is such a widespread desire to engage in violence against the US, look at Joe Klein's face and listen to his words. Every Muslim who has ever engaged in violence against the US will make that as clear as can be.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> This exchange is a perfectly vivid expression of the Obama legacy. Here we have a standard Democratic/progressive pundit who is one of the media's most stalwart Obama fanatics defending indiscriminate slaughter of Muslim children. Meanwhile, it's left to a former right-wing, Gingrich-era congressman to raise objections, call for more public scrutiny, and cite the moral and strategic dangers, one of the very few commentators on MSNBC - the progressive network - who has ever voiced such passionate criticism of Obama's ongoing killings.</p> <p>Obama has led <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/11/13/gop_and_tp_on_obamas_foreign_policy_successes/\">all sorts of progressives</a> and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/02/08/repulsive_progressive_hypocrisy/\">other Democrats</a> to be the most vocal supporters of unrestrained aggression, secret assassinations, and \"<a href=\"http://www.boomantribune.com/story/2012/10/20/212436/41\">crippling</a>\" the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/iran-santions-suffering\">Iranian people with sanctions</a>. It is completely unsurprising that the most sociopathic defense of drones comes from one of the most committed Obama supporters, and that it's now left to a former GOP Congressman to raise objections. As much as anything, <em>that</em> is the Obama legacy.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> One of the primary reasons war - especially protracted war - is so destructive is not merely that it kills the populations at whom it is aimed, but it also radically degrades the character of the citizenry that wages it. That's what enables one of America's most celebrated pundits to go on the most mainstream of TV programs and coldly justify the killing of 4-year-olds, without so much as batting an eyelash or even paying lip service to the heinous tragedy of that, and have it be barely noticed. Joe Klein is the face not only of the Obama legacy, but also mainstream US political culture.</p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>Speaking of killing children, the Afghanistan government <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-afghanistan-taliban-idUSBRE89M0N120121023\">said this morning</a> that a NATO operation on Saturday killed three more Afghan children, ones who were tending to livestock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640\"> <object width=\"420\" height=\"245\" id=\"msnbc1aeb02\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=10,0,0,0\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640\" /><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"launch=49517052&amp;width=420&amp;height=245\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><embed name=\"msnbc1aeb02\" src=\"https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640\" width=\"420\" height=\"245\" FlashVars=\"launch=49517052&amp;width=420&amp;height=245\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\"></embed></object> </figure>  <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>There's one other vital point to be made here. Klein says that \"there is a really major possibility of abuse [of drone power] if you have the wrong people running the government\" - in other words, we can trust Obama with it, but not the big bad Republicans. This was precisely what Bush followers used to say about his claimed powers of due-process-free eavesdropping and detention: <em>maybe this would be scary if Hillary Clinton could do this, but I trust Bush to use it only against the Bad Guys</em>.</p> <p>Leaving aside the authoritarian willingness to trust certain leaders with unchecked power, this is not how the US government works. Once a power is legitimized and institutionalized, then it is vested in all presidents, current and future, Democratic and Republican. That is why <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch8s41.html\">Thomas Jefferson warned</a>: \"In questions of power, then, <em>let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution</em>.\" Those who cheer for the unchecked power to assassinate in secret because it's Obama who currently wields that power will be the ones fully responsible when some leader they don't trust exercises it - abuses it - in the future.</p>",

In a comment article, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-policy-bovine-tb\">Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, says Paterson should abandon the policy for good.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of being a \"small-c conservative\" because of his resistance to modernisation.</strong> In a speech, Gove said that Miliband's \"one nation Labour\" speech illustrated not a move to the centre but an \"explicit disavowal\" of the centrism practised under Tony Blair's leadership. Gove also said that the \"blue Labour\" philosophy favoured by Miliband was \"anti-globalisation, explicitly anti-liberal and proudly protective of the past\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Blue Labour thinking - Ed Miliband's thinking - is not then a continuation or refashioning of Blairism, it is a critique and rejection of Blairism.</p> <p>It's an attempt to repudiate the period in the party's recent past when wealth creation was welcomed, when spin doctors argued education reform would mean a move away from the bog-standard comprehensive, when the director's box at the Emirates was preferred to the Durham Miners' Gala.</p> <p>That is why it is a fundamental mistake ... to see Ed Miliband's One Nation speech as a move to the centre.</p> <p>It was an explicit disavowal of the centrism practised under Tony Blair and a celebration of an older, more solidaristic socialism of the kind which would have found favour with Tony Crosland or even Tony Benn.</p> <p>Where Tony Blair used his speeches to identify the forces of conservatism and declare war on them, Ed Miliband has used his speech to celebrate the forces of conservatism and declare he wants to become their leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove has said that he is writing to MPs in areas of \"concentrated educational under-performance\" to encourage them to support his bid for more primaries to become academies.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want the MPs in those cities to work with me to persuade their local authorities and their local communities that we need rapidly to improve their schools.

I am not sure that the significance of the Gove intervention - the Education Secretary's admission that he would vote to pull out of the EU were there an In-Out referendum today - has been fully grasped. It marked the moment when a view held by roughly half of party activists and a significant percentage of Tory MPs was backed without reproof at Cabinet level - and by the Government's most successful senior Minister at that, and one who may yet be, for all his protestations to the contrary, a future party leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://nottspolitics.org/2012/10/22/do-government-chief-whips-have-an-afterlife-2/\">\u2022 David Butler at Ballots and Bullets writes about what happens to chief whips after they move.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Few ex-Chief Whips however became very important on the political stage.

We have all worked tirelessly to prepare for the delivery of this government policy to see us finally get on top of this terrible disease.</p> <p>But there have been a series of obstacles, not least the appalling weather, delays because of the Olympics and Paralympics, and the legal challenges from those against the policy. And let\u2019s be clear, the numbers from the badger population survey last week, which demonstrated just how large the badger numbers are, have left us with a huge challenge to ensure we achieve the targets needed for disease control.</p> <p>We have always said that this has to be a science-led policy to reduce disease and we have to be confident of achieving the numbers needed for disease reduction. As we rapidly approach winter the odds of achieving that number decrease. This is why, reluctantly, we have taken the decision, with the companies involved, to delay until late spring next year.</p> <p>For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today\u2019s decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do. We have said all along that this has never been about killing badgers; this has always been about eradicating disease. It has been about the battle to get on top of the TB on our farms that strikes at the very heart of our beef and dairy herds.</p> <p>This has been a very tough year for farmers, which has lent its own set of challenges. In preparing to deliver on this government\u2019s TB eradication policy we have met with delay after delay; challenge after challenge.

It used to be isolated. But it has spread extensively through the west of England and Wales. Cases are doubling every nine years. Last year some 26,000 cattle were slaughtered at a cost of \u00a3100m. Over the next 10 years it could cost \u00a3500m, he says.</p> <p>Last week the government announced plans for a new testing regime.</p> <p>Cattle and badgers can transmit the disease to each other. Culling badgers can cut transmission to cattle if it is carried out over a large enough area and for a significant length of time.</p> <p>That is why the government thinks culling badgers can make a significant contribution.</p> <p>The NFU has taken the lead in preparing the pilot culls.</p> <p>Paterson says he has been \"immensely impressed\" by the work done by the NFU. And he thanks the police for their help.</p> <p>The severe bad weather this summer has caused problems.</p> <p>Legal problems, and the police request for the cull to start after the Olympics, mean the government has missed the best time to start the cull.</p> <p>New figures also show that there are more badgers in the pilot area than thought.</p> <p>For a cull to be successful, 70% of badgers have to be culled.</p> <p>Farmers now say they cannot be confident of culling 70% of the badgers, partly because of the higher numbers and the delays.</p> <p>The companies due to carry out the culls have written to Paterson asking him to delay the culls until next summer.</p> <p>Paterson says he has placed a copy of the letter in the library of the Commons.</p> <p>Starting next summer will ensure that the culls can conform to the scientific criteria and the evidence base.</p> <p>This will be disappointing, Paterson says. But he fully supports the decision of the NFU.</p> <p>The government is still committed to the policy. But it wants to work with the NFU to get the policy right.</p> <p>It wants to have a TB-free England.</p> <p>Vaccination would be another option. But it will be some years before a viable cattle vaccine is available, he says.</p> <p>Paterson says he is utterly convinced that culling is the right thing do to.</p> <p>He wants the culls to be delivered safely next summer.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:50:07.906Z\">at 12.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50867f9bc0e343ef1abc7f21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:29:32.057Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Adam Vaughan has been speaking to <strong>Brian May</strong>, who has been one of the leaders of the anti-culling campaign.

Oh yes, they would.</p> <p>In the US there was a gap of 16 years after the first debate in 1960. After Kennedy\u2019s charm trumped Nixon\u2019s gruffness American voters had to wait until Gerald Ford faced Jimmy Carter in 1976.

The suggestion you\u2019re making is absurd.\u201d Posed the inevitable question last weekend, Theresa May answered: \u201cWe have a first-class leader at the moment [my italics]. David Cameron is dealing with the issues that he was left by the last government very well indeed.\u201d This fell short by some distance of the grandiloquent encomium required.</p> <p>There can be no doubt about it. The Home Secretary is, as Tory MPs would put it, \u201con manoeuvres\u201d \u2013 discreet ones, to be sure, but unmistakable for all that ...</p> <p>It is not as though Mr Cameron has an obvious successor. The three front-runners to succeed him are Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and George Osborne. The first claims not to want to do so. The second lacks the means (since he isn\u2019t an MP and will still be Mayor of London if he becomes one after the next election). And the third will lack the capacity if the Conservatives fail to win a majority next time round: he will go down with Mr Cameron, his friend, in such an event \u2013 one still more likely than not, given the collapse of the boundary review.

They included getting three members to vote each way in a committee to make it look as if a quorum were present (for which Mellish apologised to the House), and blocking one of the division lobbies (undertaken with Scottish Nationalists to prevent the Tories winning a vote against devolution).</p> <p>One day in May 1968 he was whipping on two Committees at once when a vote was called on the Finance Bill. He arrived just as the door was closing, forced his way through and voted. When the Shadow Chancellor Iain Macleod challenged his vote, Harrison said he had been three-quarters in and had pulled his leg in after him.

The way in Britain Lisbon was ratified without any consultation of the voters has played a part in that.

  "<p>The future of nuclear power in the UK is hanging in the balance, the chief executive of the company charged with building new reactors has said.</p> <p>Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, told MPs at <a href=\"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=11579\" title=\"\">a select committee hearing</a> on Tuesday that he had still not made up his mind whether to go ahead with a construction programme that would see the first new nuclear power stations in the UK for decades.</p> <p>He said the company was waiting for further reassurances from the government on what assistance the company will receive. This includes assurances on the disposal of waste and the decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, and a regulatory regime that should favour nuclear power through the provision of long-term <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">\"contracts for difference\"</a> that will penalise fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy.</p> <p>\"We are on the brink of delivering an infrastructure project similar in scale to the London Olympics. We are poised to deliver immense benefits in terms of jobs, skills and economic growth \u2013 locally and nationally,\" said de Rivaz, appearing before the parliamentary select committee on energy and climate change. \"But like all investors in capital intensive infrastructure projects we need to have a compelling business case. In this respect our final investment decision requires more progress to be made.\"</p> <p>This new regulatory system, known as <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/markets/electricity/electricity.aspx\" title=\"\">electricity market reform (EMR)</a>, has been criticised by renewable power companies as unwieldy and overly complex. They fear it will favour big companies and squeeze smaller players out of the market.</p> <p>The French state company EDF is the government's best hope of having new nuclear power stations built in the UK, because two German utilities \u2013 RWE and E.ON \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\" title=\"\">pulled out of plans to build new nuclear power stations earlier this year</a>. Their consortium, called Horizon, was put up for sale but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/03/new-uk-nuclear-power-station-setback\" title=\"\">failed to garner the expected interest</a>.</p> <p>Companies are understood to be concerned that new plants will face protests and will be expensive to build and run, while the electricity regulatory regime has been subject to drastic changes from successive governments in recent years, generating uncertainty and raising the risks to investors.</p> <p>EDF owns and operates eight of the UK's 10 existing nuclear power stations, and any new reactors are likely to be built on or next to existing sites. If de Rivaz does decide to go ahead, the first new plant to be built will be at Hinkley Point in Somerset.</p> <p>Another prospective nuclear consortium, NuGen \u2013 owned by Iberdrola of Spain and GDF Suez, another French company \u2013 is considering new reactors in Cumbria, but is unlikely to make a final decision soon, having said it could wait until 2015 before proceeding. A further setback to the proposed \"nuclear renaissance\" in the UK came this month, when three councils in Cumbria <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/03/three-month-delay-nuclear-waste-burial-cumbria\" title=\"\">delayed a decision</a> on whether to allow new nuclear waste sites to go ahead.</p> <p>But a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokeswoman said: \"There is strong interest in UK nuclear from a number of potential investors. We are confident that UK's stable policy environment and the measures in the energy bill to be published next month, will provide the detail and certainty that investors need.</p> <p>\"We are in the midst of a commercial negotiation with EDF so it is not appropriate for us to comment on the details of it. In our discussions with new nuclear investors, our focus will be on delivering a fair deal for consumers, which is affordable, provides clear value for money, and is consistent with the coalition agreement's commitment to no public subsidy for new nuclear power. And we will be transparent around any agreement reached\".</p> <p>EDF's main concern is to make sure that the \"contracts for difference\" under EMR are arranged in such a way as to benefit nuclear power generation. Rival utilities and opponents of nuclear power have argued that these contracts will be effectively a form of subsidy to the nuclear industry, a charge the government has denied. In the European parliament, the Green grouping of MEPs is challenging EMR as a form of state aid.</p> <p>De Rivaz told MPs a decision would be made within months: \"We have workers in high-visibility jackets, standing ready to go to work on our site. The responsibility now is on the government and us to deliver the [contracts for difference] and transitional arrangements, the framework to make it possible for our project to move to the next stage around the end of the year.\"</p>",

  "<p>The first rule of pro-choice: trust women. That applies to activism as much as abortion itself. Whether the aim is to serve an individual or a whole nation, the first thing you do is listen, carefully and attentively, to whoever you're trying to help. That's true when you're campaigning inside your own country, but even more so when the situation is complicated by the historical scar of colonialism: can you speak with women in other countries without taking their voices from them?</p> <p>A boat belonging to the Dutch group <a href=\"http://www.womenonwaves.org/\" title=\"\">Women on Waves</a> attempted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/abortion-campaigner-boat-moroccan-port\" title=\"\">dock in Morocco</a> this month. Women on Waves campaigns internationally for liberalised abortion laws and promotes helplines that advise on procuring your own medical abortion. It also uses its sea vessels as floating surgeries, performing medical abortions in international water for women whose home state criminalises the procedure.</p> <p>In Morocco, it seems that WoW picked a good target: the country has some of the most stringent anti-abortion legislation <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/profiles.htm\" title=\"\">in the world</a>. Abortion is only available in the first six weeks of pregnancy, and if a woman's life, physical or mental health is in jeopardy; there's no exemption for rape or incest, and a woman must have the consent of her husband \u2013 which assumes, of course, both that all sexually active women are married, and that a man should have the deciding voice in what happens to a woman's body.</p> <p>The boat met fierce opposition, both from the Moroccan government, which closed the port of Smir to prevent WoW from landing, and from protesters who gathered at the harbour side to express their disgust at abortion itself. \"We cannot accept these values, the values of massacre,\" said one \u2013 apparently oblivious to the fact that abortion, though illegal in Morocco, is still \"quite widespread\" according to the UN, and routinely deadly for the women resorting to unlicensed providers. But does it really help Moroccan women if the medical treatment they need is presented as something that sails in from Amsterdam, rather than something they choose and obtain for themselves? I'm dubious.</p> <p>You might compare the Moroccan case to that of Uruguay, which has just become one of the very few Latin American countries to decriminalise abortion. The new legislation is still <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2012/10/abortion-uruguay\" title=\"\">shockingly strict</a> \u2013 the need to convince a panel of three experts, and a compulsory five-day \"period of reflection\" before the procedure are the kind of things <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/07/nadine-dorries-abortion-amendment-defeated\" title=\"\">Nadine Dorries</a> wouldn't dare dream of. Yet compared to the rest of Latin America, this is an unparalleled feminist triumph. And it's been achieved, not through tugboat lobbying, but through the undramatic democratic processes of public will and political compromise.</p> <p>Will Uruguay's new law lead to a transformation of abortion rights throughout Latin America? Initially, no: the law is designed to be parochial, with abortion only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/uruguay-legalise-abortion\" title=\"\">available to Uruguayan citizens</a> or women who have been resident for one year. But in the longer term, this geographical narrowness could be the impetus for adjacent counties to change their policy. If Uruguay were to become, in the words of the law's author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/uruguay-legalise-abortion\" title=\"\">Ivan Posada</a>, \"a place that attracts people from other countries for this procedure\", it might find itself in the same place as England, Wales and Scotland are to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland: a liberal neighbour that risks supporting the hypocrisy of conservative countries by allowing them to export abortion.</p> <p>When Marie Stopes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/ireland-abortion-clinic-protests?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">opened Northern Ireland's first ever private sexual health clinic</a> in Belfast this month, a Pro-Life Campaign representative described it as \"[imposing] an abortion regime\", somehow overlooking the fact that this clinic would be run by Belfast-born Dawn Purvis and adhere strictly to the law of Northern Ireland regarding termination. But it's not only anti-abortion campaigners who conspire in the idea of abortion as something from outside: <a href=\"http://www.theantiroom.com/\" title=\"\">Anna Carey</a>, a pro-choice journalist from Dublin, says she's sometimes encountered a condescending attitude from pro-choice activists in the UK.</p> <p>\"I think the one thing that irritates Irish activists is when the situation here is presented abroad as being a simple 'the entire country is ruled by the church, oh, the poor helpless Irish downtrodden women',\" says Carey, \"when the reality is much more complex \u2026 Irish women have been campaigning for abortion rights for decades.\"</p> <p>Access to abortion is a vital human right, and one that should be available to every woman in her own country. When the geographically fortunate presume to patronise less liberal countries, there's a danger that we may simply entrench the anti-abortion position we seek to dislodge. The answer is to speak not for but with the women whose choices should be honoured by the nation they belong to.</p>",
  "<p>Academic researchers into the effectiveness or otherwise of <a href=\"http://www.asbos.co.uk/AboutASBOs.aspx\">anti-social behaviour orders </a>will no doubt want to have this one in their data.</p> <p>Dexter Ferguson, who made headlines briefly by being the first person in the north east of England to be given an Asbo, has just gone to prison after his 116th conviction.</p> <p>That was in 1999, the year after Tony Blair introduced the new penalty as a swift but immediately controversial way of handing down a penalty for relatively minor offences. It was the most eye-catching measure in his campaign to be \"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime,\" the sixth of New Labour's 1997 <a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml\">general election manifesto's ten commitments.<br></a><br>Subsequent audits have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2009/sep/29/asbo-brown-crime-crackdown\">cast doubt on its effectiveness </a>and there has been <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2148059/Asbos-axed-The-ridiculous-legacy-Labours-beloved-Asbo.html\">much mockery of asbo detail</a> which ranges from a ban on wearing one golf glove (the mark of a Manchester gang) to guarantees of good behaviour by the owner of an accident-prone herd of escaping pigs. Ferguson does not appear to give any encouragement for remaining supporters of the penalty, whose <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/28/asbos-theresa-may-home-secretary\">eventual doom was signalled</a> in 2010 by the Home Secretary Theresa May.</p> <p>He has appeared in court every year since 1992, with his asbos leaving no discernable trace on this record. Only last month, <a href=\"http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/crime/historic-asbo-man-gets-lifelong-banning-orders-after-more-than-100-crimes-1-4906019\">he was given a 'lifetime asbo' </a>whose survival beyond any action taken to abolish the measure by May could in future <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/may/22/may-tougher-antisocial-behaviour-laws\">prove an interesting legal case.<br></a><br>Recorder Jonathan Sandiford issued the order at Newcastle-upon-Tyne Crown court, saying: </p> <blockquote> <p>I am satisfied that it is necessary in particular to protect people in the area of Sunderland where the defendant ordinarily lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ferguson had to sign agreement to five behaviour rules before leaving court, but he was soon back in front of a judge, down the coast in Sunderland. This time, he was charged with communicating false information by 'phoning police to say that there was a bomb on a Stagecoach bus travelling between Durham and Sunderland.</p> <p>He has been jailed for eight days, which comes on top of several previous terms for drunkenness and violence, 130 arrests, the lifelong asbo and other orders which ban him from every pub in Sunderland's city centre and east end.</p>",
  "<p>Looking back on the story of New York's High Line in 20 years time, I wonder if we'll see it as having been the catalyst for a new era of design for our cities.</p> <p>Having fallen in love with the structure of the old freight railway from the street, it was what High Line founder Robert Hammond saw when he got up on to the railway itself, that convinced him to try to save it. Here, running through the middle of Manhattan, was a mile and a half of wild flowers.</p> <p>That was in 1999. Now, 12 years on, New York's park in the sky attracted more than 3.7 million visitors last year, has generated $2bn-worth of private investment (\u00a31.3bn) surrounding the park and is predicted to exceed $900m (\u00a3562m) in new tax revenues for the city over the next 20 years.</p> <p>Such figures are not to be sniffed at. For what started out as a rescue attempt by two neighbourhood residents (Hammond and Joshua David) with no design background, no plan and no money, has created the city's second most popular tourist attraction after the Museum of Modern Art. It is decisive evidence that it is increasingly the quality of our parks and public spaces, not the towering ambition of our skyline, that make our towns and cities stand out.</p> <p>But it is what the High Line \u2013 and to a great extent London's Olympic Park \u2013 will make possible, that will define its legacy. By making a virtue of an industrial relic, the High Line offers a new, 21st-century experience of the city \u2013 not a sanctuary from it. In fact, the High Line offers views of the city that you'd get nowhere else. So, suddenly, in the middle of Manhattan, is a piece of infrastructure that is not only a green lung, but looks and smells beautiful; is a place that offers a new route to work, space for recreation and contemplation, and is regenerating an area. Once we have a park in the sky, the city is ours to re-imagine. Indeed, it must be re-imagined if we are to face the challenges we seem destined to face.</p> <p>Which is why it so refreshing to see mainstream media, not long ago in thrall to Renzo Piano's Shard, filling pages with ideas for green cycleways in the sky, a new \"Lido Line\" offering a swimmable commuter route along Regent's Canal and an urban garden in the old Mail Rail tunnels (The Post Office Railway) beneath Oxford Street. All were the result of <a href=\"http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/events/competitions/highline_winners.php\" title=\"\">A High Line for London, a recent green infrastructure ideas competition</a> that called for proposals that transcended the traditional idea of an urban park.</p> <p>The winning idea, called \"Pop Down\" by Fletcher Priest Architects, proposed reinventing the disused tunnels of the Mail Rail that run for 10.5m as a public experience and urban mushroom farm. London with its history of hidden tunnels and lost rivers provided the inspiration for the idea, while the team tried to capitalise on the same sense of drama that the High Line creates by being in between the fabric of the city. In New York, there have also been plans to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/06/low-line-underground-park-new-york\" title=\"\">build a subterranean public space</a> and in London a <a href=\"http://spacehive.com/londonshighline\" title=\"\">High Line in Tower Hamlets</a> has also been proposed.</p> <p>But unlocking the potential of forgotten spaces is often more easily achievable than reclaiming the architecture or infrastructure that creates them, as the saga of Battersea power station can attest. HTA Landscape Design's highly-commended idea \"Bridge-it\" proposed opening up inaccessible railway cuttings and sidings, and linking them together into green linear parks that connect existing London transport hubs and open spaces.</p> <p>A much-celebrated project in East London is already showing what can be achieved by mapping the abandoned space in a neighbourhood and working with the local community to re-imagine it. Between 2009-10, J&amp;L Gibbons and Muf architects delivered 10 projects as part of Making Space in Dalston. The <a href=\"http://dalstongarden.org/\" title=\"\">Eastern Curve</a>, once a overgrown and abandoned piece of railway land, was one of them. It is now a popular public space with trees to offer shade, warm weather cooling and improve air quality, and vegetable and herb growing areas for local people.</p> <p>That a competition that would typically been considered niche has made it into the mainstream is extremely encouraging. It is in indicative of a groundswell of support for rethinking the conventional approach to designing public space and engaging with the sustainability agenda. That groundswell includes the Mayor of London's commitment to developing pocket parks; the US Embassy, which is behind a major green infrastructure development in Nine Elms; and private landowners such as Grosvenor, who was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cabe.org.uk%2Ffiles%2Fpaved-with-gold.pdf&amp;ei=uWCGUPHsMqG40QX_rICoBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGszfH_46xitcVfL2Xt1EVrQIX3mA\" title=\"\">Cabe Space's Paved with Gold report</a> to invest in the public realm.</p> <p>In the wake of the Olympic Park's success, it's easy to forget how ambitious a project it was to transform 50 hectares of post-industrial wasteland in East London. More than 2m tonnes of soil was decontaminated and the largest wildflower meadow the UK has ever seen was planted.</p> <p>While we are unlikely to see investment in public space on this scale again for a generation, as with community-led projects such as the High Line, if green infrastructure is designed and managed to a high quality, it can give credibility to wider regeneration issues. In straitened times, the creative reuse of our existing landscapes and their architecture, might be our only option.</p> <p><em>Sue Illman is president of the </em><a href=\"http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Landscape Institute</em></a><em>, which ran the High Line for London competition alongside the </em><a href=\"http://www.gardenmuseum.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Garden Museum</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Mayor's Office</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said \"significant\" material about the death of Mark Duggan has emerged in recent weeks, meaning its report into his shooting by police will be delayed even further.</p> <p>The report into the shooting, which triggered the 2011 English riots, was due to be completed this summer. On Tuesday the IPCC told a pre-inquest hearing that it could not say when its investigation would be finished.</p> <p>The new evidence emerged at the trial of a man accused of supplying Duggan with a gun, which ended last week with the jury deadlocked.</p> <p>Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, denied the charge of \"selling or transferring a prohibited firearm\" to Duggan, who was shot in Tottenham, north London, on 4 August. He will face a retrial.</p> <p>Robin Tam QC, for the IPCC, told the coroner, Andrew Walker, that the new material would have to be assessed by investigators.</p> <p>The trial of Hutchinson-Foster heard from officers who stopped Duggan, and the marksman who killed him. The new material is believed to relate to their evidence and cross-examination by defence counsel. The trial was the first time the officers had answered questions about the shooting, after they declined to answer oral questions from the IPCC, providing written statements instead.</p> <p>The officers are being treated as witnesses by the IPCC inquiry, not as suspects.</p> <p>Walker ruled that the inquest would start as planned on 28 January 2013, some 17 months after the shooting, a decision that pleased the Duggan family.</p> <p>But the retrial of Hutchinson-Foster is yet to be scheduled and if it is not completed by the time the Duggan inquest is due to start, the coroner may have to wait.</p> <p>After the pre-inquest review hearing at North London coroner's court, Duggan's brother Shaun Hall said: \"It's the first time that we have left here with a bit of hope that we can get the truth. We are told that in January we are going to get our day in court.</p> <p>\"The coroner was not prepared to lie down. He does want to see this in front of a jury as we do. All we are looking for is the truth.\"</p> <p>In court, the family's barrister Michael Mansfield said they felt a \"deep sense of injustice\" over widely publicised accounts of Duggan's death which emerged during the trial of Hutchinson-Foster.</p> <p>The trial at Snaresbrook crown court heard the marksman who shot Duggan said he had \"absolutely no doubt\" the 29-year-old was holding a gun and preparing to fire.</p> <p>The officer, known only as V53, said his account of the shooting was compiled three days later, when he and his colleagues spent more than eight hours sitting in a room together writing their statements. He said they were aware of the rules about officers conferring and had discussed the incident among themselves before writing their statements.</p> <p>Hutchinson-Foster's defence was that he had not passed the gun to Duggan and that the jury could not be sure the evidence from police officers was correct.</p> <p>The Duggan family also fear an attempt may be made to hold the hearing without a jury because of \"secret evidence\" relating to intercepts, but so far no formal or public attempt has been made to do this.</p>",
  "<p>We could argue over who killed it, but what's the point? It's increasingly obvious that a continued insistence on zombie peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians is deluded, because the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution\" title=\"\">two-state principle</a> framing them is dead. To pr\u00e9cis: it's now impossible to remove half a million Jewish settlers and infrastructure from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem; the international community is opposed to settlements on paper but does nothing in practice, and after 19 years of failed two-state talks, the fault plainly lies in the plan, not the leadership.</p> <p>This view has been expressed more vocally of late on both sides, from unlikely quarters and for different reasons. Prominent Israeli commentators have declared the end of the two-state period. The latest to do so was the mainstream, veteran journalist Nahum Barnea, who in August wrote in the mass-circulation daily Yediot Aharonot that the Oslo two-state peace process is dead. His view \u2013 \"Everybody knows how this will end. There will be a bi-national [state],\" he clarified on Israeli TV \u2013 is shared by others once supportive of the Oslo framework but now calling time on it. \"I do not give up on the two-state solution on ideological grounds,\" wrote Haaretz columnist Carlo Strenger last month. \"I give up on it because it will not happen.\"</p> <p>Alongside that, we're starting to see the practical consequences of those Jewish settlers who, surprisingly, started talking about one-state approaches two years ago. Last week, a Palestinian village in an Israel-controlled area of the West Bank <a href=\"http://972mag.com/watch-settler-helps-palestinians-get-building-permits/58091/\" title=\"\">was given building permits</a> \u2013 the first time that's happened during a 45-year Israeli occupation \u2013 thanks to petitions from their Jewish settler neighbours.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rightwing Israeli politicians such as Knesset speaker <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israel-official-accepting-palestinians-into-israel-better-than-two-states-1.287421\" title=\"\">Reuven Rivlin</a> and ex-defence minister Moshe Arens have been arguing for one state \u2013 and while their vision isn't premised on immediate equal citizenship, they have taken the sting out of the subject.</p> <p>Among Palestinians, support for a one-state approach is also growing. A poll last month showed that support for a one-state formulation premised on equal rights has inched up among both Palestinians and Israelis. In the West Bank, there are fresh peaks of disillusion with the Palestinian Authority \u2013 whose tenure was always supposed to be temporary, pending statehood, as set out in the Oslo Accords. Unelected, tainted by corruption, aid-dependent and viewed as enforcers of the Israeli occupation, the PA's last stab at credibility was probably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/11/united-nations-delays-palestinian-statehood-vote\" title=\"\">its statehood bid at the UN last year</a>. But you could practically hear the hope hissing out of that media-inflated bid when, pressured by the US, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas switched to a hollowed-out version that was meaningless and destined to fail. Now a new generation of Palestinian activists, in part inspired by the Arab uprisings in the region, are bypassing territorial demands to focus on civil rights and freedoms.</p> <p>In Israel, there are green shoots of debate around practical questions of how to share the space between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. Weeks ago, Israeli analyst and blogger Dahlia Scheindlin \u2013 previously a two-state advocate \u2013 set out <a href=\"http://972mag.com/demystifying-one-state-acknowledging-facts/57411/\" title=\"\">a list of key questions and suggestions</a>, concerning issues such as national symbols, voting systems, refugees and land rights. Already, Israeli intellectuals are working out the idea that Jewish claims to the region \u2013 currently enforced with guns and walls \u2013 would need instead to be enshrined by law, alongside equally guaranteed Palestinian protections. In his new book, <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/Beyond-Two-State-Solution-Yehouda-Shenhav/8382351078/bd\" title=\"\">Beyond the Two State Solution</a>, Israeli sociologist Yehouda Shenhav draws on a pre-Israeli, bi-national strain of Zionism that was historically drowned out but should now, he argues, be reclaimed.</p> <p>Countering a common criticism of one-state proposals, these emerging formulations don't insist that Palestinians and Israelis give up outdated attachments to nationalism \u2013 which is helpful, because it seems that neither side wants to, yet. A small group of Palestinians, Israelis and Jewish settlers, Eretz Yoshveyha \u2013 \"land of its inhabitants\" \u2013 set out \"principles for a single spatial polity\" last year, among them safeguarding the collective rights of the two nations. One settler tells me of a consensus emerging within nascent, one-state settler groups that, while national identity may be important, exclusive Jewish sovereignty is not.</p> <p>It's all germinal and there are problems, of course. Most polled Palestinians and Israelis still support a two-state framework, even while at the same time believing it doomed. Shared-space alternatives have grassroots momentum, but no leadership support. The left needs to ensure that Gaza remains part of the picture. And doubtless some West Bank settlers support one-stateism as a way of avoiding potential eviction, with scant regard for Palestinian rights. A&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/survey-most-israeli-jews-support-apartheid-regime-in-israel.premium-1.471644\" title=\"\">recent poll</a> suggests Israelis agree, with a majority supporting discriminatory policies if the West Bank were annexed. Tentative meetings between settlers and Palestinians could crash once they progress beyond relatively safe, community issues \u2013 a belief in the power of people sitting together over apolitical cups of tea was a theme tune of the peace process years, and look how that turned out.</p> <p>But one idea is crystallising: that clinging to a two-state approach is, by default, a victory for the far-right claims of one state called \"Greater Israel\", with a Jewish minority and two, ethnically coded tiers of rights and freedoms.</p> <p>That's the reality on the ground, cemented by Israel while paying lip-service to the idea of Palestinian statehood. Now the Israeli government wants to consolidate this even further, through approval of a report that declares all settlements legal under international law \u2013 enshrining the idea that the West Bank isn't occupied. In this context it's heartening that peace camps on both sides are starting to break a period of paralysis, discarding the spent husks of the Oslo phase to claw back fresh thinking space. It's only when freed from the dead weight of a two-state paradigm that a just, dignified and peaceful solution has the chance to flourish.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight</p>",
  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>For decades a focal point of US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a notable absence in Monday's presidential debate.</p> <p>The only mention came when Mitt Romney was listing Barack Obama's supposed lack of progress in his first term: \"Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?\" the Republican candidate asked. \"No. They haven't had talks in two years.\"</p> <p>The lack of discussion reflects an agenda that is changing, partly as a result of upheaval elsewhere in the region and partly as a result of conscious efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to talk down the local conflict and talk up the threat from the Iranian nuclear programme. But it will deepen the disillusionment of many Palestinians with the commitment of the US to resolve the conflict, and perhaps increase their resolve to pursue alternative strategies, such as the bid for enhanced status at the United Nations.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>The candidates restated long-held positions. Asked by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, whether an attack by Iran on Israel would be considered an attack on the US, both said they would stand by Israel. (The more pertinent question \u2013 what would be your response if Israel unilaterally launched an attack? \u2013 came later, and got no answer.)</p> <p>Obama highlighted the difference between his position and Romney's: \"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he has often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake.\"</p> <p>Romney spoke of the need to tighten sanctions and take further steps to isolate the Iranian regime diplomatically. \"Of course, military action is a last resort,\" he said. \"It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent.\"</p> <p>In a cutting riposte, Obama said: \"There have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you would do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference.\"</p> <p>Volume, tone and perception count, of course. But on substance there may be little to choose between the two candidates.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>Romney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney-china-currency-manipulator\" title=\"\">renewed his pledge to label China a currency manipulator \"on day one\"</a>, arguing that the US was losing a silent trade war with the world's second-largest economy.</p> <p>Overall, the Republican candidate took a milder stance towards Beijing, telling viewers on Tuesday night: \"We can be a partner with China; we don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.\"</p> <p>But asked if he was formally accusing China of manipulating the yuan, and sparking a trade war, he replied: \"There's one going on right now, which we don't know about it. It's a silent one, and they're winning.\"</p> <p>\"We have to say to our friend in China \u2026 you can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, [and] counterfeiting our products [and] selling them around the world, even to the United States.\"</p> <p>The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through on his claims.</p> <p><strong>Tania Branigan in Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>As expected, the 49 countries of sub-Saharan Africa hardly registered in the final US presidential debate.</p> <p>\"Africa\" came up only once, when Barack Obama said: \"Our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>The sole reference to South Africa was to the era of white-minority rule, two decades ago. It came when Mitt Romney said, of Iran: \"I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah[s] they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.\"</p> <p>There was also a brief mention of Somalia, when Obama remarked: \"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.\" The US has carried out drone strikes, and provided equipment and training to the African Union peacekeeping force that drove al-Qaida-linked militants out of their strongholds in Somalia.</p> <p>At one point Romney noted: \"Mali has been taken over \u2013 the northern part of Mali \u2013 by al-Qaida-type individuals.\"</p> <p>But after four years in which a president whose father was Kenyan raised hopes but failed to set Africa alight, the slim pickings came as little surprise on a continent accustomed to being far down the global agenda.</p> <p>Daniel Silke, a political analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa, tweeted: \"#Africa barely exists in final #Obama #Romney Presidential debate last night.\"</p> <p>Another tweeter, named Bevan, posted: \"Africa only mentioned twice in whole debate (Obama/Romney),hope fellow Africans took note. Only Africans can n will develop Africa for all.\"</p> <p>Jacques Sibomana, an entrepreneur, tweeted: \"And Africa yet became a forgotten Continent during the debate #Romney and #Obama.\"</p> <p>Last week, two analysts, Witney Schneidman and Andrew Westbury, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210191196.html\" title=\"\">issued a plea</a> for Schieffer to ask the candidates about Africa. They wrote: \"We urge you to use your privilege as moderator to direct the country's attention to a part of the world that has never been more important, but seemingly never so neglected as it concerns American foreign policy priorities: sub-Saharan Africa.\" It appears Schieffer failed to heed them.</p> <p><strong>David Smith in Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>As with many other parts of the foreign policy debate, there was no daylight between the two candidates on Pakistan, with Mitt Romney using his time to try to demonstrate that he has some understanding of the country.</p> <p>He listed all the well-worn problems that, in the eyes of many US foreign policy experts, make Pakistan a troublesome country, albeit one the US can never afford to ignore.</p> <p>\"It is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the road to double that at some point,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Repeated reference was made to Pakistan's nuclear stockpile, including to the prospect of the country, of 180 million people, one day having more nuclear weapons than Britain.</p> <p>He also noted the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, an Afghan insurgent faction allied to the Taliban that has recently been designated a terrorist group by the US, and the threat that Taliban-sympathising ethnic Pashtuns in Pakistan may pose to Afghanistan after the end of the US combat mission, in 2014.</p> <p>He said: \"This is a nation which, if it becomes a failed state \u2026 there are nuclear weapons there, and you have terrorists that can grab those nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>With the stakes so high, Romney was never going to forgo any tools for dealing with Pakistan, including the supposedly secret drone programme run by the CIA. Although the unmanned aircraft are a major source of friction between Pakistan and the US, Romney said the US must use \"any and all means necessary\" to target terrorists. \"I support that entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy,\" he said.</p> <p>For his part, Obama simply let his record stand, using his time during the Afghanistan and Pakistan section to turn swiftly back to domestic policy, saying his strategy of building up the Afghan security forces would allow the US to divert resources to \"nation-building\" in the US.</p> <p><strong>Jon Boone in Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Obama attempted to paint Romney as out of touch by recalling his Republican challenger's statement that Russia was the United States's \"number one political foe\". He upped the ante a bit by saying Romney had called Russia the country's number one political \"threat\". Romney corrected him on that later in the debate: the main threat, he insisted, was Iran.</p> <p>\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\" Obama said, recalling Romney's words. \"Because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>That's what some Russians have been saying all along. Shortly after Romney made the statement, earlier this year, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, advised the candidates to \"check their clocks from time to time. It's 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"</p> <p>The hardliners inside Russia, including Vladimir Putin, instead welcomed the statement as \"blunt\" and \"straightforward\". They are likely to do the same with the thoughts Romney aired during the debate.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to wear rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr Putin,\" Romney said, noting that \"Russia does continue to battle us in the UN, time and time again\". He also noted Moscow's recent withdrawal from the Nunn-Lugar agreement on arms clean-up as a sign of receding US influence in the world.</p> <p>With US-Russian relations spiralling to new post-cold war lows, it will be hard for Russia's leaders to disagree with any of that. Many will probably be happy simply to know that someone in Washington DC has noticed.</p> <p><strong>Miriam Elder in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Europe </h2> <p>\"Our alliances,\" said Obama, \"have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>And for Europeans, that was it. The sole reference to Europe in the debate was a perfunctory passing remark from the president; the word Europe did not cross the lips of Romney at all.</p> <p>There was no eurocrisis, despite the Obama administration's worries about how the sovereign debt troubles might affect his re-election prospects, and despite the transatlantic pressure, on the Germans especially, to get to grips with the crisis.</p> <p>Germany was not mentioned once, and France just once, along with Britain, in another throwaway remark, contrasting high US defence spending with the thriftiness of others.</p> <p>The special relationship? The UK warranted one further single mention, Romney simply noting that Pakistan will soon have more nuclear warheads than Britain.</p> <p>But failure to mention Europe may be just the way the Europeans want it. After talking to French and European diplomats, Lib\u00e9ration's <a href=\"http://washington.blogs.liberation.fr/great\\_america/\" title=\"\">Washington blog</a> sensed they were OK with the fact that Europe had \"disappeared from America's radar\", happy that Obama was not blaming the eurozone crisis as a source of US economic woe, and that Romney had stopped riffing on the dangers of \"European socialism\" (in other words, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande).</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/dossiers/monde/election-presidentielle-americaine-2012/le-troisieme-debat-romney-un-obama-bis-23-10-2012-1519983\\_539.php\" title=\"\">Le Point</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections-americaines/2012/10/23/01040-20121023ARTFIG00278-face-a-romney-obama-l-emporte-sans-creuser-l-ecart.php\" title=\"\">Le Figaro</a> felt that Romney had passed the test of leadership stature by keeping calm and succeeding in coming across as a plausible possible president.</p> <p>In a taster of its front-page editorial, Le Monde said: \"Point taken: foreign politics plays no role in the American election. On 6 November, voters will decide on one issue alone: the economy.\"</p> <p>Despite the irrelevance of Europe to the campaign, European elites are, of course, keenly watching the US election. Support for Obama is overwhelming, even if disappointment with the last four years is palpable; wariness of Romney is widespread.</p> <p>A BBC opinion poll released on Monday showed sweeping support in Europe for Obama, with France, perhaps surprisingly, returning stronger backing for the incumbent than anywhere else in the world, 72% to 2% for Romney. Two-thirds of British and Germans supported Obama, while Romney enjoyed 7% and 8% levels. The poll was conducted last month.</p> <p>Romney's highest European support came from Poland. But even that was a niggardly 16%, probably because of the Republican contender's relatively hard line on Russia.</p> <p><strong>Ian Traynor in Brussels and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>It may be next door to the US with a population of 590 million people and some of the world's fastest growing economies, but Latin America barely received a mention during Monday night's debate.</p> <p>Obama failed to refer to anything on the continent south of the Rio Grande. Romney briefly accused the president of showing weakness towards Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and failing to take better advantage of the trade opportunities in the region, but the total time devoted to Latin America in the 90-minute-long debate was about 20 seconds.</p> <p>The sense of rejection was evident in the regional and Hispanic media.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/obama-romney-care-latin-america-mexico-brazil-cuba/story?id=17508488#.UIZBmmka8eY\" title=\"\">Obama and Romney Don't Care About Latin America</a>,\" said ABC-Univision, a major Spanish-language media group. Online commentators noted there was no mention of the drug war raging just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, insecurity in Central America, or free trade with Colombia.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/internacional/em-ultimo-debate-candidatos-tentam-conquistar-indecisos\" title=\"\">Nobody loves our Latin America very much</a>,\" wrote Caio Binder, a correspondent for Brazil's Veja magazine. Binder said Romney also got his numbers wrong in his brief mention of the region.</p> <p>In a positive description of the trade opportunity that the US had so far failed to take advantage of, Romney said: \"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We're all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2013 time zone, language opportunities.\"</p> <p>Binder commented acidly: \"Wrong, governor: According to the IMF, the GDP of Latin America (and the Caribbean) in 2011 was $ 5.6tn, while that of China was $7.3tn.\" Nonetheless, he said Romney had scored a point among Latin American voters for at least mentioning the region.</p> <p>The lack of attention to the region may disappoint the 21 million eligible Hispanic voters in the US, who are seen as potential deciders in three swing states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Colorado. In Florida, they are particularly strongly represented with 16% of eligible voters.</p> <p>Nationwide, polls suggest Obama has the support of about 65% support of this group, compared with 35% for Romney. In Florida they are almost level.</p> <p>But Romney's mentions of Ch\u00e1vez, Castro and trade prompted his supporters to claim he had made the case to Hispanic voters.</p> <p>\"I was very gratified that it was Mitt Romney who brought up Latin America, who talked of doing more trade with the region, and was the one who said we have issues in Venezuela, we have issues in Cuba,\" Hector Barreto, who chairs a Romney support group, told NBC.</p> <p>Obama's team claimed the president's actions spoke louder than his words. \"Two passing references to Latin America in a debate does not change the fundamentals of the president's record on Latin America: No president has visited the region more times, in his first four years in office, exports are up more than 50%, we have new free trade agreements with Colombia, and Panama, and all of that is a function of his leadership,\" said Dan Restrepo, who was the administration's top Latin America adviser.</p> <p>The oversight of Latin America was largely due to the moderator Bob Schieffer who choose not to raise related issues, such as regional diplomacy, trade, drug control and immigration. But language may also be a partial explanation. Although Romney talked of Latin America's \"language opportunities\" for the US and although most Hispanics in the US speak English, the two candidates were less enthused to raise Latin American issues in this debate in English compared to interviews they have given to the Spanish language media.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Asia </h2> <p>Neither Obama nor Romney mentioned anywhere in Asia but China during the debate, despite the fact that America's presence in the region has involved a considerable number of south-east Asian nations in recent months, and that only looks set to increase.</p> <p>The US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, visited Vietnam in June to promote greater ties between the former foes and stabilise a move whereby 60% of America's naval ships will be based in Asia Pacific by 2020. Then, last month in Jakarta, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, encouraged a regionally unified code of conduct for the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) in dealing with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea (Clinton later went on to visit both Timor-Leste and Brunei).</p> <p>And in the US, Obama met Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, who was allowed for the first time in two decades to visit the US, and was awarded Congress's highest medal. That meeting was followed by the easing of many of the travel restrictions and sanctions against the former pariah nation, and, just last week, the US military's invitation to Burma to participate in a joint Thai-American military drill involving south-east and east Asian nations. That invitation was the US's first such engagement with Burma since 1988.</p> <p>With some analysts expecting the region to be at the centre of any US-Chinese disagreements over shared geopolitical interests, such as the South China Sea, one may very well expect to hear more about south-east Asia in the near future.</p> <p><strong>Kate Hodal in Bangkok</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last week the Department for Communities and Local Government select committee held a special hearing on councillors and the community. The influential group of MPs heard evidence from four councillors: Robert Gordon and Stephen Giles-Medhurst, the leader and the opposition leader of Hertfordshire council, and Lucinda Yeadon and Stewart Golton, executive member for adult social care and leader of the Liberal Democrat group at Leeds city council respectively.</p> <p>All were asked for their views on what makes a good councillor. What qualities are important in a local representative and \u2013 perhaps most importantly \u2013 what puts people off standing for local office? Here we round up some of the most interesting comments from the session. Let us know what you think makes a good council member in the comments thread below.</p> <h2><strong>On the changing role of councillors:</strong></h2> <p>\"If we are talking about the role of individual members in their communities rather than the council corporately, it is about re-establishing the relationship with their communities; recognising that people are more informed these days and wish to participate more and to take greater control over their own lives and their communities. And creating a means by which that element of power could be returned to people,\" Gordon said.</p> <p>\"The role of the councillor changes \u2013 maybe it returns to what it once was. It changes from a delegate that goes off to the town hall to vote things through remotely and then to explain, to someone who should be an activist within the community, a facility to the community, someone who has access to some of the levers of power \u2026 and can help communities to respond to their problems as they perceive them to be.</p> <p>\"In terms of the readiness and the skills of current members to do it, some of them are very much up for it, but some of them it passes by entirely.\"</p> <h2><strong>On interaction with communities:</strong></h2> <p>\"It is very much about involving oneself with the community residents' associations, community groups. I go to an elderly residents' home on a quarterly basis; they would not come to surgeries even if I held surgeries. I no longer believe surgeries are of value,\" said Giles-Medhurst.</p> <p>\"No longer is it the case that the councils make a decision on everything and the councillor is your representative. Yes, the councillor is your representative but no longer do we have the control over the housing association. It has been delegated. There has been outsourcing.</p> <h2><strong>What makes a good councillor?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Giles-Medhurst:</strong> \"The ability to manage and also the ability to manage time and, depending on what type of authority you are on, it is also managing expectation.\"</p> <p><strong>Gordon:</strong> \"Being anchored in the community is essential, because it is a community role first and foremost. We all have leadership positions of various types, but we are all first and foremost a frontline councillor, and at the whim of the electorate we could end up back there, so being anchored in the community is hugely important; also, the ability to deal with modern technology.\"</p> <p><strong>Golton:</strong> \"One of the things you should have is an enquiring mind. The Liberal Democrats used to say that a councillor should be a cabinet member for their ward, but I think more importantly a councillor should be a scrutineer for their ward. They need to be questioning why things are delivered in the way that they are delivered. They need to enquire why this thing has not happened in their community. They need to be able to ask questions of their own constituents.\"</p> <p>So what qualities do you think a good councillor needs today?

  "<p>When Rio Ferdinand rebelled against the instruction of his boss and refused to wear the Kick It Out campaign T-shirt in the warm-up to Manchester United's Premier League match on Saturday, Alex Ferguson threatened to take action.</p> <p>The matter has now apparently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/22/sir-alex-ferguson-rio-ferdinand-t-shirt\" title=\"Sir Alex Ferguson has 'no issue' with Rio Ferdinand over T-shirt\">been resolved and put down to a \"communication issue\"</a>, but not before the Professional Footballers' Association promised to defend the player's \"rights as a human being, never mind as a footballer\". But what about his rights as an employee? Can an employer insist that you comply with the company's uniform or dress code? And what steps can be taken if you do not comply?</p> <p>In Ferdinand's situation, his non-wearing of the campaign T-shirt was more a case of undermining Alex Ferguson's authority in fairly unusual and specific circumstances. In most employment relationships, however, your expected dress code and appearance will be set out in your contract of employment or employee handbook.</p> <p>An employer can legitimately tell their employees to dress in a certain way at work, and workers generally do have to comply with this \u2013 as long as there is a good reason for such a code. If you are in an environment where you are meeting others and therefore represent the \"public face\" of your employer, then it is entirely in order for the code to specify that you dress smartly.</p> <p>Similarly, you be may required to dress in a certain way for health and safety reasons \u2013 wearing hard hats on a building site is the obvious example. In other cases, a uniform will be a necessity, for example, if you work for a transport firm or shop. In each case, a minimum standard of dress will be justified by employers to project a professional image or promote a sense of recognition or identity as part of an employer's team.</p> <p>Employers do, however, have to be consistent in their approach and ensure that any dress code is proportionate to what they are trying to achieve. Non-compliance with your employer's dress code can be a disciplinary offence, and ultimately you could be dismissed for not complying with the request if you have no good reason for refusing - unless you have been given no prior warnings or adequate time to comply.</p> <p>There will always be the thorny issue over whether being disciplined because you do not fit in with your employer's dress code or \"look\" can amount to a breach of your human rights, or even sex or race discrimination. In 2009, a disabled worker <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/aug/13/abercrombie-fitch-employee-case-damages\" title=\"\">won a tribunal claim against the flagship London store of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</a> after accusing the company of \"hiding\" her in a stockroom at its London store because her prosthetic arm didn't fit with the firm's \"look policy\".</p> <p>In the case of Eweida v British Airways, however, an employment tribunal found that a Christian employee who was sent home when she insisted on wearing a cross visibly, in breach of the employer's uniform policy, did not suffer indirect discrimination. The case is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/02/christian-rights-cases-strasbourg-court\" title=\"\">going through the European court of human rights</a>.</p> <p>The guiding principle in relation to an employee's standard of dress should, if possible, be based on the impact of that person's dress upon their ability to do the job, after the reasonable expected standards of the employer are taken into account. There will always be a divergence of opinions and this, of course, is only to be expected.</p> <p>Are you expected to dress in a certain way at work, and do you agree with it? Or have you cast a surprised eye over how some of your work colleagues dress?</p> <p><em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer at </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/philip_landau.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a></p>",
  "<p>He may not be the most famous businessman in Russia, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Vekselberg\" title=\"\">Viktor Vekselberg</a> is now the richest.</p> <p>That is the status the natural resources investor has been accorded by the <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/\" title=\"\">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>, following AAR's sale of its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $28bn (\u00a317.5bn) on Monday.</p> <p>Vekselberg is one of five Russian oligarchs who control the AAR consortium \u2013 alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Fridman\" title=\"\">Mikhail Fridman</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Blavatnik\" title=\"\">Leonard Blavatnik</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Khan\" title=\"\">German Khan</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Kuzmichov\" title=\"\">Alexey Kuzmichev</a> \u2013 and his latest deal means he is now worth $18bn and the 40th richest person in the world. That puts him more than $700m ahead of the metals and technology investor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisher_Usmanov\" title=\"\">Alisher Usmanov</a>, the Arsenal investor who had previously topped the list.</p> <p>The deal also added $1.2bn to Fridman's fortune, moving him past the Russian billionaires <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich\" title=\"\">Roman Abramovich</a>, the Chelsea owner, and the steel and mining billionaire <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Mordashov\" title=\"\">Alexey Mordashov</a>, according to Bloomberg, and making Fridman the country's fifth-richest person.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Blavatnik's fortune rose $1.5bn to $15.4bn, making him the 46th richest person in the world ahead of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Nike chairman Philip Knight, while Khan is worth $10.3bn and Kuzmichev $8bn, according to the index.</p> <p>Vekselberg's rise is fascinating. Born in western Ukraine, he trained as an engineer and went into business in 1990, in the dying months of the Soviet Union. By 1996 he had risen to become chairman of Tyumen Oil (TNK) and negotiated the 50-50 partnership between TNK and BP. He also co-founded his own aluminium group, subsequently part of the giant Rusal, with his business interests now managed by his Renova Group.</p> <p>During the bitter row between BP and its Russian billionaire partners, Vekselberg took a back-seat role, with Fridman and Khan leading the attack on BP. Managers of the British company had a better relationship with Vekselberg and Blavatnik than the other Russian investors, and regarded Vekselberg as a \"serious businessman\", sources suggested at the time.</p> <p>In a private 2008 meeting with the US's then ambassador in Moscow, John Burns, Vekselberg offered modest criticism of the Russian government. He suggested the Kremlin's response to the economic crisis had been \"slow\" and \"bemoaned that bureaucrats and ministries can't make decisions without permission from above\". \"I have great respect for our leaders, but \u2026\" Vekselberg told Burns, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable. He didn't mention Vladimir Putin by name.</p> <p>During the same meeting the billionaire described himself as \"half-American\" \u2013 his wife, Marina, and their two children, a daughter and a son, are all US citizens. He also pleaded for \"open communication\" between Russian business and the west; in his role as chair of the international affairs committee of the Union of Russian Industrialists and Entrepreneurs he has dispatched delegations to Washington to meet US officials. His pragmatic attitude towards the US is at odds with the ferocious anti-western rhetoric frequently emanating from the Kremlin.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Vekselberg \u2013 who is 56 \u2013 understands perfectly the rules of the game in Russia: that rich businessmen should stay out of politics. The fate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky \u2013 previously, like Vekselberg, Russia's richest man but now in jail \u2013 is obvious to all.</p> <p>In 2004 Vekselberg bought nine Faberg\u00e9 eggs from the Forbes family in New York. It was a patriotic gesture likely to endear him to those at the top of Russian power. The eggs were later shown off in the Kremlin.</p> <p>The revisions to the rich list occurred after the Kremlin-controlled oil group Rosneft said on Monday it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/bp-rosneft-deal-27-billion-dollars\" title=\"\">buy the whole of TNK-BP from AAR and BP for $55bn</a>. As AAR sells its 50% TNK-BP holding to Rosneft, simultaneously the British-based oil company is also offloading its 50% stake in the joint venture for cash and shares in Rosneft valued at about $27bn.</p> <p>The sale of TNK-BP has come after years of disputes between BP and AAR in which the pair have battled each other in the courts, AAR has blocked dividends from the joint venture and the Russian oligarchs have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/mar/24/bp-russian-deal-rosneft-blocked-court\" title=\"\">scuppered BP's hopes of an earlier tie-up with Rosneft in the Arctic</a>.</p> <p>While Vekselberg's fortune is on the rise, his ascent to the summit of his country's rich list was also was aided by woes for Usmanov. His fortune has dropped on the index by more than $1bn in the past week as MegaFon, Russia's second-largest mobile-phone company in which Usmanov is a key shareholder, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d4178f32-1c2a-11e2-a14a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2A0ay2Y1g\" title=\"\">postponed its London flotation</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The president of Uruguay, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, has announced plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/relaxation-cannabis-laws-war-on-drugs\" title=\"\">legalise the production and sale of marijuana</a> under a state monopoly, triggering a lively controversy in Montevideo. The relevant bill will soon be tabled in parliament, where the governing centre-left coalition led by the Broad Front (FA) enjoys a majority but is divided on this issue.</p> <p>Possessing and consuming marijuana was decriminalised in 2000. \"There is no question of Uruguay producing and distributing drugs, but the state will control and regulate the market,\" said interior minister Eduardo Bonomi.</p> <p>\"We have a progressive tradition,\" said Bonomi who, with Mujica, belonged to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/25/jose-mujica-favourite-uruguay-election\" title=\"\">Tupamaros urban guerrillas</a> in the 1970s. \"At the beginning of the 20th century our country ended the prohibition of alcohol, prostitution and gambling.\" Abortion is currently in the process ofbeing legalised. \"Our approach to marijuana is equally pragmatic,\" Bonomi said. \"The negative effects of consuming marijuana are far less harmful than the outbreak of violence associated with the black market.\"</p> <p>About 300,000 people (8% of the population) occasionally consume the drug.

  "<h2><strong>Antiquated dogmas</strong><br></h2> <p>Although it has been 22 years since the reunification of Germany there is still only limited interaction between East and West and, as a resident of Cologne (far in the West), I have hardly visited the East at all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/west-east-germany-split\" title=\"\">(After the Wall, 12 October)</a>. I decided to try to rectify this a few weeks ago when I stopped off in Magdeburg, a historic town in what used to be in the old East Germany.</p> <p>Since reunification a lot of work has been done to modernise Magdeburg. Beside the renovated communist monoliths there is a liberal scattering of hypermodern monoliths, mostly shopping centres, with funky names such as City Carr\u00e9e and All\u00e9e Centre containing the usual suspects of mainstream retail.</p> <p>Living in Cologne, I have become used to a city containing a whole range of small cafes, restaurants and quirky shops, so these were the things that I went looking for during my stay in Magdeburg. However, after almost an hour wandering around, I realised that I was not going to find these and all that central Magdeburg had to offer were empty streets and the usual chains that I could find anywhere in the world.</p> <p>My wanderings turned into a type of \"aha\" moment, as it became clear that the current trend towards corporate capitalism is not so different from old-style communism. Yes, communism had very few consumer products to offer and capitalism has a mind-boggling variety, but despite this difference the structures are remarkably similar, with both systems causing a high level of alienation.</p> <p>For example, under communism citizens were pawns of the state and would be set to work in factories or on collectivised farms without much of a say in anything. Eldorado for these people was the west with its access to seemingly endless consumer goodies.</p> <p>But this is not much different to our version of capitalism, where citizens are pawns of the corporations, condemned to dance to the tunes dictated by corporate employers. Both worlds have one very dark feature in common: the total disenfranchisement of the individual.</p> <p>Cologne may be chaotic but the people running the little toy-shop in the Z\u00fclpicherstrasse or the Literature-Cafe in Ehrenfeld are taking risks and are working all hours to make their dreams a reality. These things may exist somewhere in Magdeburg but this does not detract from the sterile, almost Orwellian impression that I got there. The truth is that you can be just as lost under a capitalist system as you can under communism.</p> <p>We should be digging out E&#xa0;F Schumacher's book Small is Beautiful and finding ways to engage in small-scale commerce, serving communities rather than being serfs to corporations or slaves to shareholder value. Neither full-blown capitalism nor full-blown socialism is the solution so we need to add another dimension to our discussions, which sadly seem to be stuck in a range of antiquated dogmas.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 Let's get this in proportion: one West German in five has never been to the East: how many southerners in Britain have never been north of Birmingham?<br><strong>Beryl Nicholson</strong><br>Newcastle upon Tyne, UK</p> <h2><strong>Guatemala land grab</strong><br></h2> <p>It is disturbing, if not surprising, to see that the oppression of indigenous populations and cultures is still rife in Guatemala <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/04/guatemala-palm-industry-locals-uncertain-future?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Guatemala's palm industry leaves farmers facing an uncertain future, 12 October)</a>.</p> <p>Rigoberta Mench\u00fa's graphic 1980s account of the genocidal onslaught by the ladino elite on the Quich\u00e9 Indian people seems to continue today. The appropriation of the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples by multinational companies is a blight on modern society, but so long as it brings growth and jobs the concept seems to be widely embraced.</p> <p>Except that it doesn't. The means of gaining a livelihood for most rural dwellers in developing countries is through agricultural production. Taking away this means of survival by duping farmers into selling their plots with the promise of permanent, well-paid, work is both a despicable deceit and a catalyst for tipping more people into poverty and despair.</p> <p>Plantations such as palm oil monocrops are also notoriously unfriendly to the environment. Biodiversity is decimated at a stroke as indigenous species of plants and animals are eliminated and prevented from returning.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Guatemala is not alone. A similar phenomenon is occurring in several African and Asian countries. In many developing countries the so-called land-grabbers are corrupting local governments and clearing productive land of local inhabitants and biota in order to grow export crops in an attempt to feed the world. In fact the net outcome is usually more misery and poverty, environmental mayhem, loss of biodiversity and fatter wallets for the few.<br><strong>Brian Sims</strong><br>Bedford, UK</p> <h2><strong>Questionable assumption</strong><br></h2> <p>Seumas Milne's polemic cannot go unchallenged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/violent-protests-blowback-us-intervention\" title=\"\">(Surprise is that there aren't more protests, 28 September)</a>.

This last tribune of the plebs \u2013 incisive and prescient as ever \u2013 wrote of the 18th century (and our 21st): \"Now the dramatic, and indeed for most people the diabolical, innovation of bourgeois society and its capitalist economy was that it had no place for these positive rights and duties [toward paupers, orphans, widows, and the old, per the Elizabethan poor law], and indeed tried to abolish them. To quote a 19-century folk song: If life was a thing that money could buy/ The rich might live and the poor might die.</p> <p>\"And often it was: and the poor were left to die, as in the great Irish famine. The point was not that the liberal economics did not mind if people died, let alone wanted them to. On the contrary, it argued with great force that the mechanisms of profit-making enterprise operating through the market would make most people better off than ever before.</p> <p>\"The point is that it could not, and did not want to, express this aspiration in the form of rights. There could be no place for, say, a right to employment or a right to earn a living wage in its system.

  "<p>Sixteen-year-old Pheakdei and Sakngea (not their real names) were jailed for two years for stealing a mobile phone worth just $20. The boys spent 18 months in detention awaiting trial, which was postponed twice because the prosecutor did not turn up, and once their case was heard they were sentenced to six months in prison \u2013 despite already having served time.</p> <p>It's not unusual for minors to have their human rights violated in Cambodia's judicial system, say NGO workers in the region, despite ratification of the <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/UNICEFs-Work/Our-mission/Childrens-rights/\" title=\"\">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> (UNCROC) in 1992.</p> <p>Cambodian children are often held in pretrial detention where they wait months to have their cases heard; are tried without legal counsel in ordinary criminal courts; are given long and inappropriate sentences for petty crimes such as theft; and are placed in adult jails, where they can experience physical and sexual abuse from adult prisoners and prison staff. Child witnesses and victims of crime are also often subjected to violations, including giving testimony in open court, where they have direct exposure to the perpetrator and their supporters, and they can face harsh cross-examination.</p> <p>The impact of this system on minors can be great. As Kimleng Ouk, the legal director of <a href=\"http://lac.org.kh/english/\" title=\"\">Legal Aid Cambodia</a> (LAC), a Khmer-run NGO that offers pro bono legal services to Cambodia's poor, says, children in contact with the law are at risk of \"prolonged interruption to their family life, education and their personal development\".&#xa0;</p> <p>However, a major initiative seeks to make a difference. <a href=\"http://www.childjustice.org/\" title=\"\">Children's Rights International</a> (CRI), an Australian-based organisation that promotes the rights of children mainly in developing countries, is working in partnership with LAC, as well as the department of justice (through a joint working party consisting of government and a range of NGOs such as <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a> and <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>) to introduce a child-friendly legal system in Cambodia.</p> <p>\"Children represent the future of Cambodia,\" says Alastair Nicholson, CRI's chair and a former chief justice of the family court of Australia. \"If the system respects their human rights, children are more likely to develop as law-abiding citizens and the future is good. If not, it is bleak.\"</p> <p>CRI's programme related to Cambodia's treatment of children will run over the next three years, and longer if necessary. It will consist of mainly volunteer Australian legal and social justice professionals who will work with Cambodian judges, prosecutors, court administrators, police, correction officials and others to raise awareness and expertise of child-friendly procedures that are in line with UNCROC principles.</p> <p>The programme will include the treatment of child offenders, victims and witnesses; the development and implementation of diversion programmes for child offenders away from the criminal justice system; improvement of court administration and case management in relation to children; and the care, custody and protection of children in contact with the law.</p> <p>CRI's programme coincides with the Cambodian government's draft juvenile justice law, which is anticipated to come into effect in 2013 after an 11-year gestation. Nicholson says that while this law won't create a separate specialist children's court, it is expected to incorporate important reform around non-custodial sentencing of minors and their diversion from the traditional justice system. CRI's programme, with its educational and training focus, will help Cambodia's police officials, prosecutors, judges, local authorities and community organisations, who often lack understanding of children's rights, in applying this law.</p> <p>The CRI programme and the new law come at a critical time. According to figures provided by Unicef, there has been a 92% increase in the number of under-18s in prison \u2013 from 403 in 2005 to 772 in 2010. These figures in large part reflect the hardship and turmoil caused by Cambodia's history. French colonialism, the Vietnam war, the genocide of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/khmer-rouge\" title=\"\">Khmer Rouge</a>, a Vietnamese invasion and civil war have devastated the country economically and socially, leaving many youths to fall into conflict with the law just to survive.</p> <p>Other NGOs have sought to address the violations children have been subjected to with a number of important services: monitoring and advocacy work; training professionals such as lawyers, prosecutors, judges and prison officials about best practice; offering legal representation to children; providing minors with healthcare, education and vocational programmes in prisons; and providing public education about the rights of children.</p> <p>For example, LAC's child justice programme trains government authorities and law enforcement officers in proper practices, establishes diversion programmes for children and advocates for the protection of children against unlawful pretrial detention.</p> <p>\"When LAC came, my life has changed,\" says Nhean (not his real name), who was 12 years old when he went to jail for seven-and-a-half years for theft \u2013 a crime that he says he didn't commit. He has never fully understood what he was supposed to have done.</p> <p>\"The beatings stopped. We had our own rooms [a small number of prisons have separate cells for children; however, they can have up to 50 children in them] so we did not have to be under the influence of the not-so-nice adult prisoners \u2026 I would have extra food, bathing materials and some laundry soap. They have encouraged us to learn some skills: hair cutting, electronics and motorcycle repair.\"</p> <p>The challenges are great. Institutional constraints, lack of resources, inadequate training of legal and social justice professionals in child-friendly approaches, low levels of co-operation, and corruption will all need to be tackled.</p> <p>But there is hope.</p> <p>Says Nicholson: \"I think it fair to say that it [Cambodia] has adopted child-friendly principles and this project is about putting them into practice. The developments to date give rise to confidence that Cambodia is serious about&#xa0;achieving these objects.\"</p>",

Even if it were possible to implant, say, a song in somebody's head in that fashion, it would be far too unreliable a \"science\" around which to base an act. That looking into people's eyes, reading their \"tells\" business is all lies, [or] else someone like Derren Brown would be paid millions by lawyers, casinos and police forces. There is no \"leg work\", just old-fashioned conjuring and the idea that he uses psychological expertise is the trick. The only mind game he's playing is the one that allows you to think he's a bit magic. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Just a step from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, at the heart of the docks undergoing a massive facelift in preparation for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2016\" title=\"\">2016 Olympics</a>, two workers await the verdict of three archaeologists at the bottom of a trench. Municipal workers have once again stumbled on the remains of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/04/archaeologists-find-slave-port\" title=\"\">Valongo wharf</a>, where the largest number of slaves imported to the Americas disembarked. A place to remember, a place of suffering long buried under the paving stones of this dazzling city.</p> <p>More than 600,000 slaves passed through in the early 19th century. The slave market stood nearby, much as the \"cemetery of new blacks\": new because they had just arrived. Since work started in 2010, a huge variety of bracelets, precious stones and personal items has been unearthed, tens of thousands of objects, says Tania Andrade Lima, who heads the dig.</p> <p>Work on the wharf has also revealed the scale of the slave trade in Brazil. Of the 9.5 million people captured in Africa and brought to the New World between the 16th and 19th century, nearly 4 million landed in Rio, 10 times more than all those sent to the United States.</p> <p>But for the last century Brazil has tried to forget its past, refusing to accept the legacy of the slave trade. It has sought to project the image of a country of mixed descent, where the colour of a person's skin does not count, a land unfettered by racism where cordial relations reign between citizens of Indian, European and African descent.</p> <p>Brazil was the last American nation to abolish slavery, on 13 May, 1888. At the time Rio represented the largest urban concentration of slaves since the end of the Roman empire, more than 40% of the population, almost a complete city in irons. Rio city council now plans to turn part of Valongo into an open-air archaeological site. \"This heritage can finally be recognised, shown off and used to combat our collective amnesia [...] regarding the black community,\" Lima suggests. The country is certainly changing. There are few people in Rio who would still describe it as a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_democracy\" title=\"\">racial democracy</a>\", a term coined by the sociologist and writer Gilberto Freyre. Black movements tend to refer to \"institutionalised racism\", a view endorsed, among others, by the Catholic church, which condemns discrimination and the persistence of a slave-based mindset.</p> <p>According to census results published in 2011 by the <a href=\"http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/\" title=\"\">Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics</a> (IBGE), <em>brancos</em> (whites) account for less than half the population for the first time since the 19th century. Approximately 51% see themselves as <em>preto</em> (black, 8%) or <em>pardo</em> (mixed, 43%), up by more than 5% on 2000. The statistics also show that Brazilians of colour are at a significant disadvantage compared with their white counterparts. Racial inequality is manifest in many respects, starting with the share-out of riches. Two-thirds of the poor are pretos or pardos. With the same qualifications, coloured people earn half as much as whites. A black woman only earns a quarter of the salary paid to a white male. According to a 2007 survey, coloured people only account for 3.5% of executives, 10% of university students, 5% of members of parliament, 3% of the judiciary. So there's room for more change.</p> <p>President Dilma Rousseff's 36-strong coalition government includes only one black minister, Luiza Helena de Bairros, secretary of state for racial equality. She is a worthy successor to Edison Arantes do Nascimento, aka Pel\u00e9, the first coloured man to serve as a minister (of sport) in 1994. All the figures confirm this situation, contradicting the impressions of passing visitors. \"Racism in Brazil is well hidden, subtle and unspoken, underestimated by the media,\" says Joaquim Barbosa, the first black judge to sit on the bench of the supreme court in Brasilia. \"It is nevertheless extremely violent.\" Appointed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\" title=\"\">President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva</a> (<em>left</em>) in 2003 and a well-known public figure, he recalls two occasions when white men handed him their car keys as he entered a fashionable restaurant in Rio. Being black they assumed he was a valet. \"But,\" he adds, \"things are slowly changing and awareness is growing.\"</p> <p>In a sensational decision this April the 10 supreme court judges unanimously ruled in favour of positive discrimination in higher education, declaring that the racial quotas in Brazilian universities were constitutional and redressed the \"social debt of slavery\". Dozens of expert witnesses were heard and the ruling was televised live.</p> <p>In August the senate passed a bill requiring federal universities to reserve half their places for students from state schools. Rousseff has signed the whole text into law; universities have till 2015 to comply. In practice the law mixes social and racial criteria, taking into account local particularities. It sets aside a quarter of all places in federal universities for students from families with an income less than or equal to one and a half times the minimum wage ($460). The other quarter will be allocated to students according to their self-declared skin colour.</p> <p>According to the daily <a href=\"http://oglobo.globo.com/\" title=\"\">O Globo</a> the law will more than double the number of affirmative-action places in Rio's four federal universities. They currently set aside 5,400 places for social quotas, but under the new arrangements their number will rise to 12,350. Opponents of the quota system have condemned the \"racialisation\" of Brazil, rooted in an increasingly ethnic approach to social affairs. Above all the ensuing debate seems to have put an end to the myth of racial democracy, in which skin colour does not count.</p> <p>A major change is apparently underway in what the sociologist Alberto Guerreiro Ramos called \"the most racist country in the world\", during the military dictatorship in the 1980s, a view endorsed by most of the experts Le Monde talked to. \"The quotas are the only alternative to the mechanisms of concealment and social exclusion set up since the end of slavery,\" says Spiritos Santos, the author of a lively blog on racial issues.</p> <p>\"This new phase is a revolution for Brazil,\" says David Raimundo dos Santos, a Franciscan friar who heads <a href=\"http://www.educafro.org.br/\" title=\"\">Educafro</a>, an NGO that campaigns to gain access to education for coloured people. He believes that blacks, once slave to a master, are now slaves to a system. \"Brazil is waking up and can now claim to have found a method for integration,\" he adds.</p> <p>Since independence in 1822, the Brazilian elite has sought to deny the nation's African roots. \"In an effort to glorify the past, while making no concessions to the Portuguese, the elite started by promoting the Indians, the original masters of the land and no threat to the slave-makers,\" says the historian Richard Marin. Blacks were sidelined. Even the abolitionist writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Barbosa\" title=\"\">Ruy Barbosa de Oliveirato</a>, then finance minister, authorised much of the government records of slavery to be destroyed in 1890.</p> <p>When slavery was finally abolished the former captives were left to fend for themselves. Unlike Abraham Lincoln, who established 4,000 schools for former slaves, Brazil did not open a single one. \"With no land nor education, cut off from any social organisation, the enfranchised blacks were condemned to misery,\" according to historian Alain Rouqui\u00e9. \"The long-awaited abolition ultimately entrenched inequality.\"</p> <p>Prior to the financial crisis of 1929 the boom in coffee production attracted 4 million immigrants from Europe with little concern for the country's colonial past. On the grounds that this young and prosperous nation could not flourish with a largely black population, European immigration was encouraged in order to \"whiten\" Brazil, to <em>limpar o sangue</em> (cleanse the blood).</p> <p>Efforts to reassert the country's racial legacy started in the 1920s with Brazilian Modernism, which cast off Europe's academic strictures, and the novels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1rio_de_Andrade\" title=\"\">Mario de Andrade</a>, which focused on the switch from a white to a black culture. In the 1930s the work of sociologist Gilberto Freyre \u2013 in particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa-Grande_%26_Senzala\" title=\"\">Casa Grande e Senzala</a> (Masters and Slaves) \u2013 highlighted racial mixing as one of Brazil's defining features. He made no distinction between the three main ethnic groups \u2013 Africans, Indians and Portuguese.</p> <p>This concept, which contrasted with the north American segregationist model, proved very popular in Brazil, boosting the legitimacy of the authoritarian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_%28Brazil%29\" title=\"\">Estado Novo</a> regime, in power during the second world war. Half-white, half-black <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Aparecida\" title=\"\">Nossa Senhora da&#xa0;Concei\u00e7ao Aparecida</a> became the country's patron saint.</p> <p>But there was a big gap between the supposed racial democracy and the actual condition of many Afro-Brazilians, the victims of racism. Concealed by the absence of legal segregation and the warmth of social intercourse, this \"cordial racism\" was denied.</p> <p>The debate on quotas started in the 1990s under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso\" title=\"\">President Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>. He set up working groups to discuss public action to promote the black community and made it compulsory for official documents to indicate skin colour. In 2002 Bahia State University introduced racial quotas, gradually followed by about 60 other establishments.</p> <p>Under Lula, the explicit goal of racial quotas was to compensate for the racial discrimination endured by blacks. After 10 years of debate and experiment the ruling by the supreme court endorses this approach.</p> <p>The streets of the Valongo neighbourhood have just been paved over and re-opened to traffic. This evening the first episode of a <em>telenovela</em> (soap), Lado a Lado (side by side) will be broadcast. It is the story of a black community after the abolition of slavery. \"It is an exciting and as yet little known period,\" said the lead actor, Lazaro Ramos. Could he be joking?</p> <p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a>, <em>which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",
  "<p>Suspects are being needlessly remanded in custody and denied a fair trial because of a severe shortage of qualified court interpreters, a Commons select committee has been told. An investigation into the privatised monopoly awarded to Applied Language Solutions (ALS) covering all courts in England and Wales heard the main professional bodies describe the agreement as \"unsalvageable\".</p> <p>The contract, awarded by the Ministry of Justice, came into force at the beginning of February but has been boycotted by most experienced court interpreters because of low rates of pay and poor travel expenses.</p> <p>Both the public accounts committee (PAC) and the justice select committee are taking evidence this month into the way in which the contract was awarded and how it is being operated following widespread complaints about cancelled court cases and the quality of service. The contract, worth as much as \u00a3300m over five years, according to some estimates, was originally granted to ALS. The services conglomerate Capita subsequently bought out the small Huddersfield firm and this summer brought in a new management team to run the business.</p> <p>Giving evidence to the justice select committee on Tuesday, Richard Atkinson, the chairman of the Law Society's criminal law committee, said: \"People are being remanded into custody for no other reason than the lack of interpreters. I would say they are being denied a fair trial process.</p> <p>\"[One] man was remanded on three separate occasions because of lack of interpreters. He spent three nights in custody.\" Magistrates eventually gave the suspect, with no previous record, bail and sent him to a court 50 miles away where they hoped an interpreter would be available.</p> <p>\"There was a crown court case at the end of September in Leicester,\" Atkinson added. It had been listed seven months earlier. \"On the first day of the trial neither of the Albanian interpreters were available so it had to be put off for a further day.. &#xa0;\u2026 Crown court trials cost, at least, thousands of pounds a day.\"</p> <p>John Fassenfelt, chairman of the Magistrates' Association, said: \"I had an example recently when there was a Russian interpreter. The defendant said something. The interpreter didn't translate it. This person's job was to interpret, not to decide 'that's not important'. It was a substantial [comment] and it did affect the sentence.\"</p> <p>Fassenfelt said a survey of magistrates had found that 90% felt the new contract with ALS \"did not work well\".</p> <p>Ted Sangster, the chair of the National Register of Public Service Interpreters, told the committee that he had experience of other Whitehall departments but had never dealt with the Ministry of Justice. Letters to the former justice secretary, Ken Clarke, had not been answered or even acknowledged. \"[The MoJ] are not prepared to listen,\" he said. \"They are arrogant and treat their stakeholders with disdain.\"</p> <p>Nick Rosenthal, the chair of the Institute of Translation and Interpreting, said: \"The rates of pay are so low that qualified professionals are no longer able or willing to work in [such a] system. The framework agreement [of the contract] is unsalvageable.\"</p> <p>Madeleine Lee, director of the Professional Interpreters' Alliance, agreed that the contract was unworkable. She told the committee that the company was wrongly recording failures to make bookings as \"court cancellations\". \"Barristers, solicitors, defendants and the general public are unable to lodge complaints because only court employees are allowed to put a complaint in,\" she explained.</p> <p>At the PAC hearing last week it emerged that senior MoJ officials had not read the credit report they themselves had commissioned which warned them not to give more than \u00a31m a year of business to ALS.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge MP, the PAC's chair, described the process as a \"shambles\". She told officials: \"You ask a financial data company for information on whether this is a credible company with which to do business. It advises you: 'Don't do business in excess of \u00a31m,' and you enter into a contract for \u00a342m [a year].. &#xa0;\u2026 What were you thinking about?\"</p> <p>Martin Jones, the deputy director of sentencing at the MoJ, replied: \"The crucial question for me, as the senior responsible owner, was that there had been a diligent procurement process by procurement professionals, which had recommended that this was the company that was most suitable for this contract.\"</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The Ministry of Justice had strong reasons to change the old interpreter booking system, which was inadequate in several respects, and this has been acknowledged by the National Audit Office.</p> <p>\"We have now seen a major improvement in performance, with more than 95% of bookings now being filled, and we are confident the trend is continuing.</p> <p>\"Complaints have also fallen dramatically and we will continue to push for further improvement. We remain confident the contract will make the expected saving of \u00a315m a year for the Ministry of Justice.\" The hearings continue.</p>",
  "<p>I normally retreat to BBC3 for comedy comfort food \u2013 Gavin and Stacey repeats, Russell Howard showing pictures of baby animals \u2013 so I was surprised when a hilarious slice of the surreal caught my attention. The six-part comedy Cuckoo isn't just another \"boy-meets-girl-meets-family\" show with vague overtones of My Family Christmas specials. Instead it resuscitates the suburban sitcom, wheels out the tropes \u2026 and then projectile vomits all over them like a middle-England dad whose son has accidentally peddled him ecstasy (see episode three for details).</p> <p>Saturday Night Live alumnus and Lonely Island singer Andy Samberg is well known in the US for offbeat TV (Portlandia, Parks and Recreation), but Cuckoo is his first UK role. He's the hippie stoner of the title, whose demonstrative behaviour and ranting rile new father-in-law Ken (Greg Davies). He is neither a doctor nor a lawyer nor an Aston Villa supporter as his spouse's dad would have preferred, but having met somewhat dippy Rachel on her gap year, he has moved into her family home in the Midlands and bought a van from which he plans to sell baked potatoes. (Don't ask where he got the cash.) </p> <p>Much of the comedy is derived from the dynamic between Ken and his irritant son-in-law, who has won the hearts of the female members of the Thomas family by pontificating about life and using Shreddies as a metaphor for love. And although the first episode was rather clunky, a slow start doesn't seem to have harmed Cuckoo's potential for laughs: with the bonds (or lack thereof) between the characters now fully established. </p> <p>As if the clash between Cuckoo (whale music, nude meditation) and Ken (would-be local councillor, Nazi history enthusiast) wasn't enough, exchanges between Ken and wife Lorna (Helen Baxendale) are toe-curlingly embarrassing, too. While there are touches of Mr Gilbert, the authoritarian Inbetweeners headmaster in Davies's \"dad\" act, he is also protective of his rather naive wife and they work well together. Then there's Dylan, as played by Outnumbered's Tyger Drew-Honey. Here, his character schemes, swears at this parents and lets his dad take his aforesaid ecstasy pills in lieu of Nurofen to avoid fessing up to buying drugs \u2013 all with a face like a bulldog being given an enema. He's the perfect moody teen.</p> <p>It's the uncomfortable situations \u2013 Ken being accused of perving over his son's teenage love interest; said girl's dad meekly hurling a chicken drumstick at him in protest; creepy student Zeb serenading Rachel \u00e0 la Nicole Scherzinger; Cuckoo making sexual comments about Rachel in front of her dad \u2013 that make this show so watchable.</p> <p>The potentially predictable is given a new edge of awkwardness thanks to the cutting dialogue and the timing of Davies and Samberg in particular. When their adversarial characters Cuckoo and Ken became best pals after some drug-fuelled bonding, the plot feels familiar but the execution fresh. Cuckoo isn't turgid and scenes don't outstay their welcome, with every half-hour episode managing to pack in plenty of twists.</p> <p>Last week's episode contained a large and welcome dollop of screen time for Samberg as Cuckoo joined the family on a trip to visit granddad, tried to administer \"birthday bumps\" and conducted an experiment to find out whether a cat was the reincarnation of grandma Debra. It played to all of Cuckoo's strengths: satirical yet sentimental, prosaic yet potty.</p>",
  "<p>When Skyfall, the 23rd entry in the James Bond series, finally hits UK screens on Friday, the British public will be divided into two factions: those planning to see it, and those assuming it had been out months ago. Even by the unsubtle standards of studio tentpoles, the marketing push for Skyfall has been a long-haul assault, stretching far beyond the standard (if especially ubiquitous) bus-side billboards, and trailers that have been on rotation since the spring.</p> <p>Though not a man averse to material pleasures, Bond himself might balk at the amount of promotional tie-ins being attached to his name this time around. The new film raises the bar for onscreen product placement, from 007's <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2012/09/25/tom-ford-on-daniel-craig-james-bond-skyfall-wardrobe\" title=\"\">Tom Ford-tailored suits</a> to Q's <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/sony-007-edition-vaio-tx-series-notebook\" title=\"\">Sony Vaio</a> hardware, as well as offscreen alliances ranging from Coke Zero to perfume retailers. (Yes, if you've always wanted to smell like Bond \u2013 presumably not after an intense chase sequence \u2013 the option is yours.) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/17/bond-taste-for-beer-skyfall\" title=\"\">His new tipple of choice, Heineken</a>, has proved an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/shortcuts/2012/apr/02/james-bond-product-placement\" title=\"\">ongoing sticking point</a> with fans, particularly after a big-budget ad that actually roped Daniel Craig into the action.</p> <p>However, with the Dutch beer having stumped up over \u00a328m for the privilege of seeing Bond sip from a green bottle in an early scene \u2013 coolly covering almost a third of the film's estimated \u00a393.7m ($150m) production budget in the process \u2013 the producers are willing to endure that indignity. Craig himself has been a diplomatic spokesman on the issue, acknowledging that their <a href=\"http://news.moviefone.com/2012/04/16/daniel-craig-skyfall-heineken-sponsor_n_1429567.html\" title=\"\">reliance on brand associations is \"unfortunate,\"</a> before countering: \"This movie costs a lot of money to make [and] nearly as much again to promote, so we go where we can.\"</p> <p>That quote is about as close as we're going to get to learning the film's actual marketing budget, given Sony Pictures International's customary reluctance to divulge such details. It would be a grey area in any case, since it's more difficult than usual to tell where this film's marketing begins and ends \u2013 particularly in this year of the Bond films' golden anniversary, when any number of external forces are collaborating to sanctify the franchise as a great British institution. 007 practically received a knighthood in his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AS-dCdYZbo&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">amiably goofy skit with the Queen</a> in July's Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 a stunt that may not have had Skyfall's enigmatic name anywhere on it, but pointedly raised awareness of the agent's return to a global audience of a billion.</p> <p>Indeed, while few of Bond's brands of choice \u2013 the venerable Aston Martin notwithstanding \u2013 are British, much of the marketing has worked towards underlining his UK heritage. Most prominent in this regard is a joint campaign with <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.com/en/Things-to-do/Culture/Live-like-James-Bond.htm\" title=\"\">VisitBritain</a>, which will be using the film to hawk British tourism to international audiences through viral and print advertising, as well as its first ever cinema ad, all united under the slogan \"Bond is Great \u2026 Britain.\"</p> <p>That's hardly an incidental affiliation for a film that, unusually for latter-day 007 entries, was largely shot on home soil in the wake of budget cuts at MGM, which filed for bankruptcy in 2010: climactic scenes may take place in London and the Highlands, but keen-eyed Londoners will also notice the capital doubling for Shanghai elsewhere. It may not look it, but the high-gloss, name-heavy Skyfall came in significantly cheaper than 2008's \u00a3125m <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\" title=\"\">Quantum of Solace</a>.</p> <p>The budget may be lower this time around, but the stakes are arguably higher. With a UK gross of almost \u00a351m and a global total of around \u00a3369m, Quantum of Solace fell short of the numbers attained by the series' first Craig-led outing, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103963/casino.royale\" title=\"\">Casino Royale</a>, in 2006. It was far from a flop, but it disappointingly failed to build on its predecessor's gutsy brand reinvention \u2013 except, that is, in China, where it significantly outpaced the previous film. <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/reports/features/reaching-for-the-sky/5047681.article\" title=\"\">Industry journalist Ian Sandwell</a>, who recently studied the film's release strategy for trade magazine Screen International, describes the film's Shanghai-set sequences as the film's \"ace in the pack\": given the vast Chinese market's sympathy toward blockbusters with local involvement, the decision to locate a major stretch of Skyfall's action there is no accident.</p> <p>With Skyfall looking to right the ship and exceed Casino Royale's global gross, the marketing materials haven't taken many chances, with posters chiefly highlighting the 007 brand and not bothering to name its starrier-than-usual cast or its unusually <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/21/skyfall-sam-mendes-daniel-craig\" title=\"\">A-list director Sam Mendes</a>, the first Oscar-winner to helm a Bond film. Sandwell believes this focus on fundamentals is the right approach: \"This could be a reaction to the perception of the Craig era to date, where perhaps the grittiness might have attracted the Bourne fans, yet alienated the Bond diehards. Skyfall's marketing has primarily been aimed at reassuring the traditional audience that they haven't been forgotten.\"</p> <p>So far, Skyfall is tracking well enough to suggest that the approach has paid off, buoyed by one factor the marketing men couldn't control: the overwhelmingly positive reviews that greeted its first screening nearly two weeks ago, which had some excitable journalists even predicting Oscar glory. The Guardian's box office expert, Charles Gant, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlesgant/statuses/257055289000480768\" title=\"\">tweeted a prediction</a> that the film will top Casino Royale to become the highest-grossing Bond film at the UK box office. That appears to be the expectation in the US too: the number-crunchers at <a href=\"http://www.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2012-09-long-range-forecast-skyfall\" title=\"\">BoxOffice.com are forecasting a Stateside gross of $216m</a>. As it turns out, the lyrics of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/02/adele-bond-theme-review\" title=\"\">Adele's theme song</a> (another marketing coup, as the series' first chart hit in years) aren't strictly accurate: the film's standing tall, all right, but the sky isn't falling.</p>",
  "<p>On 6 April 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/07/italy-earthquake-laquila\" title=\"\">an earthquake struck the Italian town of L'Aquila</a>, a medieval settlement built on an ancient lake nestled in the Apennines. More than 300 people died, and 20,000 buildings were destroyed. This much is clear, but much of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/22/scientists-convicted-manslaughter-earthquake?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the rest of the story</a> lies buried in an avalanche of distortion and misinformation.</p> <p>It began with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/05/laquila-earthquake-prediction-giampaolo-giuliani\" title=\"\">Giampaolo Giuliani</a>, a lab technician and would-be earthquake predictor. Tremors had been occurring in the region since January, but Giuliani used his own system \u2013 a discredited approach based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_prediction#Radon_emissions\" title=\"\">measuring radon gas released by stressed rock</a> \u2013 to predict a major earthquake on 29 March. Groups toured the area with megaphones warning residents to leave their homes, causing considerable panic, but no quake materialised.</p> <p>Two days later, the major risks committee, an expert panel that advises local authorities on risks of natural disasters, met in L'Aquila at the request of the Civil Protection Agency to discuss whether a major earthquake was imminent. The meeting was unusually quick, and had apparently been convened in part to reassure the public in the wake of Guiliani's bogus claims. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100622/full/465992a.html\" title=\"\">According to Nature</a>, the minutes show that \"at no point did any of the scientists say that there was 'no danger' of a big quake\", and volcanologist Franco Barberi gave the following, accurate summary: \"There is no reason to believe that a swarm of minor events is a sure predictor of a major shock.\"</p> <p>After the meeting, Bernardo De Bernardinis from the Civil Protection Agency walked out and addressed the press: \"The scientific community tells me there is no danger because there is an ongoing discharge of energy,\" he told them. \"The situation looks favourable.\" This was not accurate at all. It was 31 March 2009. Six days later, the earthquake struck. A year later, De Bernardinis and six scientists from the committee were indicted for manslaughter.</p> <p>The nature of these charges has been relentlessly misrepresented by the media, with Nature's superb reporting a notable exception. Fox News claimed: \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/05/27/italian-scientist-charged-manslaughter-failing-predict-earthquake/#ixzz2A4dwW5kG\" title=\"\">Italian Seismologists Charged With Manslaughter for Not Predicting 2009 Quake</a>\" when the prosecution was announced, and the ABC's headline echoed that statement: \"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/scientists-convicted-manslaughter-failing-predict-italian-quake/story?id=17536977#.UIXSFobhdKw\" title=\"\">Scientists Convicted of Manslaughter for Failing to Predict Italian Quake</a>\". Those headlines \u2013 and far too many like them \u2013 are simply untrue.</p> <p>The prosecutors, and the devastated families they represent, are well aware that scientists cannot predict earthquakes. The accusation they make is not that experts failed to predict the earthquake, but that they failed to properly assess and communicate the risks, telling residents they were safe without any scientific basis for doing so. The scientists involved say that the responsibility for this lies with De Bernardinis, who made the now infamous \"no danger\" statement. De Bernardinis claims that he made his statement in good faith, based on the advice he received. The prosecutor argues that regardless of who made the statement, the scientists on the committee are responsible for failing to come out and correct it.</p> <p>The seven were found guilty and sentenced to an incredible <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/italian-court-finds-seismologists-guilty-of-manslaughter-1.11640\" title=\"\">six years in prison</a>, more than even the prosecutor had requested. Under Italian law the judge's reasoning may not be made public for up to three months, but the impact on the scientific and risk assessment communities is likely to be more immediate. Few scientists will want to take responsibility for similar statements in the future, and those who do are likely to be biased toward crying wolf rather than facing the threat of possible prosecution if their assessments are in error.</p> <p>The story is a familiar one \u2013 politicians, experts and the media coming together in an unholy mixture of miscommunication and misinformation \u2013 but the consequences are highly unusual. The scientists involved screwed up, but to prosecute people who communicate risk wrongly while acting in good faith seems excessive, and raises another question: if scientists, why not others? Why not prosecute Giuliani for his false predictions? Can we sue Michael Fish over the hurricane? Can we sue the Daily Mail for misleading the public over climate change?</p> <p>The Italian prosecution is ludicrous, but no more so than the suing of people like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/21/us-company-suing-doctor-libel\" title=\"\">Dr Peter Wilmshurst</a> under Britain's libel laws. In both cases, the same principle needs to be protected: good science is built on open debate, and if seismologists can't express their opinions for fear of ending up in a court room, then many more lives could be put at risk in the future.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 October at 14:03. It originally referred to Dr Peter Wilmshurst being prosecuted, rather than sued. This has now been corrected</p>",
  "<p>Food activist and best selling author Anna Lapp\u00e9 is fastidious about protecting her children from increasing levels of toxins created by the agro-chemical industry.</p> <p>But even she was shocked to be told recently that the organic rice milk she had been giving to her older daughter was likely to be laced with arsenic.</p> <p>\"In my mind I thought my family was hermetically sealed and then the Consumers Union released their study on the large levels of arsenic in US organic rice,\" says the 34-year-old author of Diet for a Hot Planet, who this week launches a new campaign to challenge the marketing might of the large corporations who supply pesticides and antibiotics.</p> <p>\"One of the reasons for this is livestock factory farmers use arsenic-based drugs which should not be happening. It was such a reminder that we are all connected in this. Even though I don't buy factory farmed meat or dairy, those practices still affect my family so I need to do as much as I can to change these practices,\" she says.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9's mission is to not only confront the industrialisation of our agriculture but also to show that there is a more natural and sustainable way of feeding the world's growing population.</p> <p>While she does not see the big agro-chemical companies as being inherently bad, she sees their destructive behaviour as the natural consequence of an economic system that places profits ahead of wellbeing.</p> <p>\"It is not about some evil person in a corporate office twiddling their thumbs working out how to bring down the world,\" Lapp\u00e9 explains.</p> <p>\"This is the inevitable outcome when you have consolidated corporate control on the food system. A few companies are profiting heartily from industrial agriculture and their mandate is to deliver the highest returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis and the way that they are doing that is through pushing products that are not good for our health or the planet.</p> <p>\"Look at a company like Bayer CropScience, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Its recent sustainability messaging says it is helping feed the world. But when you look at their core products, they are one of the biggest providers of antibiotics into the livestock industry. Antibiotics and factory farms are one of the leading reasons behind a major public health crisis of antibiotic resistance, yet they are lobbying heavily to ensure there are not stricter regulations on antibiotics in farming in the US.</p> <p>\"One of their most profitable products is a pesticide that covers 90% of corn seed in the US and new studies have just come up linking that particular pesticide with the disappearance of bees.\"</p> <p>Not only do big corporations have large budgets to play with, but they have political leverage through their lobbying activities. Lapp\u00e9 points out that for every elected politician in Washington there are approximately three dozen lobbyists acting on behalf of corporations.</p> <p>This is why she believes it is so important to create an alternative narrative. While campaigning over a 12-year period and taking part in more than 700 events, she kept hearing the same questions being asked: can we feed the world with sustainable agricultural techniques? Is organic really better? And wasn't she just being an interfering food nanny?</p> <p>\"Then I paid a lot of attention to the communications coming from the food industry and realised that the questions people were asking were the talking points that were coming from the food industry,\" she says.</p> <p>\"There is a deliberate effort on the part of the companies that are profiting from chemical agriculture to shape the narrative.</p> <p>\"Our modestly budgeted <a href=\"http://foodmyths.org/organizers/\" title=\"\">Food Mythbusters</a> campaign is an attempt to expose people to the scientific literature and help people understand the truth behind the marketing messages.\"</p> <p>Global studies, she argues, from organisation such as the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">OECD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/\" title=\"\">the UN</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\" title=\"\">World Bank</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight\" title=\"\">UK's Foresight report</a>, are making an increasingly compelling case for the need for sustainable agriculture.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 also says increasing numbers of people are experiencing personal transformations about the need to change their eating habits.</p> <p>But aren't products such as organic food, with their higher price tags, the preserve only of the middle classes? Lapp\u00e9 disagrees: \"I have met many people who are struggling to put food on their table and work two jobs and have had the biggest epiphanies. People are painfully aware of the crisis in their communities, such as around diabetes.</p> <p>\"You realise that once people have that shift in consciousness, you cannot unlearn this. So it is encouraging that more people understand that this is not just about me changing my practices but we are in this together.\"</p> <p>While recognising that some of the companies she targets have CSR programmes in place and individuals who would like to do more, she says their hands are tied by the core business model.</p> <p>She focuses in on Coca Cola, pointing out that while it has \"all these fancy sustainability reports, what is its core product? A sweetened beverage that is bad for your health, that is dehydrating, that uses large amounts of water and that science has shown is linked to the obesity epidemic.</p> <p>\"We cannot expect the corporations profiting from the system to be the drivers of change. The drivers have to come from outside and we have to work to create a policy and regulatory environment that levels the playing field, so that those actors who are truly sustainable are able to get in the game.\"</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 says there are few incentives to help farmers introduce sustainable practices and that this is highlighted by the fact that only 5% of the research budget from the US Department of Agriculture goes into this arena.</p> <p>In the past, she believed it would take a real crisis to wake people up to the reality of our destructive agricultural practices but now she is not so sure, pointing out how little has changed despite the terrible drought of the summer that saw half the counties declared as disaster zones.</p> <p>The proposed farm bill on Capitol Hill which plans to create a new government-funded crop insurance programme does not even require farmers to take any steps to make their farms more resilient.</p> <p>\"We know from the science that in 40-50 years industrial agriculture based on mined minerals, high energy demands for synthetic fertiliser and huge amounts of water will not be viable,\" she says. \"My concern is we will wait that long before we change.\"</p> <p>So doesn't Lapp\u00e9 despair that so little progress has been made? She admits that the world is moving rapidly in the wrong direction, represented by the rise of genetically modified produce and the fact that only 1% of US corn is eaten directly, with the majority going to feed livestock or create fuel.</p> <p>But that only convinces her more of the need for civil society to come together to confront the power structures that maintain the status quo.</p> <p>She highlights the victories that have been achieved. A decade ago there was not a single programme linking farmers to public schools but now they exist in every state.</p> <p>Thirty years ago there were only a few hundred farmers markets in the US, but now there are more than 7000.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 says: \"We have been called Pollyanas and na\u00efve with our head in the clouds. But if you look back at what has been successful and where we have seen real success, it's when people come together to organise on two fronts; to make policy change and organising around forcing corporations to do the right thing.</p> <p>\"We can really see where we have made some big strides. Before we stepped in, for example, the original proposed organic standard would have allowed farmers to use sewage sludge, genetically engineered seeds and to irradiate their food and call it organic.\"</p> <p>What also keeps her committed is seeing how other activists have kept going even when the odds have been stacked against them. She mentions Indian eco-feminist Vandana Shiva, who has just launched a campaign against seed slavery, and Kenyan environmentalist and political activist Wangari Maathai.</p> <p>\"I met Maathai when President Moi was still in power,\" says Lapp\u00e9. \"She had just lost one of her biggest funders and been threatened with arrest for her organising and she was struggling to keep the organisation together in the face of this dictatorship. If you had told her at that point she would win the Nobel peace prize she would have fallen off the chair laughing.</p> <p>\"I look at my colleagues trying to transform the food industry. I think we do it from a place of feeling we have no choice but to keep trying and to take real pride in the wins we do achieve.\"</p> <p>The greatest influence in her life has been her mother, who has spent the last 40 years campaigning against the chemical industry.</p> <p>The two of them were looking at some of her old notes recently and recognised how the warnings about the dangers of industrial agriculture she was making back in the 1970s still resonate as strongly today.</p> <p>\"I am saying what my mother said 40 years ago but there are two reasons why I am not depressed,\" she says. \"Firstly it is proof of the staying power of the science.</p> <p>\"Secondly, do you think the members of the board of Coca Cola are sitting around at their annual meeting looking at a presentation about how many billions of dollars the company is going to spend telling people yet again to drink Coke this year and saying 'I can't believe we are saying the same thing we did 100 years ago.' They know that they are in the business of shaping consciousness and that is an ongoing process that never ends.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>This week's Clip joint is by Patrick Scott, culture editor for the student newspaper <a href=\"http://www.cherwell.org/\">Cherwell</a>. Check out his profile <a href=\"http://www.cherwell.org/profile/patrick-scott\">here</a>. </p> <h2>Location</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Phoenix_Picturehouse/\">The Phoenix Picturehouse</a> is about 15 minutes' walk from Oxford city centre. Located in the Jericho area, slightly beyond the offices of the Oxford University Press, it is surrounded by nice places to eat and drink.</p> <h2>The building</h2> <p>The picturehouse was first opened as a cinema in 1913 under the name The North Oxford Kinema. It has undergone several changes of ownership, becoming the Phoenix Cinema in 1989 before being incorporated into the Picturehouse chain. The building is small but the available space is well used, with one bigger (about 200 seats) and one smaller (about 100 seats) screening room as well as a cosy upstairs bar/cafe.</p> <h2>The clientele</h2> <p>Phoenix audiences are generally friendly and respectful of the film. You won't be frowned at every time you clear your throat but you won't need to tut at people chatting and using their phones. Food and drink are allowed. A perfect balance, you might say.</p> <h2>The programme</h2> <p>The biggest releases are always shown and there's a strong nod to foreign and independent film. Four or five films are shown in any given week, and there are also live theatre performances, as well as opera and ballet. Some films have screenings specifically tailored for over-60s, and for parents with small children. </p> <h2>Pricing</h2> <p>The prices are in line with the bigger cinema chains but the best way to benefit is probably through one of the <a href=\"http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/cinema/Phoenix_Picturehouse/Picturehouse_Membership/\">membership deals</a>, which get you free tickets as well as lots of different discounts. </p> <h2>Further comments</h2> <p>The Phoenix Picturehouse is, above all, a place where it is easy to enjoy cinema. It has the pleasing effect of seeming luxurious without the prices being higher than the bigger cinema outlets. The staff are helpful, the seats are comfortable and the food and drink is superior. All the conditions are in place for a good experience.</p> <h2>The Twitter view</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheClapperBored/status/260371612937895936\">@TheClapperBored</a></p> <blockquote> <p>It's an excellent cinema for students and town residents alike, with an interesting programme, super bar and good prices</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CherwellFilmTV/status/260371920682369024\">@CherwellFilmTV</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The best place in Oxford to watch mainstream and independent movies \u2013 super-trendy and impressively middle-class snacks</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/__Sophia/status/260372054602293249\">@__Sophia</a></p> <blockquote> <p>A little gem, eager to participate within the Oxford community, be it through hosting film festivals, university events, etc</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/beckymarklawson/status/260373671661678593\">@beckymarklawson</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Seats are uncomfortable and the sound is bad but they have a great wine list </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Frank O'Connor, born <a href=\"http://frankoconnor.ucc.ie/foc_and_mod.php?teanga=\" title=\"\">Michael O'Donovan</a> in Cork in 1903, strikes me as one of those unfortunate authors who's far from forgotten, but is so familiar a part of the Irish literary furniture that he's rarely much noticed. Often these days it's not his stories that are quoted, but passages from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780971865990/the-lonely-voice-a-study-of-the-short-story\" title=\"\">The Lonely Voice</a> (1963), his book-length study of the short story. It's unsurprising that this book should prove so hardy: O'Connor was compelling when voicing an opinion. What Richard Ellmann calls the \"assumptive tone\" of his criticism can inspire, thrill and infuriate, but will never bore. \"He was like a man who takes a machine gun to a shooting gallery,\" wrote Sean O'Faolain. \"Everybody falls flat on his face, the proprietor at once takes to the hills, and when it is all over, and you cautiously peep up, you find that he has wrecked the place but got three perfect bull's-eyes.\"</p> <p>If his criticism could be scattershot, his stories are the acme of patient craft. Speaking to a student journalist at University College Dublin in the early 1960s, O'Connor described a writing process that incorporated both extremes of his character: \"I hate to write a story over a period of even two days because then I lose the mood. I write my stories as though they were lyrics \u2026 I like to get the essence, the spirit of a story down in about four hours \u2013 in any old rigmarole (I've got to catch it like a poem). And then I polish it endlessly. In my latest book there are stories I have rewritten 50 times.\"</p> <p>This labour-intensive process gave his stories what he called, referring to Chekhov's work, their \"bony structure\", meaning an absolute solidity of construction. Yet their surface is all conversational ease, a story arriving from the next barstool along. O'Connor tellingly preferred to call his audience \"listeners\" rather than \"readers\", and believed passionately that the story should ring \"with the tone of a man's voice, speaking\". This effortless flow (achieved only after much effort) misleads some readers, as Benedict Kiely noted, into believing that O'Connor is \"all surface and no depth\". But in fact many of his best stories, including \"The Uprooted\", \"In the Train\", \"Michael's Wife\" and \"The Mad Lomasneys\", gain their great power from the way in which they combine the intimacy and familiarity of the oral tradition with a Chekhovian objectivity.</p> <p>The balance between these two approaches shifts from story to story, but was present throughout O'Connor's career. It's there in one of his earliest and most famous stories, <a href=\"http://www.gs.cidsnet.de/englisch-online/Grundkurs3/levko.htm#text2\" title=\"\">\"Guests of the Nation\"</a>, the title story of his 1931 debut collection. O'Connor had done \"odd jobs\" for the IRA during the revolutionary period, and fought on the Republican side in the Civil War, and 10 of the stories in his first collection were war stories. The obvious parallel here is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/10/brief-survey-short-story-isaac-babel\" title=\"\">Isaac Babel</a>, who just a few years before had turned his experiences as a Soviet soldier on the Polish front into Red Cavalry (1925), and indeed O'Connor said that \"the man who has influenced me most, I suppose, is really Isaac Babel\". Yet their military stories are quite different, O'Connor sharing none of the heated relish Babel took in recounting violence. Instead, at the end of \"Guests of the Nation\" the narrator, having become friends with and then taken part in executing two British soldiers, stands looking out over \"the little patch of black bog with the two Englishmen stiffening into it\" and is gripped by the certainty that his youth, and whatever revolutionary fervour he had previously held, have both been destroyed. However many times it's read, the story's stark energy does not dissipate.</p> <p>Where Babel and O'Connor are closer is the skill and emotion they bring to their child narrators, as well as a shared regard for Maupassant (both writers named stories for him). O'Connor's finest stories, though, aren't his portraits of childhood, or those that focus on what Julian Barnes terms his \"bristly, fierce, manipulative\" gallery of priests. They are the ones that most powerfully capture what he thought characterised the short story above all else: \"an intense awareness of human loneliness\". Supreme among these is \"The Uprooted\" (from his best collection, 1944's <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1981/oct/08/oconnors-crab-apple-jelly/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">Crab Apple Jelly</a>), which follows two brothers on a trip home for the Easter weekend. Quiet Ned, a schoolteacher, has been \"failed\" by Dublin: \"He no longer knew why he had come to the city, but it was not for the sake of the bed-sitting room in Rathmines, the oblong of dusty garden outside the window, the trams clanging up and down, the shelf full of second-hand books, or the occasional visit to the pictures.\" Meanwhile the ordination of his more assertive brother, Tom, \"seemed to have shut him off from the rest of the family, and now it was as though he were trying to surmount it by his boisterous manner and affected bonhomie. He was like a man shouting to his comrades across a great distance.\" Both men are living lives they find intolerable, their frustration only succeeding in sealing them deeper within their loneliness. The story, the most lyrical that O'Connor ever wrote, is also one of his most pessimistic. \"We made our choice a long time ago,\" Ned says in response to Tom's suggestion that he marry a local girl. \"We can't go back on it now.\"</p> <p>\"A good short story must be news,\" O'Connor said, and his vast body of work contains much that has, through emotional honesty and quality of observation, stayed news. Yeats said O'Connor was \"doing for Ireland what Chekhov did for Russia\", and whether describing gunmen in the bogs, the inhabitants of lonely farmhouses, or poor Rita Lomasney living wild while all the time becoming ensnared by bourgeois Catholic convention, his best stories attain a distinct psychological and emotional richness. There is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/frankoconnoraward\" title=\"\">a fine short story prize given in his name each year in Cork</a>, but the greater monument remains his stories.</p> <p><strong>Next up: </strong>John Cheever</p>",
  "<p><em>Training to become a lawyer is a competitive and expensive business. Unfortunately, finding where help comes from can be a challenge and a bit time-consuming. Here's a guide to what's on offer at the different stages of your journey into the law that might help make it a bit less bumpy.</em></p> <h2>Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) and Legal Practice Course (LPC)<br></h2> <p>Non-law graduates looking to pursue a career as a solicitor or barrister will have to complete the year-long conversion course or GDL. The cost varies from around \u00a34,000 to \u00a310,000 depending on where you study.</p> <p>Those who want to become solicitors then have to pass the LPC, which also lasts a year, and costs between \u00a37,000 and \u00a313,000 (although there are now some fast track programmes available), before completing a two-year training contract.</p> <p>Trainee solicitors currently receive a mandatory minimum salary of \u00a316,650 (\u00a318,590 in central London). However, that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/17/trainee-solicitors-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">being scrapped</a> from August 2014, after which firms will only be obliged to pay the national minimum wage of \u00a311,265 a year. Trainee salaries vary enormously depending on the size of the firm. Those at large regional, national and City firms could expect to receive anywhere from \u00a320-40,000 a year, while those in legal aid and smaller high street practices will receive considerably less.</p> <h2>Law school scholarships </h2> <p>The law schools providing the professional courses offer numerous scholarships to help talented students meet the costs. Again, it's a case of trawling through the websites and prospectuses to find out what they offer and whether you might qualify.</p> <p>Selection can be based on an application or following tests, essay or presentation assessments.</p> <p>Here are a couple to get you going: The College of Law has just extended its Gold Award, which provides up to \u00a33,000 to non-law graduates taking the GDL.</p> <p>They are open to students with a first class undergraduate degree or a distinction at masters level. It offered 60 of the awards to help students who started the programme in September and will now offer 30 more to students starting the course in January 2013.</p> <p>The awards are open to students accepting a place on the full time course and are aimed at students without sponsorship from a firm or chambers, although part-sponsored students will be considered.</p> <p>Successful applicants will receive \u00a32,000 towards their tuition fees. If they go on to study the LPC or BTPC at the college, they will receive a further \u00a31,000 towards the fees, providing they are still unsponsored.</p> <p>Eligible students can <a href=\"http://gdlgoldaward@lawcol.co.uk\" title=\"\">email</a> for information. You will be required to submit a statement setting out what winning the award would mean to you and how it would help you attain your ambition of a career in law. The closing date is 7 December.</p> <p>Kaplan Law School offers two diversity scholarships, giving LPC students, who have attended a non-fee paying secondary school or college for their A-levels, a 15% reduction on their fees.</p> <h2>Sponsorship from firms </h2> <p>A number of law firms, generally the large City and top 100 commercial practices, sponsor the students that they give training contracts to, paying GDL and LPC fees as well as maintenance costs. Many of these firms stipulate which law school you must attend as they provide courses tailored to the needs of the particular firm. Details are provided on the firms' websites.</p> <p>You can also get information from The Training and Pupillages Handbook, a new version of which will be published at the end of October. It is made available free to university careers services and law departments, but can also be <a href=\"http://www.lawcareers.net\" title=\"\">purchased online</a>.</p> <h2>Bank loans </h2> <p>If you have no other funding option, you might want to consider professional and career development loans offered by high street banks. Barclays Bank and the Co-operative will lend GDL and LPC students between \u00a3300 and \u00a310,000. Interest rates are lower than for standard loans and you will not have to repay the loan until you have finished the course. Investec Bank offers loans for full time students studying at BPP.</p> <h2>Charities and grant-making trusts</h2> <p>There may be charities and grant-making trusts to which some students can apply. Details of can be sought from the local library (if you still have one) and the local authority awards officer. The website <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/\" title=\"\">turn2us</a> provides a searchable database of benefits and grants available. Qualification for these awards varies hugely, and they usually only provide small amounts of money, so don't rely on one to provide full financial support for either tuition or maintenance.</p> <h2>The Law Society's Diversity Access Scheme </h2> <p>To help improve social mobility in the legal profession, the scheme offers LPC scholarships to talented students who have overcome exceptional social, educational, financial or personal obstacles to train to qualify as a solicitor. Since it was set up in 2004, the scheme has helped 113 students, including some who have been in local authority care, resisted coercion into arranged marriage, and battled with severe physical disabilities. It also provides successful applicants with work experience and mentoring.</p> <p>Last year it assisted 30 students. The Society has just confirmed that the scheme, which is supported by several law firms and law schools as well as by the Law Society's charity, will be available next year. Details of how to apply will be posted on the <a href=\"http://www.juniorlawyers.lawsociety.org.uk/funding-studies\" title=\"\">Junior Lawyers Division website</a> at the start of next year.</p> <h2>The Graham Rushton Award for visually impaired law students </h2> <p>Graham Rushton was a blind lawyer who left a large sum of money to the RNIB to be spent on assisting blind and partially sighted law students.The <a href=\"http://juniorlawyers.lawsociety.org.uk/node/13682\" title=\"\">grant is around \u00a37,000</a>.</p> <h2>Awards and scholarships to fund work experience</h2> <p>A number of other awards and scholarships exist to fund overseas work experience. These include the <a href=\"http://www.hrla.org.uk/Bursary_2011.php\" title=\"\">Human Rights Lawyers' Association bursary scheme</a> which enables law students to undertake internships, work placements and other poorly paid work in human rights law. It provides around five awards and a maximum annual bursary fund of \u00a36,000.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hubbardlawscholarship.com.\" title=\"\">H M Hubbard Law Scholarship</a>, for trainee and qualified solicitors, funds the study of law and legal procedures in France, Spain or Canada.The Inderpal Rahal Memorial Trust provides grants towards legal training for women from an immigrant or refugee background who intend to practise or teach law in the UK.

  "<p>The British film-maker Tony Scott was on antidepressants and had taken sleeping medication before leaping from a Los Angeles suspension bridge in August but did not have cancer, a preliminary autopsy <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/uk-usa-filmmaker-suicide-idUKBRE89M00V20121023\" title=\"'Tony Scott died with antidepressant, sleep aid in system'\">report suggests</a>.</p> <p>The LA county coroner's office also confirmed yesterday that Scott's death was suicide, though his motive remains a mystery. A number of suicide notes reportedly contained no details of why the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78743/top.gun\" title=\"The 1986 film with Meg Ryan and Tom Cruise\">Top Gun </a>director chose to kill himself. The report said Scott's immediate cause of death was blunt force trauma and drowning. Non-toxic levels of the antidepressant mirtazapine and the prescription sleeping pill Lunesta were in his system.</p> <p>The last person to see Scott alive was a passerby parking his car on the Vincent Thomas bridge over Los Angeles harbour. He saw the director leap into the water just after noon on 19 August. Scott's body was recovered by law enforcement a few hours later.

  "<p>On 8 December 1999, at 8.23pm, I fell in love with another man. Roy Keane probably wouldn't care much for this revelation, but then I'm pretty sure I wasn't alone. The context was a long-forgotten match between Manchester United and Valencia in the long-forgotten second group stage of the Champions League. Long forgotten, that is, by everybody except those besotted with Roy Keane.</p> <p>For the preceding five months, there was a serious danger that Keane, aged 28 and at the peak of his not inconsiderable powers, would leave United. His contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000, and United were unwilling to break their rigid wage structure to give Keane the \u00a350,000 a week he wanted. Moves to Juventus and Bayern Munich were frequently discussed in the press; the Bosman rule meant that, as of 1 January 2000, Keane could discuss terms with foreign clubs. All that scaremongering about the Millennium Bug had nothing on the millennial angst felt around Old Trafford. The word 'unthinkable' does not begin to do justice to the thought of that United side without Keane. Impasses are usually tedious; this was terrifying.</p> <p>Then, on the afternoon of United's match against Valencia, the club announced that Keane had signed a new contract. It was a match United had to win; they had lost the first group game away to Fiorentina, largely because of a rare and hideous error from Keane. A fortnight later he righted that wrong, slamming in a joyously emphatic opening goal from the edge of the area. Keane had already made far greater contributions for United, most famously away to Juventus in the previous season's semi-final, but the combination of the goal and the earlier defenestration of the desperate thought of a world without him made it a nigh-on perfect moment. The sort that makes you realise that, even when you grow old and doddery, and when you wouldn't recognise your other teenage heroes if they were stood in front of you holding a walking stick, you will still love Roy Keane.</p> <p>There is something about Keane that inspires such extreme devotion \u2013 and also wonder. At the 2012 Soccer Aid event, superstars like Robbie Williams and Will Ferrell were clearly in awe of Keane. Most fans of big English clubs other than United hate him, of course, and in that respect Keane is an uber-Marmite figure: those who love him would generally be willing to go to the ends of the earth for any unspecified Keane-related purpose. As a player, he was of his time by not being of his time: he captured the pre-millennium angst of the outsider who cannot understand the world of which he is part. In doing so he brought to mind a number of pop-culture characters of a similar disposition. Two in particular: Tyler Durden in Fight Club and Tony Soprano in The Sopranos. Like Keane, both raged, raged against the dying of society's light. There are other similarities. The intense adoration Keane receives evokes that of Tyler Durden, while his obtuse charisma, anti-heroism and scattergun frustration is shared by Tony Soprano. Keane, like Soprano, was raging for a better world and a better him. He has always been an incredibly complex man, a compelling fusion of instinctive intelligence and pathological desire.</p> <p>Keane, like Tony Soprano, is a mass of often uncomfortable contradictions. Thank goodness for that. The most interesting people in life are invariably flawed, and Keane has been the most interesting person in British football for the last few decades \u2013 an outsider even down to his Diadora boots, never mind the candour that is so rare in modern football. What kind of hero would you prefer? Prom kings are for dreamers and liars. Having Roy Keane as a hero allows a vicarious ride through life in all its miserable glory.</p> <p>For all his success \u2013 Keane won seven Premier League, four FA Cups and, although he'd tell you otherwise, one European Cup at Manchester United \u2013 football has often been brutally unkind to him. He was booted out mercilessly by a club and manager to whom he had given his soul and body. He missed out on his only European Cup final because of suspension. A year later, when he seemed to be on a personal mission to win the trophy \u2013 he scored six Champions League goals that season, almost half his career total of 14, and played with almost demented purpose \u2013 he then scored an own goal and missed an open goal in the quarter-final defeat to Real Madrid. Having got Ireland to the World Cup in 2002 with arguably the greatest football of his career, he missed out on the tournament because of his infamous row with Mick McCarthy. Keane always defined himself and his teams by global competition; you only have to see his boyish excitement as he stood pitchside for ITV ahead of Milan v Barcelona to realise that. Despite playing some awe-inspiring football for Ireland and for United in Europe, he played just in just one major tournament and no European finals.</p> <p>If this tells us of the essentially cruel nature of football, they will not necessarily be our abiding memories of Keane. We will remember him as somebody who personified leadership, who controlled games with forensic intelligence, who was a grossly underrated passer and who, on occasion, put the fear of God into both opponents and teammates. That was a consequence of an intractable obsession with excellence. Keane combined a higher state of concentration and an inhuman perfectionism to consistently reach a level of performance beyond almost anyone else \u2013 even if that level of performance regularly did not satisfy the critic within. He was not interested in glory. Glory was something that came if you did your job properly. That, nor heroism, interested him. \"You can be a hero \u2013 whatever that is,\" he sniffed in his autobiography.</p> <p>Players of Keane's type are regularly described as 'winners', and with good reason. Keane did not so much have a will to win as a need to win. \"If I was putting Roy Keane out there to represent Manchester United on a one against one, we'd win the Derby, the National, the Boat Race and anything else,\" Sir Alex Ferguson once said. \"It's an incredible thing he's got.\"</p> <p>It was not just winning that interested Keane, however. He was equally concerned with excellence and personal pride; winning was usually the result of the exhibition of those qualities. It was not necessarily a deal-breaker. In his autobiography he talks about the performance that first caught the attention of Nottingham Forest scouts. His team were 5-0 down with a few minutes to go. Everybody else had waved the white flag, but Keane kept doing the right things: demanding possession, moving the ball on crisply, putting out fires when the opposition had the ball. The qualities were in evidence at Forest, too: in 1992-93, the first season of the Premier League, Keane fought a lone, heroic and ultimately doomed battle to keep Forest in the Premier League.</p> <p>Keane detested mediocrity, and sometimes that need for excellence proved overwhelming. It is no coincidence that his infamous foul on Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001 came immediately after Manchester City had equalised at Old Trafford. United were already champions, but they had surrendered feebly in Europe to Bayern Munich earlier in the week and Keane was convinced they were in the comfort zone. When City \u2013 a poor side who would be relegated \u2013 equalised, it all bubbled over. Prawn sandwiches, mediocrity, couldn't even beat City at home, comfort zone, Haaland in possession. \"Alfie was taking the piss\". Bang. Haaland was toppled like a folding deckchair and Keane was the villain again.</p> <p>Keane's detractors say he was little more than a thug who went round booting people at a time when the game's laws had not evolved sufficiently. This is such offensive poppycock that it barely merits mention. The primary weapons in Keane's arsenal, by a distance, were his energy, positional sense and game intelligence. Never was this more evident than during a magnificent performance in the 1996 FA Cup final against Liverpool. The game is remembered for Eric Cantona's masterful late winner, which clinched the Double for United and completed his fairytale; justly so, yet that goal was infinitesimal in the grand scheme. In this game, as much as any others, Keane's footballing philosophy emphatically came to pass.</p> <p>This particular devil has always been obsessed with detail, and the minutiae of football matches. \"They say God is in the detail; in football that's true,\" he said in his autobiography. \"Sometimes games are won by a magical goal \u2013 that's what people remember. But the essence of the game is more mundane. Detail. Wearing down the opposition. Winning the psychological battles \u2013 man on man \u2013 from the moment the ref blows the whistle for the first time.\" Keane called it the Law of Cumulation. \"First tackle, first pass, first touch, everything counts. A lot of little things add up to the thing that matters: breaking the opposition's hearts \u2013 but first their minds, their collective mind.\"</p> <p>Liverpool were a dangerous, free-flowing side who created umpteen chances in the two league games against United that season: a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford and a 2-0 win at Anfield that could have been 8-0 but for Peter Schmeichel. Keane did not play at Anfield, but he grudgingly respected Liverpool's abundant attacking talent: Robbie Fowler, Jamie Redknapp and Steve McManaman all played the most progressive football of their career under Roy Evans. The unpredictable brilliance of Stan Collymore was also worthy of respect. Keane's fear of Liverpool's capabilities was accompanied by loathing. In short, he couldn't stand them. The notion of the Spice Boys was anathema. Lee Sharpe tells a story of him and an \"absolutely smashed\" Keane bumping into the Liverpool players in a bar one Saturday night. Keane went through them one by one, dismissing their England B caps, England under-21 caps and League Cup winners' medals. The gist, frequently expressed, was simple: \"What the hell have you done in the game?\"</p> <p>Then they turned at Wembley in cream Armani suits. The FA Cup final had been turned into fancy dress day, a jolly boys' outing. You can only imagine the unremitting contempt on Keane's face as he looked those sartorial monstrosities up and down. With help from his trusted lieutenant Nicky Butt, Keane shut Liverpool down with remorselessness, concentration and intelligence. They had barely a chance all game. It was one of the great defensive-midfield performances. It meant the game, as hyped as any FA Cup final in the modern era, was a stinker, but are you going to tell Roy Keane that was a bad thing?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lifesapitch.co.uk/order-a-copy-of-the-lifes-a-pitch-anthology/?utm_source=Life\" title=\"\"><em>This is an extract from a chapter in Life's a Pitch: The Passions of the Press Box</em></a><em>, which includes essays from 18 writers, including Dominic Fifield, Jonathan Wilson and Rory Smith, and a cover quote from Rafa Benitez: \"These are the writers as you don't normally see them: when they are fans with pens.\"</em></p>",
  "<p>An experiment from major authors including Neil Gaiman and Cory Doctorow, which allows readers to pay the price of their choice for a collection of ebooks, has shattered all expectations, racking up sales of more than $1.1m (\u00a3700,000) in under two weeks.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.humblebundle.com/\" title=\"\">Humble ebook Bundle</a> \u2013 an extension to ebooks of an experiment in pricing from Humble Bundle which has already been applied to music and games \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/09/customers-pay-what-want\" title=\"\">went live on 9 October</a> \u2013 offering customers a selection of novels and comics by award-winning science fiction and fantasy writers including Gaiman, Doctorow, Lauren Beukes, Paolo Bacigalupi, John Scalzi and Kelly Link. The packages is \"DRM-free\", which means readers are not restricted in how many times they download or copy the ebooks.</p> <p>Although, if sold separately, the collection of books would cost $157, readers are allowed to choose the price they want to pay for the bundle. They can also choose how they want to split their payment: between the authors, a selection of charities, and organiser Humble Bundle itself.</p> <p>So far, 80,625 bundles of books have been sold, for an average price of $14.18 (if readers pay more than the average, extra content is unlocked). The promotion closes later today, and as of this morning had pulled in $1,143,151.85, with one user paying a whopping $1,238 for the 13 books.</p> <p>Beukes, whose Arthur C Clarke award-winning novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9780857660541/zoo-city\" title=\"\">Zoo City</a> was part of the bundle, said she initially just saw the concept as \"a grand, crazy experiment that might get the book out to some new readers\".</p> <p>\"I didn't realise there would be over 75,000 of them spending more than a million dollars in two weeks on books! As John Scalzi pointed out, this is New York Times bestseller-level sales. And for a lesser-known author like me it's meant that it's eclipsed all my sales on Zoo City to date in two weeks. Two weeks! The response has been gobsmacking and humbling and amazing,\" she said. \"Allowing people to control how much they want to pay and how they want to split the payment between charity, the authors and a tip for Humble, with extra content if you pay more than the average is just freaking ingenious. It's about respecting and rewarding the readers. People feel like they're getting a great deal and helping good causes.\"</p> <p>Nebula winner Paolo Bacigalupi, whose short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9781597802024/pump-six-and-other-stories\" title=\"\">Pump Six and Other Stories</a> was in the Humble Bundle, agreed. \"To me, Humble Bundle looked like an interesting low-risk experiment to see how people might value ebooks, and how they behave with a variable pricing model. I had a positive experience in the past where one of my publishers simply gave away DRM-free ebooks for the io9 book club \u2013 and that increased our traditional sales thanks to the publicity exposure. Humble Bundle seemed like it might have that potential, but with the added benefit that it introduced an actual sales and revenue opportunity as well. Obviously, I had no idea that this would be as successful as it has been,\" he said.</p> <p>Humble Bundle is now planning future ebook bundles. Its business development director Robert Martinez said the last two weeks' experiment had made an impact on the ebooks scene \"that cannot be ignored\".</p> <p>\"The reception to this ebook bundle has been outstanding and we couldn't be more thrilled. The average price that customers are choosing to pay for this bundle is unprecedented at over $14. This is, by far, the highest average we have ever experienced for a pay-what-you-want promotion, and we believe it is a great indication for the future of ebooks and Humble Bundle,\" he said.</p> <p>Martinez believes that the \"pay-what-you-want mechanic\" only works because Humble Bundle is transparent about where the money is going.</p> <p>\"By allowing a consumer to decide exactly where their money goes (and how much), then suddenly they are in the controlling position. This, in essence, is why we believe our model works,\" he said. \"Once we transparently empower the customer to judge the value of the promotion (and those involved), we suddenly create a relationship that makes it much more likely for them to want to reciprocate in kind.\"</p>",
  "<p>Neil Smith, who has died aged 58 of liver failure, brought a new dimension to geography by exploring the relationship between cities, the wider world and capitalism. If we want to understand the economic system's workings, he argued, then we have to understand the spaces that make its existence possible. And if we want to live in a saner environment \u2013 natural and built \u2013 we need to revolutionise the ways in which it is produced.</p> <p>As an undergraduate at St Andrews, Scotland, Neil studied the way in which gentrification had become a global force in the shaping of cities. In addition to middle-class people seeking better lifestyles, he pointed to the rent-gap, the difference between the rent a property earns currently and what it could earn if redeveloped for new inhabitants. When the gap is big enough, private capital is attracted by the financial potential, and restructuring follows.</p> <p>By the time of his book The New Urban Frontier (1996), Neil was an academic based in the US and the argument had acquired a political aspect. It highlighted an effect akin to revenge as richer people returned from the suburbs to repossess inner-city areas, their interests combining with those of private capital to the detriment of the poorer people living there. In the process, public policy initiatives such as zero-tolerance policing served to criminalise the marginalised and homeless.</p> <p>Neil's arguments about gentrification were part of a larger examination of how capitalism shapes nature and geographical space, whether land, sea, air or buildings. His PhD dissertation at <a href=\"http://www.jhu.edu/\" title=\"\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, Baltimore, became the book Uneven Development (1984), taking up the term that Karl Marx had used for the emergence of simultaneous concentrations of wealth and poverty. The example of humanly induced climate change demonstrates how we produce nature without being able to control it \u2013 a significant insight for the field of political ecology, studying the flow of environmental benefits and costs.</p> <p>This approach to geography attracted scholars in such fields as anthropology and sociology to the study of space and place. Neil's curiosity as to why pioneering work such as his came comparatively late to geography resulted in a study of Isaiah Bowman, geographer to Presidents Woodrow Wilson during the first world war and Franklin D Roosevelt during the second. American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization (2003), is a biography-cum-political history of America's rise to global power through \u2013 rather than despite \u2013 geographical ignorance.</p> <p>In Neil's view this field of study was bankrupt in the US in large part because that suited the rise of American-led, capitalist liberalism, a theme further developed in his final book, The Endgame of Globalization (2005). The effectiveness of his arguments was recognised by the discipline he so strongly criticised: the <a href=\"http://www.aag.org/\" title=\"\">Association of American Geographers</a> awarded him Distinguished Scholarship Honours, its highest award.</p> <p>Born in Leith, Neil was one of the four children of a schoolteacher and his wife. He grew up in Dalkeith, to the south-east of Edinburgh, where he developed an early passion for birdwatching that he never lost. His ferocious intellect, passionate commitment to socialism and lively Scottish sense of humour made him someone who might be disagreed with but not ignored. You wanted to argue with him, and he wanted to argue right back. \"The battle for ideas,\" he was fond of saying, \"is just too important to leave to others.\"</p> <p>Neil taught at Columbia University (1982-86) and <a href=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/\" title=\"\">Rutgers University</a> (1986-2000), where I was his student, before he was made professor of anthropology and geography at the City University of New York. There he founded and directed the Centre for Place Culture and Politics, where political activists and academics felt equally at home. He made time for his students over a beer or a meal, when, despite commitments that took him all over the world, he devoted himself to our ideas and the ruthless but comradely critique of them.</p> <p>Neil's marriage to geographer Cindi Katz was followed by a partnership with another geographer, Deb Cowen. At their home in Toronto, Neil pursued another of his great passions, gardening \u2013 a production of nature that he fully approved of. Deb survives him, as do his sister, Sheila, and brothers Derek and Harvey.</p> <p>\u2022 Neil Robert Smith, geographer and anthropologist, born 18 July 1954; died 29 September 2012</p>",

  "<p>The Emir of Qatar has become the first head of state to visit Gaza since the Islamist movement Hamas took control of the tiny enclave more than five years ago.</p> <p>Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt at the border crossing of Rafah, which is also the headquarters of illegal trading through a vast network of tunnels which flourished after Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza in 2007. He was given a red-carpet welcome by Hamas officials.</p> <p>The emir was due to inaugurate a $254m (\u00a3160m) investment programme in Gaza by the Sunni Gulf state. Among the projects funded by the Qataris is a new housing development on the site of a former Israeli settlement, evacuated in 2005, and several new roads through the territory.</p> <p>Qatari flags and posters expressing thanks were strung along streets as a 30-vehicle convoy, filled with Qatari security forces, made advance preparations for the visit.</p> <p>Sheikh Hamad was expected to address a rally at a stadium in Gaza City later on Tuesday.</p> <p>Hamas welcomed the emir's visit. \"It is the first visit by an Arab leader at this level to Gaza,\" it said in a statement. \"This breaks the political isolation of the government and opens the door to break the siege.\"</p> <p>Despite winning democratic elections in 2006, Hamas has been largely isolated by the international community since it took control of Gaza in a bloody battle with its rival faction, Fatah. However, some European governments are believed to maintain back-channel contacts with the Islamist party.</p> <p>Iran, which had been a key patron of Hamas, has withheld funding for the faction since its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/hamas-pm-backs-syrian-protests\" title=\"\">refusal to back the Syrian regime in its civil war</a>. Qatar has called for military intervention in Syria to topple the government.</p> <p>In the wake of the breach with Tehran and the rise of Islamist parties in the Arab spring, Hamas has built up relations elsewhere in the region, most notably its parent organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.</p> <p>Mohammed Morsi, the Egyptian president, welcomed the emir's visit, saying it was part of his country's efforts to \"break the siege on the people\" of Gaza.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said that while Qatari help for the people of Gaza was welcome, the \"legitimate representation of the Palestinian people\" must be preserved.</p> <p>Hamas promised tight security for Sheikh Hamad's visit. The visit comes amid an ongoing cycle of Israeli air strikes and militant rocket fire from Gaza.</p> <p>Early on Tuesday, an Israeli soldier was critically injured in an explosion close to the border fence between Gaza and Israel.</p> <p>The emir was expected to return to Egypt later on Tuesday.</p>",
  "<p>Worries about economic growth are to the fore again, after a couple of consumer groups warned on the outlook.</p> <p><strong>Whitbread</strong>, the Premier Inn, Beefeater and Costa Coffee business, said first half profits had climbed by 11% and revenues by 14%, but chief executive Andy Harrison sounded a note of caution:</p> <blockquote> Our consumer market context continues to be broadly flat. Against this background we expect to continue to outperform our competitors and like for like sales growth to be more moderate than the high levels achieved in the first half. </blockquote> <p>The company's shares are down 55p to \u00a322.68 and James Hollins at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Whitbread's first half was marginally behind our estimates and there is no impetus from the trading outlook statement to warrant a 2013 forecast increase. The strong first half top-line performance is unlikely to be replicated in the second six months and we retain our bear stance given our negative view on the group's UK hotels and restaurants returns and limited international hotel growth opportunities. Costa remains an exciting story, but, for superior long-term group growth and returns, we prefer InterContinental. </blockquote> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/23/mulberry-shares-crash-profits-warning\" title=\"\">profit warning from luxury goods group</a> <strong>Mulberry</strong> indicated the problems were more widespread, and the news hit Burberry shares, down 47p at \u00a311.25. Burberry itself issued a warning on trading in early September.</p> <p>Jonathan Pritchard at Oriel Securities said Mulberry's UK performance was fine, with the difficulties mainly in overseas markets, particularly Asia:</p> <blockquote> We think that these international problems are becoming a developing trend in retail and in general. The first inkling of this came from Tesco at their interims (we had to take overseas targets down by 20% earlier in the month). <br> We would emphasise our view that Mulberry trades in a different market to the parts of the retail sector that we cover. However the wider picture will make us keep an eye on developments at Ted Baker and Supergroup in <br>particular, and to a degree Mothercare and Asos. Read-across for Burberry would be negative too. <br> </blockquote> <p>With this negative news, investors were shying away from risk once more, so mining and banking shares were unwanted. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> is down 30.5p at 726p as metal prices fall on worries about falling Chinese demand, while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has fallen 4.5p to 277p.</p> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is 0.72p lower at 40.095p as Nomura repeated its reduce rating and Investec issued a sell note. Investec analyst Ian Gordon turned to the Netherlands for his latest negative thought on Lloyds:</p> <blockquote> It may not surprise that, as per CBS data yesterday, Dutch house prices fell in September; down 0.5% month-on-month, down 7.9% year-on-year. Indeed, we may be guilty of obsessing on this issue given that Lloyds has somewhat bigger problems at home, e.g. payment protection insurance, where we expect a material increase in its existing \u00a34.3bn provision, or its \u00a3327bn UK mortgage portfolio with 11.1% in negative equity even before prices fell 1.6% in the third quarter. But we do see Lloyds' Dutch exposure as a drag on its (generally improving) bad debt story. <br> <br>We do not suggest that Dutch impairments are likely to become individually significant in group terms, but given the lightly provisioned, high loan-to-value nature of Lloyds' \u00a35.8bn exposure, with some risk of a sustained decline in asset values, we expect impairments to grow from nominal levels seen to date. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down 36.51 points at 5846.40.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Hopkins' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-double-drones-afghanistan\" title=\"\">Guardian article</a> gives further proof of our leap into an opaque drone age. It is not that all drones are bad drones; rather, decisions are being made that will ripple through the generations. Just as the secret Manhattan Project ushered in the nuclear age, so the military and their corporate colleagues are pressing forward with policies with very little public disclosure or debate.</p> <p>Consider David Cameron's claim that British drones have killed 124 insurgents in Afghanistan; Hopkins reports that \"defence officials said they had no idea where the prime minister got the figure and denied it was from the MoD\". Does this mean that our kill-numbers are being conjured up by politicians?</p> <p>There are many more questions that beg for an answer. One is the degree to which drones are to be used simply as a weapon of terror. In <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raf.mod.uk%2Frafcms%2Fmediafiles%2F9E435312_5056_A318_A88F14CF6F4FC6CE.pdf&amp;ei=2k-GUNSNBYWi0QXQi4CYBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0SoUigMJMphpnkEglc6sZzk6xgQ&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">British Air and Space Power Doctrine</a>, the MoD informs us that \"air power is not employed solely for kinetic purposes. The psychological impact of air power from the presence of a UAV [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] \u2026 has often proved to be extremely effective in exerting influence, especially when linked to information operations.\" In plain English, the circling drones are used to terrify the citizens below into providing intelligence. Did not the Geneva conventions forbid such a war against civilians? Did we forget so soon how the material frightened out of people in the \"war on terror\" proved so suspect?</p> <p>The most harrowing histories I heard in my recent trip to the Pakistan border regions involved the fear factor \u2013 800,000 concededly innocent men, women and children in the region terrified by the sounds of drones overhead, 24 hours a day. To what extent is this to be an intentional policy? Is it regulated? Or even debated?</p> <p>Hopkins' article tells us, for the first time, that the UK will control its videogame killing machines from Britain. Previously the British \"pilots\" sat drinking coffee side by side with their American counterparts in their console chairs in Nevada.</p> <p>The British people need to be told the true reasons for this shift. One, no doubt, is the US predilection for what is called \"chopping\", a 21st-century euphemism that means a \"change in operational control\". A Nato or British drone might be on the Pakistan border when the US decides to kill someone in Waziristan \u2013 just another international war crime to the CIA, but an act that the UK would rather was committed with no British fingerprints. So the machine metamorphoses into an American drone and the US \"pilot\" slips into the comfy chair to let loose the Hellfire missile. Moving the controls to RAF Waddington may make this kind of blurred line easier to define, but it does not erase the moral and legal issues.</p> <p>The blurring of lines is a drone speciality. The US could not fly F16s to bomb an unwilling ally but \u2013 for a number of reasons \u2013 the CIA feels no compunction about sending drones over Pakistan. A recent MoD paper called <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.raf.mod.uk%2Frafcms%2Fmediafiles%2F25D5C042_5056_A318_A835C1D1CA01B071.pdf&amp;ei=eVCGUO37GcKL0AXJwYGoBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbYL8A4TCKGKdzFlVqvNaIJ_q8nQ\" title=\"\">Future Air and Space Operational Concept</a> speaks of a world that is \"free of the constraints of physical barriers and national boundaries\". In other words, might gives us the right in our robot world. Perhaps the UK does not yet run its Reaper drones across the Durand Line, the indistinct border between Pakistan and Afghanistan concocted by the British in 1893. However, even today they fly along the line, and drones can see many miles into the neighbouring country, sharing the intelligence with our US allies.</p> <p>On Tuesday, we have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-double-drones-afghanistan\" title=\"\">case in the high court</a> about British fingerprints at the crime scene. The judges will decide whether the government may blithely refuse to reveal its \"policy\" when it comes to sharing intelligence with those who commit international war crimes \u2013 for that is surely what the US is doing in Pakistan. The government is paying three QCs to assert its right to silence \u2013 every time they share a cup of coffee it costs the taxpayer hundreds of pounds.</p> <p>Why, you may well ask, should politicians, military men and corporations make these decisions in such secrecy when we will all live with them in the decades to come?</p>",
  "<p>Daniel Conn left school at 18 and started work as an administrator for Mercedes-Benz near his home in Brighton. He soon wished he hadn't spurned the idea of going to university and began investigating Open University (OU) courses, but he never quite found the courage to apply. </p> <p>Then he discovered the OU's OpenLearn website, which offers 650 Open University study units free online. After working his way through four in computing and maths (and doing an online Harvard University course on the side) he thought he might as well get a qualification. </p> <p>Now approaching 30, he is studying for a part-time OU degree in computing, which he hopes to finish in 2015.</p> <p>\"The OpenLearn materials give you the gist of what the course is about and whether you can do it,\" he says. \"It definitely gave me a lot of confidence.\"</p> <p>The OU is not the only university that has started offering courses free online. Over the past couple of years increasing numbers of universities across Europe and the US have set up web-based resources known as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). These MOOCs make recorded lectures, course materials and academic discussion forums freely available to anyone who wants to use them.</p> <p>Jonathan Kydd, dean of the University of London International Programmes, which last month began offering free courses in psychology, computer programming and law through the US online education provider Coursera, says the involvement of top-rated institutions such as Stanford and Harvard has made this kind of free distance learning particularly appealing. </p> <p>\"You are going to inspire students because they are going to get [access to] a high proportion of people who are household names and who are both great researchers and great teachers,\" he says.</p> <p>Universities use free courses not only as a shop window for the other courses they offer, but also as a way of sharing good practice with other institutions, experimenting with new technology and of seeing what does and doesn't work in distance education, Kydd says.</p> <p>This is important because the availability of higher bandwidths and progress in developing effective systems of online assessment, combined with increasing demand, means that paid-for distance learning is also booming.</p> <p>According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of distance learning students registered at UK institutions grew from 238,800 in 2006/07, to 271,445 in 2010/11.</p> <p>Tony Hopwood, chief assessor for the Open and Distance Learning Quality Council, says the increase is particularly marked in the university sector, which is now competing with dedicated distance learning organisations.</p> <p>Gr\u00e1inne Conole, professor of learning innovation at the University of Leicester, says this is out of necessity. \"We know worldwide that bricks and mortar universities don't have the capacity to deal with the number of students there are going to be in future, particularly in places like India and China, so online learning has to be the way to go.\"</p> <p>The University of Derby is one institution to recognise this, setting up a separate department to focus on online distance learning students with academic systems and tutors dedicated to their specific needs.</p> <p>Joy Rickard, who is studying for an undergraduate certificate in educational psychology at Derby from her home near Bath, says she feels the benefits. For her, distance learning means the flexibility to look after her two young children and work part-time in a school while studying alongside a global student cohort.</p> <p>\"I have met some people online who are doing fascinating things all over the world, which wouldn't have happened if I was attending in person,\" she says.</p> <p>Certainly online learning deepens the pool of potential students. Kydd says London University's International Programmes distance learning model, which allows students to take courses over time and pay incrementally, makes it affordable for students from Africa who would otherwise never be able to take a degree. </p> <p>And the University of Leicester is about to launch an MSc in security, conflict and international development, designed to meet the needs of international development workers deployed in post-conflict countries, who would normally find study impossible. Because access to the internet can be tricky in such countries, the students receive an iPad on which they download the course app and related ebooks, all accessible without an internet connection. They can then download other materials when they find a Wi-Fi&#xa0;connection.</p> <p><strong>Campus life</strong></p> <p>New courses run by Plymouth University are similarly designed for hard-to-reach students. The university is offering undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas, and master's-level programmes in hydrography for students working on oil rigs and survey vessels, sometimes thousands of miles from the nearest university.</p> <p>But what about missing out on campus life? Rickard, who studied graphic design at the University of Wales, Newport before having children, says she feels she has \"done\" student life and is now more interested in developing a career. Conn, who has just started a full-time job as a technology developer off the back of his studies, says his local OU student union and online forums keep him happy. </p> <p>\"You don't feel like you're on your own,\" he says. \"The only thing I'm missing is living in a rundown squat for a couple of years and leaving with masses of debt.\"</p>",

It is regrettable, but I have accepted the resignation.\"</p> <p>But revelations that Tanaka, who is responsible for the country's criminal justice system, had acted as a matchmaker at the wedding of a senior gang member, and attended a party organised by the same gang's leader 30 years ago fuelled speculation that he would step down.</p> <p>Soon after becoming justice minister, Tanaka admitted receiving 420,000 yen [\u00a33,200] from a foreign-owned company between 2006 and 2009. Japan's electoral laws forbid politicians from knowingly accepting funds from foreign sources. His office said it had returned the money.</p> <p>Tanaka claimed he had been unaware of the groom's connections when he agreed to act as nakodo \u2013 a ceremonial role in Japanese weddings \u2013 and had no idea the party was being hosted by a yakuza boss.</p> <p>His resignation has attracted fresh criticism of Noda's judgment following the resignation in September 2011 of his trade and industry minister, Yoshio Hachiro, who had described an area in Fukushima, scene of last year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami\" title=\"\">nuclear disaster</a>, as a \"ghost town\" and joked about radioactive contamination.</p> <p>Shigeru Ishiba, secretary general of the main opposition Liberal Democratic party [LDP], told reporters shortly before Tanaka's resignation: \"Even if he quits, that won't be the end of it.\"</p> <p>Noda, though, has so far resisted calls for an early general election, with polls suggesting his party would lose just three years <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/yukio-hatoyama-japan-prime-minister\" title=\"\">after it swept to power in a landslide</a>.</p> <p>\"The resignation is likely to further weaken Noda's support within his party. Obviously, it will become more difficult for him to exert leadership,\" Mikitaka Masuyama, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, told Reuters.</p> <p>\"But it is uncertain whether this could be a trigger for an early election. Given falling public support for the government, there is no benefit in him dissolving parliament and calling snap election at the moment.\"</p> <p>Noda also faces criticism of his handling of the economy and a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/26/japanese-tax-rise\" title=\"\">controversial doubling of sales tax</a> to 10% over the next three years. In return for their support for the tax rise, the LDP had demanded that Noda call an election by the end of the year.</p> <p>The LDP and other opposition parties control the upper house, enabling them to block key legislation.</p> <p>Noda, whose government's support rating slipped below 20% for the first time this week, promised to hold an election soon but has yet to specify when. His refusal to name a date is expected to lead to further deadlock as parliament prepares to debate a key deficit-bond issuance bill.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/higher-education-career-options\" title=\"\">In my last post</a>, I stressed the importance of publishing, applying for funding and teaching experience for progressing your academic career. You may have wondered how you will manage to do all this while finishing your PhD or coping with the workload of your postdoctoral research/teaching job (or working in another job while trying to secure an academic post).</p> <p>There is no easy answer to this, but deciding on your short- and long-term aims \u2013 what sort of role, what sort of institution, how flexible you are prepared to be and how many stepping stones you're willing to take \u2013 will help you prioritise.</p> <p>Practising time management strategies is also important. Check your institution's policy on professional development as you may be able to take time out for training, or consider working part-time to give you more research/teaching time.</p> <p>Flexibility will also be your friend: while for many this comes at the price of personal relationships and putting down roots, if you can move wherever there is work in the UK or abroad \u2013 the higher education sector is expanding in some areas of the Middle East, South America and Asia \u2013 you will likely find a lectureship sooner. A lectureship in a new location will be a lot to get used to but should give you sufficient security and support to build your profile and networks and, if you desire, plan your return to the UK.</p> <p>As with most career sectors, you need to develop your networking, application and interview skills to secure a job. Networking is crucial in academia before and after you get a job \u2013 you need to be active in your field, attend conferences, participate and find collaborators \u2013 so you might as well start as early as possible. Get used to sharing your research interests and being curious about other people's, both at events and online. Ask your supervisor and external examiner for introductions. Look into which social media tools are well-used in your field \u2013 would it be worth joining Twitter, <a href=\"http://academia.edu/\" title=\"\">Academia.edu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/\" title=\"\">ResearchGate</a>, commenting on other academics' blogs or even starting your own?</p> <p>CVs and cover letters are about selling your skills and experience clearly and concisely. Get feedback on your applications from a careers adviser if you have access to one (if you are not currently studying, some university careers services support alumni and research staff). Otherwise, <a href=\"http://www.vitae.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Vitae</a> is a great resource for CV and cover letter tips, as are your colleagues and friends who recently got academic jobs.</p> <p>Tailor your CV and cover letter to each job; the CV might not change much but the cover letter will need to be a unique persuasive document. It should say why you want to work in that particular department or research group, show you have done your research into what goes on there and who works there, and explain how you are going to fit in. It is likely that you will also have to write in-depth about your research and/or your teaching \u2013 either in the cover letter or in a separate research/teaching statement (check the job advert carefully for instructions).</p> <p>When describing research, a common downfall is to be too vague with your future research plans. Give as much detail as possible about what you plan to do and how you aim to disseminate it. If asked to write a teaching statement or philosophy, try to give specific examples from your experience.</p> <p>Interview skills are also about selling your strengths and experiences, but this time you have to do it in person (or potentially over the phone or Skype). This means you have to think about more than your words: your body language and tone communicates confidence, enthusiasm and interest (or insecurity and apathy if you get it wrong). Find out as much as you can about the interview process and how many people will be interviewing you so that you know what to expect. Prepare by reminding yourself of your strengths, anticipating and working out answers to tricky questions, and practising with a friend or careers adviser. You might also have to give a presentation at an academic interview, so make sure you know as much as possible about the audience, technical set-up and time limit so you can prepare effectively.</p> <p>Finally, there may be a social or 'informal' element to the interview, where you have a meal with other candidates and staff. Make sure you are friendly and show interest in everyone you meet during this part of the interview \u2013 don't sit in a corner studying your notes.</p> <p>In summary, ensure your institution works for you. Make the most of your supervisor's contacts, training opportunities and careers support. Moreover, don't underestimate the importance of marketing yourself to employers.</p> <p><em>Dr Rachel Walls is a careers adviser for researchers at </em><a href=\"http://www.careers.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>The Careers Service for the University of Oxford</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Every year, thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people contact Stonewall Housing for help and advice. Most tell us that the housing problems they're facing are related to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Today, many more LGBT people are having to rent their homes from a private landlord, thanks to a lack of affordable housing and because local authorities have a requirement to discharge their duty to house only the people in most acute need. But how safe is the private rented sector for LGBT people?</p> <p>For many, it simply isn't. Even though LGBT people living in private rental accommodation are more likely to be in full-time employment, more than 40% tell us they still feel insecure in their homes or are facing eviction.</p> <p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are not just private issues, they are at the core of someone's identity. Unfortunately, LGBT people still face daily harassment and abuse simply because of who they are. Sometimes, that abuse comes from a landlord.</p> <p>Gay residents may also face discrimination from neighbours or those who they share a home with. They may have to deal with inappropriate language from letting agents, and landlords have even told potential renters that they are not welcome because they may upset other tenants.</p> <p>Safety is one issue, and security of tenure is another. Tenancy agreements tend to be weighted in favour of the landlord: for LGBT tenants, this can mean their housing is even more insecure. If an LGBT tenant is being abused, and is unable to leave because of the length of notice period, they can become effectively imprisoned within their home.</p> <p>We are also concerned about LGBT living in private rented homes and receiving benefits. More than one in three people who contact us for advice can no longer afford to pay their rent. We expect those numbers to grow as welfare reform is introduced.</p> <p>We're concerned about the impact of some of these new benefit rules on our community. From April 2013, young people under the age of 35 will only be entitled to claim housing benefit at the shared accommodation rate, meaning claimants will be forced to share with others, whatever their personal needs or background.</p> <p>Transgender people going through gender reassignment may find themselves sharing with complete strangers who may be openly or aggressively intolerant. At a time when they most need a supportive, welcoming environment, these tenants will be placed at risk of transphobic abuse.</p> <p>One issue that is not confined to LGBT tenants is the quality of homes in the private rented sector. Over one in ten of LGBT people who are renting privately call us because of the poor standard of their home. Just as the Decent Homes initiative helped to improve the quality of social housing, so there needs to be a drive to improve the quality of private rented accommodation. It must become a tenure of choice, and not just because it is the only option available.</p> <p>So what do we want to see happen? There are some basic changes that private landlords can make to create a safe space for LGBT tenants:</p> <p>\u2022 Rent deposit schemes must be more accessible and the private rented sector should be made more affordable for all communities</p> <p>\u2022 Tenancy agreements must be more flexible yet offer security: if abuse or harassment happens then tenants should be able to escape without financial penalties, and if they find safe accommodation they should be able to remain there for a significant period of time</p> <p>\u2022 More landlords should be encouraged and supported to accept LGBT people who are receiving benefits</p> <p>\u2022 Private landlords and agents should be offered training and guidance so they can be more aware of LGBT issues</p> <p>\u2022 We need a more careful regulation of the quality and management of properties in the private rented sector</p> <p>I want to work with landlords so they can understand the issues that LGBT people face on a daily basis, and in their search for stable and secure accommodation.

The same should happen for the private rented sector, so all LGBT tenants can feel safe and secure in their homes.</p> <p>We would also welcome working with other support and advice agencies to deliver specialist services for LGBT communities. Stonewall Housing already offers support to LGBT people as part of the East London Housing Partnership's Single Homelessness Project, where the group has successfully helped a number of LGBT people sustain their tenancies in the private rented sector.</p> <p><em>Bob Green is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.stonewallhousing.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Stonewall Housing</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice \u2013 and the latest job vacancies in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>When the Beatles' first single <strong>Love Me Do</strong> was released in October 1962, the Soviet missile crisis threatened nuclear obliteration and Liverpool were languishing at the bitter end of the First Division table. Exactly 50 years on, Liverpool are again struggling, with manager Brendan Rodgers having an offensive weapons crisis of his own. But rest easy, Reds fans, for <strong>Liverpool are whispering PS I Love You in the direction of the Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar</strong> \u2013 or should that be Klaas-Jan Hunte-la? \u2013 whose future in Germany, according to Daily Star, \"is uncertain after he postponed talks on a new deal until December\".</p> <p>The good news for Liverpool fans is that the Dutch striker should fit in on Merseyside \u2013 after all, he is known \"as a witty guy who likes a joke and a prank\" and <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1579878.html\" title=\"\">earlier this year he told Fifa: \"I'm a jolly character, that's true.\"</a> The bad news? The endearing Huntelaar, whose dad drives him to training two or three times a week, says: \"It's really important to me to enjoy my football.\" Ah. That, <strong>and the fact he's been linked to Juventus in this morning's Italian papers</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Rodgers has become the 1,169,691th person to watch the YouTube clips of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ibHRquIsXkg\" title=\"\">the Finnish teen strike sensation Joel Pohjanpalo</a> scoring a perfect hat-trick and he is planning to step up his interest in the striker, who had a trial at Anfield earlier this year. First person to proclaim \"he's the new Jari Litmanen\" wins the Mill's Best of Jimmy Tarbuck collection on Betamax.</p> <p>Like most 21-year-old Spaniards who have experimented with Che Guevara chops and shown reddish tendencies, the Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is restless. Which means, according to the Daily Mail, he might be tempted <strong>by the sweet revolutionary serenade from Real Madrid manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</strong>. But wait, what's this in the Mail? \"Suggestions in Spain that De Gea is homesick in Manchester have not been confirmed by United.\" Gah!</p> <p>Arrange the following into a coherent sentence: <strong>transfer Wesley January Sneijder window doing one</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile like a minor celebrity expecting to be papped by Heat magazine, Internazionale and Chelsea are after a Brazilian \u2013 namely the feisty Corinthians player <strong>Jos\u00e9 Paulo Bezerra Maciel J\u00fanior aka Paulinho</strong>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Willian Borges da Silva</strong>, aka Shahktar Donetsk's attacking midfielder Willian, hs bn txtng AVB bt jng Sprs. \"There were two offers in the summer,\" the Brazilian admitted to local rag Lancenet. \"One from Chelsea and one from Tottenham. Choosing between the two clubs would be difficult. I don't know. I mean, Tottenham is a big club and it has a good person in charge. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas wanted to bring me to Chelsea and also tried at Tottenham. He always sends me messages. We are always in touch, and he has become a friend, for sure.\"</p> <p>But while AVB has been texting Willian he's been cold-shouldering Michael Dawson, who has played just two minutes in the Premier League this season, <strong>and will be off to Southampton in January in exchange for 1.5m used fivers</strong>.</p> <p>Your final dose of Brazilian news today: <strong>Neymar</strong>, the 20-year-old Brazilian with more tricks than a Halloweener who doesn't like sweets, says he is staying with Santos until his contract expires in 2014 \u2013 despite the attempts of DIS, the company that owns 40% of him, to cash in by selling him. \"DIS may still have some of my rights, as you know, but they don't have responsibility for my life,\" said Neymar. \"Those who control my life are me and my dad. From the moment you hear from my mouth, or from my dad's mouth, that I will leave, then you can start to believe it.\" Sounds fair enough to us.</p> <p>Meanwhile the <strong>Adel-Taarabt-to-Paris-Saint-Germain trail has gone cold</strong>. Speaking to the Algerian newspaper Le Buteur, the club president Nasser al-Khelaifi said: \"Despite rumours in the press we have not made any move for the player. Right now, he is not in our plans.\"</p> <p>Finally, QS is reporting that <strong>Nani \"keeps on being offered to Juventus, but the <em>bianconeri</em> are not intentioned to sign a player with such a big salary\"</strong>. Hmm, perhaps Manchester United should take the hint? That said, without drawing breath, Calciomercato suggests that \"for that reason\" the Old Lady is keen on the Old Centre-Back, and might spirit Rio Ferdinand off to Turin. Yes, \u00a3120,000-a-week Rio Ferdinand.</p>",
  "<p>Congratulations to all conservative, male Muslims in Egypt. According to the <a href=\"http://dostour.eg/dostor_masr.pdf\" title=\"\">draft constitution</a>, you qualify as the model Egyptian \"citizen\", and the state will be there for you all the way to uphold your rights and defend your freedoms.</p> <p>However, if you happen to be a woman, a Christian, a follower of a non-Abrahamic faith or an atheist, then Egypt's contradictory constitution \u2013 which attempts but fails to strike a balance between secular liberal and conservative religious forces \u2013 leaves you vulnerable to the whims and wiles of the powers that be.</p> <p>The document reflects the raging battle for the soul of Egypt between conservative Islamic and liberal revolutionary forces.</p> <p>This is nowhere more apparent than in the constitution's attitude to a full half of the population \u2013 women. Article 68 (one of the most hotly debated) begins promisingly by informing us that \"the state will do everything to promote equality between women and men\", before delivering the sting in its tail, \"without abandoning the judgments of Islamic law\".</p> <p>The state will also patronisingly help women to \"strike a balance between their family duties and their work in society\". So, the constitution is basically telling Egyptian women they are \"equal\" to men, as long as they obey their husbands or fathers and accept their secondary religious status.</p> <p>In other respects, the new constitution contains numerous articles that, at first sight, are music to the ears of advocates of democracy and individual freedom. Article 1 tells us that Egypt is governed by a \"democratic regime\" which, according to article 6, is founded on \"consultation, equal citizenship \u2026 pluralism [and] respect for human rights\". Other articles guarantee equality for all \u2013 regardless of gender, race or faith \u2013 and recognise personal freedom as a \"natural right\" and the right of everyone to a sense of \"human dignity\".</p> <p>Freedom of thought and expression is also safeguarded, and journalists, who have faced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/09/arabic-press-freedom-censorship\" title=\"\">decades of draconian restrictions</a>, should, in theory at least, rejoice at the constitution's protection of their right to pursue their profession freely and to set up media outlets, with the only stipulation being that they notify the authorities.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, a lot of what the constitution giveth, it promptly taketh away.</p> <p>Though the constitution guarantees freedom of belief, albeit only for Abrahamic religions, article 2 describes Islam as the \"state's religion\" and vaguely refers to the \"principles of sharia\" as the primary source of legislation. This is a ticking time bomb for Christians, whose current marginalisation could become open persecution if this stipulation is exploited to the full by radical Islamists.</p> <p>Fortunately, the demand by some Islamists that Islamic law should be the sole source of legislation did not make it into the constitution, though the current statement that it is the \"primary\" source leaves the door ajar both to the modern reinterpretation of Islamic jurisprudence and to the continued reliance on other, secular sources of legislation.</p> <p>Nevertheless, no matter how liberally sharia is interpreted, there is an essential tension between Islamic and modern, liberal secular law \u2013 at least in the mainstream view of it. This is eloquently expressed in other parts of the constitution. For instance, article 38 prohibits attacks on and affronts to \"the prophets\" \u2013 essentially an anti-blasphemy measure.</p> <p>While for many pious Egyptians this will appear to be an even-handed way of protecting the sanctity of not just Islam but every religion, it conflicts with the principles of free expression the constitution claims to uphold. For instance, if I, as an agnostic atheist, express my heartfelt conviction that the Qur'an was authored by Muhammad or another human hand, and that the devil, who does not exist, had no hand in the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_verses\" title=\"\">satanic verses</a>\", will the state defend my freedom of expression or prosecute me for insulting the prophet?</p> <p>Even more troubling are the parts of the constitution that transform the state into a sort of big (Muslim) brother. Article 10 empowers the government to \"safeguard and protect morality and public decency\" and to \"maintain a refined level of upbringing, religious and nationalist values and scientific facts\", while article 69 tasks the authorities with overseeing, among other things, \"the spiritual, moral and cultural development\" of young people.</p> <p>This is not only a paternalistic insult to the generation that taught Egyptians the value of their dignity and freedom, it also raises the thorny question of whose morality. And what should happen to those youth who do not wish to live by the conservative Islamic morality that the authors almost certainly intended?</p> <p>And the powers of this religious nanny state do not end there. Describing the family as the \"cornerstone of society\", article 9 grants the state the power to preserve the \"authentic nature of the Egyptian family \u2026 protecting its traditions and moral values\".</p> <p>My personal experience of Egyptian families is that they possess thousands of different \"traditions and moral values\" \u2013 so which will the state enforce and does it have the right or power to impose its own vision?</p> <p>And what will the state do to families that refuse to abide by its vision? \"Re-educate\" them? Take their children into its care? This is a truly scary prospect. For instance, my wife and I are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/26/children-religion-posters\" title=\"\">raising our child without religion</a> and have decided to let him choose whichever system of beliefs suits him once he is old enough.</p> <p>If we move back to Egypt, will the state preserve our \"natural right\" to personal freedom and our constitutional right to human dignity or will it try to force us to raise our child as a \"decent Muslim\"?</p> <p>The inherent contradictions in Egypt's draft constitution, if it ever enters into force, will leave it wide open to individual interpretation and so Egypt's future as a progressive, enlightened and tolerant state rests in the ability of liberal, secular, pluralistic forces to seize the upper hand from the Islamists.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has some \"very big questions\" to answer over Jimmy Savile, says the chairman of the Commons select committee that is to quiz the corporation's director general over its handling of the sex abuse scandal.</p> <p>John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, told BBC Breakfast that George Entwistle would recognise he had to deal with the concerns quickly because the BBC was being \"damaged very badly by the stream of revelations and by the apparent mishandling of them\".</p> <p>Entwistle is to be questioned by MPs at 10.30am on Tuesday, following days of chaotic revelations at the corporation that have culminated in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile-scandal\" title=\"\">editor of Newsnight, Peter Rippon, stepping aside</a> on Monday after the BBC said he had made \"inaccurate or incomplete\" statements about the scandal.</p> <p>Asked how the questions at the select committee would overlap or differ from the BBC's own investigation, Whittingdale said: \"There are some issues which we'll want to raise with the director general which are not covered by the inquiry, particularly the way in which the BBC has dealt with all of these matters \u2013 the handling of them over the past few weeks and also about George Entwistle's own knowledge \u2013 those are not part of the investigation.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The director of news apparently told him [Entwistle] that Newsnight was carrying out an investigation into Jimmy Savile. Now he said that he is very careful not to interfere in the editorial independence of the news division and for that reason he didn't ask any more questions.</p> <p>\"But on the other hand he was in the process of commissioning the most fulsome tributes to Jimmy Savile, which went out on the BBC over that Christmas, and I just find it very surprising that, having been told by the director of news, given a warning, he didn't think it appropriate at least to ask what the investigation was about, and instead he went ahead with those programmes.\"</p> <p>The committee will consider asking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/peter-rippon-newsnight-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">Rippon</a> and other Newsnight journalists to appear before them if they feel Entwistle's evidence is incomplete.</p> <p>Entwistle, himself a former Newsnight editor, forced Rippon to stand aside from his job at the head of the BBC2 programme. Rippon has been in the spotlight since it emerged he scrapped a Newsnight report on allegations of abuse by Savile a few weeks before the BBC was to air tributes to the DJ and presenter, who died last October aged 84. Had the Newsnight film aired, the BBC programme would have been the first to reveal claims of Savile's abuse of teenage girls \u2013 10 months before an ITV documentary revealed his activities.</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, a member of the committee, said: \"If the committee doesn't feel that Entwistle has given us a satisfactory explanation, then I think we will want to talk to other people. Somebody needs to establish the facts, and act quickly and decisively upon them.\"</p> <p>A Conservative member of the committee, Damian Collins, said it would \"have to consider\" whether to launch a broader inquiry into the BBC's handling of the sexual abuse revelations. Such a move could lead to public sessions that lay bare the BBC's internal row over the scandal.</p> <p>Collins said MPs would have to consider Entwistle's evidence \u2013 and possibly wait for an independent inquiry led by Nick Pollard, the former head of Sky News, which is due to report by the end of the year.</p> <p>The BBC has issued two significant corrections to Rippon's version of events that had been published in a BBC blogpost on 3 October, when the allegations about abuse by Savile first emerged.</p> <p>The move, made before Monday night's airing on BBC1 of a Panorama programme about the scandal, was prompted in part by a dispute about Rippon's published account. Panorama obtained previously unpublished emails from Newsnight journalists involved in the Savile investigation complaining to Rippon that his version of events was wrong.</p> <p>The journalists \u2013 producer Meirion Jones and reporter Liz MacKean \u2013 are both likely to give their version of events to the select committee if asked. Bitter that their investigation into Savile's conduct was halted last year, both gave interviews to Panorama.</p> <p>The BBC determined that Rippon was incorrect when he wrote: \"We are confident that all the women we spoke to had contacted the police independently already. We also had no new evidence against any other person that would have helped the police.\"</p> <p>Instead, the BBC statement said, the truth was that \"it appears that in some cases women had not spoken to the police and that the police were not aware of all the allegations\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/oct/22/jimmy-savile-panorama-newsnight-video\" title=\"\">Panorama's coverage (video)</a> of abuse by Savile in the 1970s largely consisted of stories already highlighted in newspapers, including the case of Kevin Cook, who, as a nine-year-old boy scout, was molested on the set of Jim'll Fix It. There was also a broad allegation of a sex ring operated by staff connected with Top of the Pops, although this was not directly linked to Savile.</p> <p>The programme also revealed that Rippon did not see the vital on-the-record interview his journalists had secured with one of Savile's victims, Karin Ward. Rippon also used a surprising phrase in an email to dismiss the evidence that the production team had secured, noting that it consisted of a background briefing and \"just the women\" \u2013 referring to on-the-record but anonymous testimonies Newsnight had obtained against Savile.</p> <p>Newsnight's key evidence came from Ward, who said she had been a victim of Savile and repeatedly told programme-makers she had never gone to the police. The BBC also said Rippon was wrong to write \"we found no evidence against the BBC\" in Newsnight's investigation last November. The correction said the Newsnight team had uncovered \"some allegations of abusive conduct on BBC premises\", although there was \"no allegation\" that BBC staff were aware of Savile's alleged activities.</p> <p>David Cameron stepped into the row on Monday, saying he was troubled that the BBC had felt obliged to make corrections to Rippon's public statements. The developments were \"concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile\". He added that this raised \"serious questions\" and he expected the Pollard review and other inquiries to answer them.</p> <p>The BBC and other institutions where Savile is alleged to have abused children are facing up to 18 claims for damages from the victims.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a lawyer specialising in child abuse cases, said the number of cases had risen in the past week as women became more confident about suing in light of the Metropolitan police revelation that Savile may have been one of the UK's worst sex offenders.</p> <p>Dux is preparing to bring cases against the BBC, Stoke Mandeville hospital and Duncroft approved school on the grounds that they had \"vicarious liability\" for the activities of their staff or their agents.</p>",
  "<p>One of the liveliest debates in social care at the moment concerns how personal budgets benefit different groups of people in different ways. Investigating this issue in Essex, we found that while personal budgets nearly always contribute to a positive experience for all, there was a marked difference in the benefits derived by older people compared to other users.</p> <p>For more than three years, the <a href=\"http://www.opm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Office for Public Management</a>, in conjunction with <a href=\"http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Essex County Council</a> and user-led disability organisation <a href=\"http://www.ecdp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ecdp</a>, has been working with social care users in Essex examining the impact of personal budgets on the lives of the people who use them. With the government wanting all those eligible to be on a personal budget by April 2013, there is a pressing need to understand the impact of personal budgets and how best to support people in using them.</p> <p>The rationale behind personal budgets is a simple yet powerful one: to empower social care users by giving them greater choice over the services they receive. In practice, this enables people to take direct control over the money allocated to them. They can use this money to pay for traditional care services, such as a personal assistant or carer, as well as less conventional services, including leisure activities and opportunities for personal development.</p> <p>We observed that many older personal budget holders and their families prefer to use the new system to purchase more traditional forms of care, in more positive ways. For example, a lot of older people use the increased choice their personal budget offers to secure consistent, flexible daily care from the same carers or personal assistants; whereas previously they were reliant on whoever the care agency happened to send at whatever time.</p> <p>Older users also benefited from being able to employ someone directly, rather than relying on family members, citing the positive effect they felt this had on their dignity. One husband, who no longer had to act as the main carer for his wife, said: \"As a man dealing with a woman, I find it's [washing and bathing] not the sort of thing I want to do, but when a woman comes in and deals with another woman it's totally different \u2026 I feel that that is the right way to be.\"</p> <p>On the other hand we found family members, who manage personal budgets on behalf of younger people with learning disabilities, instead favouring employing someone with intimate knowledge of their child's needs, often a family member themselves. A mother of a young person with learning disabilities told us: \"I tried different people but Sarah is a very, very difficult child \u2026 So I've got to use my other daughter because she listens to her, she's strong with her, she knows her, she's confident with her.\"</p> <p>We also found that personal budget holders of working age were far more inclined to use the system creatively to access community services; such as swimming, bowling, gym membership, or theatre trips. Some even reported how these activities have had a significant positive impact on their physical health, as well as making them feel more independent and improving their overall wellbeing.</p> <p>Inevitably, when introducing a new system on this scale there are going to be areas for potential improvement. The processes of securing, setting up and especially reviewing a personal budget can be more difficult and protracted than users would like. For those people who have independent sources of support \u2013 such as user-led, or advocacy organisations \u2013 these issues can be mitigated or avoided. But not everyone has this access.</p> <p>The local market also has a big role to play in ensuring the services wanted by budget holders are available. After all, a personal budget is only as useful as what it can be spent on, and supply in some cases needs to catch-up to demand.</p> <p>Overall though, what we've seen in Essex has been incredibly encouraging. The lessons we've learned have already been used to make the system better for the people who live there. We hope the findings of this study can be used to support service users, local authorities and providers across the entire country, to ensure the continued roll-out of personalisation is a successful and empowering process.</p> <p><em>Sanah Sheikh is an associate fellow at OPM and specialist in qualitative research with vulnerable and 'hard-to-reach' groups </em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>With just a few more campaigning days left before the elections for the new police and crime commissioners electionson 15 November, all the candidates will soon be officially declared, following a late flurry of people stepping in and stepping out of the contests. Members of the voting public now will have an opportunity to check out the campaign websites of the contenders.</p> <p>Much will now depend on who is elected. The predicted low turnout and the innovation of supplementary votingin areas that have never used such a system mean almost any variety of results is possible.</p> <p>The new PCCs may be destined to fade from public view like their predecessor police authorities as they become submerged by the scale of the responsibilities they will solely have. They may begin to tackle some elements of police culture that the Hillsborough report is now uncovering; they may herald in a new era of outsourced policing where dual-motif epaulets become the norm rather than the exception.</p> <p>Perhaps chief constables, who will remain in operational command, will calmly remain the professional face of local police services and allow the PCCs only tightly scripted walk-on parts \u2013 or perhaps these new super-politicians will stride across the criminal justice landscape, leaving huge change in their wake. It is not yet clear what will happen. But before the elections themselves, here are six more sets of pertinent questions for the PCC candidates:</p> <p>1. The new PCCs will have <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/questions/pcc-powers/\" title=\"\">several significant new powers</a> including appointing and dismissing their chief constable, setting the local council tax precept for policing and determining local policing priorities and plan. Does the candidate's website mention their various powers and how they will exercise them? What is their policy on raising precepts and does this conform to current, three-year policing budgets? Are words such as precept, budget or priorities even present? How will reductions in government grants be managed by the PCC?</p> <p>2. There has been much talk about the policing side of these new positions but far less discussion about the PCCs' extensive (and possibly growing) responsibilities in areas beyond crime itself. Does the candidate's website allude to these responsibilities? What is their approach to joined-up partnership working across the criminal justice system beyond the platitudinous? Will they be a good leader who will build strong bridges?</p> <p>3. The Olympics and the west coast trainline fiasco has brought the whole subject of outsourcing and privatisation to the fore. Does the candidate's website mention the outsourcing plans implemented by Lincolnshire police and considered by West Midlands &amp; Surrey police forces? Is there a clear policy stand taken by the candidate? By what principles will they judge whether various forms and scales of outsourcing are in the public interest or not?</p> <p>4. There are has been little talk of what kind of \"office\" the new PCC will need to have and few candidates so far have outlined what kind of team they will assemble. Some have declared that they will have a deputy, others have not. Does the candidate's website give any indication of how much public money will be spent by the PCC on her/his office and sundry expenses? If so, how much? What does the budget cover?</p> <p>5. Many candidates have made much of their capability to be the PCC for their area. Does the candidate's website give accessible links for people to find out more about their work or political record? Or are the voters expected to take the credentials of the candidate on trust?</p> <p>6. Public accountability and representing the voice of the people is often cited by the government as the main reason for this change. The idea is that local people can have more of a direct say in how their police services are delivered. This will only work if the PCC is able to listen to, analyse and act upon the concerns and priorities of all the communities in their area. Does the candidate's website describe how they will do this in specific terms? What plans and practices are outlined which will lead to the candidate developing a close understanding of their \"patch\" and the people there? How will the candidates allow themselves to be held to account by the people in between this and the next election in May 2016? And does their website explain transparently how their campaign has been funded and any connections or interests that they wish to declare?</p> <p><em>Jon Harvey is a leadership and organisational development practitioner, a town councillor in Buckingham and was shortlisted to be the Labour candidate for the Thames Valley PCC. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

Had the Newsnight film aired, the BBC programme would have been the first to reveal stories of Savile's abuse of teenage girls \u2013 10 months before an ITV documentary lifted the lid on his activities.</p> <p>Ben Bradshaw, a member of the committee, said: \"If the committee doesn't feel that Entwistle has given us a satisfactory explanation, then I think we will want to talk to other people. Somebody needs to establish the facts, and act quickly and decisively upon them.\"</p> <p>A Conservative member of the committee, Damian Collins, said it would \"have to consider\" whether to launch a broader inquiry into what happened about the BBC's handling of the sexual abuse revelations. Such a move could lead to public sessions that lay bare the BBC's bitter internal row over the Savile affair.</p> <p>Collins said MPs would have to consider Entwistle's evidence \u2013 and possibly wait for an independent inquiry led by Nick Pollard, the former head of Sky News, which is due to report by the end of the year.</p> <p>The BBC issued two significant corrections to Rippon's version of events that had been published in a BBC blogpost on 3&#xa0;October, when the allegations about abuse by Savile first emerged.</p> <p>The move, made before Monday night's airing on BBC1 of a Panorama programme about the affair, was prompted in part by a dispute about Rippon's published account. Panorama obtained previously unpublished emails from Newsnight journalists involved in the Savile investigation complaining to Rippon that his version of events was wrong.</p> <p>The journalists \u2013 producer Meirion Jones and reporter Liz MacKean \u2013 are both likely to give their version of events to the select committee if asked. Bitter that their investigation into Savile's conduct was halted last year, both gave interviews to the Panorama programme.</p> <p>The BBC determined that Rippon was incorrect when he wrote on October 3: \"We are confident that all the women we spoke to had contacted the police independently already. We also had no new evidence against any other person that would have helped the police.\" Instead, the BBC statement said, the truth was that \"it appears that in some cases women had not spoken to the police and that the police were not aware of all the allegations\".</p> <p>Panorama's coverage of abuse by Savile in the 1970s largely consisted of stories already highlighted in newspapers, including the case of Kevin Cook, who \u2013 as a nine-year-old boy scout \u2013 was molested on the set of Jim'll Fix It. There was also a broad allegation of a sex ring operated by staff connected with Top of the Pops, although this was not directly linked to Savile.</p> <p>The programme also revealed that Rippon did not see the key on-the-record interview his journalists had secured with one of Savile's victims, Karin Ward. Rippon also used a surprising phrase in an email to dismiss the evidence that the production team had secured, noting it consisted of a background briefing and \"just the women\" \u2013 referring to on-the-record but anonymous testimonies Newsnight had obtained against Savile.</p> <p>Newsnight's key evidence came from Ward, who said she had been a victim of Savile and repeatedly told programme makers she had never gone to the police. The BBC also said Rippon was wrong to write \"we found no evidence against the BBC\" in Newsnight's investigation last November. The correction said the Newsnight team had uncovered \"some allegations of abusive conduct on BBC premises\", although there was \"no allegation\" that BBC staff were aware of Savile's alleged activities.</p> <p>David Cameron stepped into the row on Monday. He said he was troubled that the BBC had felt obliged to make corrections to Rippon's public statements. He said that the developments were \"concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile\". He added that this raised \"serious questions\" and that he expected the Pollard review and other inquiries to answer them.</p> <p>The BBC and other institutions where Savile is alleged to have abused children are facing up to 18 claims for damages from the victims.</p> <p>Liz Dux, a lawyer specialising in child abuse cases, told the Guardian the number of cases had mounted in the past week as women became more confident about suing in light of the Metropolitan police revelation that Savile may have been one of the UK's worst sex offenders.</p> <p>Dux is preparing to bring cases against the BBC, Stoke Mandeville hospital and Duncroft approved school on the grounds that they had \"vicarious liability\" for the activities of their staff or their agents.</p>",
  "<p>With the final debate between Obama and Romney in the 2012 US presidential election campaign behind us, we can expect another inevitable onslaught of debate analysis, opinion polls, extreme scrutiny and hilarious Twitter hashtags. So I'd feel remiss if I didn't add to this. </p> <p>This wealth of data arguably is a good thing: it suggests that there is a demand for it, and this in turn suggests a large number of people are actively interested in the politics that directly affects their lives. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/voterapathy\">Voter apathy</a> is often a concern (in UK politics at least), so anything that gets people interested should be encouraged.</p> <p>However, so much analysis, discussion, dissection, interpretation and opinion is produced over every debate or other high-profile (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19631430\">or not</a>) political event, it risks becoming largely meaningless. I'm not in charge of a global superpower (yet) so I can't say for certain, but I'd have guessed that articulately defending your policies in front of an audience (albeit a <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/election-2012/audience-60-million-watched-presidential-disaster\">very large one</a>) is not the most important facet of the job. </p> <p>And yet, the debates are portrayed as a crucial test of candidate suitability. The actions of animals in <a href=\"http://jab.sagepub.com/\">behavioural science</a> labs don't come under this much scrutiny. When every sentence, gesture and stance (physical and ideological) can potentially result in a level of meticulous analysis that <a href=\"http://www.jic.ac.uk/microscopy/intro_em.html\">an electron microscope</a> would consider \"a bit invasive\", what chance does any normal human have of getting an honest and accurate assessment of the useful facts in order to make a rational decision? I'd argue that it's \"very little\", bordering on \"zero\". They're likely to end up filtering the data in some way, and focussing on things that conform to their own views and principles, and if such a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/confirmation_bias.htm\">confirmation bias</a> is used (by necessity) can a balanced decision based on the facts really be likely?</p> <p>This is undoubtedly going to get worse as time and technology progress. It's bad enough now with 24-hour news channels and the internet with all its inlets and outlets. Most media, seemingly terrified of the audience's attention wavering, focus on sound bites and brief clips, which risk losing the context and nuance of a 3-hour debate. Twitter is hardly any better in this regard. </p> <p>Who knows how bad it's going to get when more advanced technology becomes available? One can imagine the depth of analysis we'll have to deal with for the 2020 election debates.</p> <p>\"At the 2 hour mark, the perspiration detection laser sweep revealed the Democratic candidate has 1.54 times the number of beads of sweat on his forehead than his rival, implying that he is over 50% more nervous than the opposition candidate when discussing the economy. However, when the Republican candidate belched at 94 minutes, the olfactory detection scanner in the podium revealed that he had recently eaten bacon, which is likely to lose him support among undecided Jewish voters.\"</p> <p>As facetious as this may sound, the reasons people actually vote for who they do can often be no more sophisticated and superficial. In a way, it's something of a contradiction to actively decide who will make decisions for you. Democracy is a relatively recent occurrence in terms of <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1360.full\">human cognitive evolution</a>. If we're not adapted to make logical decisions based on the extensive socio-economic factors and variables we're presented with, how do we decide who we want in charge?</p> <p>Because humans do seem to always want someone in charge. Humans (and other primates) are social creatures and instinctively form <a href=\"http://anthro.palomar.edu/behavior/behave_2.htm\">groups with a hierarchical structure</a>. The need for hierarchies and social standing are potentially <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430590/\">hard</a> <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2008/nimh-23.htm\">wired</a> into our brains, and our position in the hierarchy can <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.1.82\">affect our health and well being</a>. And with any hierarchy, there is inevitably someone at the top.</p> <p>For more primitive societies, the leader is likely to be the one who can control most others by being the biggest or strongest, the one you <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-alpha-male.htm\">don't want to cross.</a> But as any society gets more widespread and complex, so must the mechanisms to control the society by its leader. Religion undoubtedly played a part in this, making it possible to invoke an invisible deity who will punish those who break the social rules when nobody is around, via some ineffable methods. And anyone who can claim to represent the deity must be obeyed, for they are supposedly capable of things beyond you. </p> <p>In such tightly regulated hierarchies as religions and militaries, who ends up in charge is not a democratic decision; in these cases, membership of and acceptance by the organisation usually requires discipline and strict adherence to the rules, so who gets to lead is not a matter for debate.</p> <p>The sort of free-thinking, intellectual types who read the Guardian science section may think themselves above such mindless adherence to authority figures, but that sadly may not be the case, even for more \"enlightened\" types. <a href=\"http://www.stanleymilgram.com/pdf/attribution.pdf\">Milgram's infamous experiment</a>, where everyday volunteers from normal backgrounds told to supply painful (but simulated, although they didn't know that) electric shocks to an unwilling victim, actually did so if commanded by a recognised authority figure (in this case, a scientist). </p> <p>One theory as to why this happens is that the subjects enter an \"<a href=\"http://aspsychology101.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/1-6-agency-theory.pdf\">agentic state</a>\", where they feel responsibility for their actions rests with the authority figure, not them, no matter how distressing. This is one theorised mechanism for why people obey commands that lead to genocide.</p> <p>But it's not a straightforward process. Give someone a uniform and a position of authority and they don't instantly get respect and obedience, as any traffic warden will tell you.</p> <p>Context appears to play a crucial role in the designation of someone as a 'good leader'. For example, <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/leadership/f/autocratic-leadership.htm\">authoritarian leaders</a> tend to do better at times of crisis, which is why the more right wing establishments tend to try to convince people that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/12/war-on-terror-corrupting\">crises are ongoing</a>. During peaceful times, people tend to be more resentful at having their individual rights stripped from them when there's no imminent danger to justify this. </p> <p>Even on the minor level , context matters. Ministers trading criticisms of each other's records is usually dismissed as childish name calling. But <a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/world/australia/gillard-poll-boost-after-sexism-speech-1.1092609\">Julia Gillard's blistering attack on her opponent's sexism</a> has done her no end of good, politically.</p> <p>There is an extensive<a href=\"http://psgleadership.scripts.mit.edu/2012IAP/pdf/1_required_reading/Scientific views on Leadership.pdf\"> body of research</a> on the social and psychological factors that determine who and what makes a good leader. There are many conflicting theories, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Levels_of_Leadership_model\">one major one</a> mentions the importance of 'presence', that vague but essential quality that makes someone more likely to be obeyed and followed without objection. Exactly how you'd quantify this is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Social psychologist <a href=\"http://www.infed.org/thinkers/robert_freed_bales.htm\">Robert F Bales</a> posited two classes of leaders: task leaders (who excel at initiating and directing behaviour to get a job done) and socio-emotive leaders (who lift spirits and provide psychological well-being to a group). Seeing as politicians need to be elected in order to start directing behaviour and completing the jobs of governing, they invariably fall into the latter category. </p> <p>Whatever you think of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\">George Osborne's fare dodging </a>or <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9619433/Police-probe-Nick-Griffin-Twitter-rant-against-gay-BandB-couple.html\">Nick Griffin's alarming Twitter behaviour</a>, the fact remains that a significant number of people felt comfortable enough with them to elect them into office. Feel free to find this alarming, I know I do.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that much of the leadership research cited in the literature is from a Western society perspective, and focuses on narrow areas such as business and small groups (both easily accessible to research). So any conclusions made may not be readily applicable to society in general, which is obviously far more complex and chaotic than any one group</p> <p>With so many variables in play, perhaps it is na\u00efve to expect any one politician to be able to effectively control and direct the extensive and ever-changing needs of a society of millions. Even religions recognise this, typically referring to an omnipotent deity who is running things. Monotheistic religions keep it vague with some omnipresent super being, but I prefer the Hindu approach, where they believe the world is run by thousands of gods, with about six arms each. Makes sense, India is a busy place after all.</p> <p>But modern politics essentially asks voters to consider all the potential ramifications of one individual or group of individuals being in charge of a society and all the variables and complications this entails. The human mind is unlikely to be able to do this without years of study in the area, so will inevitably revert to what it knows; deciding according to <a href=\"http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Group_Influence\">group influence</a>, personal ideology, even physical preference like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/18/world-leader-heights-tall\">height</a>, <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/multimedia/player.xml?auto_play=true&amp;section=mm-featured&amp;videopath=/main/news/archive/S21/78/78M51/index.xml\">facial expressions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wcffoundation.org/pages/research/women-in-politics-statistics.html\">gender</a> . </p> <p>You may argue that the latter isn't such a big deal, that you could probably<a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\"> fill binders </a>with the number of powerful women you can think of, but the sad fact is that positions of authority in numerous fields are still male-dominated. Perhaps men have been in charge for so long that most people see it as the norm now, and assume there must be a logical reason for it? Damned if I know what it is, though.</p> <p>So it's no wonder that, when confronted by a bombardment of facts and data that mean little or nothing about issues they can't really relate to, people will vote according to things they can grasp. Politicians know this, the media know this, which is maybe why so much time and effort is spent on seemingly irrelevant details like photo opportunities and correct phrasing; these are the things many people will relate to, and so could win an election. Ergo, they're not irrelevant after all.</p> <p>If we ever are visited by aliens and they utter the classic request \"Take me to your leader\", I hope they are the patient sort, because that's going to take some working out.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett prefers to interact with his puny minions via the medium of Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",
  "<p>For the estimated 800,000 people of <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/descent_based_slavery/default.aspx\" title=\"\">\"slave descent\"</a> in Mali, life is precarious at the best of times. In the most extreme cases, people descended from slaves are treated as objects and their children do not belong to them but to their \"masters\".</p> <p>Even those who live in villages hundreds of miles away from their masters can expect the occasional visitor who will collect their share of crops or take children away to be household servants.</p> <p>The plight of slave descendants is even more insecure following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/26/us-pauses-mali-military-aid-coup\" title=\"\">a rebellion by Tuareg separatists backed by al-Qaida-linked extremists. In March, the uprising triggered a military coup</a> by troops frustrated at the ineffectual government response. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/mali-international-intervention-essential\" title=\"\">Now, military intervention from Ecowas, the west African regional group, looms.</a></p> <p>\"The slave population is already defenceless; it will become even more so as the conflict intensifies. We are like the straw that will be trampled underfoot when elephants fight,\" said Ibrahim Ag Idbaltanat, an activist who received the <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/what_we_do/antislavery_international_today/award/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Anti-Slavery International award</a> in London last Wednesday.</p> <p>Slavery was formally abolished in Mali in the 1960s, after the country gained independence from France. However, although slavery is not allowed under the constitution, there is no anti-slavery law and descent-based slavery through the maternal bloodline still exists in northern regions.</p> <p>People descended from slaves remain the \"property\" of their \"masters\", either living with them and serving them directly, or living separately but remaining under their control.</p> <p>In 2006, Ag Idbaltanat set up the anti-slavery group Temedt, which means \"solidarity\" in the Tamasheq language of the north. Temedt says slavery is still practised in the far north between Berber-descended Tuareg nomads and darker-skinned Bella or black Tamasheq people.</p> <p>The descendants of slaves \u2013 200,000 of whom are under direct control of their masters \u2013 face threats from all sides because of the current conflict, said Ag Idbaltanat, himself a descendant of slaves.</p> <p>\"We are under suspicion from both the government and the rebels,\" he said. \"Old scores are being settled and anti-slavery activists who have created a lot of enemies feel the threat of violence. We challenged the state and slave owners so now we face threats as there are slave masters among the rebel groups.\"</p> <p>Ag Idbaltanat said the first cases of punishment under sharia law by Islamists were imposed on slave descendants, while former masters took advantage of the breakdown of order to recapture slaves they had lost.</p> <p>\"They can act with impunity \u2013 18 children of slaves were kidnapped recently by traditional masters of their families,\" said Ag Idbaltanat. \"Before the rebellion, we had 17 anti-slavery cases before the courts in the north, but the courts are no longer there.\"</p> <p>He described as dire conditions in his hometown of Menaka, which was captured by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, a Tuareg rebel group, in January. Public services have been shut down, schools are closed, there is no drinking water as there is no electricity for the filtration system, and people now have to fetch unclean water from natural basins in the desert.</p> <p>Ag Idbaltanat became involved in the anti-slavery movement in 1979, after he became aware of injustices against Tamasheq families of slave descent, some of which he witnessed personally. In 1976, he saw how a former slave, who had spent years working to amass a herd of cattle, had his animals taken from him by his master. The master persuaded a court that the cattle belonged to him, even through the community knew this was not the case. The master sold the animals but, in a twist of fate, caught a disease from the cows and died.</p> <p>In 2004, a slave was shot in both knees by a former master and needed emergency amputation. However, the local doctor refused to treat him because he had no money. He only agreed to operate after Ag Idbaltanat paid him, but by then it was too late and the man died.</p> <p>Temedt has more than 30,000 members, and has helped to free and support dozens of enslaved people, provided legal advice to victims of slavery, trained magistrates on anti-slavery legislation and lobbied for legal reform to criminalise slavery practices.</p> <p>The organisation is the first to dare to say that slavery \u2013 also practised in Niger and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/slavery-still-shackles-mauritania\" title=\"\">Mauritania</a> \u2013 persists in Mali. Ag Idbaltanat says the government denies this as it fears official acknowledgment might lead aid donors to withdraw. Moreover, anti-slavery activists have been accused by other Malians of being unpatriotic for airing dirty linen in public. But Ag Idbaltanat insists that he and fellow activists are the genuine patriots.</p> <p>\"We believe we are the patriots to talk about a central problem in Mali,\" he said. \"It is something that pervades society, it has an impact on democracy, it excludes people from basic services and it is a factor in the conflict now.</p> <p>\"In a society where slavery exists, there is no justice and the law of the strongest prevails. Where there is slavery, there is stratification of society, subdivisions, frustration and tension. The state pits different groups against each other and the Islamists exploit the frustration against the feudal system.\"</p> <p>Despite the current crisis, Ag Idbaltanat is optimistic. \"Our neighbours and the international community are helping and the Islamists say they are in favour of dialogue,\" he said. \"My hope is that stability will return.\"</p>",

He seemed to relax when the subject shifted to the economy, education and tax.</p> <p>One of the most vivid moments was when Obama, in a flash of arrogance, patronised his opponent, treating him as if he was a child. Lecturing him on military history after Romney complained the navy had fewer ships, Obama said: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\"</p> <p>Will this debate make a difference? Probably not. Although Romney was poor, he was not disastrously bad. And he got across his message that he is not belligerent. Talking about Iran, he said the US \"can't kill our way out of this mess\". That is what a war-weary America wants to hear. An attack on Iran would be a last resort, Romney said. He made peace a central part of his closing speech.</p> <p>Neither Obama or Romney made any serious gaffes or produced any zingers.&#xa0;The first debate in Denver, where Obama was overwhelmed, was a game-changer. But neither this one nor the one in New York have had the same impact or are likely to. The debates in New York and Florida have seen Obama climb back aboard the campaign but his performances have not been strong enough to determine the election outcome.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:54:49.367Z\">at 3.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086042c58f96784ee29093d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:42:53.145Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well that was easily the worst debate of the four we've had.

Nothing also on the EU or the euro-zone crisis, unless you count Mitt Romney's silly claim that America is going to end up like Greece unless he's elected.</p> <p>Anyway, I'd say Romney won it because he just lashed away at Obama without regard to subject or logic, showed that he knew enough about what passes for foreign policy that he's not going to fart in front of the Queen or whatever.

It's not very likely that Israel's own nuclear arsenal will come up in the inevitable criticism of Obama's handling of Iran's as yet non-existent atom bombs.</p> <p>You won't hear the Republican candidate demand the president justify the kill list he endorses each Tuesday which names those sentenced without trial or a modicum of due process to be obliterated by American drones. There won't even be a question about the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of innocents also butchered by the unseen and unmanned war planes.</p> <p>Neither will you hear Romney press Obama over the dubious legal process underway at Guantanamo where military judges have blocked alleged terrorists on trial for their lives from talking about the tortures they were subjected to by the CIA and American military.</p> <p>And then there are the friends of perpetual US administrations who get a pass on America's self proclaimed commitment to freedom. Don't expect Romney to pin Obama down over relations with Gulf oil sheikhs or African dictators with lots of the black stuff under their feet. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a23068a3-f499-45b5-86d0-83605df80af0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349894447950/9ce0807e-21e4-4ee3-aba2-e7f28402de0f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Palestine and Israeli conflict\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Palestinian man from the West Bank village of Burin, throws stones at Jewish settlers of Bracha settlement during clashes in Burin.

  "<p>During Monday night's debate, the presidential candidates weren't the only people in the room who brought on the wrath of the internet.

Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?</p> </blockquote> <p>In general, Schieffer's questions were a bit ... meandering: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rilaws/status/260562116942131200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bob Schieffer's mental landscape is a rich tapestry of strange hypotheticals and ragtime music. \"What if an omelet ate you?\"</p>&mdash; Richard Lawson (@rilaws) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rilaws/status/260562116942131200\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:03:44+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p></p> <p>And in the end, all the internet saw was this: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbn4pebpk1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbn4pebpk1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\"  width= 460px  ></img> </figure>  <p></p> <p>To be fair, there were moments when Schieffer really did try.

  "<p>Mitt Romney's more attentive supporters may have been surprised to hear him outline a strategy to combat Islamic extremism that sounded awfully like the nation-building increasingly out of favour with Republicans as costly and ineffective. Not only that, he mentioned the widely despised United Nations in the same positive breath.</p> <p>Romney painted Barack Obama as weak in the Middle East, and accused him of opening the way to a resurgent al-Qaida and other expressions of Islamic extremism from Libya to Mali. Romney even described the election of a Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, in Egypt as part of a \"pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region\", even though he also said the US works to promote elections.</p> <p>Romney went on to congratulate Obama on killing Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders.</p> <p>\"But we can't kill our way out of this mess,\" he added. \"We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is certainly not on the run.\"</p> <p>Romney elaborated on the theme later in the debate. He spurned invasions and instead advocated a policy of engagement with hallmarks of nation-building, even going so far to helping create civil societies.</p> <p>\"The key that we're going to have to pursue is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We don't want another Iraq; we don't want another Afghanistan. That's not the right course for us,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organised by the UN, to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorists.\"</p> <p>Romney said the scholars came up with a list of four priorities for foreign countries to combat Islamic extremism, beginning with economic development.</p> <p>\"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we push back and give them more economic development,\" he said. \"No 2, better education. No 3, gender equality. No 4, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies.\"</p> <p>The experience of the US, European countries and other nations involved in trying to construct the rule of law, expand education systems and promote equality as well as economic development in other parts of the world, such as Africa, is complicated, expensive and laced with failure among the successes.</p> <p>It usually requires an extended financial commitment \u2013 not something that will be particularly welcome to Republicans who have their eye on the foreign aid budget for deeper spending cuts.</p> <p>Immediately after the debate, Congressman Mike Rogers, a Republican hawk, denied that Romney was promoting nation-building. Rogers said the Republican candidate intends to use trade to pressure governments to change. </p> <p>\"He was talking about better engagement. You can't walk away from those relationships completely. We are for commerce, not conflict. What he was trying to say is we need to use American strength to pursue gender equality, which you see deteriorating all across the Middle East today. We show strength through trade agreements, using our economic power to try to bring those nations along into a more moderate place,\" he said.</p> <p>And on education and civil society? </p> <p>\"He wasn't talking about building schools,\" said Rogers.</p> <p>John Sununu, George Bush Sr's chief of staff, said Romney had identified the causes of the Arab uprisings that had to be addressed if conflict is to be quelled.</p> <p>\"I think he's laying down a set of principles that are important for the world as it deals with the realities of unrest that have been expressed in the Arab Spring. There's a reason people are demonstrating in the streets and they correspond to the points Mitt Romney was making and he's saying those countries have to find a way to deal with it if they want us to help them economically,\" he said.</p> <p>But does that mean more aid and direct involvement?</p> <p>\"Romney's smart enough to know it's a different package for different countries,\" said Sununu.</p>",

Go 0-5, go get 'em tomorrow. Blow a save, get 'em tomorrow. Botch a few plays get 'em tomorrow. The San Francisco Giants and St Louis Cardinals have run out of tomorrows, game sevens are far less forgiving. Falter tonight, play golf on Tuesday - there's no get 'em tomorrow.&#xa0;</p> <p>Luckily for these teams, they have their best pitchers on the mound. Kyle Lohse has been insane this season, yet some were&#xa0;surprised&#xa0;when Cards skipper Mike Matheny picked him to start the wild-card game against the Braves. He pitched well, then held the Nats to a run over seven innings in the NLDS, and beat the Giants in Game Three of the NLCS - allowing one run over 5.2 innings of work.</p> <p>Who did he beat? Matt Cain, tonights Giants starter, who allowed three runs in 6.2 innings, taking the loss on the road. Now Cain gets to pitch in front of what should be a rather loud AT&amp;T Park with an entire city behind him. Lohse goes to work in a war zone.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Giants have cleaned up on Cards pitching over the past two games, and St Louis have had no answer for the San Francisco's arms, including a tremendous effort by Ryan Vogelsong on Sunday. They have momentum, and many think the are Cards cooked. Are they? Well, Earl Weaver once said that \"Momentum&#xa0;is the next day's&#xa0;starting pitcher\" and I think Matt Cain hasn't quite been himself lately, while Kyle Lohse has been pitching like someone else all year - an ace.</p> <p>I've got the Cardinals busting out tonight and doing what they do, win games they're not supposed to.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The publisher of the Daily Mirror faces being sued over alleged phone hacking by four public figures, including ex-England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p>Four civil claims were filed against Mirror Group Newspapers at the high court on Monday in the first formal move for damages from any company outside Rupert Murdoch's News International.</p> <p>The allegation by Eriksson relates to the Daily Mirror when Piers Morgan was editor. Morgan, now a primetime TV host on CNN in the US, has repeatedly denied knowledge of phone hacking at the title.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) said: \"We have no comment; we are unaware action has been taken at the high court.\"</p> <p>The claims were filed by the solicitor Mark Lewis on behalf of Eriksson, former footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Shobna Gulati, who played Sunita Alahan in Coronation Street and Anita in Dinnerladies, and Abbie Gibson, the former nanny to David and Victoria Beckham's children. The claims lodged on behalf of Gulati, Gibson and Flitcroft, allege phone hacking at either the Sunday Mirror or the People. MGN faced accusations of hacking during evidence to Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into press standards, but has always said: \"All our journalists work within the criminal law and the PCC [Press Complaints Commission] code of conduct and we have seen no evidence to suggest otherwise.\"</p> <p>Lewis confirmed to the Guardian that the civil claims had been lodged, but said they had not yet been served on MGN. He added that he did not expect to file any further claims against the Daily Mirror's publisher this week.</p> <p>Morgan edited the Daily Mirror between 1995 and 2004. He gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry in December when he repeatedly denied any knowledge of illegal newsgathering techniques at the tabloid. But in May, BBC Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman claimed to the inquiry that Morgan had personally shown him how to illicitly intercept voicemail messages at a lunch in September 2002.</p> <p>Paxman claimed that at the same lunch Morgan had teased Ulrika Jonsson about the details of a private conversation she had had with Erikson, who was England manager at the time.</p> <p>In one testy exchange with Robert Jay, the senior counsel to the Leveson inquiry, in December 2011, Morgan said: \"Not a single person has made any formal or legal complaint against the Daily Mirror for phone hacking.\"</p> <p>The four claims accuse the newspapers of a \"breach of confidence and misuse of private information\" relating to the \"interception and/or misuse of mobile phone voicemail messages and/or the interception of telephone accounts\".</p> <p>Former Blackburn Rovers footballer Flitcroft told the Leveson inquiry in November that he had been hounded by tabloid newspapers over an extra-marital affair in 2001. Golati is the actor best known for playing Sunita Alahan in Coronation Street and, previously, Anita in Dinnerladies.</p> <p>Lewis said no particulars of claim had been filed, but that relevant dates relating to the alleged activity were submitted to the high court. The individuals now have four months to serve particulars of claims on MGN. The merits of the claim remain to be tested.</p> <p>The formal hacking allegations come weeks before Leveson is expected to outline a critical assessment of the ethics of the press in his report to prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>Trinity Mirror has robustly defended its decision not to launch an internal investigation into phone hacking at its titles. Sly Bailey, the former chief executive, told the Leveson inquiry in January that it was unhealthy for a company to investigate unsubstantiated allegations about itself.</p> <p>Bailey said: \"I don't think it's a way to conduct a healthy organisation to go around conducting investigations when there's no evidence that our journalists have been involved in phone hacking.</p> <p>\"There was no evidence and we saw no reason to investigate. We have only seen unsubstantiated allegations and I have seen no evidence that phone hacking has ever taken place at Trinity Mirror.\"</p> <p>Trinity Mirror opened a review of its editorial \"controls and procedures\" following the hacking scandal in July 2011.</p>",

is currently going out on the broadcaster's 10 o'clock news) <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20031176\">has posted a blog</a> entitled: 'why BBC Panorama is investigating BBC Newsnight'.</p> <p>He says that, to the general public, there may be something almost bizarre about the editor of one of BBC journalism's flagships - Panorama - commissioning an investigation into why the editor of another of BBC journalism's flagships - Newsnight - decommissioned an investigation.</p> <p>But he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... at stake is something the corporation regards as one of its crown jewels - the independence of its journalism.</p> <p>Any suggestion that news reporters were prevented from broadcasting a story because of its inconvenience to the corporation could undermine the credibility of BBC News.</p> <p>And so the fact Panorama is able to investigate editorial decisions within the Corporation is seen as evidence of a vital freedom.</p> </blockquote>

class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron has insisted he has not ruled out further inquiries into the Savile scandal but said he did not want to \"slow down the search for the truth\".</p> <p>That's according to a transcript of his interview with ITV 1's <a href=\"http://www.itvmedia.co.uk/The-Agenda\">The Agenda</a>, which goes out in about forty minutes time.</p> <p>The Prime Minister said earlier today that it was \"concerning\" that the BBC effectively changed its story about why it dropped last year's Newsnight report into child abuse Savile.</p> <p>In the interview with The Agenda, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We've got two independent BBC inquiries; we've got three inquiries at the NHS covering Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General.</p> <p>I made sure the Department of Health has got a separate inquiry to oversee that with someone independent. I think if we added another inquiry.... What this is, there are some victims who have suffered terribly and I think we've got to remember them at the absolute heart of this, these women and boys and others that are coming forward... and they must be able to tell their stories and these inquiries must be independent enough to get to the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if he envisaged a phone-hacking style inquiry covering all of the allegations, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, I think the inquiries we've got are right. <br>I don't rule out further inquiries. We've got about six under way and I think if you added another one it might slow down the search for the truth. I think the most important one is the judge...former judge...looking at the BBC and the cultural practices and I think we should allow that to get to the truth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5085af3ac0e343ef1abc7e56\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T20:40:26.657Z\">9.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of tonight's broadcasts, there is some food for thought from Mark Damazer, master of St Peter's College, Oxford, and a former high ranking BBC figure who had stints as a controller of Radio 4 and as a deputy director of BBC News.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/bbc-newsnight-probe-needless-navel-gazing\">In a piece for the Guardian</a>, he says that the BBC relishes a good self-kicking but that Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and his superiors don't deserve it: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People under this degree of constant pressure are, from time to time, going to miscalculate.</p> <p>Who wouldn't? Maybe the BBC could have made this or that move a bit earlier. Maybe. But I do not see an organisation that is being cavalier about Savile or Newsnight, or even particularly defensive.</p> <p>The BBC lives by noble ideals, of course often imperfectly executed, and is trying to get to the bottom of it.</p> <p>I know that many licence-payers will feel let down. But the BBC has recovered before from editorial dramas \u2013 and we ought not to enjoy its misfortunes.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5085a30958f96784ee2908df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T19:48:25.382Z\">8.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good evening and welcome to our live blog coverage of the deepening fall-out from the sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and the controversy over the BBC's handling of the affair.</p> <p>The next couple of hours will potentially be extremely uncomfortable ones for certain figures at the Beeb as the corporation airs an investigation by a team at <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/ss8hg/panorama--jimmy-savile---what-the-bbc-knew-a-panorama-special\">Panorama</a> into what happened at Newsnight late last year when an item into the Savile claims was dropped.</p> <p>It emerged earlier today that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/22/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile-scandal\">the Newsnight editor responsible for dropping that report, Peter Rippon, is to step aside</a>, as the BBC was forced to admit that Newsnight was aware of allegations that Savile had abused teenagers on the corporation's premises and had unearthed information not previously known to the police.</p> <p>The BBC said that Rippon's initial explanation as to why he killed off a Newsnight investigation into Savile in December 2011 was \"inaccurate or incomplete in some respects\". The corporation <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/10/jimmy_savile_and_newsnight_a_c.html\">has made three corrections to a blogpost </a>written by Rippon, which was published on 2 October, when the Savile abuse allegations first became public.<br>&#xa0;<br>We will be keeping an eye on Panorama, which airs at 10.35pm on BBC 1, reaction to it and also tonight's Newsnight itself, which will start on BBC 2 at 10.30pm.</p> <p>In addition, ITV 1's The Agenda goes out at 10.35pm with a pre-recorded interview with David Cameron in which he has made another intervention into the affair.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T20:28:09.832Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
