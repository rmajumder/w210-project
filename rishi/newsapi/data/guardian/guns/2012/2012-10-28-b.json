  "<p>He may be just over four years short of his 80th birthday but to listen to Dave Whelan discussing subjects ranging from big business to dartboards, there is little doubting that the Wigan chairman likes the rush of a good deal. As he has pushed for the club to be more self-sufficient in recent years, the work done by Roberto Mart\u00ednez over the past three seasons is all the more remarkable.</p> <p>But after a summer that saw him ridiculed \u2013 with even Liverpool's managing director, Ian Ayre, branding him a \"comedian\" \u2013 for speaking publicly about other clubs, including Liverpool and Tottenham, pursuing Mart\u00ednez, Whelan, who pondered the idea of passing control over to his grandson a year ago, showed his interest and desire have not wavered.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez had put months into a deal to sign the defender Iv\u00e1n Ramis from Real Mallorca and when he found that West Ham had lodged a higher bid, Whelan dipped into his own pocket and even travelled to Spain to ensure the \u00a33m transfer went through.</p> <p>After a chastening experience, which saw Ramis responsible for his new team conceding two goals in the first eight minutes of the 2-0 defeat to Chelsea on the opening weekend, the 28-year-old underlined his emergence as a force in English football with a powerful volley to set Wigan on their way against West Ham.</p> <p>Mart\u00ednez, who jokingly dismissed Sam Allardyce's claim that his Spanish connection made the difference in signing Ramis by restating his own Catalan roots, feels indebted to Whelan.</p> <p>\"We couldn't match the valuation of what West Ham agreed with Mallorca and [until] the chairman found the money we didn't have at the football club, that moment is a worry that you feel you're going to lose the player,\" Mart\u00ednez said.</p> <p>\"But the chairman knew how much we wanted to get the player and he allowed us to match the price. I don't know how big his pockets are but they were big enough on this occasion. Being a football man makes a big difference. He went over to Mallorca and he was really influential in the deal.</p> <p>\"[Ramis] is developing his communication skills quickly and he's a leader. It's a really important signing for us. He's been one of the best defenders in Spain for three or four years.\"</p> <p>Wigan's run of seven wins in nine, which included victories against Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle that took Mart\u00ednez's side to safety last season, had begun to seem like a distant memory.</p> <p>But after the opener from Ramis and a goal from the Scotland midfielder James McArthur, who drove in from Shaun Maloney's lay-off, earned a first home win of the season, West Ham's James Tomkins headed in from George McCartney's cross in added time.</p> <p>\"Everyone thinks we're going to be down there and we want to prove those people wrong,\" McArthur said. \"We want to win as many games as possible \u2013 and fast too \u2013 to get ourselves away from trouble.\"</p> <p>After a fine start to the campaign, West Ham now face a run of matches running into December that includes games against Manchester City, Newcastle, Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea.</p> <p>While Allardyce insisted the match officials played no part in his team's defeat, he believes Andy Carroll, who is still looking for a first goal since joining from Liverpool, could receive better protection. \"Referees aren't giving him enough free kicks when he is manhandled by central defenders who, let's face it, are having a difficult job coping with the quality that he's got,\" Allardyce said.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> James McCarthy (Wigan Athletic)</p>",

It's an unlikely story, everything from the unlikely resurgences from Marco Scutaro and Barry Zito, amazing comebacks and some clutch hitting and spectacular pitching.</p> <p>Again, tomorrow morning we'll have more in detail. Until then, here's the greatest piece of writing on baseball, the opening of Bart Giamatti's \"The Green Fields of the Mind \"</p> <blockquote> <p>It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops.</p> </blockquote> <p>I can't say it better any better than that.

Not only would they have to win four straight games to clinch a World Series title, something that has never been done before, but they would have to hope for their stagnant offense would pick up. The Detroit Tigers have had back-to-back shutouts, and have only scored three runs the entire World Series (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-1-live\">two of them on a mostly meaningless Jhonny Peralta home run in Game 1</a>).</p> <p>The good news, well the \"as good as it gets\" news at least, for Detroit is that if they can just survive tonight's game they have Justin Verlander going for them in a potential Game 5. Verlander pitched poorly in Game 1 but they can't think he will throw two clunkers in a row. Of course, they cannot even begin to think about the possibility of a Game 5 until they survive game four. They will put strikeout wizard Max Scherzer, on the hill against Giants ace Matt Cain, who has been up and down this postseason.</p> <p>Perhaps they can take a few cues from the Boston Red Sox who were the first team to come back from a 0-3 deficit to win a seven game postseason series when they did it in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odxcb0sIdt8\">2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.ruskin.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Ruskin College in Oxford</a>, for 100 years the illustrious alma mater of diverse labour movement talents from Noah Ablett to John Prescott, on Saturday <a href=\"http://www.ruskin.ac.uk/news/2012/10/23/Grand_Opening_of_Ruskins_21st_century_College_\" title=\"\">opened its new site at Headington</a>: purpose-built and accessible to those with interrupted educations and disabilities, it sees itself as the embodiment of social mobility. But the move has provoked <a href=\"http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/thoughts-questions-of-a-ruskin-graduate-on-the-college-archives/\" title=\"\">a tumultuous row</a> about the way it has handled its own past. It is not only leaving a century of memories behind, it has also shredded part of its archive. Most contentiously, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/22/celebrate-visionary-plebs\" title=\"\">it has disposed of many old student records</a>. Nothing more than institutional flotsam and jetsam, perhaps, and in breach of data protection laws too. But only the future knows where the gold dust lies.</p> <p>A cloud of archival dust now obscures the facts. But it seems beyond dispute that <a href=\"http://hildakean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Summary-19-October-archive-material-and-responses.pdf\" title=\"\">many paper records</a> containing personal information have been destroyed while other, older ones, have been partly digitised. Space is limited on the new site. Some collections have been sent to other archives. Many of the college's pamphlets and posters, the memorabilia of a radical past, have been preserved in London, at <a href=\"http://www.bishopsgate.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Bishopsgate Institute</a>. A painting of Bernard Shaw, by the Fabian artist <a href=\"http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Newc_B&amp;initial=N\" title=\"\">Bertha Newcombe</a>, has been returned to the Labour party. <a href=\"http://hildakean.com/?p=1451\" title=\"\">Critics of the principal</a>, Prof Audrey Mullender, wonder why the college didn't hold on to this link with its earliest days, and accuse her of damaging the soul of an institution whose history is woven through 20th-century radicalism. They wonder why no use was made of a supposed escape clause from the rules that allows records to be kept for historical and statistical research. But its application to the records of the living is shrouded in uncertainty. Prof Mullender's legal advice was that holding on to the records was in breach of the law.</p> <p>What's not in doubt is that the destruction threatens to leave future historians half-blind. Everyone recognises that the old audit trail of diaries and letters is almost gone. The humdrum detail of lives lived today will be gleaned only obliquely. The little people, whose history Ruskin academics such as <a href=\"http://www.raphael-samuel.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Raphael Samuel</a> made a part of the national story, risk being blotted out. Yet these scraps of history, the registration and graduation records that appear so ephemeral, the notes of the work they had been doing, the union that sponsored them, and the lives they later lived, are the sinews and tissue that anchor subject in time and place.</p> <p>Clarification is now urgently sought. It could be that hundreds of colleges and universities and scores of other institutions are technically breaking the law on record-keeping. If they are, and the destruction of records becomes an inescapable obligation, then the legitimate desire to secure personal privacy against the gaze of the prurient threatens to leave the future a sadly unfurnished place.</p>",
  "<p>From the outside at least it appears there is only one club in west London worth following if it is goals and attacking swagger you are looking for. But after this enthralling encounter Fulham can justifiably feel they deserve to be spoken of in similar terms as their neighbours Chelsea.</p> <p>Waking up on Sunday morning, and having got over the frustration of twice losing the lead to a Reading side yet to record a Premier League win this season, Martin Jol's men could reflect on having scored as many goals, 19, as the European Champions \u2013 albeit having played one game extra \u2013 and one more than Manchester City and five more than Arsenal from the same number of fixtures.</p> <p>They have become eye-catching entertainers and will continue to be so should Dimitar Berbatov maintain the level of performance he delivered at the Madjeski on Saturday.</p> <p>The Bulgarian was his typical languid self, barely breaking out of walking pace at times, but his control and delivery of possession were captivating and allowed Fulham to open up Reading on many occasions. And then there was his goal after 88 minutes, a masterclass in movement and finishing, and a strike which, had it not been for Hal Robson-Kanu's scrappy late equaliser, would have sealed a win that would have moved them into the top four.</p> <p>\"You can see he [Berbatov] is a really good player and we're disappointed he couldn't be the matchwinner,\" said the Fulham captain, Brede Hangeland. \"Overall we have really talented players [in attack] and when they're fit it must be a headache for the manager. A good one, though.\"</p> <p>Indeed, on the eve of this game Jol had spoken of Fulham now having better attacking options than \"at any time over the last decade\" and, with Berbatov supplemented by fellow summer signings Hugo Rodallega and Mladen Petric, the Dutchman's assertion does not appear a wild one.</p> <p>Alongside them is Bryan Ruiz, who came off the bench to score Fulham's first goal with a rasping drive from the edge of the area and then set up their second, scored by Chris Baird, who himself has two goals in his last two appearances. In general it feels as if the departures of Clint Dempsey and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 are no longer being sorely felt.</p> <p>\"What is my best forward line? That is still a problem and it's already October,\" said Jol. \"But it's a luxury problem.\"</p> <p>Reading's problems are more concerning. The team remain in the relegation zone and without a clean sheet or a victory after eight games back in the top flight, but they can take heart from the spirit they showed here, with Gareth McCleary and Robson-Kanu both getting them back on level terms in the last five minutes of the match after Mikele Leigertwood had given them the lead with an excellent long-range drive.</p> <p>\"I'm playing the game, not the outcome,\" said a defiant McDermott, whose side's next game is Capital One Cup tie with Arsenal.</p> <p>\"The outcome will be in May and wherever we end up, we end up. We did exactly the same thing last year; people talked about promotion, and someone said, 'It's yours to lose', but I just concentrate on playing the game. People should also remember that 20-30 years ago this club was in whatever division, but it certainly wasn't this one.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Dimitar Berbatov (Fulham)</p>",
  "<p>Somehow Chelsea contrived <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/28/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">to finish Sunday's match</a> without Fernando Torres, Juan Mata, Eden Hazard or Oscar on the pitch. Although there were extenuating circumstances involving several crucial calls by the officials, this looked like a failure of managerial judgment. Roman Abramovich, sitting high in his East Stand eyrie, would certainly have been wondering what had happened to the \u00a3130m he invested in the quartet.</p> <p>Torres had been sent off for a second yellow card. He could have gone for the first, a high lunge on Tom Cleverley, although the second, for a dive as he ran at four defenders, seemed marginal as there appeared to be involuntary contact with Jonny Evans's leg.</p> <p>But the other three were withdrawn, one by one, between the 66th and 82nd minutes as Roberto Di Matteo strove to claw back something from a contest in which his side had already made an impressive comeback. Each decision was understandable when viewed in isolation but together they robbed the league leaders of the chance to manufacture a more constructive response to a heavy dose of misfortune.</p> <p>If the initial comeback had been impressive, the same could not be said about the way they conceded two goals to Manchester United inside the opening 12 minutes. Sir Alex Ferguson had picked Antonio Valencia to play as a conventional winger on the right and Chelsea's surprisingly flimsy cover was immediately stretched to breaking point.</p> <p>Both goals came from incursions down that flank, although it was Wayne Rooney whose cross from the right provoked David Luiz's own-goal before Robin van Persie hammered in Valencia's precise cut-back. At that point, and for some time afterwards, Chelsea were all over the place.</p> <p>Their central defence, in the persons of David Luiz and Gary Cahill, had the consistency of wet tissue paper, while Ashley Cole was receiving no help in defending his area of the pitch against Valencia and Rafael da Silva, with little cover forthcoming from Mikel John Obi and Ramires. Gradually, however, their front four players \u2013 Torres and the attacking midfield trio \u2013 brought them back into the match, with the assistance of a United team strangely willing to give the ball away in their own half.</p> <p>For half an hour, either side of half-time, Abramovich had the pleasure of watching his team play the way he expects, full of artistry and inventiveness, looking fully worthy of their position at the top of the table as David de Gea held them at bay, making a number of saves with his lower limbs. Torres worked hard and took advantage of United's generosity to put over several probing crosses from the right, Mata and Hazard probed ominously and Oscar had a touch of the divine about his work. The Brazilian, who turned 21 last month, drifts and ghosts about the pitch with a finely tuned sensitivity to the shifting patterns of play. Put the genes of his compatriots Kak\u00e1 and Juninho Paulista into a test tube and you would come out with something resembling the slender, elusive No 10.</p> <p>One gloriously sinuous run eight minutes from the interval made three opponents look as though they were trying to tackle smoke. For the equaliser he accepted David Luiz's pass in the inside-left position and floated a ball over to the far post, where Mata's superb control allowed the Spaniard to bring the ball down and clip it to the far post, where Oscar was waiting to regain possession before measuring a cross that Ramires met with a strong header past De Gea.</p> <p>There will be much more to come from that quarter but aesthetic considerations took a back seat on Sunday to the fact of a victory that brought United level with Manchester City and to within a point of Chelsea. If Ferguson's side were fortunate with several pivotal decisions, then they could be said to have made their own luck through the positive manner in which they approached the challenge of securing their first win in domestic competition at the Bridge in 10 years.</p> <p>Until he committed the foul on Hazard that enabled Mata to strike the equaliser with a sumptuous free-kick, Rooney had enjoyed an outstanding game. Playing behind Van Persie in a 4-4-1-1 formation, he did everything he does in the Premier League and fails to accomplish in an international shirt. He looked fit, fast and mentally alert, with an adhesive first touch and a near-perfect control of his passing. When he foraged back to win the ball around the edge of the United area, his interventions were made with first-class timing.</p> <p>He was fortunate, however, that when he made his big error, it did not turn out to cost United the match. Robbed by Hazard 30 yards from his own goal, he turned and chased and made a tackle from behind with the kind of rashness associated with his less admirable displays. He received a yellow card and might have had another when he threw out an arm to obstruct Cole in the 71st minute. Shortly thereafter he was withdrawn by Ferguson, presumably out of prudence.</p> <p>At the end of such an intense and percussive contest there could be only a sense of relief that the steward who lay surrounded by paramedics in the tumultuous aftermath of United's winner \u2013 scored by Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, who had come back from an offside position \u2013 had, according to Chelsea, merely slipped and twisted his knee.</p>",
  "<p>Matt Frei has himself a pick-up truck; he's hitting the road, going in search of the American Dream. \"Somewhere along the line I know there'll be girls, visions, everything,\" he says dreamily, arm hanging louchely out of the open window. \"Somewhere along the line the pearl will be handed to me.\"</p> <p>Oh, sorry, no he doesn't, my mistake; that's Sal in On The Road. But Frei does seem to be feeling the freedom of the open road, released from the seriousness of being a serious Channel 4 news person (Washington correspondent, now presenter).</p> <p>This \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-american-road-trip-obamas-story\" title=\"\"><strong>The American Roadtrip: Obama's Story</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday) \u2013 is serious television; Frei is testing the temperature in the crucial midwest swing states ahead of next week's election. But he does have a Dodge Ram 1500 dual cab. He can let himself go a bit, put on a pair of sunnies, lose the tie. It's a bit like bumping into your teacher during the holidays, at the beach.</p> <p>And there may not be pearls or visions, but there are girls. There's Glenda, his \"road trip mistress\", she who must be obeyed, otherwise known as the sat nav. \"No, darling, I'm not going to turn left on highway 280, I'm going to carry on on this one,\" says Matt with masterly authority. And there's Karen, a Mormon elder, whose knickers Matt wants to talk about, her magic Mormon knickers (because of Mitt Romney's faith). They're an expression of her covenant with God, says Karen. Do men and women wear them? Yes. Does she wear them? Yes.</p> <p>Matt's got Karen's pants between his teeth now, so to speak. He's shaking his head from side to side like a terrier; he's not going to let go until he's got to the bottom of them, so to speak. Does she find it awkward talking about her underwear? It's not something they usually talk about. Wouldn't it be better just to put them out there? Oh Matt, just ask her if you can see her knickers, you clearly want to. To be honest, I do, too. What do sacred Mormon pants look like? I'm guessing, given that the idea is to ward off temptation not beckon it, that they're not like the sort that come from Agent Provocateur.</p> <p>Matt doesn't ask. But he does ask other brave questions. In Northwood, Iowa, he asks a gun shop owner whose phone ringtone is the sound of an AK47 what this election is all about.</p> <p>In Kentucky, he asks a Tea party Bible basher if he hates Obama because he's black. In Gary, Indiana, he asks a man if Mitt Romney is a brother by another mother, slightly embarrassingly.</p> <p>This is \"fly-over America\", the bit in the middle that most visitors don't get to see. Where the second amendment is a basic human right. Where \"Yurr-rup\" is mistrusted, an insignificant place a long way away, probably somewhere between \"Eye-raq\" and North Korea. Where once great industrial towns lie crumbling and abandoned. Where, these days, a middle-class couple has to work 100 hours a week between them just to keep the bailiffs from the door. Where the next generation is going to struggle to be better off than this one. Where the American Dream is dying and Obama's health-care reforms aren't going to save it.</p> <p>It's a fascinating place, even though it's often a forgotten place. Except in the runup to a presidential</p> <p>election. When it suddenly becomes just about the most important place in the whole&#xa0;world.</p> <p>Speaking of important places, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00v36y1\" title=\"\"><strong>Harry&#xa0;&amp; Paul</strong></a> (BBC2, Sunday) seem to have moved to my north-west London manor. Oi, that's the bus stop up the road. \"What a wonderful place Willesden is,\" says Victoria Wood who joins in to play, alongside Harry, a pair of minor royals, visiting a corner shop in a less salubrious part of town than they're used to. It's one of the hits.</p> <p>What, hit and miss? A sketch show? Really? Of course it is. You could even argue that this kind of traditional sketch show shouldn't have much of a future. But television would be poorer without Harry &amp; Paul, because it can be&#xa0;so good.</p> <p>It's not about the gags \u2013 if you looked at the script, you would probably just think: eh? It's all about the characters, and the interaction of the characters. Enfield and Whitehouse don't just dress up and put on silly voices, they possess their characters. The hits are big hits. \"Probable quare\" still makes me laugh. And the one at the end where it all goes Nordic noir is&#xa0;a joy.</p>",
  "<p>Southampton are proving a dangerous team but they will survive in the Premier League only if they start doing more damage to opponents than themselves. Nigel Adkins's side made Tottenham suffer here but only after shooting themselves in the foot and a second-half fightback was not enough to wrestle any points from the visitors, who climbed into the top four for the first time this season, while Saints remain stranded in the relegation zone.</p> <p>Adkins, aware of the mounting concern among the club's fans about his team's erratic start to the season and the resultant implications to his own job security, previewed this game by repeating Abraham Lincoln's warning about the precariousness of a house divided, but a divided defence is just as ruinous and Southampton were again in disarray in that department.</p> <p>That was obvious as early as the third minute when a weak header by Maya Yoshida handed an opportunity to Aaron Lennon. Under pressure from the goalkeeper Artur Boruc, however, Lennon prodded narrowly wide from close range.</p> <p>The defence got scant protection from midfield, where Southampton were outnumbered and Tom Huddlestone enjoyed the freedom to do as he pleased. Jermain Defoe should have scored in the 14th minute but fired fractionally wide after fine work down the right by Lennon and Kyle Walker.</p> <p>Southampton's reprieve was short-lived, as one minute later Huddlestone, again unattended, clipped the ball to the back post, where Gareth Bale, returning from paternity leave to torment the club that nurtured him until he left for Tottenham as a teenager in 2007, sent a header into the bottom corner.</p> <p>Bale went close with another header from a Huddlestone corner in the 25th minute before Southampton performed one of their most embarrassing defensive disintegrations of a season that has already featured several farces at the back.</p> <p>Lennon was allowed to run forward 50 yards from inside his own half before slipping the ball through to Defoe, who guided it past the outrushing Boruc. The backtracking Jos\u00e9 Fonte dawdled before attempting to clear the shot and then slipped, meaning he succeeded only in tapping the ball into the path of Clint Dempsey, who smashed into the net from three yards.</p> <p>That prompted furious jeers from the locals and Boruc, making his home debut, exchanged angry words with some of his side's fans. Adkins said he would look into claims on Twitter that a bottle was thrown by his goalkeeper during the dispute.</p> <p>It was starting to look like the only thing stopping Southampton from keeping up their average of conceding four goals per game so far this season was the poor finishing of Spurs, especially Defoe. Then suddenly Southampton improved. Substitutions have tended to backfire on Adkins this season but his replacement of Jason Puncheon with Emmanuel Mayuka in the 58th minute, coupled with a formation adjustment to give the hosts a foothold in central midfield, triggered an immediate upswing.</p> <p>Yoshida came close to scoring but his header was cleared off the line. From the resultant corner Fonte produced a foxy flick that Brad Friedel batted away desperately before Jay Rodriguez slammed the rebound into the net.</p> <p>Tottenham, hitherto so dominant, found themselves clinging on just as they had done when prevailing 3-2 at Manchester United last month, with Sandro, William Gallas and Steven Caulker making important blocks late on. \"We were extremely good in the first half,\" said Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, the Tottenham manager. \"Then suddenly in the second half it was like the match at Old Trafford and we showed desire to fight for the result.\"</p> <p>Adkins, meanwhile, insisted his job was not in jeopardy. \"Yes,\" he boomed emphatically when asked whether he was confident he would be given time to turn things around. \"We are all working together. I said before the season that we've had plain sailing for the last two years but in the Premier League there would be some choppy waters and we would have to ride it out.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Aaron Lennon (Tottenham Hotspur)</p>",
  "<p>The year after David Cameron became Tory party leader, he did something party leaders normally never do: he spoke at a fringe meeting of his party conference, such was his passion for the subject under discussion. I remember it well, since I asked him to do the debate and chaired the event.</p> <p>The issue was the environment. Cameron disarmed an audience filled with green activists, impressing them as he batted back questions.</p> <p>This was, after all, the cause so central to his drive to decontaminate the Conservative party image; remember those husky pictures, the green logo, the exhortations to \"<a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1251723/david_cameron_launches_vote_blue_go_green_and_save_money/\" title=\"\">Vote Blue, Go Green</a>\".</p> <p>Within days of taking office, Cameron declared his coalition would be \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/david-cameron-greenest-government-ever?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the greenest government ever</a>\". For all the froth of his detractors he can confidently back up this claim, the tone set from the start with support for the 10:10 campaign. Labour argued it was impossible to meet the target yet Whitehall exceeded it; within one year, it cut emissions by 13.8%.</p> <p>It is logical for Conservatives to set the pace on the environment; it is about conservation of resources, after all, while reducing Whitehall's carbon footprint cut government spending with lower energy bills. Margaret Thatcher, a scientist by training, <a href=\"http://richardwillisuk.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/margaret-thatcher-%E2%80%93-climate-change-pioneer/\" title=\"\">was admirably far-sighted on this subject</a>, warning 24 years ago of the danger greenhouse gases posed to the planet. By painting his party green, Cameron was true to her legacy.</p> <p>With each passing day, evidence grows that Lady Thatcher was right to raise the alarm. Most worrying was the extent of Arctic ice melt this summer, outpacing even the most dire predictions. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\" title=\"\">September was the 331st consecutive month</a> in which the globe's temperature exceeded last century's average; the odds of this happening by chance are greater than the number of stars in the universe.</p> <p>Given this rising tide of evidence and the overwhelming strength of scientific opinion, it is strange the Conservatives appear to be developing cold feet. There is a growing internal backlash against the green agenda, one threatening to torpedo both the public trust in politicians and the party's stuttering modernisation project.</p> <p>Most visible was the promotion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/11/owen-paterson-environment-guardian-profile\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson</a> to the environment portfolio \u2013 a man hailed by ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie as the only senior British Tory who could easily win election as a US Republican. If that is not enough evidence against him for this job, he claims to be a \"realist\" on global warming, opposes wind farms and wants to cancel green energy plans.</p> <p>After hearing Paterson's risible speech to party conference earlier this month \u2013 which failed to mention climate change \u2013 one green-minded minister said to me: \"Well, at least the battle lines are clear now.\" But his was not the only alarming move: John Hayes, who has also opposed wind farms, was moved to energy minister while Peter Lilley, one of the most hardline sceptics, was appointed last week to the Commons energy and climate change committee.</p> <p>Meanwhile the chancellor George Osborne is leading attempts to cut subsidies for renewable energies, abandon decarbonisation targets and embark on a huge expansion of gas power plants and shale gas development. The dispute inside the coalition over the forthcoming energy bill is so heated there has already been one special meeting of the \"quad\" group of senior ministers, with another pencilled in for this week.</p> <p>To his credit, Cameron mentioned green issues three times in his conference speech \u2013 unlike Ed Miliband, who despite being a former climate change minister ignored them in his own party address. But the prime minister is supporting Osborne on the energy bill, hoping a ban or tax on plastic bags will underline sufficiently their green credentials (although even this minor measure is causing concern that it might be seen as adding to the cost of living).</p> <p>Ill-informed loudmouths have long opposed policies to tackle climate change. Sadly, their views appear to be gaining ascendancy, such is the Tory leadership's desire to appease the right, combined with the fear of appearing elitist by endorsing measures that might affect the cost of living. \"It has become a totemic issue,\" said one senior Tory. \"Either you are a tough Essex man in touch with the people or you are dismissed as an effete metropolitan toff.\"</p> <p>The environment is far from the first concern of focus groups, although there is clear support for green policies. But if you believe humans are causing climate change, there can be no issue of comparable importance. Regardless, the debate has moved on in recent years: it is no longer about shackling business but about supporting a booming green economy that employs more people than the car and telecom industries combined, with huge export potential to the fastest-growing parts of the world.</p> <p>China alone is investing \u00a31 trillion in the low-carbon economy over the next five years; little wonder foreign secretary William Hague has emerged as an unlikely cabinet champion. Meanwhile such is the political prevarication, global energy giants are threatening to withdraw massive investment in Britain. To be anti-green now is to be anti-growth.</p> <p>Cameron has not given a speech on the environment since taking office. Yet along with health, this was the issue most personally identified with his transformation of the Tories. We saw the damage caused by bungled health reforms; imagine the dismay and distrust caused by shooting badgers, stopping wind farms, supporting airport expansion and strangling the green economy.</p> <p>There is a danger the short-term search for favourable headlines blows away any long-term sense of strategy. This is why the prime minister must demonstrate his continuing passion for green politics, which played such a prominent role in making him his party's first prime minister for a generation. Whether politically, economically or scientifically, it would be senseless and self-defeating to give ground on this crucial cause.</p>",
  "<p>This has not been a good year for England cricket. Having reached the Test match heights following their home humiliation of India, they were brought down first by Pakistan in the Middle East and then at home by South Africa. And on and on rumbled the Kevin Pietersen saga, resolved in principle but not yet demonstrably. The captain who took them to the top with such honest determination has gone, his game on the wane (although he managed more runs than any other England batsman last summer) and his spirit and energy sapped.</p> <p>Against this background England arrive in India to begin 15 months of cricket that could either establish them once more as the premier Test match side in the world or leave them jostling in the middle of the pack.</p> <p>They will find opponents on whose behalf a good game is already being talked but who in reality are in significant upheaval as a formidable side, growing old together, fragments. Gone already from one of the most vaunted batting line-ups in the game's history are Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman. The new England captain, Alastair Cook, was not yet five years old when Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut, and this master batsman is now having his stumps rattled on a regular basis by bowlers he would once have picked off for a pastime. The two openers, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, have not scored a Test century between them in two years, and Zaheer Khan, their premier pace bowler, is on his last legs. Virat Kohli, unquestionably a potential genius, cannot compensate on his own.</p> <p>India's runs may not flow as once they did so readily and, often, beautifully. Instead the threat, so they say, will come from spin against which England players, as a breed, have been technically inept. Ravichandran Ashwin, the tall offspinner with the hidden doosra, has just been elevated to the highest level of contract by the BCCI and he will be complemented by Pragyan Ojha's left-arm spin. England will see overtones of the manner in which Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman destroyed them in the UAE.</p> <p>Pitches will be slow, it is said, and will spin: Kohli has said as much, citing home advantage and the manner in which India were given flat decks in their warm-up matches in England and then encountered green tops in the Tests themselves. That is fair enough.</p> <p>In the Emirates England were undone as much by the manner in which the ball skidded on low than spin per se and in Sri Lanka last spring, after an indifferent start, they began to cope better in more orthodox Asian conditions. If, then, India should be careful what they wish for, it would be a mistake for England to go into the series believing that it is necessary to change the blueprint that brought them their good times of the past few years in order to succeed now. England's bowling strength comes in their pace attack, backed up by Graeme Swann. In the seven matches in which Swann has been partnered with Monty Panesar, they have not been successful once.</p> <p>Pitches in India have always been slow, almost always devoid of grass and, in the absence of a good home pace attack (as opposed to individuals), invariably prepared for their spinners. The only two times England won a series in India in the past 80 years provide salutary lessons, however.</p> <p>In 1976-77, in which Tony Greig's England overcame arguably the finest spin attack of all time, in their own conditions, to win 3-1, Derek Underwood took 29 wickets in five Tests. But John Lever and Bob Willis also took 46 wickets between them from near enough the same number of overs combined, while Chris Old's pace won the third Test. Eight years later, under David Gower, the industry of the spinners Phil Edmonds and Pat Pocock took the plaudits but no one took more wickets at a cheaper cost than Norman Cowans, or Neil Foster, whose seam clinched the series.</p> <p>So the idea that England might go into the Tests either with two spinners included in a four-man attack or that they jettison a batsman to make room for a third seamer ought to be rejected. Instead it could be Steven Finn who provides the biggest challenge for India's batsmen. Well beaten as England were in the one-day series in India a year ago, it was Finn who in the limited opportunity provided by that form of cricket, managed to rattle the opposition, even on sluggish pitches. He was quick through the air and found lift where others could not: Willis was similar. The newer Indian batsmen, and some old stagers, have shown vulnerability against the short ball.</p> <p>However Finn and the other bowlers will need the security of good totals if they are to flourish. Batting in India is not about strike rates but occupation of the crease. Pietersen may provide the pyrotechnics at some stage but it is the workers \u2013 Cook, Jonathan Trott and perhaps Nick Compton \u2013 who will provide the bedrock. If they come to terms with the conditions, England can win this series. If not, there is little the bowlers can do.</p>",
  "<p>There are some pursuers who are not particularly distinguished, like the Keystone Cops, and others who hunt down their quarry with the relentlessness of a bounty hunter.</p> <p>Fernando Alonso, it can be assumed, belongs to the latter category. A little while ago he was the hunted. But since he has been caught and passed by Sebastian Vettel he has sought to regain his advantage with a ferocity of will that might yet unnerve the men from Red Bull.</p> <p>For most of the season he has driven a car that has not been a match for the Red Bull or the McLaren for that matter. At the beginning of the season it was a dog. But Alonso, the driver of the season so far, has won races and earned podium positions to which he had no entitlement \u2013 the true sign of a great driver.</p> <p>He has been outscored 100-48 by the German in the past four races. But after splitting the Red Bulls he said on Sunday: \"There are 75 points and we are 13 behind and we know we need to improve. We are not fast enough, especially on Saturday, but we can improve the situation in Abu Dhabi or USA. I think Brazil will be quite good and hopefully I am going to be happy.</p> <p>\"As we saw with Mark [Webber] with the Kers problem, it can happen to Seb or it can happen to me, so I am optimistic. I think it is good news for us, seeing that we could fight Red Bull in the race. We need to be closer to them in qualifying. At the moment we are not able to win.\"</p> <p>Vettel has led every lap of the past three races and the last man to do that was Ayrton Senna in 1989. He remains the outstanding favourite but the blob of Ferrari red in his rear view will not go away.</p> <p>After the 26th victory of his short but astonishing career Vettel agreed he had one hand on the trophy but reminded everyone that the other hand was Alonso's.</p> <p>Vettel said: \"I was able to brake a little bit late and have quite a good exit out of turn three, which was important for the remainder of the race, and then was able to open a gap, not just to Mark but also to the cars behind and obviously control the race from there. I think we were very competitive on the soft tyres; on the hard tyres I think McLarens and Ferrari were pretty competitive.</p> <p>\"I think it's been an incredible two years for us, both times to come here and win the race, get the pole on Saturday and win the race on Sunday is fantastic.</p> <p>\"There's always a very nice trophy so I'm very, very happy to pick up another one this year. I don't know what it is about this circuit but I really like the flow of it. Sector one is a bit slow with long straights but sector two and three are really nice and I think we all enjoy it.\"</p> <p>It was another disappointing performance from the Mercedes team, who failed to score a point. Michael Schumacher suffered a puncture early on and never recovered and Nico Rosberg finished 11th.</p> <p>Schumacher also escaped a penalty for ignoring blue flags. He was investigated for impeding Romain Grosjean during the race at the Buddh International Circuit. But after both drivers talked to the stewards it was decided that Schumacher had not deliberately held up the Lotus driver.</p> <p>Meanwhile Formula One's chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, is ready to welcome the French Grand Prix back on to the calendar for next year. Ecclestone said: \"As far as I am concerned, yes. I am hoping. We are ready to sign. We have a pen and are ready to sign.\"</p> <p>Following the postponement of next year's inaugural race in New Jersey it had seemed the schedule might consist of only 19 events. But Ecclestone revealed on Sunday that a replacement was possible and France, which has not staged a race since 2008, is the favourite to get the nod.</p>",
  "<p>When you're in opposition, good news can be bad news. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Slightly better figures</a> on growth, on employment and inflation may prove a mirage. But a real recovery has the capacity to transform the terms of political trade. It would make Labour's loudest message \u2013 \"it isn't working\" \u2013 immediately redundant.</p> <p>We know the caveats. This doesn't yet feel like recovery in the real world of family budgets squeezed by rising fuel and food bills, or of high streets with windows boarded up. Everything is fragile. And history offers plenty of examples (John Major) of prime ministers getting recovery without the political credit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edballs?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Ed Balls</a> knows all that, and made a shrewd intervention after the latest GDP figures, reminding the Tories that with more tax rises coming, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, David Cameron would be unwise to be complacent. He went on to list Labour ideas on the economy, from the proper reform of the banks to the use of the new mobile spectrum money to build 100,000 affordable homes.</p> <p>Yet voters hear the big messages only, and Labour hasn't yet got a clear enough, simple enough, big-picture economic alternative. It's still vulnerable to the Tory charge of being the party of splurge. Balls and Ed Miliband have already decided that they can't assume the coalition will lose the next election on the grounds of economic competence. So, what's the story?</p> <p>There are intriguing hints. Today, Miliband makes his first major speech since the \"one nation\" clothes-stealing escapade in Manchester. It's on mental health but the underlying theme will be that this is a crisis which cannot be resolved by big government alone, but needs all of society's institutions, from hospitals to companies such as BT (which is taking mental health seriously), to roll up their sleeves. In almost every area, he is repositioning Labour away from statism and Gordon Brown's belief in centralised micro-management.</p> <p>That may be a vital first step when money is tight, but is it sincere? And how can non-state players be made to work for progressive ends? Going well beyond hints are the new ideas coming out of the Blairite thinktank Progress.</p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/campaigns/the-purple-papers/\" title=\"\">Purple Papers</a> argues that pro-jobs policies need to radiate out in every direction, from cutting NI contributions to replacing money spent on family benefits with better childcare and biasing the welfare system towards those who have worked, rather than those who never have or will. There are proposals which will make some traditional Labour supporters very angry, including freezing child benefit and tax credits and ending universal welfare entitlements such as free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments for the elderly. But critics of Progress should remember that such cuts would be balanced by new wealth taxes to fund better childcare to get people into jobs, and, as reported in the Observer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/27/soaring-cost-childcare-parents-work\" title=\"\">the high cost of childcare today often makes it barely worth taking a full-time job</a> \u2013 a major barrier to getting people back to work.</p> <p>Yet the truth is that repositioning Labour on the role of the state, and producing tough proposals on welfare, don't quite reach the heart of the dilemma, which is how to remake our economy. At present, it's unbalanced, unfair, undemocratic and anaemic. Whether the economy grows in one quarter is hardly the point; the general economic failure is profound. That's where Labour needs to concentrate.</p> <p>The deepest thinking on this I've come across is <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/171/9818/stimulus-slump-superstition-and-recovery-thinking-and-acting-beyond-vulgar-keynesianism\" title=\"\">published by the IPPR this week</a>, and comes from the most interesting of the newly rising economies, Brazil. A law lecturer and a former economic minister, Tamara Lothian, and Roberto Unger, argue passionately that both market orthodoxy and \"vulgar Keynesianism\" have failed, and that the left desperately needs a new model.</p> <p>I won't try to summarise what is a sophisticated argument \u2013 read it, please \u2013 but Lothian and Unger conclude that healthy economies will have to focus on small- and medium-sized businesses which are \"pluralistic, participative and experimental\". That means neither hands-off government on the US model, nor imposed bureaucratic government on the Asian model, but nimble, active intervention to ensure access to credit, technology and training.</p> <p>What makes this politically intriguing is Lothian and Unger's emphasis not on regulating business but on democratising it. The biggest failings of recent times have been those of the corporate giants, which are utterly undemocratic and irresponsible. In politics we take democracy for granted but when it comes to the world of work, somehow it has become a rude word.</p> <p>The founders of socialism dreamed of an economy in which workers had a sense of ownership and creative involvement. We may be a long way away from the world of Robert Owen or the Chartists, but we are also moving towards an economy less dominated by corporate giants. There is now widespread agreement that an economy of niche companies, constantly innovating, is the way forward for smaller western countries. And it's in smaller companies of skilled people working together \u2013 architectural practices, computer start-ups, specialist retailers, high-end engineers \u2013 that you tend to find the greatest effective workplace democracy.</p> <p>It is in this vision of a diverse, democratic economy that Labour will find its best answer to passing economic statistics and the route back not just to power, but to being useful in power.</p> <p><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/JackieAshley\" title=\"\"><em>Twitter: @jackieashley</em></a></p>",

  "<p>It's not a lot of laughs being Harry Hole \u2013 \"The Norwegian pronunciation is Hoola, but it's fine if you call him Hole\" \u2013 the maverick cop at the centre of nine of J<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/mar/11/jo-nesbo-harry-hole-interview\" title=\"\">o Nesb\u00f8</a>'s bestselling <a href=\"http://thefocusproject.co.uk/2012/04/29/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-scanda-noir/\" title=\"\">Scanda-noir</a> crime thrillers. Over the past 15 years he has been shot, stabbed and beaten up countless times and has the scars to prove it, a titanium finger and a slash from mouth to ear among them. He is an alcoholic who keeps falling off the wagon. His two best friends in the police \u2013 pretty much his only friends \u2013 have both been killed and he can't get married to Rakel, his long-suffering girlfriend, because she would almost certainly be topped as well. And at the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/25/digested-read-phantom-jo-nesbo\" title=\"\">The Phantom</a>, his most recent outing, he was left for dead in a sewer with two bullet wounds and rats gnawing at his body.</p> <p>So are there any laughs in being Harry Hole's creator? In person, Nesb\u00f8 is relaxed, chatty and smiles a great deal and yet ... Pursuing similarities between authors and their characters can be a bit of a dead end and I wouldn't normally bother, only Nesb\u00f8 frequently draws attention to them. \"When I wrote my first book [<a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846551451\" title=\"\">The Bat</a>, which has just been published in English], I thought I was starting with a blank slate. I remember thinking about whether to make Harry one of those heroes who was a bit different in some way \u2013 gay, priest, disabled or whatever \u2013 or to run with the stereotype of the hardboiled, troubled maverick. And I deliberately chose the latter.</p> <p>\"But by the time I was on to my third Harry Hole book, I realised there were significant areas of autobiography in his character. It wasn't deliberate; it just happened without me being aware of it. And it still does. I write something that I believe I've made up, and it's only when a friend later points it out to me that I realise I've been writing about myself again.\"</p> <p>Having spent so much time together, you would reckon that Harry and Nesb\u00f8 must have grown closer over the years. If so, what does that say about Nesb\u00f8, now that Harry's life has become more wretched? Is torturing his alter-ego part of what keeps him sane?</p> <p>Not all the overlaps are unintentional. Nesb\u00f8 has been a fan of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur</a> football club since he was 10. \"I had been thinking about supporting Arsenal because I quite liked the shirts,\" he says. \"But then my 15-year-old brother told me firmly that I wasn't and that I had two days to learn the entire Tottenham squad. He wasn't someone that you disobeyed.\" Harry, too, is a Spurs supporter and in The Phantom, Nesb\u00f8 provocatively \u2013 or playfully, depending on your allegiances \u2013 dressed the drug dealers in Arsenal replica shirts. \"I've got a number of friends who support Arsenal,\" he says, \"and they gave me a lot of grief about that. They said: 'Only a coward uses his power as a writer to do something like that.'\" And how did he respond? \"I told them to sod off.\"</p> <p>It's in the psyche where the boundaries get rather more fuzzy. The two are much the same age \u2013 Nesb\u00f8 is 52, Harry 49 \u2013 and Nesb\u00f8 has no hesitation in describing himself as a loner like Harry. \"There are those who surround themselves with other people when they have problems,\" he says. \"I much prefer to isolate myself.\" If Nesb\u00f8 has a partner, he is not prepared to say so. The only close relationship he will admit to is with his 13-year-old daughter.</p> <p>Regardless of how much his private life may leak into his writing, he gives the impression of a man who has found a way of living entirely on his own terms. It is not that he sets out to keep people at bay; it is just that his default position is to withdraw.</p> <p>Nesb\u00f8's dream was to be a professional footballer and he nearly achieved it, playing several times for the Norwegian premier league side Molde before injury ended his career while still a teenager. At which point he got a place at the Norwegian School of Economics and, after graduating, a job as a stockbroker, specialising in options and futures. \"I was a good analyst but a terrible salesman,\" he says. \"We were meant to take clients out and schmooze them, but I couldn't bring myself to do any of that and never spent any of my expenses budget. I just spoke to people on the phone from time to time.</p> <p>\"People would ask me how I thought the market was going to perform and I'd say: 'If you want to know that, then ask my dog. But if you want to know why a particular share may be underpriced then I'll give you my reasons.' The only reason I survived in the job was that I had just enough clients who appreciated my heavy touch.\"</p> <p>Stockbroking was only the day job. By night, Nesb\u00f8 was the singer-songwriter in a rock band with his younger brother, a career that would almost certainly have suited his personality better, had he been able to make a decent living from it. \"When we started the band we really weren't that good and we would change our name every week so that audiences wouldn't realise it was us playing again,\" he says. \"So the band never really had a name. Eventually we got a bit better and fans would ask when <em>di derre</em> [Norwegian for 'those guys'] were coming back. So we called ourselves Di Derre.\"</p> <p>The band still has a loyal following, despite not having written any new songs for more than 12 years, but the crunch came in the mid-90s. Nesb\u00f8 was the only one with a proper day job and the pressure of gigging in the evenings became too much. \"I told the band I wasn't going to write any more songs or tour and quit my job to go to Australia for six months and see if I could write a book,\" he says. He came back with The Bat, which won the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Key_award\" title=\"\">Glass Key award</a> for Nordic crime fiction.</p> <p>Nesb\u00f8 didn't expect instant success, but he laid the groundwork for it. \"All my friends who wanted to write had got nowhere trying to write the great European novel,\" he says. \"So I deliberately steered clear of that and set out to write something story-led. It wasn't so much a commercial decision as a literary one. Thanks to the success of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/henning-mankell\" title=\"\">Henning Mankell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/nov/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview11\" title=\"\">Peter H\u00f8eg</a>, there wasn't the same stigma attached to writing genre thrillers in Scandinavia as there was in many other cultures. Quite the opposite, in fact. Many Scandinavian writers who had made their name in literary fiction felt they wanted to have a go at the crime novel to show they could compete with the best. If Salman Rushdie had been Norwegian, he would definitely have written at least one thriller.\"</p> <p>Having become a success pretty much overnight, Nesb\u00f8 settled easily into life as an author. Each new book follows much the same process: first he writes a five-page synopsis, then a 20 page one, followed by an extended 80-100-page sketch that includes key fragments of dialogue to make sure he has captured his characters' speech patterns. Next he writes a full first draft, then a second. Only then does he allow a few people he trusts to read it and suggest minor revisions. After that, the book is done and forgotten. The only one he has re-read is The Bat. \"It's because it was my first,\" he says. \"It feels quite raw and out of control in places, and I like that.\"</p> <p>This is a rare sign of sentiment in what seems an otherwise life and work. Things happen and you move on. Like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Anders Breivik </a>massacre. \"It was the day Norway lost its innocence,\" he says. \"The day we became like other countries who had experienced similar tragedies and it will haunt us all for years to come. But it has to be understood for what it was. It was a one-off natural disaster perpetrated by an individual that couldn't have been predicted; it was not an important political event rooted in the foundations of our society.\"</p> <p>The most immediate concern for Nesb\u00f8's fans is whether Harry Hole can move on from the bottom of his sewer. For a moment, Nesb\u00f8 tries to deadpan, then relents. \"It's safe to say I do have more plans for Harry,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Care to share them? Surely things can't get much worse for him?\"</p> <p>\"There's a logic to Harry's universe. In the near future things look bleak for him. Then they will get worse. And finally he will go straight to hell.\"</p> <p>Doesn't Nesb\u00f8 feel a bit sorry for him?</p> <p>\"I like him a lot. I've got a few happy moments planned for him.\"</p> <p>How many? The odd page or two?</p> <p>\"Hmmm. But that's life, isn't it? There are no happy endings.\"</p> <p>I guess Harry would settle for that. His fans certainly will.</p>",
  "<p>The short stories in my book, <a href=\"http://adammarek.co.uk/blog/?page_id=726\" title=\"\">The Stone Thrower</a>, are full of absurd, surreal and futuristic scenarios: contagion-carrying virtual pets, genetically enhanced schoolchildren in military uniforms, a superhero dictator \u2013 but at the heart of them all is a vulnerable child. My vulnerable child.</p> <p>All the way through my wife Naomi's pregnancy, we imagined what our little boy would be like. Naomi is a painter and I'm a writer, so of course we hoped that he would be an artist too. We never imagined the possibility that he might be born anything other than perfect.</p> <p>Usually, a cleft lip is picked up in one of the ultrasound scans, but Max's wasn't. The first we knew of it was after his birth. His face was opened up like a flower, with the upper lip split into three parts and the divisions running all the way up into his nose.</p> <p>Those first moments of his life were chaotic. The cord had been wrapped around his neck, and the trauma of his long delivery meant he was covered in <a href=\"http://pregnancy.about.com/od/laborcomplications/a/meconium.htm\" title=\"\">meconium</a>. The room was crowded with hospital staff who whisked him away from us to clear out his mouth and give him oxygen. Whatever armour I'd built up during my 26 years to help me cope with adversity was gone. In Max, the most tender inner part of myself was now outside of my body.</p> <p>Eventually they brought him back to us wrapped in a towel. We had a baby that people would find it difficult to look at. But of course he was ours and we loved him and we wanted him more than anything else. I had so many worries though. Would the doctors be able to fix him? How would people, other kids, react to him? How would he feel about himself? Would a girl ever want to kiss those lips?</p> <p>A brilliant surgeon at Stoke Mandeville repaired Max's lip when he was just 10 days old, giving him the ability to smile \u2013 and what a smile. Over the next few years, the scars began to heal, and although once in a while someone noticed and remarked, often we could go whole days without thinking about it. Max began school and life was good.</p> <p>But as Max got older, he began to fall behind at school. He'd pull strange faces, and swing his arm around like a propeller wherever he went. He didn't like his peas touching his ketchup.</p> <p>Max was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/working-with/health/information-for-general-practitioners/recognising-autism-spectrum-disorder.aspx\" title=\"\">autistic spectrum disorder </a>in 2007, and we began the long, arduous process of getting a statement of special educational needs. The life we'd imagined for our son moved out of reach.</p> <p>Now we had a new set of worries. Would he be able to work? Would he get married, have children? Would he ever be able to look after himself or would Naomi and I always need to take&#xa0;care of him? Slowly, we began to come to terms with this new reality. Naomi and I talked about our fears sometimes, but mostly I worried on the page. My concerns became metaphors in stories: seabird chicks choking on fish, a child coming apart at&#xa0;the seams.</p> <p>When Max was seven, he had a massive seizure and everything changed again.</p> <p>The average <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Epilepsy/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\" title=\"\">tonic-clonic seizure</a> (one where the person goes stiff and starts twitching) lasts one to three minutes. There is a rarer form of seizures called status epilepticus, which are 30 minutes or longer. Max's lasted more than an hour. It was the first of many.</p> <p>When Max had an MRI scan it revealed scar tissue in his brain \u2013 most likely caused by his traumatic birth \u2013 which was the origin of the seizures.</p> <p>We were referred to Great Ormond Street hospital, and later the Young Epilepsy centre in Surrey. They began to tweak Max's medications, raising and lowering levels, taking medications away and adding new ones, attempting to find the perfect cocktail to get his seizures under control.</p> <p>Now, he takes five medications, which are mostly successful at keeping his seizures at bay. But at 11, and given the severity of the seizures, it's unlikely now that he'll ever grow out of it, as some children do.</p> <p>It's hard to know how Max feels about all of this. His conditions mean he won't or can't talk about a lot of things. Trying to get out of him what he did at school during the day is often impossible. It's hard to say whether the cause is the seizure activity, which affects his short-term memory, or the ASD. But from the outside, he's the warmest, happiest, most charming kid.</p> <p>Of course, Naomi and I live in constant terror of losing him. It means we are so grateful for every day he wakes up in the morning, and for our other son, who is not affected by the same conditions.</p> <p>I guess that whenever you love anyone or anything in your life, that love comes pre-packaged with a fear of losing him or her or it. I hope that among the fantastical imagery of The Stone Thrower everyone will recognise&#xa0;something of his or her self. We all fear being left alone. We are not alone in that fear.</p>",
  "<p>Graham Wake is hardly looking at me but one glance is enough. \"I could pay about \u00a375 to \u00a3100 if you had a pixie cut,\" he says briskly. \"If you went for a short bob I'd give you \u00a340.\" It's not often you get paid for a haircut, but Wake's business, <a href=\"http://www.bloomsburywigs.com/\" title=\"\">Bloomsbury Wigs</a>, now relies solely on hair <a href=\"http://www.hairharvest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">sourced</a> from the heads of women in the UK. Each week 30-40 envelopes stuffed with ponytails arrive at his office. Every day, one or two women visit to have their hair valued, cut off, and restyled. Some are bored with long hair, others need the money, and a few are raising money for charity.</p> <p>Wake says he prefers paying a fair price to women in the UK to buying hair from agents, and that 90% of the coils piled into the transparent plastic boxes that surround him are used to create wigs for people who have lost their hair. The rest are for hair extensions, which is what my locks could become. \"If your hair was any curlier, we couldn't take it,\" he says. \"It would just matt after a while, but as it is I could use it.\"</p> <p>It feels faintly embarrassing to be discussing the monetary value of something as personal as my hair.&#xa0;But perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised at myself; women's hair has always been a contentious issue. From orthodox Jews, Muslims, and nuns covering it for modesty, to a badge of femininity and beauty in fairytales such as Rapunzel, hair has always exerted a powerful metaphorical pull. Even in today's more secular world it acts as a lightning rod for our attitudes to women: something US gymnast Gabby Douglas discovered when her gold medal win at the Olympics was overshadowed by a <a href=\"http://thegrio.com/2012/08/02/gabby-douglas-hair-gets-more-attention-than-gold-medal/#48476247\" title=\"\">row</a> over whether her messy ponytail reflected badly on the black community. Miley Cyrus's decision to cut her hair short in the summer was taken as a sign that another teen pop star's life was <a href=\"http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/08/miley-cyrus-haircut-britney-spears-downward-spiral-psychologist\" title=\"\">spiralling out of control</a>, much like Britney Spears in 2007<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Today, hair is more than just a symbol: it is big business. From India to Peru, the human hair trade has spread across the globe, and it has the UK in its grasp. Last year HM Revenue and Customs recorded more than \u00a338m worth of hair (human, with some mixed human and animal) entering the country, making the UK the third <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-human-hair-trade-idUSTRE7723U520110803\" title=\"\">biggest importer of human hair in the world</a>.</p> <p>Despite the recession the UK extension industry is booming, with hair extension companies claiming it is worth between \u00a345m and \u00a360m (according to London based industry research firm IBISWorld, revenue from hair and beauty salons will be \u00a33.64bn in 2012-13). <a href=\"http://www.greatlengths.net/index.php\" title=\"\">Great Lengths Hair Extensions</a>, who supply more than 1,000 salons in the UK, report a staggering 70% growth in the past five years. And according to Dawn Riley from <a href=\"http://www.balmainhair.com/uk/hair-extensions/home.html\" title=\"\">Balmain Hair</a>, which sells extensions to thousands of salons and hundreds of wholesalers, this is only the beginning. \"It's still an emerging market.

And while profits from cuts, colouring and blow drys have remained static, in 2012 the salon's hair extension business has grown 60% year on year. Owner Inanch Emir has well-known clients including Cher Lloyd, Mischa Barton and Saturdays singer Rochelle Wiseman, and when I visit one weekday afternoon her small salon is buzzing. \"I do about two or three hair extensions a day,\" she says. \"I used to do that a month.\"</p> <p>A stylist is finishing off a head of dramatic, tumbling curls for Bianca Gascoigne, a glamour model and reality TV contestant. With her thick, false lashes emphasising her wide-set eyes, the cascade of hair makes her look like a Disney drawing. Laughing, she agrees she likes to look like \"a princess\": \"Hair extensions make you feel glamorous,\" she says, explaining she first started wearing clip-in fake hair as a teenager, keen to copy celebrities such as Christina Aguilera. Now, she says, everyone she knows has them.</p> <p>I watch as a woman in her 40s with long, streaked, blond hair has some extensions that have fallen out refitted. Thin strands of hair topped by a \"polymer\" \u2013 a covered metal ring \u2013 are wrapped around tiny clumps of her hair in neat rows, a centimetre or so from her scalp. It's fiddly work, and it's fascinating to watch the stylist gently heat the bond so it stays put. Doesn't it weigh her hair down? No, she insists, \"you can't feel them, you don't even know it's there.\" And anyway, she says, \"You fall in love with it. You look great without even trying.\"</p> <p>Emir says the UK's passion for extensions began with Victoria Beckham. \"For a long time it was only celebrities who knew about hair extensions, but when Posh went from short to long, everyone realised \u2013 and that was it.\"</p> <p>Among hairdressers specialising in Afro-Caribbean hair, however, extensions have been popular for three decades or more, according to independent hairdresser <a href=\"http://parlourmagazine.com/2011/09/charlene-white-hair-amanda-biddulph/\" title=\"\">Amanda Biddulph</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/video/2010/jul/19/black-hair-beauty\" title=\"\">Black British women may not visit salons</a> as regularly as their US counterparts, whose styling habits were investigated in Chris Rock's 2009 documentary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/jun/24/good-hair-review\" title=\"\">Good Hair,</a> but in the last decade, demand for extra hair has really taken off. Once, extensions were the preserve of women in their late 20s to mid-30s, says Biddulph, but now she regularly sees 14-year-olds with 18-inch extensions, and has refused to put extensions into the hair of girls as young as 12. \"At the moment it's Kim Kardashian for the Afro community,\" she tells me. \"They are wearing middle partings and their hair really long.\"</p> <p>Not even the fact that incorrect removal and overuse of extensions and weaves are linked to traction alopecia \u2013 a form of hair loss Naomi Campbell is suspected of having after pictures emerged showing <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2185897/Naomi-Campbells-shocking-bald-patches-years-relying-hair-extensions.html\" title=\"\">bald patches in her hair</a> \u2013 puts people off.</p> <p>Gascoigne says she thinks the reality stars from TV show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/the-only-way-is-essex\" title=\"\">The Only Way is Essex</a>, have also had a huge impact. \"I think it's the girls from The Only Way is Essex that are driving it, because everyone wants that glamorous lifestyle.\"</p> <p>Some women in the public eye may prefer to keep the \"help\" they get with their hair secret (Gascoigne says, perhaps naively, that people can't tell if she wears them). And after a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/nov/24/cheryl-cole-hair-advertisement\" title=\"\">L'Oreal advert starring Cheryl Cole drew complaints</a> because she was wearing extensions, Emir says some of her famous clients have made her sign confidentiality agreements. Several of the experts I speak to tell me emphatically that they believe the Duchess of Cambridge has had extensions \u2013 but even if she had, it's unlikely she would discuss it. Reality show participants, however, have no such qualms, says Riley. \"It takes away the embarrassment for younger women. They wear it as a badge of pride \u2013 I can afford extensions, so I have extensions.\"</p> <p>In Liverpool, at hair suppliers <a href=\"http://www.rapunzelshaircity.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rapunzel City of Hair</a>, teenagers in school uniform are a common sight, says owner Emma Canty. They buy clip-in synthetic hair extensions, which can sell for as little as \u00a310 a packet. Fake hair accessories such as plaited hair bands, meanwhile, are also sold in highstreet shops such as Topshop. Theresa Yee, beauty editor at trend forecasting company <a href=\"http://www.wgsn.com/\" title=\"\">WGSN</a>, says these quick fixes are \"driving the popularity of this trend into a wider market\" allowing customers to \"try out multiple 'temporary' looks which they can achieve at home\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398553728\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351265188413/model-with-hair-extension-008.jpg\" alt=\"model with hair extensions\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big hair \u2026 a model makes the most of her Balmain hair extensions.

So for more permanent extensions salons rely on human hair. With it comes an array of jargon. There is Remi hair (all strands face the same way and often come from just one person's head); virgin hair (unprocessed); double drawn (all the same length). The hair can be attached with a weave \u2013 when strips of extra hair, called a weft, are sewn into thin plaits of the customer's own hair \u2013 or attached to the customer's own hair using micro rings, or even glue. But while such terms may trip off the tongue of dedicated customers, few seem interested in the human beings it came from. \"If I'm honest, I don't think people care where it is from,\" admits Riley. \"I would like to say we are all ethically minded, but if clients want something and they can pay for it, they will have it.\" Gascoigne agrees: \"I never ask where the hair comes from, I just love it so much. When you have big, bouncy hair you feel a million dollars.\"</p> <p>Yet behind the bounce, the profit, and the rows of neatly packaged hair, is what hair historian <a href=\"http://heritagemodern.com/whoweare/\" title=\"\">Caroline Cox</a> calls the \"dark side\" of the industry. With the exception of a handful of businesses such as Bloomsbury Wigs, most hair comes from countries where long, natural hair remains a badge of beauty - but where the women are poor enough to consider selling a treasured asset.</p> <p>Cox points out that such exploitation has underpinned the industry since false fronts and hair pieces became popular in the UK in Edwardian times. \"It's taking advantage of those who are disadvantaged,\" she says. \"Working-class women's hair is used to bedeck the head of those who are more privileged. It's been going on for hundreds of years.\"</p> <p>Much of the hair on sale comes from small agents who tour villages in India, China, and eastern Europe, offering poverty-stricken women small payments to part with their hair. As one importer, based in Ukraine, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/global/22blond.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">told</a> the New York Times recently: \"They are not doing it for fun. Usually only people who have temporary financial difficulties in depressed regions sell their hair.\" More worryingly, back in 2006, the Observer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/25/india.theobserver\" title=\"\">reported</a> that in India some husbands were forcing their wives into selling their hair, slum children were being tricked into having their heads shaved in exchange for toys, and in one case a gang stole a woman's hair, holding her down and cutting it off. When Victoria Beckham said in 2003 that her \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2003/dec/23/features11.g2\" title=\"\">extensions come from Russian prisoners, so I've got Russian cell block H on my head</a>\", she may have been joking, but it was not long until the Moscow Centre for Prison Reform <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/13/gender.uk\" title=\"\">admitted</a> it was possible: warders were forcibly shaving and selling the hair of prisoners. Thanks to such horror stories, reputable companies try to ensure the hair they sell is \"ethical\". Balmain Hair, Riley explains, has been sourcing hair from China for almost 50 years, and pays women the equivalent of a man's six-month salary (although she cannot give me an exact figure). However, not all companies pay donors.<strong> </strong>In temples in south India devotees travel for hundreds of miles and queue for hours to have their hair tonsured, or ritually shaved. Some have prayed for a child, others for a sick relative or a good harvest, and when their prayers are answered they offer up their hair. According to one <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2153691/From-Hindu-temple-Hollywood-hairdo-How-thousands-Indian-women-having-heads-shaved-gods-hair-end-3-000-extensions.html\" title=\"\">report</a>, most are rural women whose hair has often never been dyed, blow-dried, or even cut and is worth around \u00a3200. The hair is then sorted and sold, often by online auction. Last year Tirumala temple, apparently <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tirumala-temple-earns-huge-money-from-auctioning-human-hair/1/199003.html\" title=\"\">made</a> 2,000m rupees (more than \u00a322m), from auctioning hair. Great Lengths, who sell \"temple hair\", point out the hair is donated willingly, and they have a representative based in India who buys it straight from the temple, and ensures the money is funnelled directly back into the local community to fund \"medical aid, educational systems and other crucial infrastructure projects\".</p> <p>But while the women who grew the hair may not be well paid, the price for the customers is rising. Biddulph says the cost of buying hair \"has gone through the roof\" \u2013 packets that used to cost \u00a310.99 to \u00a320.99 are now priced at \u00a350 or \u00a360. Yet, says Biddulph, even in a recession about half of her clients' extra hair is something they \"can't be without \u2013 they factor it in to their monthly expenses.\" Other stylists I speak to agree and link it to the higher grooming standards and emphasis on physical perfection that have recently crept in. Kim Hunjan, who runs <a href=\"http://bellehairextensions.com/\" title=\"\">Belle Hair Extensions</a> in North London, says: \"A lot of clients talk about botox and plastic surgery, and they see this as&#xa0;similar.\"</p> <p>In a recent report on the hair industry, <a href=\"http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/home.aspx\" title=\"\">IBISWorld</a> noted trips to salons are seen as essential, rather than an optional extra: \"Many salon customers have come to view their spending on hair colouring and styling services as non-discretionary expenditure causing demand for the industry to remain more resilient than in&#xa0;previous years.\"</p> <p>In fact, asking how women can afford the cost might be missing the point. According to Cox extensions, like long fake nails, are status symbols. \"If you have long nails, there is a suggestion you have a lot of leisure time. If hair costs a lot to do, and to keep up, there is the same suggestion. It's almost as though you are living the life of a The Only Way is Essex girl or glamour model.\"</p> <p>The fact that it does not necessarily look like your own hair also reflects the influence of the sex industry on our ideas of what a woman should look like, says Cox. \"The fashion for such a long time has been about the glorification of artificiality. Fake tans, fake teeth, fake boobs and fake nails \u2013 and you need fake hair to go with all that. The whole idea of beauty is [now] predicated on artificiality and getting rid of humanness \u2013 waxing every hair from your body but putting fake hair on your head.\"</p> <p>Recently there has been a move towards a more demure aesthetic, she says, but one that continues to emphasise wealth. \"In the recent series of The Only Way is Essex, almost half of it was set in hairdressing salons, and they were all having their hair styled in up-dos.\" This exposes roots and allows extensions to be clearly seen. \"It's a way of showing them off,\" says Cox. \"Today we want to show off that our extensions cost \u00a3800.\"</p> <p>Extensions also reflect a retrogressive attitude towards women's place in society, she says. \"When women try and change their role their hair becomes short and chic like in the 60s and 20s, but when gender roles become more traditional, fake hair comes in.\"</p> <p>However, economic woes, and the recent rise in grassroots feminism could spell the end of extensions. \"It's beginning to look old fashioned, especially as the recession continues,\" Cox explains. \"I think we are at the height of it; in the fashion cycle we are moving towards a more natural look.\" Biddulph has already noticed a rise in salons catering exclusively to women who don't relax, straighten or extend their Afro hair. \"More people are making a statement with natural hair and more salons are opening up. It's about a 70\u201330, but I think it will be 50\u201350 soon.\"</p> <p>Yet a natural look does not necessarily mean the end of extensions in the mainstream. Instead they are becoming more discreet \u2013 used to add volume rather than length. This trend reflects the fact that older women are turning to extensions: \"Young people often have coloured extensions, middle-aged women do it for the 'wow' effect, while older women often want thicker hair,\" says Emir. Riley agrees: \"Women's hair starts thinning at 35 but they want the beautiful hair they had at 20, and they do it by hair addition.\"</p> <p>Whatever sparked our love affair with extensions, it has deepened into something more permanent. On a rainy Thursday I watch as one of Kim's stylists works on bride-to-be Jessica Munday, who is having her hair lengthened in time for her wedding. It's a time-consuming, repetitive and expensive process but Jessica doesn't care. \"People want longer hair instantly. If I like it I'll&#xa0;definitely have it done again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Heseltine, the former Tory deputy prime minister who has been commissioned by George Osborne to undertake a review of economic growth, is expected to back some form of control on overseas takeovers of UK companies.</p> <p>The plan to restrict foreign takeovers will form part of Heseltine's report, which is due to be published on Wednesday and which will also propose abolishing two-tier councils in favour of more unitary bodies to boost growth. That move is expected to be opposed by Eric Pickles, the communities secretary.</p> <p>Currently ministers only intervene in foreign takeovers in cases that may affect national security or when media companies are involved. Heseltine's proposals are believed to involve widening this remit further.</p> <p>Mergers are formally assessed if the company being taken over has an annual turnover of \u00a370m or more, or if the new entity would control 25% or more of its market. If not an issue of national security, the assessment is largely seen through the interests of the consumer as opposed to the wider strategic needs of British industry.</p> <p>Heseltine, who may see his takeovers plan hampered by EU laws, resigned as defence secretary from Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986 over the Westland affair when he opposed the prime minister's effort to integrate the ailing British helicopter firm with US firm Sikorsky. Heseltine wanted Westland to form part of a European conglomerate that would have included British Aerospace, the Italian firm Agusta and French companies.</p> <p>There has been an on-off debate over the benefits of reintroducing a broader public interest test in the assessment of mergers, first in the wake of concerns about the takeover of British companies by foreign multinationals and, in particular, the takeover of Cadburys by Kraft Foods in 2010.</p> <p>Lord Mandelson, then industry secretary, said there was a case for a change in the law possibly by giving long-term shareholders preferential voting rights.</p> <p>In March the coalition government announced an important reform of the competition regime, with the merger of the Office for Fair Trading and the Competition Commission to form a new single Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). It is anticipated that the CMA will be established from April 2014.</p> <p>The government has not yet proposed any changes to the competition test even though the business secretary Vince Cable in opposition did favour a wider public interest test.</p> <p>Other proposals included in Heseltine's report will include call for a shift of civil servants out of Whitehall into the areas he regards as the engines of UK growth.</p> <p>He is also expected to call for a bigger role for local chambers of commerce and greater power for the 39 local enterprise partnerships, the successor bodies to regional development agencies. The partnerships are made up of business leaders and local authorities.</p> <p>Labour is likely to contrast Heseltine's activist approach with the more laissez-faire stance of many Tory MPs that back free enterprise.</p> <p>Heseltine was asked by George Osborne to review policies for growth last March at a time when it was expected that many cities would vote in favour of electing their own mayors. After the concept was rejected at referendums in leading cities except Bristol, Heseltine has been looking at ways of encouraging greater co-operation between councils within a region.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2014. An earlier version referred to the helicopter manufacturer as Augusta rather than Agusta.</p>",
  "<p>A magazine editor in Greece will appear in court after publishing the names of more than 2,000 wealthy Greeks alleged to have Swiss bank accounts, triggering a row over tax evasion that threatens the stability of the government.</p> <p>Kostas Vaxevanis was arrested on Sunday, after his weekly journal, Hot Doc, printed the list of names, which including prominent members of Greece's political and business elite.</p> <p>The editor was giving a live radio interview when police arrived, and broke off saying he had to go \"to be arrested\". At the same he tweeted about the arrest, comparing the police to German stormtroopers in the second world war. In another tweet he wrote: \"They're entering my house with the prosecutor right now. They are arresting me. Spread the word.\"</p> <p>Police officials said that Vaxevanis had illegally published personal details without proof that the people involved had broken the law. But he and other critics of the government have portrayed his arrest as part of a cover-up intended to obscure claims that the finance ministry had had the list for more than two years without taking action against those named.</p> <p>\"If anyone is accountable before the law then it is those ministers who hid the list, lost it and said it didn't exist. I only did my job. I am a journalist and I did my job,\" Vaxevanis said in the video sent to Reuters news agency.</p> <p>The case has triggered a parliamentary inquiry and could provide the basis for prosecutions at a time of rising radicalism on both left and right and a sense of injustice over the widespread destitution and despair created by Greece's economic crisis set against the relative impunity of the country's rich, who have a long history of tax evasion.</p> <p>George Papaconstantinou, a former finance minister, said the Greek tax authorities had failed to act on the list because they were afraid of confronting the country's elite tax evaders. He also claimed that the affair brought to light only a small part of a massive tax evasion problem that was part of what he described as a \"broken and corrupt system\".</p> <p>The scandal has its origins in a raid in January 2009 on the French home of a former computer technician for HSBC bank's Geneva branch, Herve Falciani, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/11/hsbc-inquiry-stolen-swiss-accounts\" title=\"\">accused by the Swiss of selling stolen data on the bank's clients</a>. The French police found computer files on 130,000 potential tax evaders and, to the fury of the Swiss authorities, held on to them and began investigating them.</p> <p>In mid-2010, the French intelligence service, the DGSE, informed Athens that many of those named in the Falciani dossier were Greek.</p> <p>Papaconstantinou, then finance minister, asked his French counterpart at the time, Christine Lagarde, to pass it on. It arrived through diplomatic channels in the form of an unlabelled CD containing spreadsheets for the roughly 2,000 accounts now known in Greece as the \"Lagarde list\". What happened to it next is at the heart of the current political storm in Athens.</p> <p>\"I handed the head of the tax police the 20 people with the biggest balances, and who accounted for about half of the total amount on the files we got from the French authorities, and asked him to see what we could learn by looking at their profiles,\" Papaconstantinou told the Guardian. \"He came back and told me that their profiles did not justify these kind of bank accounts in Switzerland. On the basis of this information, I asked him to go ahead and do a full investigation. I was not happy with the lack of follow-up.\"</p> <p>As Greece faced economic meltdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/17/greece-finance-minister-evangelos-venizelos\" title=\"\">Papaconstantinou enacted a series of measures aimed at cracking down on tax evasion</a>, but was forced out as his austerity programme became politically toxic. \"Before I left the ministry in mid-2011, I handed all the files to the new head of the tax police and asked him to proceed with a full investigation,\" he said.</p> <p>Papaconstantinou told a parliamentary inquiry last week that the French CD stayed at the ministry when he left and he did not know what had happened to it since. He has been lambasted in some parts of the Greek press for having lost it.</p> <p>\"I am being accused of having lost the original. I did not; I gave all the information to the tax police with instructions to investigate, so it is there on the record in electronic form,\" the former minister said. \"The CD of course I left at the office when I left finance. I don't know where it is now, but even that is not the original. It is a copy of a CD which the French authorities have.\"</p> <p>Papaconstantinou also rejected the argument presented to parliament by a former tax chief that the data could not have been used for an investigation as it had been illegally obtained, saying: \"This information is equivalent to getting an anonymous tip. It is not permissible in court but the tax police are obliged by law to follow it up and use it in their investigations. And they did not.\"</p> <p>Papaconstantinou argued that the tax authorities deliberately chose not to pursue information on the list. \"My interpretation is they probably got scared. They looked at the names on the list and saw it was full of important people from business and publishing and decided not to go ahead without clear political instructions and cover,\" he said, adding that the Lagarde list was only the tip of a Greek tax evasion iceberg.</p> <p>\"It is not insignificant [about \u20ac1.5bn in total] but the truth is that compared with other lists it's not the treasure trove everyone is looking for,\" Papaconstantinou said. \"There is a list from the Bank of Greece of 54,000 people who took \u20ac22bn out of the country. That is official and can be used in court. The first check found 6 billion that can't be justified and letters are going to 15,000 people on that list who will be taxed at the 45% rate.\"</p> <p>The former finance minister said measures he took to tighten tax collection still face resistance and delay in the bureaucracy and judiciary, adding: \"What we have is a corrupt and broken system.\"</p> <p>Petros Markaris, an author and social commentator, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/13/petros-markaris-greek-rage-fiction\" title=\"\">who recently published a bestselling detective novel about a serial killer targeting tax evaders</a>, said: \"This really is a mess, and it has become a mess because the politicians have handled it so badly. This was not incompetence but because they did not want to make public what could harm them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two threads run through the current government's rhetoric, just as they defined a lot of what we heard in the Blair and Brown years.</p> <p>People \u2013 and particularly parents \u2013 must be empowered, and the supposedly slow hand of the state has to be quickened and made more responsive, or done away with altogether. Now as then, the watchwords are choice, competition, localism, empowerment.</p> <p>Strange, then, that so much of what this government and the last have done has pointed in the opposite direction, towards centralisation and the emasculation of the citizen. Strange, too, that a particularly egregious example of all this has just been unveiled, and very few people seem to have noticed.</p> <p>The government's drastic proposed changes to England's <a href=\"http://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/overview\" title=\"\">special educational needs</a> (SEN) system will affect close to 1.7 million children. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jun/04/special-educational-needs-changes-time-campaigners\" title=\"\">plans</a> threaten to chop down parents' rights, hand power and initiative from families to local authorities and also strengthen the centralised fist of the Department for Education. Moreover, everything is behind schedule. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/24/special-needs-children\" title=\"\">Sarah Teather</a>, the Lib Dem minister who claimed the reforms were something of a personal crusade, was a casualty of September's reshuffle. Having been up and running for mere months, the department's hurried \"pathfinder\" schemes will not report until the reforms hits the Commons, as part of the Children and Families Bill. Omnishambles threatens to strike again.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/20/children-special-needs-reform-rush\" title=\"\">first wrote about this six months ago</a>, when the reforms were announced, drawing on my experience of the SEN system, and what it took to get roughly the right provision for my six-year-old son, who's <a href=\"http://www.autism.org.uk/about-autism/autism-and-asperger-syndrome-an-introduction/what-is-autism.aspx\" title=\"\">autistic</a>. As things stand, the most reliable arrangements are founded in statements of special educational needs, which currently apply to around 225,000 children, and usually deal with every aspect of their education \u2013 including NHS therapies. If you can stomach the cost and stress involved in getting one, statements represent a pretty solidmeans of holding your local authority to account. The usual route lies in a request made by parents, or a child's school: some authorities tend to oblige, and others only issue statements after the most grinding of fights.</p> <p>If a request is made by parents or a headteacher, a local authority has a legal duty to respond within six weeks. If it declines to commence the requisite assessment process, parents can appeal via the SEN tribunal system. The next step, if you're lucky, is what's called statutory assessment, which has a legal limit of 12 weeks, and then the finalising of the statement itself, which can take no longer than eight weeks. That's six months in all: a long time when all you can think about is the urgency of so-called early intervention, but at least the limit is there.</p> <p>But not for much longer, it seems. The government wants to replace statements with \"single plans\", spanning education, health and social care. On the plus side, these will extend from birth to 25, as long as a young person remains in education or training \u2013 but that step forward is compromised by the fact that they will be less exacting. Witness one of the most fundamental aspects of what's being proposed: the government's draft legislation \u2013 belatedly published in early September, and now being looked at by the education select committee \u2013 makes no mention of defined rights for parents or schools to request an assessment, nor a prescribed period for a request to be dealt with. To anyone who has been through the special needs process, what that suggests is grim: the black hole of official indifference, now given official licence.</p> <p>Under the current system, local authorities have a duty to specify the provision that will be made. The word specify is fantastically important: it means you can argue against fuzzy promises of \"regular\" this or \"frequent\" that, and push for guarantees of, say, speech therapy or physio for stated periods, at specific intervals (an hour once a week, for example). With echoes of a move that was defeated by parent campaigners back in 2001, the new plans contain only an obligation to \"set out\" what will be provided: \"wildly different\", as one campaigner puts it, and a change that will rub out decades of case law that have hardened parents' rights.</p> <p>In the switch from statements of educational needs to the new single plans, there is another glaring problem. Under the current system, all of a child's therapies and programmes \u2013 even if they're provided by the NHS \u2013 come under the umbrella heading of \"education\", and thereby fall under the remit of the special educational needs tribunal. If something fails to materialise or is taken away, you can at least take your case to an affordable(ish) forum of appeal. But no more: the government plans to separate everything out into three categories of education, health and social care \u2013 but keep only the first one under the tribunal's authority. What that means for parents like me is obvious enough: the knocking-away of accountability that currently underlies things such as occupational therapy, and help with our children's speech and language.</p> <p>All this seems comically antithetical to what habitually comes out of ministers' mouths: an officially sanctioned power-grab by often unreliable public institutions, at the expense of the few solid rights that parents currently possess. Although the cost of implementing the reforms looks huge, much of this is seemingly driven by the same logic as the cuts that are already impacting on the lives of children with disabilities and learning difficulties: in pushing public bodies further away from accountability, the government seems to be giving them freer rein to hack back provision even more. On occasion, in fact, the DfE has looked only too happy to create exactly that impression: do not forget that last spring, the plans arrived in a flurry of headlines about as many as 450,000 children being taken out of the category of special needs altogether, as if they had been put there thanks to a spasm of profligacy and trendy teaching.</p> <p>To cap it all, the draft legislation contains at least one burst of power politics at its most brazen. The existing SEN system's statutory code of practice \u2013 the details of how it's actually meant to work \u2013 can only be altered after any changes have gone through both houses of parliament. In the suggested new reality, the secretary of state will be able to change its provisions at will. Once again, it seems, talk of empowerment and accountability masks the usual centralism.</p> <p>Towards the end of last week, having thought about my own case and pored over the exhaustive analysis of the reforms by the special needs charity Independent Special Education Advice (IPSEA), I contacted the DfE with an itemised list of concerns, expecting at least cosmetic engagement with what thousands of people are increasingly worried about. But it didn't happen: a spokesperson said ministers \"want to hear people's views\" and would consider them, along with what the education select committee has to say, \"very carefully\". Their four-sentence statement ended thus: \"These reforms will put parents in charge, giving them better information and a comprehensive package of support that meets their needs.\"</p> <p>In fact, unless MPs can work miracles, the whole thing looks dangerous and ill-thought-out. That may sound painfully familiar, but we need to think about the fallout not in terms of political pantomime, but as it will affect children and parents who need government to get things right.</p>",
  "<p>Progress against cancer is stalling, with the latest targeted cancer drugs failing to live up to expectations and priced so high that treatment is becoming unaffordable even in rich countries, according to experts at a meeting of nearly 100 eminent cancer specialists from around the world.</p> <p>At the two-day meeting in Lugano, Switzerland, the doctors agreed a 10-point declaration, to be published early next year, which will chart the way forward for cancer care around the globe. Much needs to be done, they believe, to improve treatment, care and prevention both in the developed world and in poor countries, where cancer rates are rising even faster. They agreed to embark on an ambitious plan to get essential cancer care to those who are dying early in developing countries, in the same way that Aids doctors took on the fight to get HIV treatment into hard-hit Africa.</p> <p>The meeting of the World Oncology Forum, organised by the European School of Oncology and attended by experts such as epidemiologists Sir Richard Peto and Prof Michel Coleman as well as the government's national cancer director, Sir Mike Richards, agreed urgent action was needed on many fronts.</p> <p>Only a few years ago, many cancer experts thought the arrival of targeted medicines, designed to attack the genetic makeup of the tumour, would make dramatic inroads into cancer deaths. That has not happened. Instead, these therapies have only bought a few extra months of life. If the question was whether the world was winning the war on cancer, said Douglas Hanahan of the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, who outlined the latest state of drug research, \"in general, for most forms of human cancer, the answer is clearly no\".</p> <p>The excitement generated by targeted drugs, which interfere with specific molecules involved in tumour growth and suppression, has been short-lived.</p> <p>Doctors reported apparently miraculous results from the use of the BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib in advanced malignant melanoma, a usually fatal form of skin cancer. Within two weeks, the tumours had melted away.</p> <p>\"But six months later, [the cancer] is back with a vengeance,\" he said.</p> <p>Other drugs working in a similar way \u2013 including erlotinib (Tarceva) for a form of lung cancer, bevacizumab (Avastin) for breast, colorectal and other cancers, and sunitinib (Sutent) for renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal sarcoma \u2013 have also not done so well, said Hanahan. Resistance to the drugs builds up, sometimes very quickly. \"All came on line with great expectations. The reality check is they are all working in the important first step, but we have a long way to go in terms of winning the war.\"</p> <p>The future is probably using these drugs together or in combination with other, older types of drugs, but the price is likely to be prohibitive.</p> <p>A year's treatment with vemurafenib alone would cost \u00a391,000. Even though the manufacturer, Roche, has offered an undisclosed discount to the Department of Health, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence said in June it was too much for the NHS to pay. No health service will be able to afford to put a patient on two or three such drugs at the same time.</p> <p>Doctors at the meeting said pharmaceutical industry prices were unsustainable \u2013 and the pursuit of profits stopped companies taking part in trials of combinations of their drugs with those of their competitors, which might help patients. They were also said to be not interested in testing their drugs combined with older drugs that are out of patent.</p> <p>Prof Alexander Eggermont, general director of the Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute in France, said the \"economic models of molecular medicine are very uncertain, because if you don't produce cures, you don't know if it is going to sell\".</p> <p>Decades ago, genuine breakthrough drugs were discovered which continue to have a huge impact on the disease. Peto, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, pointed out that five years of tamoxifen reduces mortality in most breast cancers by a third and the benefits continue even after a woman stops taking it. It now appears that taking it for 10 years is even more effective. Nobody knows why resistance does not develop, as it does with the new drugs.</p> <p>But the meeting agreed that while changes are needed in research, regulation and funding to speed progress on new drugs for intractable cancers, a great deal could and must be done now to tackle cancer in less well-off countries where children and women, in particular, are dying of preventable and curable diseases.</p> <p>\"The divide is such that in Canada almost 90% [of children with leukaemia] can hope to survive while in the poorest countries of the world, 90% are expected to die,\" said Prof Felicia Knaul, director of the Harvard University global equity initiative.</p> <p>Between a third and a half of all cancers \u2013 2.4m to 3.7m a year \u2013 are preventable, said Knaul, and 80% of those are in lower- and middle-income countries. Preventing and treating them would offer potential productivity savings globally of more than $130bn (\u00a380bn) a year \u2013 far more than the cost of treatment.</p> <p>Cheap vaccines and basic screening can prevent and detect cervical cancer, which kills young women and mothers; cheap hepatitis B vaccination protects against liver cancer; and screening picks up breast cancer early. The dire shortage of morphine and other opioid drugs in developing countries to relieve suffering from cancer pain must be addressed, the doctors said.</p> <p>Rifat Atun, professor of international health management at Imperial College Business School, called on doctors and scientists to have \"bold ambition\" and follow the lead of clinicians involved in the Aids response.</p> <p>\"Prevention is important and we need to do it. That does not mean we should not be providing treatment,\" he said. A decade ago, people said it was not possible to get antiretroviral drugs to patients with HIV in Africa. There are now more than 8&#xa0;million people in lower-income countries on them.</p> <p>The forum agreed to a 10-point plan including a goal to cut deaths globally, oppose tobacco \u2013 possibly by a tax on manufacturers' profits \u2013 accelerate research and get an essential package of cancer care to poor countries.</p>",
  "<p>The Vatican is locked in a bitter dispute with one of South America's top universities in a row that has resurrected ideological differences within the Catholic church long thought to have been consigned to cold war history.</p> <p>At stake is the seemingly obscure issue of whether the <a href=\"http://www.pucp.edu.pe/content/index.php\" title=\"\">Pontifical Catholic University of Peru</a> in Lima can any longer describe itself as either Catholic or pontifical \u2013 ie, papal. The dispute has highlighted lingering antipathy between Roman Catholic conservatives and proponents of liberation theology, which in the 1970s and 1980s created a bridge in Latin America between radical priests and leftwing&#xa0;militants.</p> <p>This summer, Pope Benedict XVI's most senior official, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, issued a decree stripping the university of the right to use either word in its title. The decree said the stance of the university, known as La Cat\u00f3lica or La Pook (after its Spanish initials, PUCP), was no longer \"compatible with the discipline and morals of the church\".</p> <p>Students and faculty have refused to accept the decision \u2013 and some claim there is more to the affair than misgivings over their university's liberalism.</p> <p>As the decree made clear, the Vatican has been wrangling with the PUCP for more than 20 years.</p> <p>The university has been closely linked to liberation theology since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Guti%C3%A9rrez\" title=\"\">Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez</a>, the liberation movement's Peruvian founder, taught there in the 1960s.</p> <p>The row burst into the open less than three weeks after Benedict <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/03/pope-appoints-watchdog-marxist-links\" title=\"\">named a lifelong friend of Guti\u00e9rrez to head the Vatican department that enforces doctrinal orthodoxy on the worldwide Catholic church</a>. Monsignor Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller, the new prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), even co-authored a book with Guti\u00e9rrez.</p> <p>But, said Father Gianpaolo Salvini, a former editor of the Jesuit review La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica and expert on the Latin American church: \"I do not think that M\u00fcller's appointment signals a re-evaluation of liberation theology. The term includes several, heterogeneous currents of thought. Some of its followers were perfectly orthodox.\"</p> <p>Father Nicola Bux, a consultor (adviser) to the CDF, agreed. Liberation theology, he said, only became unacceptable to the Vatican \"at the point at which it is argued that man's salvation can be resolved by means of justice to be attained in this world\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398482177\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/9/1349798510228/Gustavo-Guti-rrez-the-fou-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, the founder of liberation theology, taught at La Cat\u00f3lica in the 1960s.\" width=\"200\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, the founder of liberation theology, taught at La Cat\u00f3lica in the 1960s. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:   Bettmann/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the cold war, while Latin America was undergoing enormous upheaval, doctrinal issues took on a political dimension, said Salvini. \"Jesus became a social agitator and the poor, as referred to in the gospels, came to be equated with the proletariat as defined by Marx. That alarmed the Vatican. And the great fear was of the export of the Cuban revolution. John Paul II, a pope born in Poland, a Communist country, could not in any way go along with that.\"</p> <p>In Nicaragua, priests inspired by liberation theology took an active part in the 1979 Sandinista revolution against Anastasio Somoza's rightwing dictatorship. The philosophy also influenced leftist rebels in Mexico and Colombia, where one of the main guerrilla factions was led for nearly 30 years by a former priest.</p> <p>The Vatican never condemned either Guti\u00e9rrez or his writings. But he was repeatedly called to Rome, and in 1999 became a monk, apparently to escape the scrutiny of his diocesan superiors.</p> <p>The rector of the PUCP, Marcial Rubio, said that, in a letter to the Peruvian bishops' conference, Bertone expressed consternation at the teaching of Guti\u00e9rrez's works at the university. \"Bishop Muller says that Father Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez is very important in the development of Catholic theology,\" Rubio said. \"How is it that it is wrong to read the books of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez here?\"</p> <p>Some at PUCP suspect the battle over the university's name is not about liberation theology, but power and perhaps money.</p> <p>Months before Guti\u00e9rrez fled into the Dominican order, Pope John Paul II made Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani the archbishop of Lima. A member of the conservative Opus Dei fellowship, Cipriani has been campaigning to put the PUCP firmly under the control of his archbishopric. He has the support of conservative groups in Peru who fear the university has been overrun by professors with liberal views towards homosexuality and abortion.</p> <p>Luis Bacigalupo, a philosophy professor at the PUCP, believes the Vatican's backing for Cipriani could be inspired by other concerns. The university's campus and other real estate in Lima is worth about $300m (\u00a3186m), he said, noting the Vatican faces an economic crisis exacerbated by \"multimillion-dollar payouts\" in sex abuse lawsuits. He added: \"There are certain conservative sectors in the Vatican who are very worried about the financial future of the church.\"</p> <p>For Natale Amprimo, lawyer to the archbishop of Lima, the issue is simple: \"La Cat\u00f3lica belongs to the Catholic church. The professors must fall into line with the rules of the Holy See.\"</p> <p>Rubio said: \"We think of the university as a group of people, not the property of anyone.</p> <p>\"We're defending freedom of conscience, a plural education and freedom of speech. I think our archbishop thinks we shouldn't be that free.\"</p> <h2>Roots of liberation theology<br></h2> <p>Liberation theology is an interpretation of Christian doctrine that stresses what it sees as the church's duty to help emancipate the poor from social, political and economic injustice. Its roots go back to the 1950s, but the Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez did not coin the term until the 1970s.</p> <p>He described liberation theology as a reaction to \"a continent in which more than 60% of the population lives in a state of poverty, and 82% of those find themselves in extreme poverty\". He and other proponents of this school of thought felt the church had strayed from original Christian teaching by accepting poverty's existence.</p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez wrote: \"The denunciation of injustice implies the rejection of the use of Christianity to legitimise the established order.\" Many of his followers went further, taking part in direct action and aligning themselves with revolutionary movements.</p> <p>In Nicaragua, priests took an active part in the Sandinista revolution that led in 1979 to the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza's rightwing dictatorship. Several also played a role in the Marxist-inspired government that replaced it.</p>",
  "<p>With its steel and plate glass facade, the interactive entertainment academy at the University of Central Florida looks as far from the grassy quadrangle and belltower of a traditional college as it's possible to get.</p> <p>Inside, small teams of students \u2013 artists, computer programmers and aspiring games producers \u2013 collaborate to acquire the skills needed to work in the video games industry. In one studio, a trio of students have created an iPad version of an Angry Birds-style game that involves firing dodos from a cannon.</p> <p>Kyle Martin, lead artist on the dodo game, had borrowed $33,000 in a federal loan to pay for his year's tuition.</p> <p>\"FIEA has a really great success rate in terms of who gets hired,\" he said. \"That by itself proves it's a great investment.\"</p> <p>The campus is in Orlando, a city that is best known for its proximity to the world's most popular amusement park but is increasingly a centre for hi-tech industry, film, TV and gaming.</p> <p>Ben Noel, director of the interactive entertainment academy, said: \"Orlando has grown up around agriculture and tourism, low wage jobs. The people who had opportunities around here were the children of bankers, real estate lawyers and real estate developers.</p> <p>\"As we grow, there's very much a focus on economic development and high wage jobs. We're trying to build that infrastructure.\"</p> <p>The US has one of the most highly educated workforces in the developed world. Across all age groups, only Canada, Israel, Japan and Russia have a higher proportion of college-educated workers. But many countries are catching up fast as more young people around the globe get an opportunity to go to university.</p> <p>According to the OECD, 42% of young Americans have a college education _ far behind the world leader, Korea, where 65% of young people have a degree.</p> <p>On current trends, the US will be overtaken by an increasing number of countries in coming years.</p> <p>In a flatter world, that creates competitive pressure. The Obama administration has set a goal that, by 2020, the US will have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans agree that college should be more affordable and accessible, but differ on how to achieve this.</p> <p>President Obama has raised the maximum Pell grant award available in the next academic year. The grant, intended for the neediest students, is the federal government's single biggest expenditure on education; of the 16.4m undergraduates at US colleges in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.popecenter.org/inquiry_papers/article.html?id=2704\">58% received Pell grants</a>.</p> <p>Mitt Romney argues that increased federal funding will feed the growth in college costs. He has indicated a narrowing of the Pell grant programme, saying that \"a Romney administration will refocus Pell grant dollars on the students that need them most\". Romney says that he will support \"institutions that are pursuing innovative operating models to drive down costs\".</p> <p>Obama acknowledges the need to curb college costs, but favours using federal money as an incentive for good behaviour. He has proposed that some federal aid will be shifted away from colleges that fail to hold down net tuition \u2013 the costs paid by students after taking grants into account. The money, $10bn annually, will be used to reward colleges that \"do their fair share\" to keep tuition affordable, the president says.</p> <p>Obama lobbied Congress this summer to extend the low interest rate on federal student loans, a move that was backed by Romney. Congress voted to extend the 3.4% rate on Stafford loans for another year - the interest rate would otherwise have doubled.</p> <p>Meanwhile, state funding for public universities is under intense pressure. State government budgets have been squeezed by spending on programmes like Medicaid, the healthcare scheme for the poor. Universities, which can plug their funding gap by charging students more for tuition, are obvious targets for spending cuts.</p> <p>Between 1992 and 2010, state funding dropped from 38% of public universities' total revenue to an average of 23%. Enrolment at public universities has gone up while state funding has fallen by 20% per student in the past decade, according to the National Science Board, which advises the government on science policy.</p> <p>The erosion of state support is keenly felt at the University of Central Florida. With over 50,000 students enroled, it is the second largest university in the US, after Arizona State.</p> <p>Last year, for the first time, the university's share of funding from tuition exceeded the proportion it received from the state. In Florida as a whole, public funding per student has fallen by 19% in the past decade, according to the National Science Board figures.</p> <p>University provost Tony Waldrop said: \"One of our goals is to provide access to students who are qualified to go to college. We don't see our job as to figure out how to deny people a college degree but rather to provide access to that opportunity.</p> <p>\"We could just cap enrolment, and then we wouldn't have this problem, but if we cap enrolment that by definition means we're going to deny students an opportunity to get a college education without going out of state.\"</p> <p>Instead, the university has cut courses, increased class sizes and is offering more education online. A third of UCF's student credit hours \u2013 which count towards graduation \u2013 are either completely or partially online, the provost says. This figure grows every year.</p> <p>Waldrop said: \"At a time when we were growing very rapidly, and growing rapidly so we could meet the demand for access to colleges here in Florida, we were also getting cuts, so the biggest impact has been not being able to hire faculty at the same rate we were increasing in size. So something we're concerned about is our student to faculty ratio is not where we would like it to be.\"</p> <p>Average class sizes are now between 40 and 48 students, the university's management estimates. Five courses, ranging from radiology to actuarial science, have gone \u2013 in some cases because of low enrolments but also because they were available at local community colleges. It remains a comprehensive university offering a vast array of courses from art history to neuroscience. The giant main campus - featuring a 10,000 seat arena where graduation ceremonies are held - feels like a self-contained citadel within Orlando.</p> <p>A further squeeze on government funding; if, for example, eligibility for Pell grants is narrowed, could have a serious impact on the university's mission.</p> <p>\"If the Pell grant programme is limited, disadvantaged students are not going to be able to afford to come to UCF,\" the provost said. \"And if they can't afford UCF \u2013 we're already one of the cheapest in the country.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398481679\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/28/1351447514396/florida-education-010.jpg\" alt=\"florida education\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At UCF, tuition fees for the current academic year are just under $6,000 for Florida residents on undergraduate courses.

Romney wants to encourage private provision of college education, indicating that he will deregulate this sector.</p> <p>The candidates' attitude to private for-profit colleges has emerged as an effective dividing line in the presidential race. The Obama administration has passed regulations that require for-profit colleges to <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/gainful-employment-regulations\">demonstrate \"gainful employment\"</a> among their graduates \u2013 the measures include being able to demonstrate that at least 35% of former students are actively paying down loans.</p> <p>Romney has said he will do away with this \"ill-advised regulation\". The Romney plan says: \"the federal government should allow consumers in the market to make their own choices while providing the information to make those choices well.\"</p> <p>A Romney remark that students should \"shop around\" and borrow more money from their parents was seized on in Democrat campaign ads as an example of the gap between the Republican candidate and ordinary lives. The president has portrayed himself and his wife as beneficiaries of affordable state-backed education.</p> <p>On the campaign trail <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF_9r6-DLTw\">Romney has praised</a> the for-profit Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida, noting that they run classes 24 hours a day \"because physical structure is expensive\".</p> <p>Romney said: \"They hold down the cost of their education by recognising they're competing. We're going to have to have greater competition among institutions of higher learning and I believe that they're going to have to become productive.</p> <p>\"Two of the places that are least productive in our society, have done less to improve their cost and quality are healthcare and higher education. Bringing the dynamics of competition to those marketplaces in my view is the best way to bring down cost.\"</p> <h2>A private model with higher tuition </h2> <p>Full Sail, which is less than seven miles from UCF, <a href=\"http://www.fullsail.edu/outcomes-and-statistics\">has steeper tuition rates</a> than the public university. A degree course in Digital Arts and Design, for example, costs $80,000 for a 21 month course.</p> <p>However, a spokeswoman argued that as the university's courses are taken at an accelerated pace, students saved on living costs.</p> <p>She said: \"Our students are potentially in their career earlier, they've saved money on up to two additional years of living as a college student, and they've been more aggressively prepared for the non-stop pace of the entertainment industry.\"</p> <p>Full Sail is a specialist institution focused on the entertainment industry; its alumni include an Oscar winner, Gary Rizzo, who was honoured for his sound mixing work on the Christopher Nolan film Inception. <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2047078,00.html\">At last year's Grammys</a>, the five nominees were all mixed or engineered by Full Sail graduates.</p> <p>It offers students lavish facilities \u2013 there are more than a dozen sound stages to shoot film and television, music recording studios that meet professional standards, and outdoor movie sets recreating Amsterdam, Venice and New York. Its website publishes detailed statistics about student outcomes, including how many get jobs in their chosen profession \u2013 for the digital arts and design course, the success rate was 78% of the 222 students who graduated in 2009-10.</p> <p>Full Sail provides a fast track into the entertainment business for many of its students, but its high tuition costs mean it is unlikely to provide a realistic alternative for students from less affluent homes.</p> <p>Asked about the university's student profile, the spokeswoman said: \"We do not track the socio-economic background of our students and we do not encourage or discourage students based on their socio-economic background. Also, due to our student privacy policy, we do not publish information of this nature.\"</p> <p>Like the music industry and the media, traditional universities face a challenge from the disruptive power of the internet. Increasingly, traditional universities have felt the need to cover their internet flank by offering courses online. Harvard and MIT have launched the edX platform while a number of elite universities including Princeton and Johns Hopkins have joined the online education platform Coursera. The provost of UCF accepts that the expansion of virtual learning will provide mounting competition for universities like his.</p> <p>Waldrop said: \"I think our competition increasingly will come from online education and different ways of doing it that may or may not lead to degrees. I don't think we've seen the impact of that yet.\"</p> <p>Teenagers will always require a rite of passage into adulthood, and that is part of what universities provide. But as online education grows, the solution to America's college debt problem might bring with it the dissolution of the physical campus and library.</p>",

So&#xa0;if&#xa0;anyone knows any black ones we can&#xa0;use for the photos, please give my&#xa0;publisher a ring as we really are&#xa0;struggling!</p> <h2><strong>Valentine's Day</strong></h2> <p><em>Now is the time to bump and grind/ Against my firm and smooth behind/ And Harry sends away his flunkey/ Hoping I will spank his monkey.</em> Valentine's Day is the day on which&#xa0;people celebrate their love for&#xa0;one another, so one unusual thing&#xa0;you can try is to give a card to your special one \u2013 Me! \u2013 with a heart on&#xa0;it. If you can't find any cards like this, you might want to buy me some flowers. A garage will help you out, if you don't find a florist open on your way back from the pub. I also think nothing says \"I love you\" more than a raspberry souffle, so I've included another recipe someone found somewhere. And for that final flourish, a box of After Eights is the perfect ending to a romantic evening.</p> <h2><strong>Wedding day</strong></h2> <p><em>Oh joyous, rapturous day of days/ When&#xa0;social climbing pays its way/ And&#xa0;Westminster Abbey doth as one all swear/ I have the world's best derri\u00e8re.</em> A&#xa0;wedding is when someone gets married to another person, so the clever party organiser will always remember to bake a cake and order the&#xa0;right amount of chairs for the guests to sit on. On big family occasions like this, it's all too easy to imagine the&#xa0;day is about the bride and groom, and forget that a large, televised wedding is the perfect way to launch your own career. So never be afraid to upstage your sister, and once you have&#xa0;made yourself the centre of attention, you can relax with a glass of&#xa0;wine and a sing-song, knowing you will never have to work again.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> Cutandpaste.</p>",
  "<p>There are few places in America where the dividing line in the 2012 election is as clear as the desolate stretch of Harrison Avenue on the outskirts of Canton, Ohio. On one side of the street is the smoke-belching Timken steel plant, its owners generous contributors to the Republicans. On the other, four of the workers, members of the steel union, distribute leaflets on behalf of Barack Obama.</p> <p>It was just after dawn on the first bitterly cold day of autumn and, even clad in hats and heavy jackets, they were shivering. But no one was complaining. They were on a mission, handing out pro-Democrat leaflets to sleepy-eyed, largely uninterested workers coming off the night shift and others about to start the day shift.</p> <p>\"The only motivation I need for getting out early in the morning is knowing this election will decide whether organised labour still exists afterwards in this country or not. This election could erase 50 to 60 years of struggle by organised labour,\" said Joe Sterling, 48, one of the four. A former carpenter who became a steelworker, he has been on leave since May working full-time on the campaign.</p> <p>Harrison Avenue provides a powerful image of how polarised this election has become, especially between the classes. But Timken's importance lies not in the symbolism but in its location, one of the biggest employers in Stark County, among the most intensely fought-over areas in the whole of America. How Stark County votes is usually how Ohio votes and Ohio looks as if it will decide who will be the next White House incumbent.</p> <p>It is too close to call and the numbers of volunteers out for Obama is down on 2008 \u2013 as is the level of enthusiasm. \"I am nervous,\" said Susie Camper, 69, another one of the four outside the gates. She had been up since 5.30am to get to the factory in time to leaflet. \"It is kind of scary if Romney becomes president.\"</p> <p>Camper, Sterling and tens of thousands of other union members like them across the country are putting in long days in the swing states, working the phone banks and going door to door.</p> <p>In terms of volunteers and financial donations, the unions are one of Obama's biggest assets, the shadow army to his official campaign teams.</p> <p>The union contribution tends to go largely unrecognised, their role in the campaign mainly ignored by the media, and with little in the way of thanks afterwards from Obama and the politicians they help into office. \"Unions have become a dirty word,\" one union official said.</p> <p>It was not always so. American unions have a proud history, at least as far as those on the left are concerned: from the violent clashes in the pits and steelworks across Pennsylvania at the latter part of 19th century to the New York garment workers' strike at the start of the 20th century, the unions were the key to winning decent wages and working conditions. The unions peaked in the 1950s, with about 30% of the workforce signed up.</p> <p>Today, membership has dropped dramatically, down to only 11%, partly a result of the highly publicised stories of corruption in the 1950s and 60s, especially those involving the Teamsters, and partly as a result of anti-union legislation, a creeping process brought in by Republican governors and legislatures. Now 23 out of the 50 states are \"right-to-work\", with laws that prohibit unions from requiring non-members to pay dues.</p> <p>The fear of the unions is that if Romney wins the White House, this process will accelerate.</p> <p>\"What we are witnessing is corporate greed out of control,\" said Kathleen Kelly-Calcei, 55, a full-time official with the AFL-CIO, the federation representing 56 unions. Kelly-Calcei runs the campaign war room in Canton, one of about a score of AFL-CIO field offices in Ohio. A poster near the entrance sums up her uncompromising spirit: \"Go Hard or Go Home.\"</p> <p>\"I fear Romney will go in for the kill with federal legislation. I definitely think he is committed to those who are funding him to get rid of the unions. It will be devastating. There will be no one standing in the way of the corporations.\"</p> <p>Kelly-Calcei and others cite as evidence the way the Republicans, after wins in the 2010 mid-term elections, immediately moved to introduce anti-union legislation in Wisconsin, Indiana and elsewhere.</p> <p>If unions are in decline, then why, union officials ask, are they the number one target for Republicans? A steel union official in Canton, Joe Hoagland, 57, has one answer. Workers at Timken earn about $20-$23.50 an hour. Without the unions, workers would be earning $12 an hour, as they do in the \"right-to-work\" states in the South, Hoagland said.</p> <p>Another reason is that an attack on the unions is an attack on the Democratic party. Without union money, the Democrats would be struggling to match the Republicans. The unions are coy about how much they contribute but estimates run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. One union alone, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said in the summer it planned to spend $100m.</p> <p>The union contributions are not just in terms of direct donations or paying for expensive ads in the swing states, but in terms of hours.</p> <p>The United Steelworkers alone is deploying 600 of its full-time staff and paying the wages and health insurance for 150 workers such as Sterling who have taken time off work to help. On top of this, the union has lots of unpaid volunteers, an estimated 10,000, each working at least a three-hour shift each week.</p> <p>\"Our goal is to have 11 contacts from the union with every member. In some places, it is 14,\" Tim Waters, national political director of the steelworkers' union, said.</p> <p>Obama campaign offices across the US attract a lot of young, affluent and college-educated staff and volunteers. Those running the parallel union operations tend to be predominantly working-class, more inclined to openly display their passion, more direct and more inclined to argue.</p> <p>The four outside Timken knew most of the workers going in and out, and their leaflets are mostly accepted, either out of shared conviction or just politeness. Others decline, more interested in getting to their cars and home or because they are Republicans. An estimated 30% of all union members across the country will vote Republican.</p> <p>Another of the four outside Timken, Scott Jacob, 57, a furnace operator, got into an argument with a Romney-supporting worker. It was the kind of exchange unlikely to be replicated by one of the young middle-class Obama staffers, who are told not to argue with voters.</p> <p>\"I told him if he votes Romney, he would see what happens to social security and Medicare benefits. He said he did not think that would happen,\" Jacob said. \"I told him: 'Bend over. You are going to get screwed if you vote for Romney.'\"</p> <p>This uncompromising approach to campaigning is evident too in union ads. An ad paid for by a group linked to the AFL-CIO launched last week accused Romney of being \"an economic traitor\".</p> <p>What do companies such as Timken get if Republicans win? A more business-friendly administration, certainly. And even more direct rewards. One of its owners was a big contributor to George W Bush, to the extent that he was given ambassadorship to Germany.</p> <p>What will the unions get in return if Obama wins? Not very much, union officials said. They would like legislation giving unions nationwide rights but are not expecting that to happen. They would like tougher responses to China to ensure a more equal playing field in trade. But if all they get is to see Obama's healthcare reforms embedded, that would be a big bonus for workers and they will settle for that.</p> <p>After election night, the officials and volunteers will pack up their offices and have a few days off. Then they will be heading back for the midnight shift.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012 because the original referred to \"right-to-work\" laws that prohibit unions from requiring members to pay dues. This has been corrected to say non-members. </p>",
  "<p>Two down, one to go? No sooner had Txiki Begiristain been confirmed as Manchester City's director of football than the inevitable question began to be asked and once they started they did not stop. Begiristain's statement said he was looking forward to working with Roberto Mancini, which it had to say of course, but it seemed everybody wanted to know the same thing: does this mean Pep Guardiola is coming too?</p> <p>Aitor 'Txiki' Begiristain was the sporting director who turned to Pep Guardiola when Barcelona sacked Frank Rijkaard at the end of the 2008 season. He travelled to see Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and decided the Portuguese was too much of a fire-starter to entrust with the job. The decision seems logical now: Guardiola became the most successful coach in Barcelona's history, winning a treble in his first season. At the time the decision was a brave and risky one.</p> <p>Now everyone wants Guardiola; back then, few did. Begiristain was one of them. Guardiola won the European Cup. Rijkaard, the first coach to work under Begiristain, had won one too. Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, once said: \"Bringing in Txiki was the best decision I ever made.\" Under him, Barcelona won two European Cups and five league titles in seven years. When he came in with Laporta in 2003, Barcelona had gone four years without a trophy and were lurching from crisis to crisis.</p> <p>Yet Barcelona had begun a slide under Rijkaard and even before the 2007-08 season was finished Begiristain had determined a change was needed, even as some on the board resisted. The decision may even have come late, but it did finally come. Begiristain said Rijkaard had lost control of the dressing room. There was, though, no guarantee that Guardiola would wrest it back again, still less that he would prove successful. He had only been a coach for one season: with Barcelona B.</p> <p>But Begiristain had faith in Guardiola. He formed part of the Johan Cruyff-led dream team alongside Guardiola that won the 1992 European Cup and they shared an approach. Cruyff was Laporta's mentor; Begiristain was Cruyff's suggestion.</p> <p>Begiristain is a Basque who had been signed from Real Sociedad and claims to have learnt Catalan sitting in Barcelona's traffic jams, repeating everything he heard on the radio. Funny, chatty, likeable and smart, Cruyff described him as a \"clever\" player. So clever, Cruyff's No2 Charly Rexach claimed, that in the pouring rain and mud of Atoxa, he'd leave the pitch with hardly a stain on him.</p> <p>As sporting director he insisted on the need for style and substance. Full-backs had to be attacking and at least one of the central defenders must be capable of bringing the ball out from the back \u2013 of being a player as well as a protector. Although there were question marks about some of his signings - Maxi L\u00f3pez and Alexandr Hleb among them \u2013 the decision to go for Guardiola has huge symbolic significance. It would have been easier to chose Mourinho. Indeed, as Graham Hunter explains in his book Bar\u00e7a, Guardiola himself told him just that.</p> <p>Begiristain had travelled to Lisbon with two directors, Marc Ingla and Ferran Soriano, to see Mourinho. The presentation was impressive but Begiristain, Soriano and Ingla were not keen; there was something about his personality that did not fit. They would win, sure, but it was not enough simply to win. Guardiola was not just the right manager, he was the right man. When they returned, the message was unanimous: it has got to be Guardiola. Soriano and Begiristain went to get him.</p> <p>Soriano left Barcelona in 2008, Begiristain two years later and Guardiola last summer. Soriano and Begiristain have since arrived at Manchester City. Guardiola is in New York on a sabbatical, mulling over his next move.</p>",
  "<p>A relative of the British family murdered in the French Alps has demanded British authorities return the two children who survived the massacre to their family and claimed a French nuclear worker found dead at the scene was the intended target of the attack.</p> <p>Dr Ahmad al-Saffar told the Guardian the family wanted the two children who survived the attack returned to them from foster care where they were placed when they came back to Britain.</p> <p>He said the family believed the sisters, aged seven and four, should be being brought up in a Muslim household. Saffar added that they were being kept in foster care \"against their will\", which was exacerbating the \"pain and suffering\" caused by the loss of their parents.</p> <p>Saffar is the uncle of Iqbal al-Saffar, who was found dead in a car in Annecy in September. Also shot dead was her husband, Saad al-Hilli, from Surrey, and her mother. One of their children was shot and beaten with a pistol, while another escaped unhurt. Nearby the body of a French cyclist was found.</p> <p>Saffar criticised the French prosecutor and said the family felt they were not being treated as victims but were being put on trial and their lives put under a microscope.</p> <p>Recent reports said ballistic tests showed the French cyclist was shot first, contrary to what had been first reported about the attack. The French authorities said they did know who was shot first.</p> <p>Saffar said his family resented the speculation that feuds among relatives may have been a motive for the killing. He said: \"From my family's perception I do not see any single reason why three members of my family were the targets for a murder. I do not see any reason. None of these [supposed motives] the French prosecutor has mentioned are credible at all.\"</p> <p>\"I think the French cyclist was the target. The mounting evidence and leaks are saying the main target was the cyclist. There is no reason for our family to be targeted in France when they were on vacation.\"</p> <p>The cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, worked as a welder at the subsidiary of a French nuclear company.</p> <p>Saffar dismissed speculation about a row over the will of Saad al-Hilli's father: \"I think this was ridiculous, this is not something unique to the al-Hilli family. Some differences arose after the father's death, but the family are civilised people, they are not solving their problems in this brutal way.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The French prosecutor is putting our family on trial, they are not being treated as the victims any longer, they are the accused.\"</p> <p>Speculation centred on Saad al-Hilli's brother, Zaid. Saffar said he and Zaid had helped organise the funerals last weekend in Britain and was saddened by the speculation. \"This really is very disturbing to bring up these issues as the reason for this savage murder,\" he said. \"He felt very bad about this speculation.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month it was claimed the family had a Swiss bank account and that Hilli had been in Geneva shortly before his death. An illegal Taser gun was claimed to have been found in the family's Surrey home.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Le Monde claimed Saad al-Hilli's father was linked to a payment of over \u00a3800,000 from the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq, with the report saying the information had been passed to French police by German intelligence. The claims were rejected by French police who said they had no knowledge of the alleged payments nor had been given details about them.</p> <p>Saffar said he doubted the claim, saying: \"The father left Iraq in the 1970s because of disagreements with the regime.\"</p> <p>Hilli's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was left severely wounded, and four-year-old Zeena traumatised after hiding under her mother as the gunman sprayed the car with bullets.</p> <p>Saffar said Surrey county council, which has placed the orphaned sisters in foster care, should return the children to the family. \"Their suffering and pain continues on top of what pain and suffering they have experienced,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They should be with their family to give them some comfort and we see that every time we meet them.\"</p> <p>Saffar, who saw the children with their aunt last weekend, said: \"It was hard to see Zainab, to hear her ask why our meetings are so short.\"</p> <p>Their aunt is seeking guardianship of the two surviving children from the attack. Saffar said: \"The social services can see these two girls want to be with their aunt.\" The foster parents were not Muslims, he added, and the sisters were \"deprived of being in an environment which is the same as [provided] by their parents, in regards of religion and culture\".</p> <p>Saffar said: \"We are not saying anything negative about this [foster] family \u2013 they are good \u2013 but we think the girls are better off with their aunt. The affection is not there.\"</p> <p>He said of Zainab, whom the hitman attacked and left for dead: \"I saw her last Saturday. She is doing fine. One can see very clearly she is with a foster family against her will.\"</p> <p>In the Guardian interview, the al-Hilli family's dissatisfaction with the French investigation is barely disguised.</p> <p>Saffar said the family were not being kept in touch with the progress of the investigation. He said: \"We have had no contact from the French about the investigation, just interviews when we were in France after the murders, and no contact since.\"</p> <p>The family had one meeting with British police, in addition to interviews as witnesses.</p> <p>He criticised the French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, saying: \"His job is to find the killer and not to focus on the family. I hope it will not take him 10 years to solve the crime, as he has said. I think he should hand it over to someone else to do a better job.\"</p>",

Not what the Rams, nor the league, had in mind when they were scheduling this game, but New England's substantial British support can celebrate another successful visit.

From a statistical standpoint, Bradford is having an excellent game - having completed 14 of 16 for 146 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. They have perhaps been guilty of not committing enough to the run - the best tactic against a team as explosive on offense as the Pats is often to keep the ball out of their hands - but mostly they have been guilty of making big mistakes in key moments.

It was a penalty that killed the Rams on their last drive, a holding call wiping out their offensive momentum, and now a pair of them help carry New England into the end zone, Bradley Fletcher twice called for pass interference on a series that ends with Ridley ploughing into the end zone from a yard out. The second was a real killer, arriving as it did at the end of an incomplete pass on third-and-goal from the eight.

Big trouble brewing for the Rams here, not so much for the fact that this drive is quickly unravelling - a holding penalty taking them back from the New England 41 into their own half before Richardson loses a couple of yards on a pass reception - but because quarterback Sam Bradford required an injury time-out just now to receive treatment on an injured shoulder. Bradford appeared to land badly on his left shoulder as he was brought down by Hightower, having narrowly escaped a sack on what looked like a broken play. TV has just cut to an ad break, so we'll have to wait and see if he returns ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508d75fdb5793e5495b451c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-28T18:14:21.957Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rams 7 Patriots 21, 4:28 remaining in 2nd quarter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Rams desperately need to get something going here - both so that they can reduce the arrears on the scoreboard but also to give their defense a much-needed rest.

Here's a snippet:</p> <blockquote> <p>There was a moment in the mid-1980s, around the time that yuppies started braying into mobile phones the size of breeze blocks and the Big Bang went off, that American football in the UK exploded. Millions watched week-old highlights on Channel 4. William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, a 22-stone tugboat of tallow and body armour, became an unlikely celebrity. Dan Marino, then one of the game's biggest stars, even held a training camp at Luton Town football club. And then, like acid house T-shirts, Hi-De-Hi! and other 80s curios, the bubble burst.</p> <p>A generation on, American football is again moving the chains in Britain. The&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/nfl\">NFL</a>&#xa0;has a battery of statistics \u2013 a 154% rise in viewing figures since 2006, a 4.3m combined TV and radio audience for last year's Super Bowl and a 32% increase in its \"avid fanbase\" of two million UK supporters \u2013 to make its case. But its actions speak louder than numbers. This month, the NFL announced it would play two regular-season games at Wembley in 2013. A spokesman hailed it as an \"historic step in international development\". It was also a major statement of intent.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/27/razzle-dazzle-nfl-out-shadows\">Click here to keep reading.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508d5ffc95cb4ec5a031bac6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-28T16:40:29.251Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cultural exchange</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the spirit of mutual understanding that these international games hope to foster, I would like to share with our US readers the following informational video covering the differences between the oft-confused terms 'UK' and 'Great Britain'.

The NFL returns to Wembley Stadium for the sixth consecutive year, the International Series now a firm fixture on the UK sporting landscape. That there is an appetite for this form of football on the far side of the Atlantic is no longer in doubt. Once again, close to 40,000 turned out for the pre-game fan rally this week in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>Whether said appetite can ever be great enough to sustain a London franchise - or indeed, whether such an enterprise is logistically viable - is perhaps a debate for another day, but what we do know is that these games have driven a significant increase in the sport's UK following. Sky Sports, the main broadcaster for the sport in the UK, have more than doubled their viewing figures for the NFL since 2007. Amateur British leagues are experiencing 10-15% year-on-year growth in participation.</p> <p>What we also know is that the New England Patriots are among the best-supported NFL teams in the UK, a source of great frustration to the Rams fans left behind in St Louis. This is nominally a home game for their team, meaning they lose one of their eight regular season games at the Edward Jones Dome. All of the team's three wins to date have come in front of partisan crowds there. Although the Rams have struggled to sell games out - ranking 29th in the league for attendance as a percentage of capacity - the noise inside the dome has often been imposing.</p> <p>In the five seasons prior to this one, the Rams had won just 15 games - the worst-ever run in NFL history - but already this season they look transformed under new head coach Jeff Fisher. Two of their four defeats have been deeply unfortunate - <a href=\"http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/09/10/nfl-says-clock-operator-in-detroit-made-mistake-late-in-rams-loss/\">an error by the clock operator costing them dear in Detroit</a>, just as three missed kicks by the otherwise flawless rookie Greg 'The Leg' Zuerlein did in Miami. This team will believe it can overcome the heavily favoured Patriots.</p> <p>New England themselves have been a puzzle,ranking first in the league for total offense, yet contriving to lose to the Rams' NFC West rivals from Arizona and Seattle. Switching their offensive focus away from the pass towards a run-heavy no-huddle scheme has proved a success, but the defense - and in particular the secondary - remains porous.</p> <p>It all adds up to an intriguing match-up, one which should prove far more closely thought than many had envisaged when the game was first scheduled. One of which both the NFL, and London, can be proud.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>When Ali Faras's 21-year-old son was murdered, the local court gave him three options: to pardon the killer, demand blood money from the man's family or call for his execution. If he decided the latter, he would have to perform the killing himself.</p> <p>The killer, Mohamed Sanbaare, had been his son's friend and business partner. Sanbaare owned a fishing boat and the pair worked together as human traffickers, ferrying immigrants across the sea to Yemen. One day, out at sea, Sanbaare shot and killed his friend. It was, he said, an accident.</p> <p>Sanbaare was found guilty of murder at a court in Bossasso, in Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland. Puntland more stable than the capital, Mogadishu, with functioning local authorities.</p> <p>Bossasso has the largest prison in the region, with room for 400 criminals, and every week the port city's highest court deals with serious criminal cases including murder, terrorism and piracy. Murderers are judged according to Somalia's sharia law and the concept of Qisas, or \"equal retaliation\", which states that the victim's family must decide the fate of the murderer. They can choose to forgive, to ask for money as recompense or to demand the killer's death.</p> <p>\"Once the sentence is passed, if the victim's family choose to kill, then we take the defendant to the execution site, and the killing is carried out,\" said Sheikh Adam Ahmed, the highest judge in Bossasso.</p> <p>The local authorities provide the family of the victim with an AK-47 and five bullets. The condemned man is blindfolded and tied to a small tree known as the tree of death. The person chosen to carry out the deed stands five metres away.</p> <p>A gravedigger called Jerry \u2013 a nickname given to someone with a limp \u2013 explained it was not always easy for the executioner.</p> <p>\"Sometimes they [the family] miss because they're shaking so much,\" he said. The authorities will then provide an extra five bullets and allow the marksman to stand just two metres from his target, and have another go.</p> <p>\"The victim's families come here eager to finish the job,\" said Jerry. \"But once they shoot the man dead, they always rush away. There's a sense of guilt.\"</p> <p>Faras, a camel herder who once served in Somalia's army, decided to ask his son's killer for blood money instead. In Islamic law, blood money is very precise \u2013 one man's life is worth the value of 100 camels. The current going price for 100 camels is about $20,000 (\u00a312,400).</p> <p>Four years later, Sanbaare's mother, Asha Abdulakadir, is still trying to raise the money to save her son from execution. \"$20,000! Where will I find $20,000 from?\" she asked. \"If I can't find the money, I will lose my son.\"</p> <p>Sanbaare used to be the breadwinner in the family. Without his income, Abdulakadir is struggling to keep up with her rent and is facing eviction. Meanwhile Sanbaare is in jail and Faras awaits payment.</p> <p>\"I am the victim and they promised to pay the blood money,\" he said. \"They say they will find it, and I told them: if you want to save your son, then pay.\"</p> <p>Sanbaare is one of 67 death row prisoners at Bossasso jail. Over the past five years he has watched as, one by one, his 20 cellmates were taken away, never to return.</p> <p>\"When executions are about to happen here, you can always tell,\" he said. \"When your time is up, it's up. We all have to die some day, whether you're executed or die of natural causes. I'm waiting for my time.\"</p> <p>Sitting in the courtyard, with prison guards watching us from metres away, Sanbaare complains about prison life.

  "<p>Over wine and coffee in the Wilde Oscar restaurant, Peter Sibley and Gottfried Stecher are swapping stories of the bad old days when homosexuality was outlawed.</p> <p>\"I was a late developer, and didn't even learn the word 'gay' until I was 30,\" says Stecher, 84. \"I only came to the slow realisation that I myself was [gay] because I knew it wasn't usual not to be interested in girls,\" adds the retired confectioner who now works as an extra at the national opera house, the Deutsche Oper. \"I've spent most of my life being a lover to married men.\"</p> <p>Sibley, 70, a former London theatre and music manager, says he had the fortune \"of working in a profession where it was considered normal to be queer\". Apart from his parents, he says, \"I've lived with other gay people all my life.\"</p> <p>They may have had different life experiences, but in retirement both men had a similar wish: to grow old in an environment in which they could be open about their sexuality.</p> <p>Now neighbours, they are meeting for the first time in the plush restaurant on the ground floor of a revolutionary housing project both call home in west&#xa0;Berlin. In Europe's first multi-generational house for lesbian, gay, transgender and bisexual residents, Stecher has a two-room flat on the second floor, Sibley a single room in a fourth-floor flatshare.</p> <p>\"What all our residents have in common is that they wanted to live together with other gays and lesbians,\" says Marco Pulver of Berlin's gay and lesbian advisory service, which is behind the \u20ac6m project, Lebensort Vielfalt (Diverse Living Space). \"Many of our older residents spent their youth and often a large amount of their adult life in gay-hostile environments.</p> <p>\"Several even experienced persecution under the Nazis, and all of them have been affected by Germany's 'paragraph 175',\" he says, referring to the law that forbade sex between men and was not abolished until 1994.</p> <p>\"Now their priority is not to have to shy away from their sexuality and to certainly not have to worry about whether who is taking care of them, often in an intimate way, has a problem with it.\" There are more than 200 people on the waiting list for the home.</p> <p>Pulver insists that although 60% of the space is reserved for men over 55, the project is far more than just a retirement home for men. Women, as well as younger men, live there too. The youngest is 31-year-old Robert Franke, an accountant at a local yoga centre, who says he jumped at the chance when he was told he could apply for a flat in the housing project.</p> <p>\"I lived in a commune with 24 others in a squat in the former East Berlin,\" he says. \"When that broke up, I thought it would be nice to be a bit independent, but also to be in a well-defined community with other gay people.\"</p> <p>Fifty-two-year-old Paul Welbourne, from Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, said: \"I wouldn't idealise it \u2013 there are lots of challenges to living at close quarters and just because we're gay doesn't mean we all get on. But we plan to stick at it and hope to make it work.\"</p> <p>The residents of Lebensort Vielfalt's 25 flats are also served by a concierge, and enjoy a library, a garden, and the restaurant, which doubles up as a theatre/cabaret bar for regular entertainment including a recent \"gay not grey\" fashion show, which was open to the public.</p> <p>Sibley says the Berlin housing project saved him from \"ending my days rotting in an anonymous old folk's home\". Having recovered from the worst effects of a stroke last year, he set about trying to find suitable accommodation, helped by friends and the Terrence Higgins Trust in the UK.</p> <p>\"There was nothing comparable in the UK, so we had to look elsewhere. They're planning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/02/spains-first-gay-retirement-home\" title=\"\">something similar in Madrid</a>, but seeing as I have friends in Berlin, and it's easy for UK friends to fly over to see me, we decided upon this,\" he says.</p> <p>Despite his ailments \u2013 he is reliant on a wheelchair \u2013 he views his situation with a healthy dose of humour. He draws on the daily encounters with his handsome, gay, Hungarian carer, trips to the local deli, the Scott Joplin piano concert he played when the project opened and details of life with his insomniac former opera-singing flatmate.</p> <p>Friends have now encouraged him to turn his words into a blog, <a href=\"http://oldbuggerzinberlin.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">oldbuggerzinberlin</a>. \"There are days when I think 'get me out of here',\" he admits, \"but there are certainly far worse places in which to end up.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <h2>Teams</h2> <p>Everton (4-4-2): Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Distin, Neville; Coleman,<br>Osman, Fellaini, Mirallas; Jelavic, Naismith.</p> <p>Subs: Mucha, Heitinga, Hibbert, Oviedo, Hitzlsperger, Gueye, Vellios.</p> <p>Liverpool (4-3-3): Jones; Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Enrique; Allen, Sahin, Gerrard;<br>Suso, Suarez, Sterling.</p> <p>Subs: Reina, Carragher, Shelvey, Coates, Downing, Henderson, Assaidi.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Afternoon \u2013 it's arguable that the pressure before today's kick-off rests more heavily on the shoulders of Everton's men than Liverpool's. The build-up to the game has been dominated by reports of the home side's growing confidence and stature, the visitors reduced to being described as a faint echo of their former greatness.<br>But, then again, Everton went into three of these derby fixtures last season with exactly the same expectation yet did not beat Liverpool in either their two league encounters or their FA Cup semi final. Everton may have finished higher than their neighbours in the league but they were so uncertain against Liverpool in the FA Cup in particular that it's tempting to wonder if they fear some kind of derby day hoodoo.<br>Today they arrive as some people's favourites again, and face a Liverpool that is still a work in progress. The ability to shake off the supposed inferiority complex would confirm to many that Everton are now the dominant force on Merseyside. Another failure would leave David Moyes gnashing teeth despite his efforts to downplay the fixture by saying it will not define their season.</p> <p>Liverpool, for all their supposed problems, turn up today on the back of three successive clean sheets and know they've won nine of their last 12 league games at Goodison. But for Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers, the quest continues to forge an identity for the team. His side \u2013 understandably, for these are early days of a new regime \u2013 are in stark contrast to the organisation at Everton. Under Moyes, everyone seems to know their role. At Liverpool the debate still rages as to what Steven Gerrard's best position is, let alone his role, and he's the captain.</p> <p>Moyes, though, is more concerned about the role of the referee today. His not-so-subtle nod, wink and raised eyebrow to Andre Marriner before the game concerned whether or not Luis Suarez will remain on his feet today after Jack Rodwell was sent off in last season's fixture, supposedly for bringing the striker down. In a tie which has seen 20 red cards \u2013 the most in any fixture in the Premier League years \u2013 the referee will always be an issue, but perhaps Moyes has a more legitimate fear: eight of the last 10 reds have gone to his side. Any more today and he'll have grounds to believe there's something in the hoodoo theory after all.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>1.08pm: Interesting that Rodgers is fielding Jones and not Reina in the Liverpool goal. Is this the start of a plot to remove the Spaniard from the Liverpool side after a shaky start to the season? Jones has done well of late but, with Fellaini in the Everton side, will he able to deal with the aerial threat? All this and more answered over the coming 90 minutes. Possibly.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>1.15pm: Rodgers says Reina is not 100% - not sure whether he's talking about his fitness or his ability.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.26pm: The teams are trundling down the tunnel and onto the pitch. Suarez is still on his feet.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep:</strong> With a swell of noise from the crowd, Andre Marriner gets the game underway. The 187th league meeting between the two sides begins with a long ball to Fellaini, nodded down to Jelavic, who crosses to Naismith. Liverpool forced to concede an early corner.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Liverpool clear the corner, and Enrique breaks. He hares down the other end and, with Sterling clear and screaming for a through ball, he hammers it miles past him. Sterling does his nut.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Suso finds Enrique, who knocks it down for Suarez. An Everton touch knocks the ball behind for a corner. Liverpool do nothing with it, so are fairly pleased when Everton concede another immediately. Gerrard's cross goes over everyone and is cleared to Sahin, who sweeps the ball up, into the area and out again into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> This is the proverbial end-to-end stuff. Coleman and Feillaini combine up the right wing for Everton, before Enrique clears and sends Suarez away and into the box at the other end. Howard gets his mitts on the ball and then Naismith tries to play Jelavic into the Liverpool box. And we're still just five minutes in.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Jose Enrique has been everywhere thus far, perhaps proving a point to Brendan Rodgers that he's worth playing a bit more often. But, having gone piling up the left wing he's nearly caught out of position as Coleman tries to play the ball in over his head for Naismith.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Mirallas collects the ball on the halfway line, looks up for a second, then goes on a mazy dribble through the entire Liverpool defence. His shot is turned over by a Liverpool foot and Everton can do nothing from two subsequent corners. Still, lovely stuff from Mirallas.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Suarez darts into the box but is offside. On hearing the ref's whistle, Sterling blooters the ball quite hard into his striker, which has cheered him up no end.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Suarez, his every touch booed, sweeps a lovely-looking ball from the centre circle into the box. Only problem was that Sterling was zipping about up the wing, and not the box.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Everton 0-1 Liverpool (Suarez, 14min):</strong>Suso plays a lovely ball into Enrique in the box. He lashes a cross over and and Sterling goes flying under an Everton challenge. Could have been a penalty but the ball breaks to Suarez who hammers home off Leighton Baines.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Suarez celebrated his goal by running over to the Everton box and throwing himself to the ground in front of David Moyes, which has gone down well with the swivel-eyed Scot after his comments about diving pre-match.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> \"You have to say Everton have had it coming,\" emails Chris Nemeh. \"With the exception of that run by Mirallas they've been playing scared.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Sterling goes whizzing through the centre of the park and then collapses on the ground. Osman gets a yellow card but any contact looked very, very minimal. Strange one, as Andre Marriner has been keen to keep his cards in his pocket so far.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>GOAL Everton 0-2 Liverpool (Suarez, 19min):</strong> From the subsequent free-kick, Gerrard sweeps a majestic ball high and into the box. Suarez just uses the pace of the ball to angle it into the net. What a ball from Gerrard!</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Everton 1-2 Liverpool (Osman 21min):</strong> Everton strike straight back! Jelavic nods the ball down to Feillaini and he smacks a shot just wide of Jones's post. It's deflected behind for a corner, which Jones punches nervously clear. Osman latches onto it and, on the half volley, smashes the ball through the box and into the bottom corner.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Osman looked like he enjoyed that one, just stopping short of running up to Andre Marriner and yelping \"That one was for that slightly harsh yellow card Mr Marriner!\" Everton appear galvanised by it too and Mirallas attacks up the left. A raking cross comes off Skrtel for a corner - a vital touch as Fellaini was in behind him and lurking.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Jones comes for a cross from Baines and drops the ball. Marriner adjudges that Distin has fouled him, but again it looked harsh. Shaky stuff from the Liverpool keeper.Up the other end, Suarez finds himself in between the Everton centre backs and he fizzes a shot wide of Howard's left hand post.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Mirallas causes havoc again on the left, pushing the ball forward to Jelavic. He passes to Fellaini in the box and the big Belgian can't sort his feet out in time to capitalise on an excellent chance.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Sterling catches Baines on the wing and earns a yellow. He mistimed it, but Baines made the most of that. The great roar of the crowd probably had something to do with it. I suppose that evens out the Osman yellow.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Mirallas flips a pass over the top from just left of centre. It's got too much on it for Fellaini though. The left winger then wraps a leg around Joe Allan which has the Liverpool midfielder howling at him, and the referee urging him to calm down.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Sterling deliberately trips Leighton Baines after failing to latch onto a through ball. He's very, very lucky not to get another yellow card. Gerrard comes over, chats to Andre Marriner, and sends the winger to the operate on the other side of the pitch. That could easily have been a red then.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> \"Do you think the referee knows the rules?\" asks Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Everton 2-2 Liverpool (Naismith, 34min):</strong> Mirallas crosses into the box but it hits Fellaini. He takes the ball to the byline in the box and hammers another cross back across the goal. Naismith is there to bundle home his first goal for Everton.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Everton are buzzing and have been ever since Osman's yellow card. However, they don't look completely solid at the back and just before that strike Sahin and Suarez had combined cleverly to fashion half a chance. Not sure if Suarez's first goal will be a Baines own goal or given to the striker. If it's the latter, I wouldn't bet against another hat-trick today.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Mirallas again skips past a host of challenges as he flies into the box from the left wing. He scythes a shot at goal and Jones sends out an instinctive hand to deflect it wide.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> \"We really miss Lucas - easily our best player for the past few years,\" emails James Debens. \"A midfield three of Lucas, Sahin and Allen will be quite something. Now to get Theo Walcott as our centre forward ...\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Mirallas is caught by Suarez deep into the Everton half prompting a young wag in the crowd to wave a red card at Andre Marriner as Baines hangs the free kick over and into the box. The linesman flags for something or other and Liverpool clear from a freekick.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> \"Re. Gary Naylor's question,\" emails Patrick Finch. \"Yes, obviously.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> That's a lovely turn from Mirallas. Osman rolled the ball into the box and the left winger simply spun on the spot, doing the entire defence while he was at it, and getting a shooting chance. He earns a corner, from which Distin's header is cleared behind. Liverpool scramble it clear to Coleman who - a mile out - whacks a half volley just over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>IRONY NEWS, WITH PHIL NEVILLE:</strong> After all of David Moyes's talk pre-game about diving, it's Everton's Phil Neville who gets a yellow card for going down under the minimal attentions of Daniel Agger just outside the Liverpool box. <strong>/IRONY NEWS</strong></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep:</strong> That's half-time and Brendan Rodgers will be a relieved man. After going two goals up, Liverpool have been mauled by Everton for much of the second half. Should be quite the team talk coming, and no mistake.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails:</strong> SB Tang has sent this email three times. So to prevent him getting RSI by sending it again, here it is: \"In answer to the valid question you posed earlier about Gerrard's position, it looks like he's sitting deeper alongside Joe Allen, with Sahin pushing forward into the space vacated by Suarez who's drifting around like a false nine. Which is interesting given that Sahin was deployed primarily as a regista at Dortmund the season before last when they won the league and he was crowned player of the season.\" Alright now SB?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lucas the saviour?:</strong> \"All this pining for Lucas is an indicator of how far Liverpool have fallen,\" says Samuel Biss. \"Terrible for the first few seasons, one decent year in a poor team and now falsely revered by the misty eyed. They weren't missing him when Alonso and Mascherano were around!\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Marvelous Mirallas:</strong> \"Mirallas the best player on the pitch so far?\" asks Chris Nemeh. \"Everton better hope that knock isn't too serious as he looks like their only player that can go create something out of nothing. They need his spark for when things get stagnant.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>GOAL-gate:</strong> Looking at some of the replays at half-time, the first Suarez goal will go down as a Baines own goal. The striker's shot was going wide until it hit Baines and went in. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool were lucky to get the free-kick that led to the second goal. Osman barely touched Sterling and it took the winger a little while to hit the deck thereafter. A soft one.</p> <p>Following that, the throw-in that led to Everton's second goal should have gone to Liverpool and not the home side. Can't imagine any of these things will be talking points after the game, what with both sets of fans not being all that bothered about this one.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>MBM idiocy:</strong> \"... Liverpool have been mauled by Everton for much of the second half?\" emails Frankie Taggart. \"Does Mystic Tom have information to which the rest of us aren't party? Was this game made earlier by Jamie Oliver, or a Blue Peter presenter?\" You'll never believe what's about to happen Frankie. It'll blow your mind.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Lucas:</strong> \"Samuel Biss is forgetting how poor Alonso was in 2007-8 and how mercenary Mascherano is,\" replies James Debens. \"Look at the stats and listen to the people who actually go to Anfield each game (not me - I work weekends).\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Peep peep:</strong> Here comes the second half. Two substitutions for Liverpool: Jonjo Shelvey is on for Suso and Coates is on for Sahin. For Everton Gueye is on for Mirallas who got a knock at the end of the first half.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Shelvey flips the ball right Wisdom and he pings a low cross into the box. Jagielka just catches the ball and that takes it past Suarez who was looking to clatter it home.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Sterling is playing off Suarez now as Liverpool go to a 4-4-1-1. It nearly pays off immediately. Enrique plays the forward into the box and he's one-on-one with Jones. But he attempts to chip the keeper and completely mis-hits it. Suarez, who was bellowing at him for a square ball, has just gone utterly ballistic at Sterling. Meanwhile: \"I think Liverpool need a cool head in the middle of the pitch,\" emails Nick Smith. \"Enter Jonjo ...\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Jelavic (I think) shoots and Jones deflects it into Baines's path. He crosses and is caught, prompting howls for a penalty from the Everton fans. Naismith shoots wide from the cross.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Gerrard goes flying up the middle and attempts to get onto Sterling's through ball. Osman just gets his studs to the ball to prevent a shooting chance.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Jelavic tries to fashion a crossing chance on the right wing. He settles for a throw in. Liverpool get it clear and, as with much of the game for the last few minutes, the ball spends most of the time whizzing from one end of the pitch to the other. Suarez eventually forces a chance and drives into the box from the right wing. He hammers the ball at goal but Jagielka blocks. \"Lucas Leiva is like Jack Wilshire and, to a lesser extent, Tom Cleverly: the less he plays, the better he gets,\" emails Rob Moline.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Liverpool play a big ball over the top and Sterling turns to latch onto it. Jagielka knows he's not going to match him for pace and pulls him down. He gets a yellow - largely because Marriner was a long way off the action - when he might have got a red for denying a goal-scoring chance. From the free-kick, a long way out, Gerrard stings Howard's palms with a skidding scorcher.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Everton build now. Baines sends over two crosses, which Liverpool cope with. Next, Coleman swings one over. He finds Fellaini but his header is just wide.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Coleman and Fellaini play a fantastic one-two on the edge of the box and the Irishman goes whizzing into the box. His shot-cross is bundled clear. Osman then fires a shot at goal too. Everton are missing Mirallas but not disastrously so.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Coates fouls Baines on the left, and the left-back hits a good cross into the box from the free-kick. Jelavic gets up in front of Fellaini and can't get a good enough connection on the ball.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> That Suarez celebration in full should be atop this report now. It's a cracker. Meanwhile, Baines is lining up another free-kick on the edge of the box. Fellaini again goes up for it but misses. It means it comes to Jelavic faster than he expects and his header goes wide. It was a sensational ball in by Baines.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Fellaini bundles into Daniel Agger and Andre Marriner rewards the Liverpool defender with a yellow card. No one quite knows why. However, Baines can't find another cracking ball to deliver into the box from this free kick.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Jordan Henderson has come on for Wisdom. Meanwhile, here's SB Tang again: \"I wonder what Gerrard thinks about being shunted out to the right? I seem to recall him referring to that as the 'graveyard shift' in his autobiography. That being said, he did enjoy his best goal-scoring season out there in 2005\u201306 \u2026\" Whatever keeps him out of the way, SB, whatever keeps him out of the way.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Luis Suarez stands on Distin's achilles for no good reason, a really spiteful challenge. He gets a yellow, to great cheers from the crowd. He's played well today, but that unnecessary.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> \"How many utterly ridiculous bookings is that so far today? Osman, Sterling and Agger certainly,\" emails Richard South about the Agger card. You could argue Jagielka might have got a red too.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Gueye hangs a cross over and Jelavic goes down under the attentions of Agger. Didn't see it too clearly but didn't look like a penalty. Jelavic's foot was high too. Henderson scurries down the other end with the ball and attempts to chip Howard in goal, without success.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Coleman crosses and Jones gathers as the game begins to gather pace again. Shelvey whizzes up to the Everton box and, with Sterling unmarked, he hits a poor long range shot instead. \"Gerrard actually referred to the left wing as the graveyard shift,\" says Tom Colohue, thus sparing me from having to read said tome. \"Also, he's still in midfield. Sterling is supposedly covering both wings. Sterling hasn't had a good game. He's staying too high. I'd have rather seen Suso stay on and cover the same positions.\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Fellaini and Osman combine to send Sterling sprawling. Their attentions draw the justified ire of Gerrard, who ambles over to the referee and has a right old go at him about it all. Gerrard, who is on the right wing again now, then tries to bend the ball around the back of the defence for Suarez. And fails. Fellaini then follows things up by kicking Joe Allan while he's on the ground. The big Belgian is riled up right now.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Fellaini, so physical just now, has gone down fairly easily under the attentions of Coates. Neville takes the free kick quickly and Naismith latches onto the ball and into the box. However, it's too quick for Marriner who orders that he retakes it. He does so and Everton work the ball to Baines. He shoots and the ball is deflected behind for a corner which comes to naught.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Henderson pulls the ball back to Gerrard on the edge of the box. He absolutely clatters a shot at the bottom corner. Phil Jagielka puts in a fantastic block, with Howard beaten. Henderson attempts another long-range effort from the corner but doesn't catch it right.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Suarez then makes himself a great chance. With nothing on and no-one around him, he scampered into the box from the right wing. His shot is blocked by Baines. Great work from the striker though. Before the corner is taken, he's forced to remove something from the pitch that has been thrown at from the stands.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Sterling blooters a rotten effort over after making himself half a yard. Everton replace Naismith with Oviedo.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Coleman is the latest to go into the referees book after tugging at Sterling's shirt. The winger then goes past Jagielka and is fouled again. This time Marriner doesn't give it, which is fortunate for the Everton man since he's already been booked.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Graveyard shift-gate with SB Tang:</strong> \"Page 188 of Gerrard: My Autobiography (Bantam ed, 2007): I was left fighting with Danny Murphy and David Thompson for right midfield. Danny, Thommo and I called it the 'graveyard shift'.\" This is a tedious debate, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Suarez attempts to latch onto a long ball but, in turning, he is caught by Distin. A long range free-kick follows, arcing into the box. He hits it too far, unfortunately, and the ball goes out for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Just feels as if the fight has gone out of this. Both sides seem to be settling for the draw. There are four minutes of extra time, so there's still time ...</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>90min +1:</strong> Everton make a valiant attempt to get the ball into the box, via Gueye. Baines then attempts the same from the other side of the pitch. The problem being that there was no-one in the middle to latch onto the ball.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>DISALLOWED GOAL!</strong> Osman thumps into Gerrard just inside the Everton half. All the Liverpool big men go lumbering forward and Gerrard hoofs the ball into the box. Coates heads the ball down to Suarez who hammers it into into the roof of the net. He goes off on a victory lap, only to see the linesman's flag is up.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>PEEP PEEP:</strong> Everton attempt to launch a counter attack but Liverpool scramble it away. Then Sterling slips a neat ball into Suarez again but he can't get another shot on target. It appears the goal was ruled out for offside but Suarez looked level. Perhaps Coates was adjudged to have clambered on an Everton defender in knocking the ball down for Suarez. Finally, the ref blows the whistle and is surrounded by grumpy Liverpool players keen for his thoughts on why they haven't won.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>That's that then.</strong> The first half was a cracker, really exciting stuff from both teams. It was pretty hard for the second half to live up to it. Everton were probably slightly the better side and were certainly hampered by the fact Mirallas had to go off at half-time. Had he stayed on, it might have been different. A quick office discussion reveals that we think the late Liverpool goal was disallowed because Coates clambered on an Everton defender. Unlucky perhaps. If it was disallowed for offside, then the goal should have stood as Suarez was clearly onside. </p> <p>Thanks for all your emails - many of which were excellent.

In addition, English public law states that one of the roles of the state is to secure human rights.</p> <p>\"The Council of Europe states, and the UK agreed in the Brighton declaration, that the primary responsibility for human rights falls upon member states.</p> <p>\"What this case discloses is that there is a systemic failure in the UK, a structural fault, which needs to be fixed.</p> <p>\"When the Council of Europe identifies this situation in a member state it identifies the problem and advises what action needs to be taken to remedy the breach. In this case it is to amend section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 to allow convicted prisoners to vote. My case shows that section 3 is not compatible with article 3 of the ECHR's first protocol.</p> <p>\"So either the UK complies or withdraws from the Council of Europe and the ECHR.\"</p> <p>The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, speaking about the row for the first time, took a cautious approach, saying: \"I have to be very careful in my role as justice secretary and lord chancellor. The reality is that we are signed up to the European convention on human rights. We are signed up to the European court of human rights. If, therefore, we choose to disagree with a ruling from that court, we have to understand that we are taking a significant step outside that international commitment.\"</p> <p>Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he added: \"There are precedents from other European countries of them saying 'no, we don't agree with you' to the European court of human rights, but of course the counter-argument is that if we send a message that says we will stand up to the court, where does that leave countries in other parts of Europe that perhaps have less good human rights records than we do, where there are really quite serious issues about the right to a trial?\"</p> <p>Grieve, the attorney general, said in a lengthy speech last week that he disagreed with the ECHR judgment in the prisoner case, and acknowledged that the British parliament was sovereign in the matter.</p> <p>But he cautioned: \"Observing its judgments is an international legal obligation arising by treaty \u2026 it is possible for parliament to take no action on the judgment, although that would leave the government in breach of the treaty and liable to criticism and sanctions from the Council of Europe by its fellow signatories and to damages awarded by the court.</p> <p>\"Some have also argued that the solution for the UK in view of these problems is to withdraw from the convention altogether on the grounds that it is an undesirable and unnecessary fetter of national sovereignty in decision-making. I disagree. Withdrawal would result in reputational damage.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week the Department for Education has announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/26/michael-gove-tests-trainee-teachers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">a shakeup of teacher training</a>, applying what future generations will no doubt refer to as the \"Gove principle\", whereby any perceived issue can be solved by making the exams more difficult. Not content with belittling the effort of thousands of students by announcing how worthless their GCSEs were just days after the grades were released, it has now been announced that teachers too have not been tested thoroughly enough and a more \"robust\" system will be brought in to compensate for the low standards of literacy and numeracy displayed by hapless educators.</p> <p>While there are significant issues with the current selection process for aspiring teachers, it seems there are one or two glaring omissions in the logic that justifies spending limited resources on developing a new testing system. Fifteen years of education resulting in a degree should really imply a certain standard of literacy and numeracy, and if it doesn't perhaps our university system requires some scrutiny. I'm sure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a> will get round to suggesting tougher degrees at some point in the future, perhaps with lower grade boundaries for those from disadvantaged backgrounds to encourage social mobility.</p> <p>It is a universal truth that we lose the skills we don't use regularly, and GCSE maths is no exception. The new tests will take place before an applicant is accepted on to teacher training and are expected to increase in difficulty until they represent a B grade at GCSE. Woe betide any potential PE teacher or dance instructor who has not seen a maths paper in five years, who cannot tell a histogram from a heptagon, or a vector from a vulgar fraction. That's not to say that the aforementioned PE teachers lack the ability to pass these tests. Currently those training to be teachers are able to get support from fellow students in order to help them pass the English, maths and ICT exams. Trainee teachers in these subjects benefit by developing their professional skills by assisting their peers before they are let loose in a classroom for the first time and the non-specialists get a chance to relearn those skills they have forgotten.</p> <p>In recent years a very dangerous idea seems to have been accepted by the decision-makers around the education system that the best teachers are the best qualified teachers, leading to a sliding scale of funding that financially disadvantages those without high-class degrees from the classroom. The reality is very different. A good teacher has to be an exceptional communicator, with patience, common sense, focus, more than a little belligerence and vast reserves of tolerance and empathy. Many prospective teachers simply do not possess these qualities and yet are accepted on to teacher training and even passed despite every indication that they do not have what it takes. The most fantastic academic background cannot make up for a lack of these qualities, but a great communicator with a third-class degree has far more than the necessary knowledge to inspire a class of teenagers.</p> <p>Ultimately these new tests are a smokescreen hiding far more significant issues, as Gove has previously made it clear that qualified teacher status is not a requirement to inhabit the classrooms of the increasing numbers of academies and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/free-schools?INTCMP=SRCH&amp;INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">free schools</a>. How he expects his new tougher teacher tests to enhance our education system while he is responsible for creating more opportunities for unqualified teachers to educate our children is a question I would love to know the answer to.</p>",
  "<p>Apple will sell boatloads of the iPad mini, even though the just-announced tablet looks somewhat overpriced and under-powered. There are lots of reasons, but one in particular seems under-appreciated by competitors in the mobile device market: loyalty.</p> <p>I'm not talking here about customer loyalty, a commodity that Apple commands more of than any other tech company, often to the point of customers becoming irrational in their ardor for all things Apple. Rather, this is about the company's loyalty to its customers.</p> <p>The mobile hardware market has become a race to sell the latest and (sometimes) greatest gear. Part of this is a natural effect of the industry's high-velocity cycle of technology improvements, and its relative youth; the early days of any marketplace always see massive, frenetic change, and when you couple that with Moore's Law and its corollaries, you get relatively short-term obsolescence on an epic scale.</p> <p>But another part of the rapid obsolescence we're seeing in this particular market has as much to do with corporate decisions as any technological innovation. The mobile industry \u2013 device makers and carriers \u2013 are gaming the system in distinctly customer-unfriendly ways. This is especially true in the Android ecosystem, where disloyalty to customers is a standard business practice \u2013 and, thereby, one of Apple's competitive advantages.</p> <p>How standard a practice? I've now been orphaned twice by the Android crowd. The first time was an expensive Samsung tablet, sold by T-Mobile, that wasn't updated even though the same tablet did get updates for the wi-fi version and versions sold by other carriers. That experience made me view Samsung devices and T-Mobile's network as a last resort in my shopping.</p> <p>The second time was just a couple of weeks ago, when Motorola \u2013 owned by Google, creator of the Android operating system \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.autoomobile.com/news/motorola-ics-update-droid-razr/1004703/\">reneged on a public commitment to update my current phone model to the latest OS</a>. The company has offered the customers it stiffed a $100 discount on a new phone. No thanks. Why would I trust Motorola in the future after this experience? I won't take the chance.</p> <p>More broadly, I've lost faith in Google's promises regarding Android. The company has repeatedly promised to bring some order to the Android market, including a <a href=\"http://androidandme.com/2011/05/news/google-partners-with-manufacturers-and-carriers-to-speed-up-android-updates/\">now-laughable vow some 18 months ago</a> to get hardware makers to update the operating systems in a reasonable amount of time after the software is released. The reality is that most Android device makers and carriers are doing little or nothing to keep the operating systems up-to-date, visibly and insultingly inviting customers to upgrade the operating systems and other software by purchasing new hardware.</p> <p>Imagine if Macs and Windows computers couldn't get the latest updates and operating systems and that you had to buy <em>a new machine</em> each time. This has more implications than stiffing customers on usability upgrades. It's actually dangerous when vital security fixes don't make it to devices.</p> <p>The device makers and carriers have a generic excuse: it's complicated. This is true, but it's complicated because they've designed it to be so. Among other things, the Android manufacturers put ridiculous proprietary software layers on top of Android, gumming up the user experience and requiring more testing when updating the OS.</p> <p>By comparison with the Android hardware makers, Apple is a paragon of treating buyers right. I won't move to iOS for other reasons \u2013 namely, Apple's refusal to allow customers to use their devices as they wish, and the much greater choice I get with Android \u2013 but one thing you can count on when it updates an OS is that it will work on recent devices, period.</p> <p>Older Apple devices often won't get the full feature set of the newest software, to be sure. And sometimes Apple, too, seems to be \"encouraging\" customers to buy new phones and tablets. Still, the company's support for already-purchased devices is vastly better than almost all the Android crowd. (Apple's iPhone 5 hardware, with a new proprietary connector, requires customers to buy a $29 adapter and/or new peripheral hardware \u2013 a distinctly nasty move that the acolytes have, with their usual Apple-is-my-Daddy fervor, already forgiven.)</p> <p>Google itself is branding the \"Nexus\" line of hardware, made by manufacturers like Asus (Nexus7 tablet) and Samsung (Galaxy Nexus phone), with a promise \u2013 hmm, where have we heard this before? \u2013 to keep those devices updated to the absolute latest operating systems and tweaks. You guessed it: the <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/verizon-and-sprint-kill-the-google-nexus-experience-stick-with-gsm-model-7000003176/\">carriers have broken the promise anyway</a>, and appear to be daring Google to do something about it. My Nexus 7-inch tablet, which works only with wi-fi, is getting updates directly from Google. When Apple rolls out an update, it works across iPhones and iPads no matter which carrier the customer has chosen. Why can't Google ensure this?</p> <p>Microsoft's latest mobile OS, and the devices that will run it, seem likely to take a more Apple-like approach. But for customers, that will mean taking the bad \u2013 they control your device, not you \u2013 with the good.</p> <p>For Android customers who are willing to take some time and a small risk of \"bricking\" their devices (though it's almost always possible to bring them back to life), there's a fix. They can upgrade themselves by loading software created by the Android hacking community for this purpose. The brilliant <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/\">XDA Developers website</a> is a treasure trove of helpful information and links to fixes. I'll be doing this soon with my Motorola phone.</p> <p>I shouldn't have to do this: I shouldn't have to go to such lengths to avoid Google/Motorola's decision to make my phone \u2013 full of modern hardware \u2013 obsolete so fast. There are a few things the Android community \u2013 Google, in particular \u2013 should be learning from Apple, and that's one of them.</p>",
  "<p>One rainy day in the early 1950s, a very young Martin Scorsese was watching a butchered version of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036112/\" title=\"\">The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</a> on his black-and-white TV. Colonel Blimp, which deals with a lifelong friendship between Clive Candy, a British soldier sporting an upper lip of almost unbelievable stiffness, and his top-hole German counterpart, Theodore Kretschmar-Schuldorff, first saw the light of day in 1943. This was not the best time to be releasing a film with a sympathetic German character.</p> <p>The film Scorsese saw was not the film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-powell\" title=\"\">Michael Powell</a> had shot, nor the film his collaborator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/26/2\" title=\"\">Emeric Pressburger</a> had written. (For years, the pair worked under the name \"The Archers\", a partnership that produced such immortal films as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/nov/08/my-favourite-film-red-shoes\" title=\"\">The Red Shoes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2005/aug/05/3\" title=\"\">Black Narcissus</a>.) Blimp originally ran at 163 minutes; the version Scorsese saw had been hacked down to 90. With scenes presented out of order, huge chunks of plot missing, and no possibility of marvelling at its radiant Technicolor cinematography, Scorsese was nonetheless beguiled. Eleven or 12 at the time, he could not have known that in 1943 a lot of Brits would have&#xa0;found the film unusual, if not downright strange, and Candy a bit priggish, blustery, annoying. He could&#xa0;not have known that Winston Churchill despised the film and ensured its failure at the box office. None of this mattered.</p> <p>\"My reaction to the film was totally outside the context in which it was made,\" Scorsese says, seated in a dainty little guest house on the Long Island estate where he is currently shooting scenes for his new film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/\" title=\"\">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>. \"It was a little puzzling, because it's a very different culture from mine \u2013 southern Italian, Sicilian. It took me years to understand Candy's behaviour. I was only familiar with an England I had seen by watching films that extolled the empire.\"</p> <p>Scorsese would grow up to use shots borrowed from the Powell/Pressburger films, to make at least one film that pays direct homage (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bENHsyGPg\" title=\"\">The Age of Innocence</a>). He became close friends with Powell, introduced him to his future wife (<a href=\"http://www.fastcocreate.com/1679964/what-makes-a-great-edit-scorseses-legendary-editor-thelma-schoonmaker-dissects-hugo-via-good\" title=\"\">Thelma Schoonmaker</a>, Scorsese's longtime editor), and attended his memorial service in the Cotswold village of Avening. Now he has spent the last three years restoring Colonel Blimp to its original condition, and on this particular afternoon has no interest in discussing anything else. Scorsese is best known for such dark, violent films as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo5jJpHtI1Y\" title=\"\">Goodfellas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps0PeEHHePM\" title=\"\">Raging Bull</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/\" title=\"\">The Departed</a>: why, then, so much fuss over an idiosyncratic British film without a single mook, wise guy or&#xa0;<em>consigliere</em>?</p> <p>\"The story transcends the culture which produced it,\" the director explains in an amused tone, pointing out that British films were part of every American's childhood back in the 50s. \"It is very elegantly made. It would be great if audiences could experience the film the way it was made, the way the camera moves, the way it was supposed to be seen. But for me the most important thing is the humanity of the&#xa0;film, the relationship between the characters. The whole story has an eloquent sadness to it.\"</p> <p>Colonel Blimp is a paean to a particular idea of Britain, one that was already going out of fashion in 1943. A romantic comedy filled with preposterous facial hair and ridiculous hats, it is also a film with a serious, moral undercurrent. Blimp extols the virtues of good sportsmanship and fair play, virtues that were always more popular with the upper classes, because the lower classes had little time to play, and even less time to be sporting. In it, Clive and Theo slice up one another's faces during a youthful duel in Berlin. The German winds up with a scar on his forehead; Candy's wound is sustained on his stiff upper lip, henceforth covered by a prodigious moustache that gets progressively sillier. Candy, played with staggering aplomb by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CL8mh_4-0s\" title=\"\">Roger Livesey</a>, is such a swell chap he lets his German rival (Anton Walbrook) marry the girl of his dreams (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/oct/18/obituaries.news\" title=\"\">Deborah Kerr</a>) while he is still on the mend. \"She wants him to say that he loves her, but he can't,\" Scorsese explains. \"It wouldn't be sporting. It would violate his sense of fair play. It's like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHkKbTkRp_k\" title=\"\">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a> \u2013 the villain kills eight people, but he's a perfect gent about it.\"</p> <p>Candy spends the rest of the film ruing the one that got away. He marries a nurse who looks exactly like her (she, too, is played by Kerr) and during the second world war secures the services of a driver who also bears a striking resemblance (Kerr, just 21 at the time, plays her, too.) Powell was having an affair with the actress at the time, even though Kerr had warned him that she would ditch him if she got a call from Hollywood \u2013 which she did. \"He never got over her,\" Scorsese says. \"He loved her, but he couldn't have her.\" So Powell, obsessed with the real-life Kerr, 16 years his junior, made a film about a man who is obsessed with girls who look like the youthful Kerr \u2013 even as the man, steadily getting balder and tubbier, enters his dotage. It is by no means inconceivable that both Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen fell under the spell of this film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rEdBvQONtEY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rEdBvQONtEY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEdBvQONtEY\"><br>Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>As Europe enters the final stages of the suicidal phase that began in 1914, Candy becomes convinced that if an Englishman must resort to the same tactics as his enemy to defeat him, then he is just as bad as his enemy. (This may be Powell and Pressburger's not-so-subtle critique of RAF civilian bombing.) By the end of the film, Candy has lost touch with reality. It is Theo, now an exile in London, who must explain to his friend that if you refuse to use the same tactics as the Nazis, you have no chance of defeating them. Theo knows whereof he speaks; both his sons are Nazis. \"Candy doesn't&#xa0;understand that decent, good sportsmanship does not translate to this war,\" says Scorsese. \"He doesn't understand that business as usual is out of the question.\"</p> <p>1943 was an odd moment to release the film, with the war still going full blast; the last thing Churchill (who may have interpreted Candy as a personal caricature) wanted was a film poking fun at the British government, the British diplomatic corps and the British Army. Were Powell and Pressburger going out of their way to irk the powers-that-be? \"I&#xa0;think they were trying to be provocative,\" Scorsese says. \"Audacity, <em>toujours l'audace</em> was their philosophy.\" And Churchill? \"Powell never met Churchill, to my knowledge, but Pressburger was present at a screening for Churchill and the war cabinet. He remembered the sound of the seats lifting up \u2013 bang! bang! bang! \u2013 as they walked out of the room.\"</p> <p>The film was released in Britain but banned from export until after the war; only later did it develop the cult status it now enjoys. The film underwent a partial restoration in the early 1980s; this time, Scorsese has finished the job by working from the original camera negatives. What kind of damage can a film sustain over the years? \"Mould damage, shrinkage,\" he says. \"And 20 minutes in the middle of the film are gone. We made up the missing 20 minutes from&#xa0;the separation masters [a form of&#xa0;copy], not the original camera negatives.\"</p> <p>Does he worry that his own films might one day require such major salvage? \"I have it in my contract that they have to make separation masters,\" he says. \"The studios have started taking better care of their property in the last 20 years. But it's not altruistic; it's protecting their assets. A lot of films made before 1990 are in serious trouble. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/oct/10/steven-spielberg-martin-scorsese-celluloid\" title=\"\">Cinema is very fragile</a>.\" Sitting in this lovely Oyster Bay guest house, extolling the glories of Colonel Blimp, Scorsese seems to have forgotten that he is a famous director working on a new film of his own. \"Cinema has meant so much to so many people who did not have a culturally fulfilling childhood,\" he continues, \"so restoring a film like that is rewarding work. A story like Colonel Blimp could not work as a book or a play; it can only work as a film. Cinema began as a sideshow attraction and developed into a reputable art form. I hate to see films fade away.\"</p> <p>In 1961, Pressburger wrote a novel called Killing a Mouse on Sunday, which was made into a 1964 film called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057879/\" title=\"\">Behold a Pale Horse</a>. The film stars a miscast Gregory Peck as a guerilla who fought on the losing side during the Spanish civil war and is now returning home to visit his dying mother; it was banned in Spain and flopped in the US, in part because Americans had already forgotten the Spanish civil war. In&#xa0;Colonel Blimp, first world war conscripts do not remember the Boer war, fought just a decade earlier. Is Scorsese concerned that a younger generation might no longer know enough about the second world war to&#xa0;appreciate the film?</p> <p>\"Cinema is a great way to explain the past,\" he says, hopefully. \"My daughter is 13, and her introduction to the second world war has to start soon. Colonel Blimp, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9v5H0IhODg\" title=\"\">A Matter of Life and Death</a>, The Red Shoes \u2013 these are all great films to help explain the past. As long as the story is good, somehow it might resonate with young people.\" It&#xa0;was the humanity of Powell and Pressburger's characters that impressed him as a child, and still does: characters such as Candy are bigger and more enduring than the society that produced them. \"When you get older, there's less time to spend,\" adds Scorsese. \"And I want to spend more of it with these films.\"</p> <p>\u2022 A restoration edition of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp is released by ITV Studios Home Entertainment and out now on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Colonel-Blimp-Special-Restoration/dp/B0084Z5B7 0/ref=\" sr_1_5?s=\"dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349435599&amp;sr=1-5&quot;&quot;\">DVD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Death-Colonel-Blimp-Restoration-Blu-ray/dp/B009HV995 K/ref=\" sr_1_3?s=\"dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351503462&amp;sr=1-3&quot;&quot;\">Blu-ray</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Death-Colonel-Blimp-Restoration/dp/B0084Z5BYI/r ef=\" sr_1_2?s=\"dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351503462&amp;sr=1-2&quot;&quot;\">Steelbook</a></p>",
  "<p>The government should be reluctant to bring in new laws to regulate newspapers following the publication of the Leveson inquiry, the communities secretary Eric Pickles, has said.</p> <p>Pickles said the press was working towards a way of offering proper recourse for those with legitimate complaints, saying the right of newspapers to expose corruption must be protected. He added that ministers must be very careful about introducing statutory regulation if Lord Justice Leveson recommends a new independent watchdog to monitor the press.</p> <p>His remarks were taken as the clearest view yet of his Conservative cabinet colleagues' attitude to the Leveson inquiry.</p> <p>They came on the day it was reported that David Cameron was said to have urged Tory cabinet colleagues at a private meeting last Thursday not to say anything that might be taken as pre-empting the government's response to the Leveson inquiry due to report next month.</p> <p>In a lengthy Lords debate last Thursday on press regulation, the government spokesman worked hard to be even-handed and did not rule out a form of statutory underpinning as a stopgap.</p> <p>The rightwing media are already campaigning hard to oppose any statutory intervention, saying it would represent an unacceptable interference in press freedom.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, said on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that there had to be some kind of statutory underpinning. Her view that the press has failed to reform itself is broadly in line with that of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Pickles said: \"It is massively important to ensure we have freedom of press in this country. Some of the characteristics of the British press \u2013 it is good at exposing corruption and it is good at going to places where other press wouldn't.</p> <p>\"I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said that for a free society to operate, then the 'river of a free press had to flow without restriction'.</p> <p>\"I think, given that the press are looking towards finding ways, the end result of offering a good way that people who have a legitimate complaint can find recourse, then that is right.</p> <p>We should be very, very, very reluctant to take on legislation. It's a balance and my view is that we should always balance in favour of a free press.\"</p> <p>Lord Black, the peer who represents the views of the newspaper industry, told peers last week it would be possible to bring in a new, tighter form of self-regulation within three months, but statutory legislation would take three years, and might face a legal challenge.</p> <p>A spokesman for Hacked Off said the newspaper industry could bring in its voluntary reforms without waiting for the Leveson inquiry if they believed they were the right reforms to introduce.</p>",

  "<p>I did psychology at Birmingham University, but I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. My final year project was on dyslexia and I really enjoyed the time I spent in classrooms working on this but at that point I didn't think of teaching. When I left university I spent seven years working at John Lewis partnership. I spent much of my time there writing the partners' newsletter. My managing director was a lovely chap who realised I wasn't doing what I wanted to and he helped me get a job at the Surrey Advertiser and later I went to work in copywriting for a recruitment advertiser in London.</p> <p>So I had this writing background, but started to think I wanted to do something more worthwhile. At the end of the day, any advertising is peddling other people's wishes and eventually this started wearing a bit thin, then a bit thinner.</p> <p>By my late 30s it was starting to niggle a lot. My older son had started primary school and I remember thinking where are all the blokes? There were no male teachers at his school. It was then I had my first eureka moment. I was cycling to the station for my commute into London and I suddenly realised I wanted to be a primary school teacher.</p> <p>I believed, and I was right about this, that you can show a lot of creativity as a teacher. So I went part time in my advertising job and did work experience at my local primary school. I knew my colleagues at the agency were expecting to see me looking shell shocked when I started but instead I started looking forward to my voluntary days more than my professional days.</p> <p>I applied for GTP at my local school. It was a hard year, studying by night and teaching by day. And then I got a job at <a href=\"http://www.gusford.suffolk.sch.uk/\">Gusford Primary school</a> in Ipswich. It was fantastically nerve wracking to be responsible for a whole class at first. But I had a fantastic mentor for the first year. You're always learning as a teacher \u2013 and really what you learn in your training just scratches the surface. So much of what you learn is on the job, so having someone with experience, patience and understanding as a mentor was invaluable.</p> <p>I taught year 4 for two years and then moved to year 6. That's a nutty year with Sats, transition to secondary school, beginning of adolescence - but the year 6s are still very much kids, not too stroppy not too self conscious and they can take a bit more of a joke than younger pupils - which I love.</p> <p>I wanted to take a light hearted approach to my teaching because I think children retain more when they are smiley and happy, so I prefer to teach with fun and humour. It comes quite naturally to me as I'm six foot two and forever knocking over bins and tiny chairs. When I was teaching in year 4 I was forever treading on the children themselves; at least year 6 are bigger targets.</p> <p>I taught year 6 for three and bit years and it was a real wrench to pull back to part time and not have my own class. But I had such an urge to write. It was the writing I did at school that really led to me writing my first children's book. Like many schools, we bought package plays but as we are a three form entry our year group is so large - there were never enough parts for everyone. So I was forever writing new characters and additional plot lines to give everyone a part \u2013 and people started saying they were funnier than the rest of the show.</p> <p>I knew I wanted to write a book and wanted to write one for children. I thought long and hard about taking a break for teaching and I was lucky my wife was happy to work full time so I stopped teaching full time to write a book.</p> <p>I thought a lot about children's brains when I was teaching. It confused me that sometimes I'd teach something to children and they'd totally get it and then a few weeks later we'd come back to it and they'd swear blind they knew nothing about it. Then they'd find it in their brain and say: \"Oh yes I do know this\". I wanted to explore children's amazing brains. I wanted to help children find out how amazing their brains were. I've experimented with all sorts of initiatives and brain gyms in my lessons and some worked quite nicely, whether it is just giving their brains a break I don't know, but it works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398416885\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351258953273/Lousy-Thinking-book-003.jpg\" alt=\"Lousy Thinking book\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lousy Thinking book Photograph: Live It Publishing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Live It Publishing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wanted to give a chance to children to stop and think about what's inside their head. Realising I could write a book looking at children's brains through the eyes of head louse who bites into a nerve with a direct link to a child's brain was my second eureka moment. Any thought would be fantastic to someone or something who hasn't yet experienced a brain. I want to make children think: \"Do I exercise my brain or leave it dead?\" So that's what is behind writing my first children's book <a href=\"http://www.lousybooks.com/\">Lousy Thinking</a>.</p> <p>The downside of teaching, the only real one is, it's such a lot of work. I worked in John Lewis and in advertising but I've never worked harder than in teaching. A lot of it is lovely work. Marking can be a delight, you see the lights come on when someone gets something, it's fantastic work but there's such a lot of admin.</p> <p>When I was at secondary school myself, there were no computers, our head had one assistant, but he still had time to teach us English. This could never happen now. The sad thing is what we teach the children hasn't really changed that much. Teachers are always willing embrace and drive the necessary changes and the updates. But to me education should be like steering a barge, with gentle diversions on the way. But as soon as we get a new minister they must grab the tiler, go left then right, crank into the bank. The skipper blames the crew and everyone gets shaken up. It's so frustrating but it shouldn't be this difficult to keep children learning.</p> <p>When I was training, I read about a career changer who left teaching soon after qualifying and he said in industry you'd be sacked if you wasted so much time. In education you have to spend so much time doing extras tasks that seem like a waste of time. No-one wants to be the person who isn't producing these tables and assessing kids every five minutes. You have to paddle on as fast as you can to keep up. In my first four years teaching I had to rewrite either my entire English plans or maths plans each year as they changed so much. I had to write to completely different frameworks which takes hours and hours. I could have spent so much more time improving my lessons if I hadn't had to devote so much time to admin.</p> <p>I found being a full time teacher is actually a very difficult job to do if you have a young family. You start off with the idea that teaching is very child friendly, with a bit of time at the beginning and the end of the day to be with your kids and the same holidays. But I found I didn't stop working. You work in the evenings and at weekends. I think that any education secretary rather than jumping up and down about standards needs to think what you really need to keep, and needs to have a big bonfire of admin, but it seems that doesn't play well at a party conference. Parents still think teaching is cushy, but ask any partner of a teacher if that's true.</p> <p>The children are the best thing. The wonderful sense of achievement when they proclaim they've got it, the beautiful bits of writing you see, when children come back afterwards and tell you they've had the best year with you. And the staff. The teachers at my school are such a resilient, dedicated, good natured, determined bunch and the teaching assistants are inspiring.</p> <p>So I became a teacher to do something worthwhile and memorable. You make a difference. From an egotistical point of view you make an impact of people and they remember you. It does feel good. I might go back to full time teaching but at the moment I teach part time, mainly one to one. I find that deeply satisfying. I've written a book and almost finished a sequel. I should have been able to do it while I was teaching full time, but the lack of spare time made it impossible for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398416886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351172267268/Mike-Davies-003.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Davies\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Davies Photograph: Mike Davies</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Mike Davies teaches part time at <a href=\"http://www.gusford.suffolk.sch.uk/\">Gusford Primary school</a> in Ipswich.

  "<p>Lawyers for Chinese premier Wen Jiabao's family have denied reports of their \"hidden riches\" saying they are untrue, according to Hong Kong media.</p> <p>The New York Times said on Friday that relatives of the premier had controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn, citing detailed analysis of corporate and regulatory records.</p> <p>The Chinese foreign ministry said the story \"blackens China's name and has ulterior motives\". Authorities also blocked the media organisation's Chinese language and main websites and banned microblog searches for its name and a wide variety of terms related to the article.</p> <p>But it is unusual for the family of a senior leader to comment publicly on foreign media reports about them. When Bloomberg ran an article this summer on the wealth of relatives of Xi Jinping, vice president and heir-apparent to the presidency, there was no public response from the family.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1071455/statement-lawyers-premier-wen-jiabaos-family-obtained-sunday-morning-post\">The statement, issued by lawyers from two Chinese firms</a> late on Saturday night and obtained by Hong Kong television, the South China Morning Post and Sing Tao newspaper, said they had been \"entrusted by the family members of Wen Jiabao\" but did not specify which relatives they represent. </p> <p>Telephone calls to the two law firms, Grandall and Jun He law, rang unanswered on Sunday.</p> <p>The statement said: \"The so-called 'hidden riches' of Wen Jiabao's family members in the New York Times' report does not exist.</p> <p>\"Some of Wen Jiabao's family members have not engaged in business activities. Some were engaged in business activities, but they did not carry out any illegal business activity. They do not hold shares of any companies.\"</p> <p>It said that Wen's mother had never had any income or property beyond her salary and pension.</p> <p>The statement added: \"Wen Jiabao has never played any role in the business activities of his family members, still less has he allowed his family members' business activities to have any influence on his formulation and execution of policies.\"</p> <p>The New York Times article did not suggest that Wen himself held assets, nor allege wrongdoing.</p> <p>The report said that in many cases the names of family members were \"hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners\".</p> <p>It added that several relatives held shares via an investment vehicle run by a wealthy businesswoman who told the media organisation that the assets were actually her own. She had not wanted publicity so asked relatives to find other people to register the shares in their names on her behalf; they had \"by accident\" chosen the premier's relatives.</p> <p>The lawyers' statement added: \"Other relatives of Wen Jiabao and the 'friends' and 'colleagues' of those relatives are responsible for all their own business activities.</p> <p>\"We will continue to make clarifications regarding untrue reports by the New York Times, and reserve the right to hold it legally responsible.\"</p> <p>Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the New York Times, wrote in an email published by the media organisation itself: \"We are standing by our story, which we are incredibly proud of and which is an example of the quality investigative journalism The Times is known for.\"</p>"
