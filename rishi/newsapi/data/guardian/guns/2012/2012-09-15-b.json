  "<p>The editor of an Italian gossip magazine set to publish as yet unseen topless photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge has promised that the pictures \"will not damage her dignity, nor are they in any way morbid\".</p> <p>Alfonso Signorini, editor of <em>Chi</em> magazine, told the <em>Observer</em> his 26-page feature containing 30 pictures \u2013 which will be published on Monday \u2013 contains \"normal topless shots, except Kate happens to be the future Queen\". He added: \"They are not scandalous, there are no unpublishable pictures. It is just a huge scoop.\"</p> <p>Signorini said he had selected 30 photographs from a selection of 200 which show Catherine arriving on the terrace in a red robe, before applying sun cream and sunbathing. \"There are no amorous moments, no kisses, at most William places his hand on her head affectionately at one point,\" said Signorini.</p> <p>However, the British royal family is heading for a fierce legal showdown with media mogul and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who controls the magazine. St James's Palace <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/media/2012/sep/14/royals-legal-action-closer-kate-topless-photos\" title=\"\">is already planning legal action against French magazine <em>Closer</em></a><em> </em>after it published photos of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing on the terrace of the Autet Ch\u00e2teau in Provence, southern France. The French lawsuit, which is due to be heard by a court on Monday, has not deterred <em>Chi </em>from publishing photos that <em>Closer </em>said it considered too \"intimate\" to print.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for St James's Palace said: \"We will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos in Italy save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review. Any such publication would serve no purpose other than to cause further, entirely unjustifiable upset to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who were enjoying time alone together in the privacy of a relative's home.\"</p> <p>Both <em>Closer </em>and <em>Chi </em>are published by the Italian publishing group Mondadori, which is controlled by Berlusconi and managed by Marina Berlusconi, his oldest daughter from his first marriage. Launched in 2005 as a French version of the British magazine of the same name, <em>Closer </em>was sold in 2006 to Mondadori France.</p> <p>In Italy, <em>Chi </em>magazine publishes a regular diet of paparazzi shots of celebrities in various states of undress, as well as flattering photo features of Silvio Berlusconi and his family. Signorini was also instrumental in smoothing over the scandal of Berlusconi's friendship with teenage belly dancer Karima El Mahroug, which has seen him sent to trial on charges of underage prostitution. During a sympathetic interview conducted by Signorini on one of Berlusconi's TV channels, El Mahroug broke down in tears in front of more than two million viewers and explained she had never had sex with the then prime minister.</p> <p>Berlusconi has also allegedly been informed in the past of compromising material offered to <em>Chi</em>. In 2009 Italian daily <em>Corriere della Sera </em>reported that the tycoon was told the magazine had been offered a video of Piero Marrazzo, the then governor of the Lazio region, undressed in the company of a transsexual prostitute. Berlusconi reportedly contacted Marrazzo to warn him, while <em>Chi </em>declined to buy the video.</p> <p>Signorini told the <em>Observer </em>he had not been in touch with Berlusconi over whether to use the photos of William and Catherine. \"That is laughable,\" he said. \"I informed Mondadori of my decision to publish the pictures but I never spoke to Berlusconi,\" he said. \"Don't forget that this is the magazine which once published shots of Marina Berlusconi topless.\" But he added: \"We would&#xa0;never have published the photos of Prince Harry naked in a room in Las Vegas.\"</p> <p>The publication of the topless pictures of the duchess does lay Berlusconi open to charges of double standards after he fought through the courts in 2009 to <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/05/silvio-berlusconi-villa-topless-holiday-pictures\" title=\"\">halt the publication of shots of topless women at his villa in Sardinia</a>, claiming they violated his right to privacy.</p> <p>Spain's <em>El Pa\u00eds </em>newspaper was the first to print the photographs of Berlusconi's female party guests taking showers and sunbathing in the gardens of Villa Certosa, as well as a highly embarrassing picture of former Czech prime minister Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, nude and semi-aroused. \"These photos are of a private event, and therefore fall foul of the law,\" Berlusconi's laywer Niccol\u00f2 Ghedini said at the time.</p> <p>As the duke and duchess continued their Asian tour this weekend, statements from the royal family suggested Berlusconi's publishing empire has now sparked a far more serious incident. According to Clarence House, the Prince of Wales's office, the photos recalled the \"worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to the duke and duchess for being so\".</p> <p>That <em>Chi </em>magazine was now publishing topless shots was no surprise to Candida Morvillo, an online celebrity columnist. \"It was one of few publications that decided to publish the photos of Diana, immediately after her fatal car crash,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>In Iran, the country I was born in and where I lived until three years ago, public hanging is a horrific but familiar scene for many, at least for those living close to city centres and public squares. Once as a child, on my way to school, I became an inadvertent spectator of an execution, my eyes shocked at seeing the guards draping a rope around the neck of a convict. The sight has haunted me ever since.</p> <p>Hanging is the common method for execution in Iran. The judicial killings usually take place in the morning as the sun rises, often at the crime scene or in a city centre. The families of victims and convicts gather as the authorities prepare to hang the condemned from cranes.</p> <p>Under Iran's sharia law, the victim's family has the right to spare the convict from execution for certain crimes, such as when someone is convicted of killing another person in a car accident. This means many executions see the condemned's relatives incessantly pleading for a pardon. A huge crowd, which might include children, usually surrounds the scene.</p> <p>Executions in Iran are mostly the result of grossly unfair trials which are usually held behind closed doors without the presence of a defence lawyer. Activists believe that many of those on death row were convicted on the basis of \"forced confessions\", a method believed to be commonly used in the country at the moment. Moreover, when a death sentence is handed down, families are often not given prior notice of the execution.</p> <p>A number of crimes such as murder and rape \u2013 and even homosexuality \u2013 can send a convict to the gallows, but it is the drug-related offences that accounted for more than 80% of the killings in the country last year. Latest figures on the number of executions that are known to have been carried out in 2011 globally indicate that half of the killings took place in Iran, although China, which considers the precise figures about its use of death penalty as a state secret, is not included in the calculation and still remains at the top of the list.</p> <p>Iranian officials acknowledged the execution of only 360 people last year, but it is believed that this figure grossly underestimates the true number in the Islamic republic because the regime had allegedly embarked on a campaign of secret and mass hangings of prisoners, especially in faraway provinces.</p> <p>Human rights organisations estimate that as many as 600 people were put to death in Iran last year, of which at least 488 executions were carried out for alleged drug offences. In the first half of 2011, Iran was executing at the rate of two people a day.</p> <p>This year Amnesty said the authorities have so far acknowledged the execution of at least 182 people, 35 of them hanged in public.</p> <p>\"Amnesty International has received credible reports of 100 other executions which were not officially acknowledged, mostly of convicted drugs offenders,\" the group said. Iran's drug-related executions in 2011 showed a threefold increase from 2009, according to the human rights organisation.</p> <p>Iran has also used capital punishment for foreign nationals, including Afghans imprisoned in the country for drug offences. As many as 4,000 Afghans are believed to be on death row, with concerns that they are particularly poorly treated.</p> <p>The country's judicial system has also been criticised for handing down death sentences against juveniles. In 2011 at least 143 child offenders were on death row in Iranian prisons, waiting to go to the gallows when they reach 18.</p>",
  "<p>After his unhappy experiences filming in London and what I considered an indifferent visit to Spain in <em>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</em>, Woody Allen was approaching peak form last year exploring the subject of nostalgia and cultural tourism in <em>Midnight in Paris</em>. He's now moved on to a country in which a man called Oreste Lionello became nationally famous for dubbing Allen into Italian. But his presence in Rome is not to do with money alone, though that's an important incentive. It's the city most closely associated with his southern European idol Federico Fellini, to whom he has often paid homage in the past (most notably with <em>Stardust Memories</em> and <em>Radio Days</em>), and indeed the cinematic idea of \"the Eternal City\", as the place is referred to with half-mocking reverence, is central to his latest film.</p> <p><em>To Rome with Love</em> looks back to the omnibus films so popular in Italy 50&#xa0;years ago when Allen began his serious moviegoing. Every major director from Polanski to Pasolini contributed to them, you only needed a single idea, they could be made quickly, the producers got big names on the marquee, and the chances were that two or three of the episodes would pay off. Very early on, Allen made his own version, <em>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)</em>, which featured among other sketches a parody of Antonioni, and later joined two Italian-Americans, Scorsese and Coppola, in reviving the genre with <em>New York Stories</em>. So it was natural for him to turn to this idea when a Roman project came up.</p> <p>Two of his stories are about American visitors, two about Italians, and neither is essentially concerned with love in the romantic sense that has made such Hollywood movies as <em>Three Coins in the Fountain</em> or <em>Roman Holiday</em> enduringly popular.</p> <p>The Italian stories are the wispiest offerings. The more substantial is a sex comedy about Antonio and Milly, a naive provincial married couple arriving in a Roman hotel from Pordenone in the north east (the town chosen no doubt because it has a prestigious annual festival celebrating classic silent cinema). She leaves the hotel to find a hairdresser but loses her way, runs into a film unit on location and has a Felliniesque adventure with its pompous star. Meanwhile, Anna, a beautiful call girl (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz at her most beguiling), arrives by mistake at the couple's room and is passed off as Milly when relatives arrive.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WIbYqxqtP38?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WIbYqxqtP38?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The other Italian segment centres on Roberto Benigni as Leopoldo Pisanello, a family man and office worker of total obscurity who one day finds himself the subject of national adulation, followed everywhere by paparazzi, constantly on TV. How long will it last? When will the bubble burst? This one-joke satirical sketch about the ridiculousness of celebrity is a characteristic omnibus item, and Allen specifically establishes its 1960s provenance by having Pisanello's chauffeur tell him that he's \"famous for being famous\", a definition of celebrity coined by the historian Daniel Boorstin in his 1961 book. How funny you find the episode depends on your feelings about Benigni. After the dreadful <em>Life&#xa0;is Beautiful</em> in 1997, his very appearance on screen is for me like getting a strong shot of Novocaine.</p> <p>In the traditional Italian omnibus film the stories were given titles and presented discretely. In <em>To Rome with Love</em> they are interwoven, and the result is curiously surreal, because they don't take place in the same time frame. The story of the couple from Pordenone, for instance, is set over a period of a few hours, the Benigni is at least several days, and the two parts about Americans cover days or months. In fact the surreal aspect is enhanced by, and enhances, the sketch in which disillusioned middle-aged American architect John (Alec Baldwin) meets ambitious young American architect Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) in Trastevere. Baldwin looks like the ageing relatives described by TS Eliot in <em>The Family Reunion</em> as being \"so withered and so young\", while Eisenberg is the essence of edgy youthful idealism; and from their interchangeable names and the role of unseen adviser that Baldwin assumes (rather like Bogart in Allen's <em>Play It Again, Sam</em>), we infer that they are the same person at different ages. The pair are perfectly cast, and they play beautifully together, as does Ellen Page as an outrageously pretentious actor who disrupts Jack's menage.</p> <p>The crucial episode, however, features Allen himself as Jerry, a retired director of avant-garde opera (famous for a <em>Tosca</em> in which the singers were dressed as white mice), and his acerbic wife Phyllis (Judy Davis), who visit Rome to meet their daughter's lawyer fiance. This story is both funny and moving in its approach to marriage, ambition and death, with Allen sending up his grouchy, pessimistic public persona and Davis putting him down the way Allen's wife, Soon-Yi, is said to puncture his ego. The latter happens quite literally when Davis tells him he hasn't got an ego, a superego and an id, just three ids.</p> <p>Not all the jokes come off, and sometimes one can hear the gun being cocked and the hammer falling on a detonator that fails to work. But mostly this segment is very engaging, and its armature is a vintage showbusiness joke about the brilliant tenor who can only sing in the shower. This might have worked best as a one-liner when the veteran stand-up comics gather to reminisce in Allen's <em>Broadway Danny Rose</em>, but is here milked for slightly more than its worth. Anyway, I greatly enjoyed this film. Seeing it so soon after&#xa0;Robert Weide's exhilarating two-hour documentary on Allen, I'm feeling generously disposed towards Woody and full of gratitude for the abundant pleasure he's given us over the past 50 years.</p>",
  "<p>It's 8 o'clock on a bright morning at the end of the summer term just gone and at Kingsmead primary school in Hackney the staff are preparing to perform one of their core tasks. Not teaching their pupils to add up. Not teaching them how to read, or all the cool stuff about Egyptian mummies and the pharaohs. They are preparing to give them breakfast. \"You can't have good learning if the children are not ready to learn,\" says head teacher Louise Nichols, and she knows what she's talking about. She knows that without their daily breakfast club, dozens of the children in her inner city school would be coming to school hungry. And she knows that because it's what used to happen.</p> <p>Kingsmead is in an area that is among the 4% most deprived in Britain. Around a third of the children come because their parents' working hours make it difficult for them to get breakfast at home. But many more come because there simply isn't breakfast to be had at home. \"There's a lot of chaotic households, and some very large families,\" Nichols says, in the pause before breakfast starts. \"A lot of our children will be getting themselves up from a very young age and not necessarily seeing an adult. We give some of them alarm clocks to help them get up.\" And then there are those adults who simply don't have the money to feed their kids. \"The community is definitely getting poorer,\" she says. There are more and more hungry children needing feeding, more and more breakfasts to be served.</p> <p>As the new school year gets under way, Louise Nichols's experience is being confirmed by data from across the country. In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/jun/19/pupil-hunger-survey-result\" title=\"recent survey from the Guardian Teacher Network\">recent survey from the Guardian Teacher Network</a>, 83% of teachers said they were seeing pupils who were coming to school hungry; 55% said up to a quarter of their kids were turning up having not eaten enough. Almost 50% admitted they had bought food with their own money to give to pupils. Teachers talk about children fainting in class or in the playground; about children whose behaviour is so erratic they have considered excluding them, until they discovered they were simply hungry. They talk about anxious or fretful children who can't put a name to what is troubling them, because they are too hungry to focus on the problem.</p> <p>What's more, as changes to the benefits rules kick in and the recession deepens, organisations involved with breakfast clubs are saying the problems are only worsening, that demand is rising. It is estimated that there have been<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/oct/23/school-breakfast-clubs-at-risk\" title=\" as many as 20,000 such clubs nationwide\"> as many as 20,000 such clubs nationwide</a>, but those supported by local authorities are now seeing their funding cut, and just as that demand is rising many are being forced to close. Last spring the Royal College of GPs, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health all called on the government to give the 1.3 million children in England already entitled to free school meals, free breakfasts too, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/16/wales-free-breakfast-clubs-schools\" title=\"\">as they are in Wales</a>. It's not going to happen; ministers have said they have no plans to pursue the proposals. Teachers may give a damn about children going to school hungry. Charities may care. But apparently Michael Gove, the secretary of state for education, does not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815399\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347023874269/Children-at-Kingsmead-Pri-001.jpg\" alt=\"Children at Kingsmead Primary School in Homerton, east London at their breakfast club\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children at Kingsmead Primary School in Homerton, east London at their breakfast club.

On a busy day Kingsmead can be feeding half the school's 250 kids. Today is busy enough, with herds of small people from a vast range of ethnic backgrounds \u2013 the area is one of the most diverse in the country \u2013 crowding around the fold-out tables in a bright, airy hall just off the reception area.</p> <p>\"What we do here is really important,\" says Hilda McWilliams, one of the teaching assistants who helps run the club, as she butters up toasted bagels by the dozen. \"Bagels are the most popular, though we also do beans every other day and in the winter there's porridge with maple syrup which they like. Though we keep control of the maple syrup.\" I ask a bunch of eight-year-old girls why they come, as they shove hunks of jam-smeared bagel into their mouth. \"They give you food for free,\" says one, with a grin. \"I come for fun,\" says another. They talk a lot about the social side, about meeting their friends, about the football club which they all appear to be a part of.</p> <p>The staff do not play down the socialising element. It's important. But they also emphasise the role that getting their children fed has played in the school's success. They have recently had an outstanding Ofsted report, and are outperforming many of their neighbours with more privileged intakes. It's a story reported across schools offering free breakfasts. According to figures gathered by Magic Breakfast, 88% say it has led to improved attendance and attainment, and 93% say it has led to better concentration in class. \"We used to have a registration process for the breakfast club,\" Nichols says, \"and we charged a \u00a31 a day for it.\" That, she says, was putting lots of parents off. Once they could stop charging, the children who really needed it started coming. But, she says, the service is vulnerable. \"Which is worrying because it's something we seriously need.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815400\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347020395692/Children-at-Keyworth-Prim-001.jpg\" alt=\"Children at Keyworth Primary School breakfast club\" width=\"220\" height=\"152\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keyworth Primary School breakfast club. Photograph: Richard Saker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's a similar story over at Keyworth primary in Kennington, south London, another outstanding school in an area of high deprivation , which also gets support from Magic Breakfast. It runs its club from a long airy Nissen-style hut to one side of the grounds. Again I talk to the children about why they come. \"It's too busy at my house,\" says one nine year old. \"Because the cereal has run out,\" says another, simply. \"I come because my mum doesn't really make my breakfast for me,\" says a third. I ask gently why that is. He shrugs. \"Because there's no food.\" It is the cold logic of the child.</p> <p>I ask Claire Eastwood, deputy head teacher of Keyworth, whether she thinks people know how serious the problem is. \"No,\" she says bluntly. \"I don't think people understand that kids don't get breakfast for many different reasons.\" Does she ever find herself being judgmental about what can look like a simple failure of parenting? \"You can't be judgmental because you simply don't know what circumstances they find themselves in.\" (It is a sentiment echoed by Louise Nichols at Kingsmead. \"I'm Hackney born and bred,\" Nichols says. \"I know the difficulties these parents face.\" In any case, she says, once you start judging the parents you start labelling the child, and they are what matters. \"They are the ones who are suffering, for whatever reason.\")</p> <p>In the last three months of the school year, Keyworth has seen a \"massive increase\" in the number of children coming in for the club. It's down to changes in benefit rules forcing unemployed parents who were able to be there for their children out on to work experience early in the morning. It's also down to a simple lack of hard cash. According to Eastwood, \"It's a fact of life in an inner city school.\" What's more, we were talking at the end of the summer term. The safety net of school was about to be removed for many of these children for six weeks. \"That's true. When the holidays come, breakfast club closes and it concerns me greatly, on the level of food intake, socialisation, everything. When they come back after the summer you always see a deterioration.\" Carmel McConnell, the founder and chief executive of Magic Breakfast, first got involved with the issue around the turn of the millennium, when she was visiting schools to conduct research for a book on how business could engage with local communities. \"Headteachers were telling me they could have brilliant communities but too many of their pupils were putting their hand up and saying they were hungry,\" she says. \"That was shocking to me. Britain's GDP had tripled, we had a trillion-pound financial services sector and yet in Hackney we had children who were hungry.\" She shakes her head at the memory of it. \"I couldn't do very much. I went round supermarkets and bought a load of food with my own money and dropped it off at five schools.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815401\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347020664929/Carmel-McConnell-001.jpg\" alt=\"Carmel McConnell\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmel McConnell, founder of Magic Breakfast.  Photograph: Richard Saker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McConnell, who describes herself as a veteran of social protest movements of the 80s \u2013 Greenham Common and the miners' strike \u2013 decided something more serious had to be done. She remortgaged her house and gave herself two years to set up a more robust organisation. \"Suddenly I had 25 schools on my books. I lobbied the Labour government about it. I saw every single education minister and they all said it was being dealt with. It wasn't.\"</p> <p>By 2008 she realised, in her own words, that \"the cavalry wasn't coming\". Government wasn't going to deal with the issue. Having worked on corporate social responsibility issues with some big companies, including BT, she now describes herself as \"fluent in capitalism\". She approached the makers of Quaker Oats and Tropicana juices and convinced them to deliver \u00a3600,000 worth of food and drink a year (both companies supply their own products, though this is not the case for all supporters of breakfast clubs: Kellogg's give grants instead). \"And that's how we've made it work. Until now we haven't had any public grants. It's all been done through partnerships with business. Those companies that want to get involved for PR reasons can sling their hook.\"</p> <p>I ask if it makes her cross that an organisation such as Magic Breakfast has to exist. \"Of course,\" she says. \"It's madness that I have to do this. This is pure social failure. You can't have hungry children missing out on their education. And it's getting worse. We used to have 20 or 30 schools on our waiting list. Now we have 130. The forms they fill in would make you weep. Children coming into school listless because they're hungry. We're also seeing more midweek hunger as pay packets and benefits run out at home.\"</p> <p>Other organisations working in the field report similar issues. The charity <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/oct/01/families-queue-for-food-handouts\" title=\"FareShare, which redistributes food from supermarkets and manufacturers\">FareShare, which redistributes food from supermarkets and manufacturers</a> which might otherwise go to waste, says that breakfast clubs used to make up only 4% of the groups receiving its food. Now it's nearly 20%. A number of companies, including Kellogg's and Greggs, help support clubs across the country. The educational charity ContinYou, which administers grants in partnership with Kellogg's and provides training and support for clubs, says it too is seeing massive increases in demand. \"We also have anecdotal evidence of more kids coming to school hungry,\" says the chief executive Karin Woodley. Sadly, the outlook is bleak. Research into the impact of current benefits changes, by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), forecasts another 800,000 will be pushed into poverty by 2020. And poverty means hunger. \"So far we've only had 15% of the benefits cut,\" says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the CPAG, \"and we're already seeing the impact. We've got the vast majority still to come and that's very worrying.\"</p> <p>There are glimmers of hope. Kellogg's is running a campaign to raise around \u00a3250,000 to help support clubs. Magic Breakfast is to get a six-figure sum from Boris Johnson's Mayor's Fund, to support 50 schools in London for the next three years. But it's a long way from McConnell's ambitious plan to raise \u00a313m, with which she believes she could provide the 1,000 poorest schools with self-sustaining breakfast clubs. And it's even further away from central government support.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Education acknowledged their importance. \"Breakfast clubs can improve children's attendance, concentration, motivation and promote healthy eating habits.\" However, they said it was up to schools to decide how to spend the funds they were given; with local authorities seeing their budgets brutally squeezed, the clubs are often the first in line for cuts. According to the DoE, the so-called \"pupil premium\", aimed at the most disadvantaged children, will double, but that's not until 2014/15, which may be far too little far too late. Even a report into school food, commissioned by Michael Gove from Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent, the founders of the Leon healthy fast-food chain, will not be delivered until sometime next year. Dimbleby and Vincent have made it clear they recognise the importance of breakfast. \"We don't need to wait for a detailed double-blind trial to prove that children who are hungry will find it hard to concentrate,\" says Dimbleby. But again, even if their recommendations are acted upon \u2013 and that is a very big if, given the track record of the education department under Gove \u2013 any change will still be measured in years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395815402\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347024059582/Breakfast-bowls-001.jpg\" alt=\"Breakfast bowls\" width=\"220\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preparing breakfast at Keyworth primary school.

Because without them, too many would go hungry. It would be shocking at any time. But in 21st-century Britain that is nothing short of a scandal.</p>",
  "<p>Visit a winery at most times of the year and not all that much seems to be going on. A winemaker may periodically come to check on a barrel, a bottling line may stutter into life, and, in the larger operations, a lab technician will studiously test samples to the quiet murmur of a radio. But for the most part a winery is a place of museum-like calm.</p> <p>At this time of the year, however, all that changes for a few weeks. Right now it's vintage season in the northern hemisphere, and wineries are buzzing with activity. An army of itinerant workers, many of them volunteers pick and sort the grapes. As trucks full of grapes arrive from different vineyards, each one needing to be logged, sorted, crushed and sent to a different tank, the bigger wineries will feel a little like a frenetic Saturday night at A&amp;E, with the grapes as patients and the winemaker as the harassed junior doctor allocating staff and resources. At other times, vintage will feel more like a carnival, with wineries laying on alfresco lunch and dinner.</p> <p>There's an irresistible romance to vintage time that cuts right to the heart of wine's appeal. That date on the label is a reminder that wine is an agricultural product, subject to the whims of the weather that year. It provides a feeling of continual renewal, too, with each vintage effectively being a new product. And it gives wine its magical time-travelling capabilities; that sense, if you drink a very old bottle, that you're drinking the weather and sunshine of one long-gone year.</p> <p>Am I being too romantic? When I talk to supermarket buyers I'm told that few of us take the year into account when buying a wine, and it's rare for a shop to offer two vintages of the same wine to choose between.</p> <p>There's also an argument that wines have become much more consistent from year to year, thanks to developments in winemaking and winegrowing. And we drink many more wines from regions (such as Chile and California) where the climate is more reliable, and vintage variation less pronounced, than in northern Europe.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean the concept of vintage is past its sell-by date. It still matters to producers. It would take a braver soul than me to tell a winemaker who's had their entire crop destroyed, or who struggled with this year's washout summer in northern France and England, that differences between vintages amount to little more than the changing digits on their labels.</p> <p>And you only have to look at the fuss made around the release of the new vintage in Bordeaux every spring to see that it matters to buyers of so-called fine wine. If anything the importance of vintage for the top wines in Bordeaux (and Burgundy) can be a little overstated, with great wines made in vintages that have had less hype (such as 2008), selling considerably cheaper than wines of lesser quality produced in vintages that have been pronounced as \"great\" such as 2009 and 2010.</p> <p>Vintage ratings can only ever be a guide: in good years more producers will tend to come up with the goods, but if a producer is worth their salt, they'll make a decent wine every year. But no matter how skilled a winemaker is at masking the differences, no two vintages of the same wine will ever be exactly alike. With most products, that would be a flaw. With wine, it's part of its magic.</p> <h2><strong>Six value vintages</strong></h2> <p><strong>Martin C\u00f3dax Caixas Albari\u00f1o, R\u00edas Baixas, Spain 2011 </strong>(\u00a39.99 or \u00a37.99 if you buy two bottles, <a href=\"http://www.majestic.co.uk/find/product-is-14008\" title=\"Majestic\">Majestic</a>) Martin C\u00f3dax is one of Spain's most consistent producers from vintage to vintage, but from what I've tasted the 2011 vintage in this part of Galicia was a good one lending this subtly peachy white extra vim and zest.</p> <p><strong>Berrys' Good Ordinary Claret, Bordeaux, France 2009 </strong>(\u00a38.75, <a href=\"http://www.bbr.com/products-9701-2009-berrys-good-ordinary-claret\" title=\"Berry Bros &amp; Rudd\">Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a>) The 2009 vintage was widely hailed as a classic in Bordeaux, raising the level of quality across the board, as in this excellent fleshy, smooth blackcurrant-and-damson fruited red from the reliable Dourthe operation.</p> <p><strong>Extra Special Domaine de la Lev\u00e9e Chablis, France 2010 </strong>(\u00a39.34, <a href=\"http://groceries.asda.com/asda-estore/catalog/sectionpagecontainer.jsp?skuId=80677994&amp;departmentid=1214921923747&amp;aisleid=1214921926153&amp;startValue\" title=\"Asda\">Asda</a>) This is excellent value for a sinuously classy Chablis from a good, if slightly smaller (in terms of crop) than average vintage.

  "<p>Four <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/49159050\" title=\"\">fluttering doves</a>, a flying bird's nest, white columns, hieroglyphs, the blue-haired Queen of the Night: after 25&nbsp;years and 14 revivals English National Opera's classic staging of Mozart's <a href=\"http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?itemid=2130\" title=\"\"><strong>The Magic Flute </strong></a>launched the new season in reassuring style, continuing to woo audiences with its intelligent charms as it always has. This, we are told \u2013 not for the first time but probably for the last \u2013 will be positively, definitively, without question, categorically the final revival of Nicholas Hytner's production, with its serene yet playful designs by Bob Crowley. Is there anything new to say? With Mozart's late opera, part pantomime, part arcane enigma, there always is.</p> <p>Directors struggle to find the right way to handle its constant shifts, from slapstick to philosophy, anger to laughter, moonshine to blazing sunlight. The nature of Sarastro's smug wisdom is distinctly uneasy once you begin to examine it closely, which, perhaps mercifully, this production does not (you soon slide into L Ron Hubbard terrain if you do). The dialogue can sound arduous especially when, as here, everyone's vowel sounds seem to come from different continents. Only Rhian Lois, as the delightful tea lady Papagena, sounded wholly authentic in her Welshness, perhaps because she is Welsh.</p> <p>It matters more that they can sing, and they could, impressively. ENO should congratulate itself on having secured 28-year-old baritone Duncan&nbsp;Rock as Papageno, who this week won the first \u00a310,000 <a href=\"http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/young_musicians/chilcott/duncan_rock_wins_2012_chilcott_award/\" title=\"\">Chilcott award</a> for young British opera singers. Elena Xanthoudakis was highly original, even quirky and intense, as Pamina. Tamino (Shawn Mathey) had an awkward start but quickly settled into fluent lyricism. The Queen of the&nbsp;Night (Kathryn Lewek), secure in&nbsp;her coloratura frenzy, showed the right degree of crazed anger. Her Three Ladies, led by Elizabeth Llewellyn, were a high-class and formidable trio. The Three Boys shone, showing touching humour and earning noisy applause.</p> <p>Much of the excitement came from the pit. Nicholas Collon was making his ENO conducting debut and enticed well-paced, zestful playing from the orchestra, with special praise for the \"magical\" instruments so crucial in this opera \u2013 flute and, via Papageno's bells, percussion. Apart from one over-eager splashed string chord at the start of the overture, the musicians sounded glad to be back in harness. The noises off \u2013 birdsong, gushing water \u2013 are a distraction, the ad libbing not yet fluent but there is plenty of good comic potential. Papageno seemed a bit alarmed when, after asking for a bride to save him from a lonely death, a woman in the second row stalls volunteered her services. It's an idea that might catch on.</p> <p>Another 25th anniversary was celebrated this week. <a href=\"http://www.byo.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Youth Opera</a>, founded in 1987 to showcase the next generation of opera singers, celebrated its birthday with Smetana's <strong>The Bartered Bride</strong> and Judith Weir's early career triumph, <em>A Night at the Chinese Opera</em>. I chose the Smetana, hoping that if anyone could redeem this awkward comedy \u2013 not that I mind beauty contests, bartering brides or poking fun at stammerers, or maybe I do \u2013 it might be the young and talented.</p> <p>There are some who say this long opera is best abandoned after the glorious overture. The wooden plot revolves round the putative bride, Marenka, being in love with one brother but finding herself betrothed to the hopeless other. Her chief interest is in getting her man, though in this <em>Dallas</em>-Annie Oakley world you often wished she'd get her gun too, just for interest. Katherine Crompton sang engagingly with lovely, bright top notes. It will be well worth seeing how she tackles a more complex role.</p> <p>These performers, mostly graduate students whose alumni include ENO's music director Edward Gardner and Cardiff Singer of the World Katarina Karnus, did their utmost, with many sparkling moments in between the longueurs which seem to be written indelibly into the work's dramatic pacing, however lavish and starry the forces staging it. The cheerful updating to Prague, Oklahoma in the 1950s provided ample opportunity for tight-waisted prom frocks, beehive hairdos and saloon-bar camaraderie perfectly in keeping with Smetana's Bohemian folkloristic original. Directed by Rodula Gaitanou, with designs by Cordelia Chisholm, it used simple devices to good effect.</p> <p>The conductor, Peter Robinson, kept the tempo moving with good support from the Southbank Sinfonia. If the boxy acoustic did not always flatter their ensemble, they still gave rhythmic energy to the Czech dance rhythms which are the highlight of the score. The bonus for BYO is the large ensemble cast. Luis Gomes (Jenik) displayed promising lyricism as her lover. Matthew Stiff found a nice lightness of touch for the stolid marriage broker Kecal, and if no one else leapt out from the cameo roles, all were well taken.</p> <p>There's no point attempting political correctness in this opera. You can make \"black'' Monostatos white, as in Hytner's <em>The Magic Flute</em>. You can play down racism, colonialism, antisemitism, sexism as displayed in so many 19th-century masterpieces. But there's not a thing you can do about Va\u0161ek's stammer. It's embodied ineradicably into the notes, expressed in an aria of broken, hiccuping phrases,&nbsp;bar after agonising bar. Samuel Furness, a fine tenor who can also act, commanded the stage as the poor, shy, tongue-tied boy who eventually finds his inner grizzly bear by joining a circus. There's a message in there somewhere.</p>",

One of the ways the Welsh government has been tackling the problem is <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/16/breakfast-clubs-schools-funding\" title=\"\">breakfast clubs</a>.</p> <p>It began in 2004, with the piloting of the primary school free breakfast initiative, which targeted the most disadvantaged areas of the country. The programme was then introduced across the country three years later, allowing any maintained primary school to take part.</p> <p>Five years on, almost 75% of primary schools across Wales have breakfast clubs.</p> <p>\"Because of the devolved education services in Wales there is the opportunity for the Welsh government to prioritise things in a different way than in other parts of the UK,\" says Pam Boyd, director of education charity ContinYou Cymru. \"The Welsh government still promotes the idea of schools being community-focused in a way that is now different to schools elsewhere, particularly in England.\"</p> <p>Breakfast clubs have been made a priority because they are seen as a necessary part of education, helping to improve learning and attendance.</p> <p>\"The minister for education in Wales has stated that addressing the impact of poverty on education is one of the priorities of the government,\" explains Boyd. Despite proposed legislation in the Assembly to transfer funding for clubs to local authorities, there was a commitment at the last election to continue with the scheme. It continues to grow, with the budget for 2012-13 rising to \u00a312.7m.</p>",
  "<p>Rumer, in a restaurant, is sensitive to events on other tables. The clang of dropped cutlery, a hand raised a little too long when calling for the bill, these are things that make the singer momentarily break from her own meal and eyeball the waiter, just make sure he's on the way. \"I can't relax when someone needs the salt,\" she says, because for many years, before she had a hit record, back in the days when she was still known as Sarah Joyce, Rumer made her living as a waitress.</p> <p>\"I loved it,\" says the 33-year-old, dressed this lunchtime in a green-patterned dress over jeans, long, messy brown hair falling to reach the table. \"The morning shift especially \u2013 pulling down the awning, setting out the chairs, putting on the music. Loved it.\"</p> <p>We are eating in the lounge of <a href=\"http://www.unionclub.co.uk/\" title=\"the Union\">the Union</a>, a members' club in Soho: a curious, cluttered place with faded red walls and a general sense of its having an eccentric history. Rumer looks unimpressed when the young waiter fails to provide any background facts; a nugget or two of building trivia should, clearly, be a part of his professional arsenal. I bet Rumer was a good waitress.</p> <p>\"Depends who you ask,\" she says. \"If you ask the chefs, they'd say I was awful. Chefs didn't like me because I tried to please the customers.\" She'd let people order off the menu, and then \"have to dodge missiles when I got into the kitchen\".</p> <p>A good thing, really, that after 10 years of after-hours gigging, even working for a while as a popcorn vendor in a cinema, she got a deal with Atlantic Records two years ago. Her debut album, the mellow, 70s-influenced MOR of <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>, was a great success, selling more than a million copies. No more waiting on tables for you, I suggest, as our main courses arrive.</p> <p>\"I actually did a shift at my old restaurant a few months ago. <a href=\"http://www.pullens.biz/\" title=\"Pullens\">Pullens</a>, in south London. Does fantastic steak\u2026\"</p> <p>Sorry?</p> <p>\"Pullens. It used to be a gentlemen's outfitters before it was a restaurant. The manager, Alan, used to be a fisherman so everything's \u2026\"</p> <p>But I'm not after background facts. Rumer, a few months ago, would have been tweaking her follow-up to <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>, an album of surprising cover versions called<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/album/15026d98-4096-4c64-89ff-329171ab462c\" title=\" Boys Don't Cry\"> <em>Boys Don't Cry</em></a> that at the time of our lunch is on its way to No 3 in the UK album chart. An odd time, you'd think, to start moonlighting at her local steak joint. What was she up to? \"Just helping out,\" she says. \"They were short-staffed. It was interesting \u2013 I was polishing cutlery and I thought, well, how many times have I done this? I used to stand doing the cutlery and dream about getting away, being a singer.\"</p> <p>I wonder if her still relatively new career as a pop star, which recently included <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOqnCns59Y\" title=\"\">performing for President Obama at the White House</a>, has been everything she expected. \"Nothing ever is. There are times, now, when I wish I didn't have any of the pressure. All these experiences that I'm having \u2013 shaking Obama's hand, having a lovely chat with Michelle \u2013 they're amazing. But they're also laced with fear. Some people love performing but I don't have that confidence. Because I don't think that I'm amazing. I don't think everything that comes out of my mouth is perfectly executed.\"</p> <p>Fame came late, at 30, and up until then Rumer's life had been disjointed: false starts with bands; bouts of depression; a slow year as a kitchen assistant at a hippie-ish retreat, cooking bean stews for visitors signed up for \"gong camp, past-life regression, whatever\". Now she is hurried around the world to sing and promote and glad-hand, \"one minute Helsinki, the next New York\". But self-confidence doesn't always develop as quickly as a career urged on by massive sales.</p> <p>\"Someone from my record label said to me: 'This bit about fame being hard. It's an interesting angle.'\" Rumer hoots with laughter. \"I said: 'An angle? It's not an angle, it's true. What are you talking about an angle ...\"</p> <p>I doubt, though, the label's angle-man got off with the affectionate chuckle she's using today. Rumer is, by most accounts, quite exacting when it comes to her music, and hands-on at every stage of her album's creation. Nothing irks her quite like her label telling her something can't be done.</p> <p>\"I ask them: 'Really? Or are you just a quitter?' I have the attitude that everything is doable. I've got a rogue gene. I've got these mountain goat herding genes from Pakistan.\"</p> <p><strong>These last comments need some </strong>explaining, if you're unfamiliar with the singer's past. Born to English parents in 1979, she grew up in an expat community in eastern Pakistan, where her father, an engineer, worked on the Tarbela Dam. They moved back to England to live in a house in the New Forest. \"You know the expression 'fur coat no knickers'? That was us. We looked like we had money. Big house but it was falling apart. There was a swimming pool with no water in it.\"</p> <p>At the age of 11, Rumer learned that she was the result of an affair her mother had in Pakistan. Her biological father was a man from the local village and the family cook. \"We're talking about somebody who used to make my dad's jam roly-poly,\" she says. \"Every night. And it was rock hard. He was the worst chef. Didn't know how to cook. Completely not interested in obeying rules. Did his own thing.\"</p> <p>She bursts out laughing. \"My mum told me once that he went shopping [for the family] and when he unpacked it he didn't know what to make of a box of Tampax. So he put it in the cupboard with the rice.\" Her mother and the man \u2013 who Rumer won't name \u2013 grew close, she says, because her mother was clever and frustrated. \"They got on well because my mother was a linguist. The cook taught her Urdu, and the Qur'an. They studied together.\"</p> <p>In her mid-20s, Rumer travelled to Pakistan to try to find her father, there to learn he'd recently passed away. Her mother had died from cancer only months prior. \"I'd like to think I've buried all my sadness in this record,\" says Rumer, who worries she's spoken a little too often about her curious parentage. She says she has a tendency to \"go dark\" in interviews, especially when the subject comes up. \"I haven't really got any skin left, you know?\"</p> <p>She says there's a third album in the works, a more cheerful one, but before she can finish it, \"I just want to observe life again. Feel a part of the natural rhythm of life.\" With this in mind I ask if her brief return to restaurant work was an effort to recapture the calm before the clamour brought on by <em>Seasons of My Soul</em>. \"I think I just like doing my own thing,\" she says. \"I'm not very interested in being famous. It's good to make up for lost time, all the years I didn't earn money. But the fame \u2026 You can keep that. Not bothered.\"</p> <p>Of course this is the sort of thing it's easy for an artist to say once they're successful. And if it came from a younger musician, you'd smile and nod and think: sure. Rumer, though, gives the impression of someone fairly honestly processing two bountiful but stressful years that followed a decade of meandering \u2013 polishing cutlery, cooking for hippies, handing out popcorn.</p> <p>\"There are good points and bad points to coming in late in the game,\" she says. \"You adapt better when you're younger, you let it mould you. But I can't let it mould me because I already know what's real. I know what it's like to sit on the tube, going round and round on the Circle Line not wanting to get off and go to work. I know what it's like to wonder: where's my life going? To feel like you're getting older.\"</p> <p>At this the waiter swoops in to take our plates, pleased to have a nugget of information to deliver. The Union opened in 1990, he tells us. Not a great fact, but Rumer checks the bill to ensure it includes a decent tip.</p> <p><em>Boys Don't Cry is out now on Atlantic</em></p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago I came across the story of an unlikely wedding. The Gambian president Yahya Jammeh \u2013 an unpleasant dictator of the type who gives African leaders a bad name \u2013 decided to execute nine prisoners, and boasted that everyone else on death row would be dead within a month. On&#xa0;the very same day he presided over this killing spree in the Gambia, Jammeh got married in Ghana.</p> <p>As I tweeted the story, I noticed an interesting reaction. Although the twittersphere expressed horror at the juxtaposition of Jammeh's executions and his marriage to a 22-year old Ghanaian graduate (who became his third wife), neither of these revelations seemed to provoke much surprise. Instead the question I kept getting asked was: \"How can Jammeh have had a wedding in Ghana when he isn't even there?\"</p> <p>I had never stopped to think about this before, but I suppose if you're not used to this Ghanaian tradition, it must seem strange. It is perfectly common not to attend your own wedding in Ghana. Just last week my auntie had a wedding in Ghana, despite the fact that she was in&#xa0;London and&#xa0;her husband was&#xa0;in Germany. Her relatives in Ghana weren't going to let those minor details get in the way.&#xa0;As&#xa0;far as they are concerned, the union is between their families as much as it is between the individuals getting married \u2013 the bride and groom simply don't need to show up.</p> <p>That's not the only thing about West African weddings that are, well, different. Nigerian weddings are notorious in these parts for their excessive quirks. Anyone who saw the Barbie and Ken Nigerian wedding photos that were circulating on Facebook recently would have noticed that the couple was covered in cash. \"Spraying\" the newlywed couple with money is standard fare at Nigerian weddings. The previous Nigerian government was so worried about this \"abuse\" of its currency, the&#xa0;naira, that it tried to turn spraying into a criminal offence carrying at least six months' imprisonment.</p> <p>That didn't stop Nigerians, whose self-confessed \"love of exhibitionism\" manifests itself beautifully in weddings. A Nigerian friend, who is currently engaged, complained that&#xa0;her family was insisting on a&#xa0;guest list&#xa0;that was simply too big. I&#xa0;sympathised \u2013 common problem with weddings, right? I&#xa0;told her about a Ghanaian friend who was having a similar row with her mother over the latter's non-negotiable 350 invitees. 350? My Nigerian friend replied: \"No, no \u2013 you don't understand. My family is insisting on inviting 5,000.\"</p> <p>It turns out that the whole village has been invited to her wedding. In the closest thing to a compromise she has been able to reach, 500 will be invited inside the house while the remaining 4,500 will have to watch the ceremony on a big-screen TV outside \u2013 think Henman Hill at Wimbledon.</p> <p>African wedding tradition shows no sign of fading, although most people do go to their own ceremonies, and the growing love affair with western-style white weddings means that far from not enjoying the limelight of the big day, many couples now get to enjoy it twice over.</p> <p>But even when it comes to traditional marriage there are \u2013 I&#xa0;can&#xa0;think of no better way to say this \u2013 truths universally acknowledged. I've yet to encounter a culture where men escape wedding-day anxiety. I was in Mali recently, covering the conquest of the country's desert north by al-Qaida-linked insurgents, when I met a&#xa0;local&#xa0;journalist minutes after he had fled from one of the most dangerous towns under Islamist control. It had been a narrow escape. He looked anxious. I asked if he was all right.&#xa0;He said no, he was stressed and tense. I asked him if it was because of what he had seen in northern Mali, or perhaps because&#xa0;of the threat of being kidnapped or killed. \"Oh no, nothing to do with work,\" he said. \"I'm getting married tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Email Afua at <a href=\"mailto:afua.hirsch@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">afua.hirsch@theguardian.com</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch</a> for all her articles in one place.

We think in a few days we will be done with the investigation.\"</p> <p>Four days after the attacks on the consulate and a second accommodation compound left Stevens and three more US diplomats dead, a more detailed picture of the assault is emerging.</p> <p>Libyan investigators say witnesses and mobile phone footage indicate that the attackers, armed with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades, used the riot as cover for the attack.</p> <p>\"Some people came in a special car to Benghazi, they covered their faces,\" said Shihaibi. He said the leader of Ansar al-Sharia had denied responsibility but brigade personnel remain under the spotlight.</p> <p>This was confirmed by the head of the Benghazi Special Security Committee, the national gendarmerie, Fawzi Yunis Gaddafi, jailed by the former regime despite coming from the same tribe as the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi. He said he viewed mobile phone footage: \"We saw them (Ansar al-Sharia), some of them.\"</p> <p>The al-Sharia brigade remains barricaded behind the heavy iron gates of its Benghazi compound, refusing to meet journalists. \"It was pre-planned \u2013 100%\" said Iusef Magarief, president of the newly elected national congress.</p> <p>Four suspects have been arrested but their identities are being kept secret, part of a disjointed investigation that is symptomatic of the chaos that continues a year after the revolution. What evidence there might have been at the consulate has been trampled by sightseers. Two wounded attackers are being treated in a city hospital but have not been interviewed, with local police fearing to confront the Sharia militia who stand guard around the building. And Libya has yet to give permission for an FBI team dispatched to Libya to work in Benghazi.</p> <p>But anxiety about the attack is everywhere in this city. \"It is chaos, only chaos, we need the United Nations here,\" said Mailand Saad, a local businessman. \"We need to defeat these bloody people, these extremists.\"</p> <p>More than 600 community leaders gathered on Saturday at a conference, the Committee of the Wise People of Benghazi, to promise help in finding the militants. Conference organiser Alem Ali said leaders had agreed a joint demand that rogue militias must surrender or be disarmed by force. \"If they do not join legitimate armed forces, the tribes have authorised the government to take action.\"</p> <p>Sulaiman Mohammed, dressed in the traditional white robe, white and embroidered gold waistcoat and red fez, said tribal leaders had agreed to hunt terrorists in their midst. \"It's a bad thing and cowardly people did this. I tell you, the killer is here, and he will be found.\"</p> <p>There is anxiety about unilateral American action, amid reports that the Obama administration is under pressure to show determination with a presidential election looming. \"We know the pressure on Mr Obama, there is the election, there is Romney and the Republicans [demanding action].\" said Salah Jehuda, a prominent local MP who worked as a business analyst in Washington. He said a US strike on militants in Libya could inflame nationalist sentiment.</p> <p>\"There should be action, but not by the Americans. Maybe it [American action] would solve it in 48 hours, but the fact of foreign forces on the ground creates another problem,\" he said.</p>",

Vince Cable \u2013 the caring face of the coalition, to the extent that it has one \u2013 announced on Friday that rewards will be limited to 12 months' salary. In principle, there's nothing wrong with the Department for Business giving recession-hit firms more certainty about their potential liabilities. But the real sadness about Cable's latest intervention is the signal it sends about the coalition's priorities during the deepest slump in living memory.</p> <p>This is a government in the grip of a clapped-out ideology, as out of date as the suits from Margaret Thatcher's 1980s wardrobe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/30/margaret-thatchers-suits-for-sale\" title=\"\">that recently came up for auction</a>: it's what Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, calls \"retro economics\", and it's wrong-headed, for four reasons.</p> <p>First, it is nonsense to suggest that during the weakest upturn in living memory, when much of the eurozone \u2013 our biggest trading partner \u2013 is on the floor, the US is stalling, and British households are hamstrung by the debts from the boom years, what's holding firms back from hiring new workers is a bit of red tape.</p> <p>It was this idea, still rife on the Tory right, that motivated venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft's report on employment law, commissioned by David Cameron earlier this year. Yet America's ultra-flexible labour market is stuck in the doldrums; while Germany, where employers face far more rules and regulations, has halved its unemployment rate since the peak of the crisis.</p> <p>Beecroft's own report acknowledges the fact that his recommendations are based more on anecdote and hunch than sound economic analysis. \"Quantifying the loss of jobs arising from the burden of regulation, and the economic value of those jobs, is an impossible task,\" he says. \"How many more businesses would there be, how many people would they employ, how many more people would existing businesses employ, how profitable would all these businesses be? Who knows?\"</p> <p>Yet the Tory right continue to seize on his proposals, and others like them, as a way to unleash the \"wealth creators\", and kick-start growth.</p> <p>Second, even if the argument that cutting red tape boosts jobs had firmer economic foundations, it's hard to see it as relevant to the UK. Analysis by the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" title=\"\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> suggests that only the US and Canada make it easier for firms to fire their staff.</p> <p>Third, though business confidence will have to be an important factor in restoring economic growth, consumers' mood matters too. Hard-pressed employees are hardly likely to feel more secure if they are told that it's now easier still for them to lose their jobs.</p> <p>Finally, it's one legacy of the crisis of the past five years that a growing number of economists are beginning to argue that not only does slashing red tape not create new jobs, but increasing workers' bargaining power might actually help to generate recovery. <a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2011/04/08/inequality-and-growth/\" title=\"\">The International Monetary Fund</a> \u2013 hardly a hotbed of lefties \u2013 has made a link between widening income inequality and stagnating growth. The <a href=\"http://unctad.org/en/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development</a> has gone further, and urged western governments to adopt a full-blown incomes policy \u2013 even more retro than Mrs T's shoulder-padded power suits \u2013 to boost the living standards of low-paid workers, and stoke domestic demand.</p> <p>Those at the bottom of the pay scale, the argument goes, are more likely to spend what they earn \u2013 and create demand \u2013 than super-rich business owners whose wealth leaches away offshore, or piles up unspent. The idea remains taboo even on the left; but it may be that re-regulating the jobs market, not deregulating it, is a surer route to economic success.</p> <p>Yet in a time of deep anxiety, the coalition's best plan is to cut the recompense for staff who have been chucked on the scrap heap through no fault of their own.</p>",
  "<p>Pound for pound, the Highland wildcat is probably the most vicious carnivore held in zoos in Britain. They are muscled, highly aggressive creatures that can kill, in seconds, any rodent, rabbit or hare unlucky enough to cross their paths. Males often grow to the size of medium-sized dogs and can weigh up to 8kg.</p> <p>Even humans can come a cropper in encounters with them, as Robbie Rankin, a keeper at the Highland Wildlife Park \u2013 which houses a substantial colony of wildcats \u2013 has attested. \"I have come out of our enclosure with blood dripping from my hands on many occasions,\" he once told me.</p> <p>The Highland wildcat is, in short, a magnificent predator. However, it is also a highly endangered one. Indeed, according to a report published last week, <em>Felis silvestris grampia</em> is now hovering at the edge of extinction and could be wiped out, in the wild, in the next few months.</p> <p>A report, produced by the Scottish Wildcat Association, reviewed 2,000 records of camera trap recordings, eyewitness reports and road kills, and concluded there may be only about 40 wildcats left in Scotland in the wild today.</p> <p>\"However you juggle the figures, it is hard to find anything positive,\" says Steve Piper, the association's chairman. \"The overwhelming evidence is that the wildcat is going to be extinct within months.\"</p> <p>The prospect is alarming, to put it mildly. A species that has earned itself a reputation for its aloof ferocity \u2013 a perfect emblem for an independent Scotland, you might argue \u2013 may soon disappear from our shores. Not every wildcat expert agrees with the association's grim prognosis. A separate report, by Scottish National Heritage, last month concluded there may be up to 400 still living in the wild.</p> <p>That is certainly a more encouraging figure, but only slightly. Even if their population is measured in hundreds, it means there are fewer members of Britain's only native species of cat than there are tigers in the wild. The future of this glorious, distinctive animal is worryingly uncertain, no matter how you stack up their numbers. But how has this happened and what can be done to save the wildcat?</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the answer to the first question is a lot easier to provide than the latter and stems from recent studies into the origins of wildcats. These can be grouped into three main genetic clusters, say scientists: the European wildcat, <em>Felis silvestris silvestris</em>; the Middle Eastern wildcat, <em>Felis silvestris lybica</em>; and the southern African wildcat, <em>Felis silvestris cafra</em>. Crucially the Highland wildcat is a member of the first of these subspecies while the domestic moggie that sleeps on your sofa and squawks for food in your kitchen is a member of the Middle Eastern subspecies.</p> <p>So how did descendants of the Middle Eastern wildcat end up in our homes and why is that important for the fate of our own native wildcats? The answer is straightforward: with the invention of agriculture in the Middle East 10,000 years ago, the first stores of grain were established. Mice and rats moved in and wildcats \u2013 of the Middle Eastern variety \u2013 turned up to hunt them. Soon the cats adapted to life with humans and, as farming spread westwards, the cats came with them. Today there are an estimated 10&#xa0;million ancestors of these early domestic cats in homes across Britain.</p> <p>And that is a real problem for the Highland wildcat. Its population had already been drastically reduced by loss of habitat in historic times, says David Hetherington, of the Cairngorms Wildcat Project. \"Wildcats disappeared in lowland England around 1800. Then they vanished from Wales and northern England around 1860. Finally, they went from southern Scotland. All we have left is a few hundred around the Cairngorms and places like the Black Isle.\"</p> <p>However, it is not the loss of habitat that is causing the current cat crisis in the Cairngorms. It is the spread of the domestic cat. Occasionally household animals go wild, mate and create colonies of feral cats. These form at the edges of villages and in farms. Some of these feral animals meet up with wildcats and they mate. Female wildcats become pregnant and give birth to kittens that are not purebred wildcats. Slowly the species loses its unique status and vigour and animals become hybridised.</p> <p>\"Essentially the Highland wildcat is being eradicated by an alien invasive species: the domestic cat,\" says Steve Piper. \"Estimates suggest that there are now up to 100,000 domestic cats that have gone feral in the Scottish Highlands. The fact that domestic cats can survive there shows that they are a very resourceful species. However, that success \u2013 measured by their population \u2013 shows the kind of trouble that the Highland wildcat is in today. There are a few hundred of them \u2013 at best \u2013 surrounded by 100,000 feral domestic cats. They are being outbred.\"</p> <p>The urgency of the problem led conservationists to meet in Scotland last week to develop a plan to save the wildcat. \"We cannot wait for another couple of years to do a new census,\" says Piper. \"We need to act immediately.\"</p> <p>The exact nature of that plan has yet to be finalised but almost certainly involves the widescale neutering of feral cats. \"That will bring numbers down and take the pressure off the Highland wildcat,\" says Piper.</p> <p>The situation is, therefore, not hopeless, a point that is reinforced by the example of the Iberian lynx, a feline whose story shares many features with the Highland wildcat. Ten years ago, there were only around 100 of these equally magnificent hunters left in the wild. Hunted and snared across Andaluc\u00eda, the lynx \u2013 which is almost twice as big as a wildcat \u2013 was also rapidly approaching extinction. However, its prospects have been transformed by a rescue project that boosted numbers to more than 300 and which could reach a thousand by the end of the decade.</p> <p>I recently joined conservationists working on the Iberian lynx project and was struck by the enthusiasm and commitment of its staff \u2013 and by the considerable resources they needed to do their work.</p> <p>Having persuaded local hunters and landowners to stop shooting and laying down snares in lynx territory, conservationists have since been capturing animals and relocating young adult lynxes in protected territory. Captive breeding centres have also been established and animals reintroduced into the wild. Warrens of rabbits \u2013 a lynx's prime source of food \u2013 have also been established.</p> <p>As a result, lynx numbers have bounced back, though we note the price tag. A total of \u20ac33m (\u00a328.5m) \u2013 most of it provided by the regional government of Andaluc\u00eda \u2013 has been spent so far on saving the lynx. A further \u20ac50m has been committed for work to reintroduce the lynx to other areas of Spain and Portugal, with the bulk of this coming from the EU.</p> <p>And that, we should note, is the level of expenditure that is likely to be needed to save the Scottish Highland wildcat. Millions of pounds will be required to ensure its survival. Most of us would think it money well spent, though we should also consider the larger issue: it is relatively easy to drive a species towards extinction, but it is very hard and very expensive to bring it back from the brink.</p>",
  "<p>He did it very well, did David Cameron. One of the dimensions of being prime minister at which he excels is crafting the right language and striking the appropriate tone on grave or shocking occasions or, in this case, responding on behalf of both government and country to a shockingly grave report. He delivered a model statement of penitence for what he correctly called \"the double injustice\" done to the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> stadium crush.</p> <p>It is always easier, mind, to say sorry for a disaster that was someone else's fault. The bigger test is what happens next. It is wrong to think of Hillsborough, and the disgusting conduct of some members of the South Yorkshire force, as a tragedy to be deeply regretted and then filed away as an event belonging to the distant past. It is true that stadium design has been massively improved and methods of crowd control have become more sophisticated. Football hooliganism, fear of which was a contributory factor, has largely disappeared from Britain. So a tragedy of that type is less likely to happen now.</p> <p>What cannot be said with so much confidence is that the police would never behave like that again. It would be a comfort to think that Hillsborough was an isolated example from long ago of officers attempting to conceal their own neglect and incompetence by lying about what had happened and smearing the victims of their mistakes. It would also be a false consolation. What happened at Hillsborough was not an isolated one-off, but a particularly horrific example from a pattern of policing scandals over many decades. The very long list includes multiple miscarriages of justice such as the false imprisonment of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham-six\" title=\"\">Birmingham Six</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/guildford-four\" title=\"\">Guildford Four</a>. The shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/oct/01/demenezes\" title=\"\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> and the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">Ian Tomlinson</a> at the G20 protests are two more recent cases where the police made appalling errors and then tried to cover up their mistakes. Scotland Yard's failure to properly investigate the hacking scandal exposed alarming lacunae in the ethical and professional judgment of some of the most senior officers in the Met. Other officers face trials for corruptly selling information to newspapers.</p> <p>There are many dedicated men and women doing a job which can be highly demanding, often dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening, and they do it in a spirit of public service. But that cannot be said of the police as a collective. Hillsborough is a particularly grotesque illustration of a culture that to this day too often puts its own interests before those of the public it is paid to serve. Repeated scandal is what happens when you have a closed profession highly resistant to scrutiny or criticism whose default instinct is to protect its own.</p> <p>It is also the result of a failure of political will to pursue reform. The approach of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair was not to challenge police working practices or culture. For her, they were \"one of us\" and crucial allies in her epic battles with the trades unions. Mrs Thatcher responded to an earlier report about Hillsborough by telling her then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, to mute the government response to devastating evidence of police misconduct. For Tony Blair, being pro-police was a vital ingredient of being New Labour. He loaded them with many additional powers and generously increased budgets. To a reform-minded home secretary, Mr Blair once demanded: \"Do we really want a fight with the police?\"</p> <p>To see what he was frightened of, you only have to look at the trade union of their rank-and-file officers, the Police Federation. Visiting the Federation's annual conference is the scariest date in the home secretary's diary. Earlier in the year, they boorishly humiliated Theresa May when she tried to make her voice heard through the booing and heckling. She should not take that personally. They dealt out the same treatment to Labour home secretaries too.</p> <p>Millions of employees in the private sector have learnt that there is no longer such a thing as a \"job for life\" while millions in the public sector have been challenged to justify their existence. Working practices have been revolutionised; organisations radically restructured; pay and conditions dramatically changed. Teachers, nurses, ambulance drivers, doctors, local authority workers and firefighters have all felt bracing blasts of government-driven change. The big exception has been the police.</p> <p>There has been some progress, including a serious effort to purge racism since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case</a>. But compared with everyone else, the police are the last unreformed public service.</p> <p>Because Labour prime ministers tend to become nervous of looking anti-police, it probably takes Conservative ministers to reform the forces of law and order. David Cameron and Theresa May made a bold start when they commissioned the first fundamental review of police pay and practices in 30 years by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/tom-winsor-chief-inspector-constabulary\" title=\"\">Tom Winsor</a>, the former rail regulator. They have also demonstrated a seriousness of intent about implementing his recommendations by making him chief inspector of constabulary, an appointment which has provoked fierce outrage in the ranks. When he takes up the post this autumn, it will be the first time that the role has been performed by someone from outside the police since its creation in 1856.</p> <p>The government has also set great store by the novelty of elected police and crime commissioners, the most dramatic change in police governance ever. Making chief constables accountable to commissioners, so it is believed, will challenge the whole culture of policing. Forces will have someone independent constantly looking over their shoulders. One minister who is an enthusiast for commissioners says: \"What would have happened in South Yorkshire in 1989 had there been an elected person in charge? Their whole purpose in life would have been to find out what the hell happened.\"</p> <p>I would certainly hope so, but there are problems with the commissioners even before a single one is in post. The quality of the candidates is patchy, ranging from people with the potential to be excellent invigilators to old party hacks. The number of people turning out to vote is going to be abysmal because, when the original timetable slipped, the government took a crazy decision to make these standalone elections in the inclement month of November rather than combine them with the county council elections next May. Most informed people I talk to, including those running the campaigns, reckon they will be lucky if turnout averages 15%. Commissioners elected on such a small vote may have legitimacy issues which will embolden the police to try to ignore them.</p> <p>An even more important question is whether the Winsor reforms can be pushed through against the ferocious hostility of many officers. They don't like his proposal to widen the pool of talent from which police leaders are drawn by allowing direct entry into the higher ranks, breaking the tradition that all officers must start out as a beat constable. Another resisted reform is that officers should be rewarded for their skills, performance and hours spent on the front line rather than the length of service. Were we talking about any other part of the public sector, ministers could just get on and implement these changes. They can't do this with the police because of the no-strike deal. So the fate of Mr Winsor's most crucial recommendations are being determined by a body called the police arbitration tribunal.</p> <p>On top of which, the minister most passionate about reform has just quit. <a href=\"http://www.nickherbert.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Herbert,</a> who had a real zeal for the challenge, left the government in the recent reshuffle. He has been replaced by <a href=\"http://www.damiangreenmp.org.uk/galleryflash.aspx?id=25\" title=\"\">Damian Green</a>, who was moved to the police brief from immigration, and must think that all the clich\u00e9s about the frying pan and the fire apply. A few years back, Mr Green was the target of a ludicrously misconceived police operation when officers raided the MP's home and parliamentary offices. So Mr Green is probably not the sort to go soft on police reform. In the end, though, the outcome of this battle will most depend on the mettle of his seniors, the home secretary and the prime minister. The police never come quietly. As one former chief constable puts it, there is an \"inbuilt conservatism\" about the service which makes it \"often risk-averse, process-dominated and defensive.\" It is a big thing for governments to take on the police, which is why ministers have so rarely done it.</p> <p>David Cameron demonstrated how accomplished he can be at making a pitch-perfect parliamentary statement with his eloquent apology for Hillsborough. Getting the police to accept and implement reform will require different leadership skills. This will be a test of how much steel there is in his spine.</p>",
  "<p>The former girlfriend of the leading novelist of the beat generation Jack Kerouac has revealed details of their affair and his descent into bizarre behaviour on finding fame, in a new book to be published more than 40 years after his death.</p> <p>Joyce Johnson, an accomplished author, also dispels the myth that Kerouac's writing was effortlessly spontaneous. Where he claimed his novel <em>On the Road </em>was written in a blast of energy during three weeks in 1951 she recalls that he spent years revising his work and carefully crafted each paragraph.</p> <p>Her book is just part of a revival of the cult that surrounded Kerouac which has this year prompted three feature films and a documentary, as well as books and an exhibition at the British Library.</p> <p>Johnson, now 77, describes him as a \"very odd person\" who treated her dreadfully but was the love of her life. She delves more deeply into his background, his childhood and his rise to fame and chronicles the toll his celebrity status and his drinking took on their relationship.</p> <p>She was 21 when she met Kerouac. \"Jack was without a place to live and had no money. Since I was a young writer who had her own apartment, Allen [Ginsberg] set up a blind date.\" They were together for two years.</p> <p>Kerouac became a sensation after <em>On the Road</em>, which blighted their relationship: \"Women everywhere were offering themselves. He was a celebrity, which was very hard for him. In public situations, he had to drink.\"</p> <p>Johnson's book, <em>The Voice Is All: The Lonely Victory of Jack Kerouac</em>, to be published this month, explores how the \"spontaneous\" writing of <em>On the Road</em> was actually \"a much longer process \u2026 each paragraph had to be a 'poem'.\"</p> <p>She shows how Kerouac's French Canadian background both enriched his prose and gave him a unique outsider's vision of the US. She details his slow, often painful development as a writer, with early struggles to master English.</p> <p>She said: \"He spoke Joual, a Canadian dialect of French. Other biographies have not looked really deeply enough at the implications of Jack's Franco-American heritage, the fact that English was a second language \u2026 There was always a process of translation going on, trying to find the English equivalent for the French inside his head \u2026 Now looking at the text of <em>On the Road</em>, I can see French inflections all the way through it.\"</p> <p>She recalls: \"I thought I'd never met anyone who'd lived with more absolute freedom \u2026 A need to keep moving, as if whenever he stayed anywhere too long, he exhausted the present by soaking it in too intensely.\"</p> <p>Exhibits at the library will include the 120ft scroll on which he typed <em>On the Road</em>, according to his claims in 1951. After repeated rejection by publishers and years of despair, his story of a hedonistic road trip across North America was published in 1957, since when it has sold five million copies in the US alone.</p> <p>Kerouac died an alcoholic recluse in 1969, aged 47, having tried in vain to interest Marlon Brando in a screen adaptation of <em>On the Road</em>. Francis Ford Coppola sensed the book's cinematic potential, but it has only now been made into a film, directed by Walter Salles, with Coppola as executive producer, to be released in Britain in October.</p> <p>Rebecca Yeldham, one of its co-producers, said the story still connects with young people, particularly in times of adversity: \"You read it through the lens of the moment that you're in, and through \u2026 your own life experience. This book is still so timely and contemporary.\"</p> <p>Kerouac's frenetic prose conveyed the energy of a postwar generation and the influence of jazz. It is said that he wrote with the freedom of a jazz musician, breaking the rules with grammatically irreverent sentences shaped by sound.</p> <p>He is played in three semi-biographical films by Sam Riley in <em>On the Road</em>; by Jean-Marc Barr in <em>Big Sur</em>, an adaptation of the novel; and by Jack Huston in <em>Kill Your Darlings,</em> inspired by a true-life murder story told in <em>And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks</em>, by Kerouac and his friend William Burroughs, which was not published until 2008. Daniel Radcliffe plays fellow beat writer Allen Ginsberg.</p> <p>Michael Polish, writer-director of <em>Big Sur</em>, said his film will show Kerouac's battle against alcohol and the pressure of being designated the voice of a generation. Asked why Kerouac had inspired so many films now, Polish suggested that, while traditional film-makers had been wary \u2013 \"the books are hard to adapt as they don't allow themselves the typical three-act structure\" \u2013 independent directors have shown how the rules can be broken.</p> <p>There are also reports of a screen adaptation of <em>The Dharma Bums</em>, Kerouac's second bestselling novel, according to Paul Slovak, an editor at Viking, which is publishing a book on Kerouac by a former lover.</p> <p>Isaac Gewirtz, curator of the New York Public Library, which has the world's largest collection of Kerouac papers, said his reputation as a serious writer had suffered: \"His supporters see him as an inspired prophet; his detractors as a boorish man and artless ranter whose malevolent influence helped spawn the loathed counter-culture.\"</p> <p>The scroll in the British Library exhibition was bought privately for \u00a31.68m, a record price for a literary manuscript.</p>",
  "<p>A few days on from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough </a>report, one powerful image abides. It is of three stoic women, speaking with power and clarity about the struggles they've endured these past 23 years. Two of them, Margaret Aspinall and Anne Williams, lost their sons, respectively James, 18, and Kevin, 15, at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final.</p> <p>The third woman, Sheila Coleman, spokeswoman for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, has faced a different kind of struggle. Her task has been to keep the appalling injustices of the disaster in the public eye, so that fellow mothers such as Margaret and Anne could, finally, get the world to accept what they had been saying with patient insistence. That their sons went to that football match in peace; that they did not contribute to their own deaths; that their lives could have been saved, and that the real architects of the Hillsborough tragedy are still at large, still unaccountable.</p> <p>This was a tragedy with deep roots. For those who lean to the left, it's too easy to utter the word \"Thatcher\" and to link her government with everything wretched that happened in the 1980s. But it's enough, for now, to note that the style of government she fostered brought a confrontational atmosphere to everyday life. In the form of Thatcher herself, and her ally Norman Tebbit, there was little trace of any form of patrician Tory benevolence. Their credo seemed more akin to a rigid take on national identity whereby every True Brit toed the line and worked hard, uncomplainingly, for whatever they were given. Anyone who bucked against the Tories' values was deemed a \"wrecker.\" The play-out to the Tom Robinson Band's 1979 song Power In The Darkness lists a catalogue of \"wreckers\" including \"\u2026 football hooligans, juvenile delinquents, lesbians and left-wing scum.\"</p> <p>Among those toeing the line, of course, were the police. There are reasons for their apparent sense of immunity. Early on, the Conservatives implemented a 45% pay rise for the force. Unsurprisingly, this fostered a spirit of kinship and loyalty among the nation's constabularies. Simultaneously, the government started into its programme of wage cuts and closures in the nationalised industries. Which inevitably set police on a collision course with pickets as industrial action escalated in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Also, there seemed little sympathy in their ranks for those living in the nation's poorest communities. Complaints were rife that newly ordained snatch squads were abusing their powers of stop-and-search (the hugely unpopular \"Suss\" process) to humiliate peaceable citizens. Resentment smouldered in multi-ethnic quarters such as Brixton and St Paul's, Bristol, where the overriding feeling was that law and order did not apply to the forces tasked with imposing it.</p> <p>With unemployment rocketing from 1.5 million in May 1979 to nearly 3 million by the end of 1980, these communities further felt a complete disenfranchisement from any likelihood of work. So the Brixton riots of April 1981 came as no surprise; neither did the disturbances that flared up in Toxteth, Liverpool, a few months later.</p> <p>A year or two after Power In The Darkness, Tom Robinson might have added \"scousers\" to that ironic list of demons. The 1980s oversaw a radical transformation in Liverpool's national standing and its citizens' popular perception. Gone were the lovable Merseybeat bands of the 1960s, and the daffy but adorable Liver Birds. In their place came a family of incorrigible scroungers, in<em> Bread</em>, followed by a litany of skivers, whingers and whiners in <em>Brookside</em> and <em>Boys from the Blackstuff</em>.</p> <p>Just as the mop top came to symbolise a certain Liverpudlian elan, so the hackneyed bubble perm, worn with a sloppy tracksuit and a defiant moustache, stereotyped the workshy scouser of Thatcher's Britain. Whereas the previous generation's assumption was that Liverpudlians were gregarious, generous, witty and creative, the 1980s version were viewed as chippy, aggressive and innately inclined towards criminality.</p> <p>And then there was Militant. Even among lifelong Labour voters, opinions are polarised to this day over Liverpool's Militant-dominated city council of the early 1980s. Most believe their regime was in part responsible for Liverpool's acute downturn. But we now know that, in the wake of the Toxteth riots, Chancellor Geoffrey Howe urged Thatcher to abandon Liverpool to a programme of \"managed decline.\" In those circumstances, it was going to take a different brand of local government simply to arrest that decline, let alone reverse it. Yet the sharp suits and fondness for the limelight of the council's de facto leader Derek Hatton only added fuel to the anti-Liverpudlian pyre.</p> <p>By that time Mrs Thatcher had been re-elected, and the growing sense that the police did her bidding was palpable. Having gained experience and, perhaps, harbouring grudges from the riots of 1981, the mounted police took no nonsense from the pickets at Orgreave at the culmination of the miners' strike of 1984. Their actions were so violent that the Police And Criminal Evidence Act was re-drafted to include a code of conduct for police, as well as suspects.</p> <p>In football, in the English first division, crowds were on the decline and hooliganism was on the rise. With outside broadcast units joining the rest of nation on strike in the 1980s, it went almost unnoticed that Liverpool and Everton won the league championship almost every year.</p> <p>But the 1984-85 season was marred by violence at football grounds, culminating in tragedy when 39 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus\" title=\"\">Juventus</a> supporters died at the European Cup final in Brussels after they were charged by Liverpool fans. Mrs Thatcher demanded solutions to the British Disease, and nothing \u2013 ID cards, electric fences \u2013 was considered too draconian. In the event, the culture of football violence ended organically the following season when ecstasy-fuelled Acid House ushered in a new era of communality.</p> <p>It was against this social backdrop, then, that the events of 15 April 1989 unfolded at Hillsborough. Four of us set off by car from Liverpool that morning. There was a prolonged tailback across the Snake Pass, meaning we didn't get into Sheffield until after one. It's absurd to suggest that nobody approaching the ground had had a drink, but I'd seriously doubt that anybody had time to get seriously drunk. It's equally pat to say that everyone had tickets \u2013 but the touts soon put paid to that. They were virtually giving tickets away on the walk-up to Hillsborough.</p> <p>As the Leppings Lane end of the ground came into sight, and the singing amplified, so the crowd flow simply stopped. We waited. There was no information. Understandably, the police were jumpy. These were football hooligans they were facing down. Liverpool fans. Scousers. Militants. The worst sort of wreckers. Everybody knows, now, what happened next.</p> <p>The prime minister's apology carried symbolic value as it represented an owning-up to corruption that went to the heart of the Establishment. That, for me, was a historic admission. As for the later apologies \u2013 from<em> Sun</em> editors past and present Dominic Mohan and Kelvin MacKenzie, the FA \u2013 they're worthless. They only came as a result of the culprits finally realising they had no choice<em> but</em> to apologise.</p> <p>On that day in 89, I was among the fortunate ones who went left, where others went straight ahead. For 23 years, those of us who were at that game to support Liverpool have had to endure, at best, the suggestion that somehow we were responsible for the deaths of our fellow fans. Or to listen to the wretched line of \"just get over it\". For Margaret Aspinall and Anne Williams, it has been far, far worse. I'm in awe of them, and Sheila Coleman \u2013 the women who just wouldn't let it lie.</p> <p><em>Kevin Sampson is a novelist and screenwriter whose work includes Awaydays and Powder</em></p> <p>Comments will be open later this morning</p>",
  "<p>If ever there was a tale of two diaries, it's now. Both Edwina Currie and Sally Burton are to publish diaries \u2013 the former, her second volume, the latter, those of her husband, the late actor Richard. Both tomes exude a background hum of ulterior motivation so obvious that it's almost delicious.</p> <p>First, Currie's diaries, the \"good bits\" already filleted out by the <em>Daily Mail</em>. Currie has every right to publish. In a way, I applaud her refusal to dissemble, and spare fellow politicos' blushes. Her unceasing conceit and dearth of self-awareness are also priceless. On Planet Edwina: she's only passed over for jobs because people are intimidated by her; almost every man she meets desires her; and all other women are judged on whether they have the job she wants and/or their weight. Oh, and John Major could have been \"great\" had they remained lovers.</p> <p>Currie muses: \"If I'd stayed by his side, would he have retained his imagination, the drive and risk-taking ability?\" Edwina, pet, who knows? What we do know is that she used the \"I bonked Major\" line to flog the first set of diaries. This time, despite the fact that the relationship is over, Currie doesn't stop rattling on about Major. Everything he says and does is viewed through the Currie filter of \"I've seen you naked\". Jeez \u2013 if ever a man was punished for his infidelity. No wonder Major has spent most of his post-PM life hiding behind cricket stumps.</p> <p>But never mind him. After enduring it the first time around, his wife Norma has to be wounded and humiliated afresh, just to hawk Edwina's diaries. After seeing Norma somewhere, Edwina writes condescendingly: \"Norma looked lovely \u2013 she's really grown into her role\". Unbelievable. Note to Norma: if you ever finally exploded, and wanted to fight Edwina, may I be the first to offer to hold your coat for you.</p> <p>Moving on to Richard Burton's diaries. Dickie isn't slow with the acerbic one-liners (Marlon Brando is a \"self-indulgent obese fart\"; Lucille Ball \"a monster of staggering charmlessness\"). Then there is the Liz Taylor circus. Sally has previously vented her irritation about this, and who could blame her? Imagine having your life defined by your late husband's former wife (twice), relentlessly banging on about their \"grand amour\", as if you were just the housekeeper who came in at the end to run his baths, and heat up the Ovaltine?</p> <p>For Sally, LT must have been the ultimate nightmare ex \u2013 an old flame that just wouldn't go out however many damp tea towels you tried to throw over it. Saying that, one suspects that Sally may be being a tad disingenuous about wanting these diaries published to show Burton's \"love for words\". While the diaries relate Burton's big passion for Taylor they also reveal that he disparaged, ridiculed and despaired of her towards the end, while he was with Sally - writing that Liz was fat, \"sloshed\", \"lonely\", a \"mess\", \"losing her teeth\", \"beginning to bore.\"</p> <p>The suspicion forms that Sally's unspoken motivation was to derail, once and for all, the Liz-Dickie show. To demonstrate that, despite all those tales of Burton's sending secret final love letters to Taylor, in which he wrote of yearning to \"come home\" to her, in truth, he had gone right off her, and, considering what he was writing, near despised her. To my mind, this none-too-subtle attempt to undermine the Burton/Taylor-myth looks a bit vindictive \u2013 especially considering that Taylor is dead now, and can't flash those violet eyes, and open that fabulous fishwife mouth, in reply.</p> <p>So, what we have here are two women producing books, both with somewhat unsavoury agendas, with the result of either hurting a woman who is still alive (Norma), or having a vengeful pop at one who is dead (Taylor). A tale of two diaries, indeed. Well played, ladies.</p> <h2>Please tell me it's not true about Vlad the imposter </h2> <p>How disappointing to learn that Vladimir Putin has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19591179\" title=\"\">admitted to staging </a>some of his infamous Action Man stunts. It seems that antics such as <a href=\"http://travel.aol.co.uk/2012/09/14/putin-admits-his-tiger-shooting-stunt-was-staged/\" title=\"\">frolicking with a snow leopard </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/12/vladimir-putin-greek-urns-ridicule\" title=\"\">diving to retrieve Greek urns</a> might have been a tad contrived to make him look good.</p> <p>What a shame for those of us who relished Putin's displays of machismo. Who could forget him overcoming a judo rival in that totally natural unforced-seeming way? Or such images as Putin, topless on horse; Putin, topless with hunting rifle; Putin, topless fishing and, my personal favourite: Putin, topless in weird hat, while fishing and looking sternly into mid-distance. There really was something for everybody.</p> <p>To think that this was all put on, and Putin wasn't just casually going about his daily business, topless, with random fishing rods, rifles, leopards and Greek urns \u2013 which just happened to be lying around \u2013 is a bitter blow. To make amends, Putin should put out a sexy 2013 calendar, perhaps called Just Putin or Vlad Unveiled. The August shot could be of him, topless, imprisoning Pussy Riot.

Use your loaf</h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nutrition.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Nutrition Foundation</a> report says that it's fine to eat bread, even white bread \u2013 it doesn't wreck blood sugar, or trigger obesity or wheat allergies. In response, there's been criticism of the BNF, for their links with food companies. It also bears mentioning that most modern bread has about as close a resemblance to what was once our daily staple as a wimple does to a vajazzle.</p> <p>Still it's oddly refreshing to see bread not receive its customary bashing as the anti-Christ of baked goods. Personally, I don't like white bread because it tastes like bad cake. Nor do I care for gluten-free bread, which I know some people have to eat, but I find the texture akin to loft-cladding.</p> <p>However, what I dislike most are the bread-deniers. People who pointedly push away bread baskets in restaurants, as if they've been offered sliced strychnine. These are often the same people who fall for any old \"health\" baloney, seemingly validated by new ways of eating strangely (\"I eat zero carbs, therefore I am\"). The type who approach dieting as a sinister cult, and are suckers for gurus with The Answer.</p> <p>In truth, there seems nothing inherently wrong with most bread, otherwise the baguette-obsessed French would be in trouble, as opposed to regularly ranking among the slimmest in Europe.</p> <p>What may be wrong is binge-eating 15 slices of toast and jam, all washed down with four litres of fizzy Cola \u2013 but that's enough of my last dinner party. As is so often the case, it's the overeating that's the problem, not what's being eaten. (Who knew?)</p> <p>With this in my mind, please look out for my forthcoming global diet sensation: \"Hey, perhaps we shouldn't eat so much crapola.

  "<p>A row has broken out between animal rights activists and shooting groups over calls for gun magazines to be displayed on newsagents' top shelves.</p> <p>Animal Aid claims a poll it has commissioned suggests that most people want gun magazines showing animals being killed for sport to be treated in a similar way to pornography. Even more want the sale of such publications restricted to people over the age of 18.</p> <p>The NOP poll found that 84% of people favoured a ban on the sale of gun magazines to children, while 74% wanted them banished to the top shelf. Animal Aid claimed the results were a vindication of its campaign, during which it wrote to WH Smith asking it to ban the sale of gun magazine to under-18s. \"Shooting lobbyists have characterised us as 'crazy' and 'extremists',\" said director Andrew Tyler.</p> <p>An Animal Aid report, Gunning For Children: How the Gun Lobby Recruits Young Blood, has warned that children have easy access to publications that \"encourage the killing of animals for 'sport'.\" It highlighted a recent edition of one shooting magazine that carried a two-page article on a hunter who \"fulfilled his dream\" when he went to South Africa and shot a lion.</p> <p>The UK's largest shooting organisation, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said the idea of targeting shooting magazines was misplaced. \"According to the police and successive governments it is in the interests of public safety for children who will shoot to learn the safe handling of firearms,\" said Christopher Graffius, director of communications. \"Shooting magazines educate as well as entertain and not only on firearms; their content covers history, gundogs and conservation. To compare them to pornography is laughable.\"</p> <p>The Professional Publishers Association said the magazines \"are specialist interest titles published responsibly for a targeted audience\".</p>",
  "<p>A British professor of German history has published an extraordinary expos\u00e9 of the secret Nazi past of the man who married her godmother.</p> <p><em>A Small Town Near Auschwitz</em>, written by Mary Fulbrook, who teaches at University College London, and to be published this week, tells the story of Udo Klausa, a man Fulbrook's family believed was involved only in mundane local government during the war years.</p> <p>However, she has unearthed unpublished material that reveals his role as a Nazi backroom administrator of the Holocaust, operating close to Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than a million Jews died. On discovering the true nature of his activities, Fulbrook said: \"I felt literally like I'd been punched in the stomach. I was angry and shocked. I partly wrote the book almost to rub his face posthumously in the murderous consequence of his actions.\"</p> <p>Delving into Klausa's past was especially painful for her because her own mother \u2013 a close friend of Klausa's wife, Alexandra \u2013 was a German-Jewish refugee who lost friends and relatives to the Holocaust. It was through her mother's childhood friendship with Alexandra that Fulbrook obtained access for the first time to Klausa's unpublished memoir, written long after the war, and to dozens of wartime letters written by Alexandra.</p> <p>They reveal a man who \"produced the preconditions\" for selections and deportations. Klausa was the <em>landrat \u2013</em> or civilian administrator \u2013 of a sizeable county in eastern Upper Silesia, north of Auschwitz in Poland, where thousands of people lost their liberty or their lives to his civilian policies. Yet the writings suggest that he never witnessed the results of his actions and had seemingly convinced himself of his own innocence.</p> <p>Fulbrook was shocked to discover how few references there were to atrocities against Jews around Bendsburg, the small town where Klausa and his family lived \u2013 even though people had been burned alive, shot, hanged or deported.</p> <p>One depraved act in a neighbouring county involved forcing Jews to lie for hours forming a path of human paving-stones over which Nazis walked in heavy boots. An eyewitness recorded a German standing on a Jew's face until it was \"squashed to pieces\". \"These omissions from his memoirs are extraordinary,\" Fulbrook said. \"He has no memory of atrocities. This is really important in understanding how the Holocaust was possible. It shows the way in which you could live with that kind of past, cover it up and present yourself as a perfectly decent, ordinary civil servant who had nothing to do with the atrocities.</p> <p>\"If he'd conveyed anything like fear, regret, guilt, shame, I would have felt much more comfortable. But it's just a whitewashed past.\"</p> <p>Letters sent in 1942 by Alexandra to her own mother suggest that Klausa was disturbed by the unfolding events \u2013 they refer to her husband's \"even worse\" mood. But mass killings are mentioned coldly. Alexandra wrote: \"There is constant shooting, everywhere dead Jews are lying around \u2026 One simply can't avoid seeing all this, and the constant shooting drives one quite mad.\"</p> <p>Fulbrook said the material offered a new perspective on perpetrator mentality. Other studies have focused on prominent Nazis and frontline killers or their victims, she said. But the victims only ever saw the people in the frontline of physical violence, the SS and Gestapo, the designated \"perpetrators\". The backroom civilian administrators were unknown to them.</p> <p>She came across Klausa's story while \"idly\" sifting through her mother's old letters. Among them was a typed memento created by Klausa's son in memory of Alexandra. It drew on his mother's own letters. One referred to 15,000 Jews being deported. Fulbrook said: \"I thought, 'Where on earth was she to witness this in one day?'\u2009\"</p> <p>Alexandra was writing from Bendsburg, Fulbrook said. \"I'd never heard of it. I Googled it.\" It was the Germanised name for the occupied Polish town of Bedzin.</p> <p>There was also passing mention of Klausa as a <em>landrat</em>. Fulbrook said that, even though she is a German historian, she does not understand a landrat's functions. There was no literature on it \u2013 \"let alone a landrat close to Auschwitz\".</p> <p>It was after investigating further that she discovered <em>landrats</em> were charged with implementation of Nazi directives. Klausa went along with Nazi policies, ensuring Jews wore the yellow star, did not break the curfew, and did not use public transport or enter areas forbidden to them.</p> <p>After the war, West German law for prosecuting war criminals allowed the defence of \"following orders\" to escape a murder charge. \"Thereby, Klausa fell out of the picture completely,\" Fulbrook said. He was never tried and later became director of a Rhineland regional council. In the book, she writes: \"One part of me wants to yell back at Klausa \u2026 to scream that, without him and countless other functionaries \u2026 Hitler could never have wrought such mass destruction.\"</p>",
  "<p>Vince Cable's business investment bank, announced last week as part of the coalition's latest stab at an industrial strategy, was yet another desperate attempt to bypass the broken British banking system that remains one of the major obstacles to economic recovery.</p> <p>Project Merlin, the painfully choreographed deal between Cable, George Osborne and the biggest banks announced in February last year, was meant to result in a surge of new loans to small businesses; yet net lending continued to fall.</p> <p>Osborne used his autumn party conference speech last year to promise a new policy of \"credit easing\", launched as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/20/george-osborne-scheme-boost-lending\" title=\"\">National Loan Guarantee Scheme in March this year</a>. Not all the banks agreed to participate; the negotiations with lenders about how they would pass on cheaper borrowing costs from the Treasury were long and fraught; and again, nothing happened.</p> <p>A few months later, at the annual Mansion House dinner, Osborne and Sir Mervyn King used their speeches to the black-tie-wearing dignitaries to announce yet another scheme, known as<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/13/george-osborne-funding-for-lending-scheme\" title=\"\"> funding for lending</a> (or FLS), aimed at cutting the cost of borrowing for the banks and persuading them to lend.</p> <p>It's too soon to say whether FLS is having an impact, since it was only launched in July \u2013 though there is some evidence in the housing market of a modest decline in mortgage rates, and a rise in loan-to-value ratios, as a result of government intervention.</p> <p>However, the fact that the Treasury is willing to countenance setting up a new state-backed institution to lend to businesses suggests there remains deep anxiety in Downing Street about the pace of business lending.</p> <p>And if companies are still struggling to borrow, it doesn't just matter because it puts jobs at risk and delays Britain's recovery in the short-term, but because the kind of adjustment the economy must make \u2013 from finance to industry, domestic consumption to exports \u2013 requires a radical transfer of resources. That can't happen if the financial plumbing is blocked.</p> <p>All the suggestions are that, just like another of Cable's cherished ideas, the Green Investment Bank, the new institution will be hemmed in by tight financial restrictions imposed by a nervous Treasury that believes governments should not be in banking.</p> <p>But a new report by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR), due to be published later this week, suggests that \u00a340bn would be the minimum size worth bothering with if the new bank is to make a serious difference to the economy, and urges Osborne to allow it to raise funds on capital markets to boost its lending power to \u00a3100bn.</p> <p>Like Cable, the IPPR's Tony Dolphin sees the bank as a solution to some of Britain's long-term economic problems, rather than a rapid cure for the slump. It could help to boost investment levels, for example, which are far too low in the UK relative to our international rivals, at just 15% of GDP. A state-backed bank could also take a more long-sighted approach than small firms are accustomed to seeing from high street lenders, with their computerised loan models and centralised management.</p> <p>So Cable is to be encouraged for floating the idea, and we should wish him luck as he tries to persuade the Treasury to be bold; but it also serves to underline the unfortunate truth that Britain's banking system is failing \u2013 and for two reasons.</p> <p>The first is a direct legacy of the boom-bust cycle of the past 10 years. The big four banks, which control an extraordinary 75% of the small business market, still have billions of pounds' worth of assets on their books from the happy-go-lucky days before the Great Recession, when they lent so freely to everyone from first-time buyers with no wage slips to show to the cash-strapped Greek and Spanish governments.</p> <p>The Bank of England's financial policy committee has expressed concern about what has popularly become known as \"extend and pretend\" \u2013 the banks' practice of showing lenience to borrowers who can't make repayments, rather than write down the value of their loans and face the knock-on effects across their balance sheets.</p> <p>That's a relief to struggling debtors, whether homeowners or companies; but the banks will remain reluctant to make new loans while they're loaded up with dodgy debts from the past. And it means the risk remains of another hugely costly taxpayer bailout if the economy fails to recover.</p> <p>Secondly, the flip side of Cable's argument \u2013 that a state-backed investment bank could take a longer-term approach and help to boost investment levels \u2013 is that despite Britain's banking sector being one of the largest relative to the size of the economy of any developed country, it has failed to channel savers' funds into productive, long-term investments that boost the economy's growth potential.</p> <p>Instead, as <a href=\"http://www.cresc.ac.uk/publications/an-alternative-report-on-uk-banking-reform\" title=\"\">the work of the Cresc group of economists</a> has shown, banks devoted themselves to recycling cash around the financial system \u2013 or, as Martin Wheatley, who will be boss of the new Financial Conduct Authority pointed out <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/speeches/2012/0905-mw.shtml\" title=\"\">recently</a>, trying to flog consumers risky products they didn't need.</p> <p>This government, like the last, has been far too timid in getting a grip on the style, culture and scale of British banking, despite owning a large part of the industry as a result of the bailouts of RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. All power to Cable's elbow \u2013 but building a shiny new lender with his name above the door won't give Britain's businesses the banks they deserve.</p>",
  "<p>On 25 June 2005, Tony Nicklinson entered his own personal purgatory, hovering between life and death. He suffered a brain-stem stroke so devastating that it resulted in locked-in syndrome, a condition often described as \"the closest thing to being buried alive\". Tony's fully conscious and razor-sharp mind was locked into a broken body, his lifeless limbs and paralysed vocal cords unresponsive to the brain signals commanding them to move. By his own admission, he died that day, despite his beating heart, and it was not until the 22 August 2012 that his body finally caught up.</p> <p>To many, Tony Nicklinson was the public face of the modern-day right-to- die movement. He led the legal battle to secure his death via voluntary euthanasia, and was the locked-in man who dribbled, cried and convulsed on live television, begging the courts to let a doctor end his life. He tweeted his 50,000 followers, giving the flesh of a personality to the idea of the man many would read about, helping them to understand the indignities of his condition with honesty and good humour. He was admired by many, feared by some.</p> <p>But he was so much more than that \u2013 he was my dad.</p> <p>When I was a child, he was the man who gently brushed my hair before bed, the one who taught me how to ride a bike and patiently helped me with my homework. In later years, he comforted me when my teenage boyfriend broke my heart; he taught me basic driving skills, and helped me with my university applications. Post-stroke, I combed his hair, wiped the dribble from his mouth, and pushed him in his wheelchair. I know he cried with pain and pride when I bought my first car, and graduated from university without him there. In the last few months, we emailed each other our news in gangster speak, because we found it amusing \u2013 and, before all of this, we used to laugh so much together.</p> <p>Growing up, I was a proud daddy's girl: we had a very close relationship. I idolised him and thought he was the most amazing person ever to have walked the planet. I more than loved my dad \u2013 I actually liked him. Dad raised my younger sister, Beth, and me to be tenacious, independent young women, to face life's hurdles with strength and courage and to voice our opinions with conviction. He taught us to enjoy life and to seize the day, just as he had done.</p> <p>Then, in an Athens hotel room seven years ago, a stroke destroyed his body, but left his mind intact. Mum, Beth and I learned how to hoist him from his bed to his wheelchair, feed him pulverised food and wipe away his tears. Far too quickly we forgot the sound of his voice, and we grieved for the man who had become buried so deep within his own body: we knew he was never going to reach the surface again. Together, the four of us tried to accept, adapt and adjust to our new family set-up and carry on with our lives the best we could. Mum, Beth and I kept our tears to ourselves while we watched the man we loved most in the world try his hardest to love his locked-in life.</p> <p>For some people, simply being alive is enough, but for Dad it was not \u2013 he wanted to die.</p> <p>I have no doubt that there are other people with Dad's disabilities who can find joy and pleasure in life, and that is fantastic, but Dad could not. The things that made his life enjoyable were impossible to do once he became locked-in, and the disabled-friendly versions brought him no joy. What makes a life worth living is subjective and specific to every individual; what is satisfactory for one person is not necessarily satisfactory for another. Dad believed that life should be about quality, not quantity and did not believe in going through the motions of living just for the sake of it. He wanted to live his life, not watch everyone else live theirs from the sidelines. He could not stand the limitations of his condition, and he deemed his life intolerable. I appreciate that many people live happy, fulfilling lives with a range of disabilities, and we support their right to life. But we also supported Dad's right to die.</p> <p>The crux of our case was about his right to autonomy and self-determination; his right to decide whether or not he lived or died. Able-bodied and less disabled people can exercise that right, but Dad could not because the law discriminated against him based on his physical disabilities. Dad was too disabled to take his own life, and he needed more than an assisted suicide; he needed someone \u2013 a doctor \u2013 to kill him. Dad may have been in a minority group, but that should not have meant his rights and wishes should have been ignored.</p> <p>Naturally, there would need to be a clear legal framework. Voluntary euthanasia would need to be requested, and be available only to those who are mentally sound but too disabled to take their own life, so the vulnerable would automatically be protected. There would be a lengthy, rigorous process to go through. The suggestion that it would be as simple as a single visit to the GP is not true: that was mere hyperbole, shameless scaremongering of the worst kind. It is quite simple: if you do not want it, do not ask for it. We acknowledge that there absolutely must be safeguards in place to protect those people who cannot protect themselves. However, the argument that the \"floodgates\" would open is an exaggerated concern. Another potential barrier was that of religion. As an atheist, Dad resented his life being governed by a faith system that he had no belief in: why should his rights be denied and his views discounted because of someone else's beliefs?</p> <p>A week before Dad died, the high court ruled that he did not have the right to die. They felt it was a matter for parliament. However, when our MPs will ever decide to sit up and listen, let alone proactively engage with the issue, is anyone's guess. Politicians are always fearful of putting their heads above the parapet. I am disappointed that a country as advanced and civilised as ours continues to evade the issue. Effectively, Dad and others in his position are forced to take a hit for the pro-life team. To use a religious metaphor, they are a flock of sacrificial lambs. The question must be asked: what country lets someone suffer so horrendously, despite their clear and informed wish to die, because it is too controversial?</p> <p>If a prisoner were held in these conditions in a prison, there would rightly be accusations of torture. Dad's prison was of a wholly more torturous nature. I still find it difficult to believe that our leaders and lawmakers cannot find a way to make voluntary euthanasia possible, while at the same time protecting those who need safeguarding. There is a real lack of political will. It will not be easy, but right decisions never are. It should be possible to achieve, and, at the very least, talked about, discussed and considered. After all, the next stroke could happen to anyone \u2013 would you like to live your life locked in?</p> <p>Dad's dying days were relatively peaceful, and he passed away at home with his family by his side. By refusing antibiotics and succumbing to pneumonia, he had some control over his death \u2013 when he was diagnosed with a chest infection, he saw the opportunity to die and took it. He was 58 and the thought of another 30 years locked in really frightened him. Seven years ago, a stroke broke Dad's body, but it was the British legal system that broke his heart.</p> <p>I miss Dad every day, as do Mum and Beth, but we take comfort knowing that he is no longer suffering. We draw our strength from each other, so supporting Dad came easy. We loved him and saw him hurt every day: how could we not help him end that pain? He would have done the same for any of us. We will continue to champion the cause that Dad died fighting for, and we are continuing his legal battle: I hope that no one ever has to suffer the way that he did. We are incredibly proud of all that he achieved, and I am so very proud to be his daughter.</p> <h2>A lasting legacy: Lauren's eulogy for her father</h2> <p>In the face of such undignified suffering, Dad displayed unbelievable courage, strength, tenacity and good humour.</p> <p>Dad has inspired a nation, has left behind a lasting legacy attached to the assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia debate, and started something incredibly important for British society. In death, Dad does not need a voice to be heard; his legacy says it all.</p> <p>But Dad has left behind a far greater legacy, that of his friends and family and the happy memories that we all have of him. He was a loving husband, a doting father and Mum, Beth and I are privileged to be the three people that he loved most in the world. Dad will never be forgotten, always missed and eternally loved.</p> <h2>It's my life: Tony Nicklinson's tweets<br></h2> <p><strong>On euthanasia</strong></p> <p>It has nothing to do with someone else making a judgement about your life; it is about what you think of your life.</p> <p><strong>On the idea of starving himself should his case fail </strong></p> <p>I've given it much thought and concluded that a few weeks of discomfort are better than 30 years like this.</p> <p><strong>On fighting the system</strong></p> <p>I resent being told by the state what I can and can't do with my life.

It will be hard for us to police it, though,\" said a spokeswoman for the Royal Court this weekend.</p> <p>London's theatreland has enjoyed a heady few years, with a succession of critical hits drawing unprecedented crowds \u2013 from David Tennant's <em>Hamlet </em>to Mark Rylance's performance in <em>Jerusalem</em>; and from James Corden's comic tour de force in <em>One Man, Two Guvnors</em> to Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Lee Miller co-starring as Frankenstein and his monster. The prospect of queues winding around a theatre again has underlined the growing problem of fair access to such sought-after shows.</p> <p>While those who live outside London cannot easily queue overnight at the Sloane Square venue, richer fans can opt to pay others to queue, or can buy later at inflated prices from touts.</p> <p>Tickets for <em>The River</em> will be at a premium, not simply because of West, who starred in the American television series <em>The Wire</em>, but because Butterworth and the theatre's artistic director, Dominic Cooke, are staging the play in a studio theatre which seats only 85. \"It was a decision made by everyone,\" said the Royal Court spokeswoman. \"It is a three-hander and very different to <em>Jerusalem</em>. Whether it stays in such a small venue depends on what happens with audiences but, for its premiere, Jez wants it to be at the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs.\"</p> <p>Although the Royal Court cannot be sure that those who queue for tickets will later come to see the show, the spokeswoman said that queuing was the fairest way to allocate tickets.</p> <p>\"People will have multiple opportunities to buy and some theatregoers prefer to be the first person in line. They don't want to leave it to an online lottery,\" the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>While paid queuers are well known in New York, where free tickets for the annual Shakespeare performances in Central Park are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, they are relatively new to London. \"For both <em>Frankenstein</em> and for <em>One Man</em> last year we had huge demand,\" said Aidan O'Rourke, box office manager at the National Theatre. \"People were camping out the night before, but we can usually tell from people's reactions at the box office whether they are going to be using the tickets themselves. They happily give us information about themselves that makes it clear. If not, then I might have a word with them.\"</p> <p>Tickets are limited to two per person and staff look out for people popping up in the queue several times in a run. \"In that case we check they are for their own use,\" said O'Rourke. \"We might suggest holding the tickets at the box office and then asking for ID on the night.\"</p> <p>With more than two decades of experience and memories of the long queues for seats to see Anthony Hopkins and Judi Dench in <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em> in the 1980s, O'Rourke believes queues police themselves quite well.</p> <p>\"Queuers talk to each other, particularly if they are camping out. If someone doesn't know what the play is, it becomes obvious and then queuers mention it to the box office,\" he said.</p> <p>Touting is exposed, O'Rourke added, when restricted view seats are sold at full price and customers are disappointed. \"We know we are being targeted, but the queue is the happiest and fairest medium we have found so far.\"</p> <p>Britain has an honourable tradition of queuing, but the Harvard political philosopher Michael J Sandel, author of <em>What Money Can't Buy,</em> has warned of the inexorable march of the price tag. He points to the common practice on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, where homeless people are paid by \"line-standing companies\" in order to allow lobbyists to attend a congressional hearing.</p> <p>Although paying to skip queues has been common practice at British theme parks for some years, Sandel has argued that some things should perhaps be considered sacrosanct. Equal access to the arts and to political influence might well be on that list.</p>",
  "<p>The friends of freedom should not make exceptions because freedom's enemies never do. Admittedly, the trailer for<em> Innocence of Muslims</em> (one of its many titles) makes the temptation to allow just one exception close to overwhelming. It advertises an amateur and adolescent piece of religious propaganda that depicts Muhammad as a violent and lascivious fool. Copts probably made it. As there is no great difference between Christian and Islamist extremists, why not intervene in this clash of fundamentalisms and stop one sect inciting another sect to violence?</p> <p>Even before mobs attacked the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/13/demonstrators-clash-us-embassy-cairo-video\" title=\"\">US embassy in Cairo</a>, its diplomats felt the urge to abandon basic principles. \"We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others,\" they said. Hillary Clinton was hardly more robust. \"The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\" It was a little too late in the day before she recalled America had other commitments going back to its founding, and muttered for all that America still does \"not stop citizens from expressing their views, no matter how distasteful\".</p> <p>European states, with all their counter-productive restrictions on freedom of speech \u2013 and yes, thank you, I include laws against Holocaust denial, denial of the Armenian genocide and all the other prohibitions of hatred that litter the statute books \u2013 would find a way to ban the film and arrest the film-makers. The British police would use public order and breach of peace laws. The wistful tone of the Obama administration make one suspect that it wished the US constitution did not prevent it following suit</p> <p><em>Innocence of Muslims</em> is one of the hardest cases for liberals I've come across. But even this tawdry piece of work raises problems for the proponents of censorship. The first is a problem with language. Mount a critique of Islamist religious fanaticism, and it is only a matter of time before you find that defenders of religious reaction have hijacked liberal language. You are an \"orientalist\", they say, an \"Islamophobe\", \"neo-colonialist\" or \"neocon\". (The prefix \"neo-\" has become a synonym for \"evil\". The reader need only see a \"neo-\" to know that no good will follow.)</p> <p>The joke of it is that defenders of censorship represent \"orientalism\" at its most patronising. They see the world's Muslims as an undifferentiated and infantile mass. The smallest provocation \u2013 a cartoon in a Jutland newspaper, a trailer for a nasty but obscure film \u2013 is enough to turn them into a raging mass of bearded men who bellow curses as they fire their Kalashnikovs. They take no account of those in Libya, Egypt and Iran who want nothing to do with clerical violence. As seriously, they do not understand that \"offences against Islam\" are manufactured by extremists, who must keep their supporters in a state of violent rage or see their power wane.</p> <p>The murder of US diplomats was not carried out spontaneously, but by a jihadist militia that wanted to kill Americans on the 9/11 anniversary. In Egypt, the controversy over the Coptic film was created by Al-Nas, a Salafi channel dedicated to promoting militant Islam. These crises are political events, in other words. Their promoters must create the poisonous atmosphere in which they thrive. Does anyone doubt that if the Muhammad film had never been made, they would not have found another target for their fury? Has everyone forgotten that their targets have included men and women liberals have a duty to defend? The same people who scream today, applauded the murder of Salman Tasser for protesting against the execution of Pakistani \"blasphemers\" who \"insulted\" Islam. They hoped for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/08/ayaan-hirsi-ali-interview\" title=\"\">the murder of Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, because she tried to stand up for the right of immigrant women to resist religious oppression in Europe.</p> <p>Then of course there is the case of <em>The Satanic Verses</em>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/14/looking-at-salman-rushdies-satanic-verses?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Salman Rushdie </a>has chosen this week to publish his autobiography. I would have said that the timing was perfect from his publisher's point of view, except that so many other weeks would have revealed how the violence caused by Ayatollah Khomeini's attempt to suppress <em>The Satanic Verses</em> in 1989 and murder all those associated with it never passed. Readers who were around at the time will remember that a desperate Rushdie tried to appease his persecutors by issuing an abject apology. He learned that there are forces you cannot appease, when the Islamists laughed and carried on with the terror campaign. It is a lesson we would do well to remember.</p> <p>To bring the story up to date we now have before us the example of Channel 4's documentary on the origins of Islam. It was everything that the Muhammad trailer was not. Tom Holland presented a thoughtful and balanced film on the arguments among historians about whether the armies that exploded out of Arabia to conquer the Persian empire and much of the Byzantine empire were Muslim, or whether Islam came later. His documentary was public service television at its most scrupulous. I speak from experience when I say that he has no hatred of religion. The last time I met him was at a debate where he argued for and I argued against a motion that religion was a force for good in the world.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Holland and Channel 4 had the integrity to break a taboo more frightened broadcasters are too cowardly to challenge. They aired doubts about Islam's founding myths, and the predictable fulminations followed. The Ramadhan Foundation and Islamic Education and Research Academy attacked them with dangerous abandon. Channel 4 had distorted \"our faith and history\", they said. The programme was \"prejudiced\" and \"ignorant\". Their denunciations are all over the web, and could be picked up in Iran or Egypt or indeed Bradford or Birmingham and used as an excuse to attack British interests. Does that possibility mean Channel 4 should have suppressed the programme, and that Britain should submit to a de facto blasphemy law?</p> <p>Even in the hardest of cases, the old arguments against censorship remain the best. The makers of <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> have reactionary religious prejudices and probably reactionary racial prejudices too. Reactionaries are not hard to beat in open debate. If you can't beat them without calling for the cops or reaching for a gun, you should get out of the debating business and make way for someone who can.</p>",
  "<p>By any standards, Twitter is one of the wonders of the digital world. A service that didn't exist seven years ago has somehow become a central part of our media ecosystem, old and new: I can't remember when I last heard a radio programme that didn't invite me to \"follow\" it on Twitter, while at the opening of every conference I attend nowadays, after the obligatory notices about the location of the fire exits, there is the unveiling of the event's Twitter&#xa0;hashtag.</p> <p>So Twitter is huge. It has more than 500 million active users who send 340m tweets on an average day, and is consistently <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\" title=\"\">one of the top 10 websites</a> in the world. Two-thirds of the world's top companies have an <a href=\"http://thesocialskinny.com/99-new-social-media-stats-for-2012/\" title=\"\">active Twitter profile</a>. And yet when it first appeared in July 2006, it provided instant corroboration of Naughton's First Law of Innovation, which says that if the <em>Daily Mail</em> is baffled and/or infuriated by a new piece of technology, then the odds are that it is a really significant&#xa0;development.</p> <p>Twitter spread like wildfire for various reasons: it was easy to understand and use; it was quirky; and, most importantly, it was <em>asymmetrical</em>. If you chose to \"follow\" someone's Twitter stream, they were under no obligation to follow you. As one of the service's co-founders (Jack Dorsey) put it, Twitter's attraction was founded on \"connection with very low expectation\". This lack of reciprocity turned out to be seductive to people who were intimidated by the expectations implicit in other social&#xa0;media.</p> <p>For most of its short life, Twitter has had a good press, partly because of the way it has stood up to attempted bullying by lawyers and security authorities seeking the personal details of users. During the attacks on WikiLeaks after the release of US diplomatic cables, Twitter functioned as a way of bypassing the withdrawal of Domain Name Services (DNS) for the site, providing a workaround that allowed access to WikiLeaks. It also played a significant role in the Arab spring, especially in Egypt \u2013 all of which persuaded the world that Google might not be the only internet corporation that had \"Don't be evil\" engraved on its corporate&#xa0;DNA.</p> <p>Recently, however, Twitter has come in for some heavy criticism on two fronts. During the Olympics it <a href=\"http://dangillmor.com/2012/07/30/is-twitters-suspension-of-journalists-account-a-defining-moment/\" title=\"\">suspended the account</a> of Guy Adams \u2013 the <em>Independent</em>'s man in Los Angeles \u2013 who had been posting hyper-critical tweets about the awfulness of NBC's coverage of the Games. Twitter claimed that the suspension was because Adams had broken its rules about not revealing people's email addresses. Critics alleged that it was because of the fact that Twitter had a commercial arrangement with NBC, and that this had led it to curtail Mr Adams's freedom of speech. \"Twitter is becoming old media,\" fumed one venerable netizen, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/245640297160253440\" title=\"\">Dave Winer</a>, echoing the sentiments of some other&#xa0;netheads.</p> <p>But in fact, many techies had become disenchanted with Twitter before the Olympics. The reason was that the company had begun to constrain their freedom to build <a href=\"http://windmillnetworking.com/2012/01/31/top-20-twitter-clients-2012/\" title=\"\">applications</a> that interacted with the service \u2013 eg by creating software (such as HootSuite and TweetDeck) that allowed people to tweet without visiting Twitter's website. From very early on, Twitter's co-founders had sussed that the way to expand rapidly was to design the service as a \"platform\" on which other developers could <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/\" title=\"\">build things</a>, and so published an application programming interface (API) defining the technical protocols that enabled external developers' software to communicate with Twitter's.</p> <p>Currently there are about 100,000 <a href=\"http://blog.twitter.com/2010/05/twitter-platform.html\" title=\"\">external applications</a> that use the Twitter API, so its ecosystem is a really big deal. What's raised techie hackles recently is Twitter's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/17/twitter-third-party-developers-cutoffs\" title=\"\">restrict the freedoms</a> of those who use its API \u2013 for example by limiting the number of users they can have, or the frequency with which their apps can interact with Twitter.</p> <p>This new disenchantment with Twitter seems daft to me. The suspension of Adams's account looks more like an error of judgment rather than the onset of old-media control freakery. Twitter is unlikely to abandon its First Amendment principles, if only because to do so would be commercially disastrous in the long run. And as for the API restrictions, well, Twitter isn't a charity. Those billions of tweets have to be processed, stored, retransmitted \u2013 and that costs money. Twitter has already had more than $1bn of venture capital funding. Like Facebook, it has to make money, somehow. Otherwise it will disappear. Even on the internet there's no such thing as a free lunch.</p>",
  "<p>In the catalogue that accompanies this exhibition, curator Kate Bush writes: \"Photography does not merely illustrate the world, it articulates it.\" <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=13613\" title=\"\">Everything Was Moving</a> attempts to show not just how the medium articulated the various political and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, but how it responded to the often self-questioning experiments of contemporary conceptual artists like Andy Warhol and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/12/ed-ruscha-obama-pop-art\" title=\"\">Ed Ruscha</a>. The&nbsp;predominant creative dynamic in the show, though, is the one articulated in the 1950s by Henri Cartier-Bresson, who proposed that photography should&nbsp;strive to find \"a balance... between two worlds \u2013 the one inside us and the one outside us\".</p> <p>Bruce Davidson, whose evocative, sometimes shocking images of America&nbsp;during the civil rights era are on show here, merged those two worlds, one subjective, the other objective, by challenging the notion that the documentary photographer should be a detached observer. When he accompanied the 10 young men on the <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/Catalogue/Bruce-Davidson/1963/USA-Mississippi-Freedom-March-NN17181.html\" title=\"\">Mississippi freedom march</a> in 1963&nbsp;\u2013 \"five whites and five blacks, walking down an isolated two-lane highway in the middle of nowhere\" \u2013 he regarded himself, he later said, as \"the 11th marcher\".</p> <p>The undiminished power of Davidson's photographs attest to his eye for the illuminating detail \u2013 a gesture, a gaze, a single solemn face in an agitated crowd \u2013 and to the risks he often took in getting so close to his subjects \u2013 the marchers and the angry white men who tailed them every step of the way.</p> <p>One of the strongest juxtapositions in a show that relies on the drama of contrasting, even opposing, approaches is between Davidson's work and that of William Eggleston. Both photographers shot extensively in America's deep south, but the results, superficially at least, suggest that they may as well have been working on different planets. It is not just the contrast between Davidson's black and white reportage and Eggleston's vivid, brooding colours, but the difference in artistic temperament and vision. Eggleston's democratic eye lights on the most seemingly mundane of subjects \u2013 a ceiling, a rusting road sign, the back of a woman's head \u2013 and somehow these disparate images add up to a unified aesthetic. Here, the American south is a state of mind as much as anything else: a menacing place of odd shadows and unreal light.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/25/david-goldblatt-photography-guillot-review\" title=\"\">David Goldblatt</a> has spent more than six decades photographing his native South Africa and his detached, formal, but thought-provoking images of the apartheid era are a testament to the abnormal normality of that time and place. In one, a row of black faces in a mixed crowd stare at a line of young white women in swimming costumes, entrants in a Miss Lovely Legs competition. In another, entitled <em>The Maid's Room</em>, a newspaper rests on a chair beside a makeshift single bed and a cardboard carpet. The headline reads \"Moon men on the way back\". Life goes on, these photographs say, in a grotesquely normalised way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/23/ernest-cole-photographer-apartheid-review\" title=\"\">Ernest Cole</a>'s images emphasise the singular importance of a photographer who also grew up under apartheid and who responded to its daily ignominies in an endlessly resourceful way. Having managed to get himself reclassified as \"coloured\" rather than \"black\", Cole moved freely between the townships and the white sectors, often shooting visual narratives that showed the distance between the two. His snatched shot of a well-dressed white man casually slapping a young black boy around the face as he walks past him on the street is one of the most arresting images in the entire show. Cole died an exile, penniless and homeless, in New York in 1990, the week after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison.</p> <p>The other artists in Everything Was Moving are given less space, and the juxtapositions seem less dramatic, though Larry Burrows's richly coloured action tableaux of American soldiers in combat in Vietnam are provocatively contrasted with Shomei Tomatsu's grainy black-and-white images of what he saw as an increasingly Americanised Japan. In 1961, Tomatsu visited Nagasaki to record the city's reconstruction. There, he photographed exhibits in the local museum, including a <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/artist,show,1,105,0,0,0,0,0,0,shomei_tomatsu.html\" title=\"\">beer bottle</a> so distorted by the force of the atomic blast that it resembled a skinned pig hanging in a restaurant.</p> <p>The influence of conceptual practice is most visible in the early pictures of Boris Mikhailov, whose series of doubly exposed visual satires on Soviet censorship, <em>Yesterday's Sandwich</em> (1968-1975), add up to a scrapbook-like impression of a world where the personal was always political. More elliptical still is Sigmar Polke's series of 14 photographs of a staged fight between two dogs and a bear, which he took in Afghanistan in 1974. A swipe at Russian imperialism, the images are less easy to read on any other level, their surfaces having been covered in dark washes and stains. This is photography challenging photography's reliability, but the series seems out of place here.</p> <p>I was intrigued by Graciela Iturbide's modernist portraits of the nomadic Seri people of rural Mexico and by Raghubir Singh's vivid images of Indian life. In one unforgettable shot, two sari-clad girls fly almost horizontally on a makeshift rope above a crowd of women and children. After Li Zhensheng's huge panoramic tableaux of demonstrations and mass rallies in Mao's China, it was like entering a different world.</p> <p>Indeed, there are so many different worlds here that the very idea of a historical moment is challenged. It is more a set of vivid glimpses of a period in which everything that was moving was caught, and transformed, by a generation alert to the myriad possibilities of photography.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Price \u00a327,600 </strong><br><strong>MPG 74.3</strong><br><strong> Top speed 131mph</strong></p> <p>Years ago, having owned a string of scrap-yard survivors, rusted hand-me-downs and persistent MOT offenders, I decided the time had finally come to buy a \"grown-up\" car. One that would cost four figures (just), have a number plate in the current run of the alphabet and which wouldn't bring a tear of disappointment to my father's eye. I headed for my local garage where the salesman looked me up and down before pointing towards the far corner of his yard: \"What you want is flash but not much cash. And no car does that better than a Citro\u00ebn BX\u2026\" He was dead right, both about me and the BX.</p> <p>The now defunct BX was a disarming mixture of luxury (electric windows, hydraulic suspension, tinted sunroof), wrapped in a stylish package and propped up on a&#xa0;mechanically unimpressive foundation.</p> <p>It was a template that worked brilliantly for Citro\u00ebn and millions of drivers (including myself) were delighted, though often frustrated. But hey, it was a proper car.</p> <p>The latest generation of Citro\u00ebns, however, is messing with this blueprint. For the price, they're still gadget-heavy and unexpectedly luxurious\u2026 but their underpinnings are no longer as dubious.</p> <p>The most recent car to buck the trend is the innovative DS5 Hybrid4 \u2013 the world's first mass-produced diesel-electric hybrid car. It will do a wallet-tranquillising 74mpg and its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dip below the magic 100g per km mark, which means it avoids both road tax and London's congestion charge. These figures are all the more impressive when you consider that the DS5 is both large and posh. It's a five-seat premium motor, not some green-conscious bandwagon with hemp seats and a whiff of eco-smugness.</p> <p>From the outside it's a bit of a&#xa0;shape-shifter: part saloon, part estate, part MPV, the DS5 is unlike any other car you'll see in your local multi-storey. Two long swishes of chrome whip up from its front corners to a&#xa0;steeply angled dark windscreen, like a pair of metal ice-hockey sticks. There's plenty more chrome along the sills and snaking around the front valance, bracketing the headlamps like the silver glints on the arms of designer sunglasses. The bonnet is as heavily creased as a linen napkin and the flanks are sculpted and shapely.</p> <p>The interior is a banquet of high-grade rubber, leather and soft-touch plastics. Controls sweep around the driver, spilling down the central console and studding the ceiling. The digital dash scrolls information past you with dizzying graphics. It all feels a bit <em>Top Gun</em> at times.</p> <p>But what really sets the DS5 apart is its groundbreaking power unit. A&#xa0;161bhp, two-litre turbo diesel drives the front wheels and a 36bhp electric motor the rear. The result is a&#xa0;four-wheel-drive set-up with 200bhp. You can switch the system around and choose sport, 4x4 or all-electric drive, or you can do what most of us will \u2013 select auto and let the smart car decide.</p> <p>Pioneering though the car may be, there are still a few touches to remind you of the Citro\u00ebns of old. The gearbox feels jerky and uncertain at times, the weight of the car means it takes a heavy foot to get you going, and the satnav is maddeningly inept. The lack of a central cubby also means every time you turn a corner the keyless fob slides off the polished surface. But there's more than enough flash to blind you to any faults.</p>",
  "<p>There is something deliciously improper about watching Elizabeth McGovern perform on stage in a rock band. The sight of a middle-aged mother, even one as coolly attractive as McGovern, playing a guitar and singing in a&#xa0;beer-splattered festival setting is necessarily out of the ordinary. But it's the contrast with Lady Cora, the delicate Edwardian matriarch she plays in <em>Downton Abbey</em>, that really plays havoc with the imagination.</p> <p>As the lead singer and songwriter of Sadie and the Hotheads, McGovern has created a kind of supercharged alter-ego, a private weekend hobby that has blossomed into a fully fledged album-producing and touring entity. Earlier in the summer, a few days before her 51st birthday, she appeared at the Hard Rock Calling festival in Hyde Park.</p> <p>In one of the large side tents, away from the main stage, the Hotheads entertained a&#xa0;couple of hundred appreciative fans and curious onlookers, led animatedly at the front by McGovern's husband, the film director Simon Curtis. Dressed in a black jacket, pink top, dark hot pants, slinky stockings and high-heeled silver boots, McGovern looked persuasively rock 'n' roll, if a little nervous initially, singing slightly flat on a couple of numbers before hitting her confident stride.</p> <p>The songs she writes are wry and personal and sufficiently difficult to place in a defined genre as to qualify for the status of idiosyncratic. She isn't interested in the technical aspects of singing, which is why she is left numb by \"that excruciating show\" <em>The Voice</em>. Her own voice is both fragile and husky, but distinctly hers, lending a quirky charm to the deft musicianship of the Hotheads.</p> <p>Before an autobiographical number entitled \"LA Days\", she made a little speech to the audience. \"Most people grow up dreaming of going to Hollywood and some of them work and work and work and finally end up in Hollywood,\" she explained, with a professional's sense of timing. \"But I started my life in Hollywood and worked and worked and worked to get to Shepherd's Bush and play in a pub.\"</p> <p>It's a good line, but it also contains a&#xa0;large dollop of truth. In the early 1980s, McGovern's face was plastered across American billboards. A teenage film star, she was nominated for an Academy Award (1981's <em>Ragtime</em>) by the time she was 20. She was sought after by the best directors and performed opposite actors such as Robert De Niro, Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. And if all that wasn't enough biography to be getting on with, she also got engaged to Penn \u2013 a two-year relationship she has described as \"exhausting\" \u2013 not long before he married Madonna.</p> <p>As the Eagles once noted of the luxurious prison of Hollywood celebrity, you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. McGovern, however, did leave, albeit not with the aim of playing in a pub in Shepherd's Bush. Instead she met Curtis, then a young and relatively unknown producer-director, they fell in love, she got pregnant, left her career behind and moved to\u2026 Chiswick.</p> <p>A few days before the Hyde Park gig, I meet McGovern at a photography studio in east London. Tall, fine-boned, and blessed with burning blue eyes and a girlish smile, she is an intriguingly equivocal presence, at once stunningly youthful and authentically her age.</p> <p>I suggest that it must have been a momentous decision to relocate to London and effectively say goodbye to stardom. \"I think that it was a quick decision that I&#xa0;made fully,\" she says carefully, \"and then there was the subsequent conflict inside me about whether it had been a good idea, which I sort of processed over the first few years I was here. It was a&#xa0;kind of adjustment period.\"</p> <p>The adjustment was not straightforward. At first she found London a&#xa0;grim and confusing place. As she points out, the city has changed a lot since her arrival in 1992. \"I think people forget that even in 1992 there was nowhere near the spirit of creative enterprise that there is now. There weren't the restaurants, there weren't the coffee shops.\"</p> <p>Nor did she understand Londoners, who seemed to her to have walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. They spoke too fast and peppered their conversation with impenetrable references that left her blank-faced. At dinner parties she would be so lost that she'd simply laugh when her husband did, because she hadn't a&#xa0;clue what was supposed to be funny. \"It's amazing how differently I&#xa0;feel now,\" she says. \"But it has been 20 years.\"</p> <p>Back then, was there not a moment when she regretted the unexpected course her life had taken to this strange place where people spoke a language of ironic references?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't actually put it like that,\" she says, once more cautiously weighing the implications of the question. \"I think there was a big part of me that needed what I found when I&#xa0;moved here, which was peace and serenity.\"</p> <p>She speaks of her 20s in Los Angeles and New York as a roller coaster of dramatic momentum during which she constantly felt as though she was trying to catch up on a&#xa0;youth lost to the demands of the film business. Although she grew up in LA, little in her background \u2013 her father was an academic and her mother a&#xa0;teacher \u2013 had prepared her for the warped values of Hollywood. One of the reasons she split up with Penn is she couldn't wait to get away from the place when she wasn't working there.</p> <p>She was also insecure about her acting, a&#xa0;doubt that was exacerbated by working with screen legends such as De Niro. But as much as she questioned her ability to assume the identity of others, her real trouble was in establishing her own. She looks back now at her young self with a kind maternal amusement.</p> <p>\"That feeling of being 19 or 20 and 'hot' in Hollywood was so intense,\" she says. \"It was something I'd enjoy more now because then I&#xa0;had a feeling of being a bit of a&#xa0;fake as I&#xa0;was so young. Now I'd probably feel like a fake, but I'd be OK with it because I&#xa0;realise that it's all smoke and mirrors anyway.\"</p> <p>She and Curtis now both have flourishing careers \u2013 he is the director of <em>My Week With Marilyn</em>. Their two daughters are of an age to no longer need close parental attention. For many years, though, McGovern put her maternal duties first, but not without a certain frustration at being all but ignored by British casting directors.</p> <p>I remember seeing her in a small stage production of <em>The Misanthrope</em> in 1996, when she was a genuine curiosity, a&#xa0;fallen star, or one living in something close to obscurity. There followed occasional stage and television outings, including a short comedy series called <em>Freezing</em>, about an American Oscar-nominated actor who moves to London to be with her English husband and struggles to find work. It all sounded rather close to home, particularly as the series was directed by McGovern's real husband, Curtis.</p> <p><em>Freezing</em> managed to produce enough critical heat to place McGovern back in TV executives' minds. Her fictional husband in the show was played by Hugh Bonneville, and the screen couple reprised their marriage in 2010 in <em>Downton Abbey</em>.</p> <p>She is about to film the final episode of the third series when we meet, and is guarded about what plot twists are in store. It is widely known that Shirley MacLaine will be playing her mother. Did the veteran American star live up to her reputation as an eccentric?</p> <p>\"She did not let us down in that sense or in any sense,\" says McGovern, with a broad smile. \"I love every minute of her tenure on the show.\"</p> <p>After a strong opening season of <em>Downton</em>, the second season was widely declaimed for its implausible narrative shifts that, at their most pronounced, were reminiscent of <em>Dallas</em>'s heyday. McGovern has hopes the third series will be the best yet, not least because it steps away from the melodramatics of the second series.</p> <p>\"I think the feeling is that the tone will go back to being closer to the first season,\" she says diplomatically, \"partly because there isn't a war going on and partly because I think the tone of the first season seemed to work so well.\"</p> <p>After a couple of decades hiding away in Chiswick, McGovern seems to be enjoying the attention. Earlier this year she attended a reunion with De Niro and James Woods at the Cannes film festival to mark the release of a print of <em>Once Upon A Time in America</em> that more closely resembles the version that Sergio Leone, the film's late director, envisaged. She loved every minute of the razzamatazz. And although she's more likely to be noticed on the street these days, she doesn't feel under the pressure she felt as a&#xa0;young woman, when the fame game demanded more than she was prepared to give.</p> <p>\"It's different now,\" she explains. \"I've got my private life \u2013 that's sacred \u2013 and I didn't have that before.\" She also, of course, has her music. She started playing seriously only seven years ago, first venturing to an open-mic evening in a&#xa0;Notting Hill pub to perform her own compositions. She would go because, she says, \"I&#xa0;didn't want to inflict it on anyone else.\"</p> <p>What about her husband, did he not accompany her for moral support?</p> <p>\"He did every now and then,\" she winces, \"but it was a little painful for him because he's such a showbusiness-savvy person and to hear me play not very well in a place in which nobody was listening was just too painful for him.\"</p> <p>Far from being depressed or intimidated by performing in such mundane surroundings, she found the company of strangers liberating, because no one was interested in her background.</p> <p>\"That was an incredible period for me because my old identity was totally eradicated,\" she says in a way that confirms that this was a good thing. \"A lot of the people there were eastern Europeans who were quite accomplished musicians and they didn't know anything about me at all, nor did they care. It was wonderful getting to know these people where nothing in my past was relevant at all.\"</p> <p>It's probably fair to say McGovern's old identity has now been supplanted by her new one. Not that of musician \u2013 at least not yet. But many of her <em>Downton</em> followers are like those musicians in the pub, insofar as they neither know nor care where she came from, because all that matters to them is that she's here. Finally her past has become a foreign country, a long, long way from Chiswick.</p> <p><em>The new series of </em>Downton Abbey<em> starts tonight on ITV1. The book, </em>The Chronicles of Downton Abbey<em> (Collins, \u00a320), is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>Reading Christopher Reid's <em>Nonsense</em> is like being inside a theatre \u2013 a wonderful, oddball auditorium with a cast composed largely of Reid lookalikes. As a poet, Reid has two distinct talents: the ability, close to a novelist or playwright's, to tell a story, as he so brilliantly did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/10/the-apprentice-review-phil-hogan\" title=\"\"><em>The Song of Lunch</em></a>, performed as a BBC drama by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. His other, less convivial gift is for unperformable private truths, as in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/poetry/9780955455360/a-scattering\" title=\"\"><em>A&#xa0;Scattering</em></a>, the collection about his late wife which won the <a href=\"http://www.costabookawards.com/\" title=\"\">Costa Book of the Year</a> and described an untheatrical grief (although the theatre was his wife's world).</p> <p>Professor Winterthorn's Journey starts this collection, takes up half of it and is by far the best thing in it. To be disguised as another person brings with it freedoms \u2013 including the right to depart from any predictable script. Winterthorn is a blundering widower, an indecisive packer, a practised yet somehow abject traveller. He is on his way to a literary conference, to which he seems to have invited himself, on the subject of futility. What Reid excels at is deliberately not editing out tedious parts of travel \u2013 or of life \u2013 but lending his keen wit to what most of us pretend not to see or to what we tell ourselves is not happening. From now on it will no longer be possible to proceed through airport security and on to duty free without having&#xa0;Professor Winterthorn at one's elbow:</p> <p><em>Check-in is slow but goes without a hitch;</em><br><em>he presents passport photo \u2013 tiny, yes, but me! \u2013</em><br><em>joins the abattoir shuffle towards baggage inspection</em><br><em>and body frisk; and at last is admitted</em><br><br><em>to the great, luminous cavern of Duty Free.</em></p> <p>The \"abattoir shuffle\" is a comically dire dance step. The \"luminous cavern\" beautifully sums up duty free's pretensions. Waiting is dreaded: \"the traveller must submit/ to the twin powers/ of commerce and tedium\". And one empathises with the professor's nervy thoughts about seat allocation: \"\u2026near the back/ Is that good? Or dangerous?\" Reid is inspired, too, on the impersonality of hotels, pushing the idea to its limits:</p> <p><em>Nothing, of course, to tell you</em><br><em>who has stayed here before,</em><br><em>or who will in the future,</em><br><br><em>or who is doing so now.</em></p> <p>There is, alongside the wit, an unexpected sweetness too. Winterthorn, prone on his bed, is charmingly described as a snoozing \"worker bee\". In the middle of all this, the professor's question about the loss of his wife comes with tremendous naturalness, a&#xa0;muddled cry from the heart:</p> <p><em>When a life ends \u2013</em><br><em>he's fumbling for the words \u2013</em><br><em>where does, not the life,</em><br><em>but the life of the life go?</em><br><br>Reid's repertoire boasts another long, entertaining and subtle poem \u2013 about an actress rehearsing Mistress Quickly in <em>Henry IV, Part 2</em> \u2013 in which he is especially deflating about thespian vanity. The shorter poems that wind up the book are, by contrast, inconsequential \u2013 a poem about staring into an espresso, though nicely observed, is not going anywhere beyond the cafe table. Another, Last of the Campus Poems, contains a wonderfully apt and absurd line about computers (\"The computers stand idle,/ inscrutable as barn owls\") but the poem is about electing not to write \u2013 a manifestation of the suspended animation that dominates elsewhere too.</p> <p>Even Chorus seems stuck, hankering after superior performance. Reid makes us more interested in the theatre audience \u2013 the shuffling gannets in the perilous upper circle \u2013 than in the struggling, bearded actor below. I like to think one of these, possessed of first-rate wings, is Reid&#xa0;himself.</p>",
  "<p>There's a mythic quality to <a href=\"http://www.letthefeastbegin.co.uk/lawrence-norfolk\" title=\"\">Lawrence Norfolk</a>'s fourth historical novel. Set in the mid-17th century, stretching across the civil war years, it skillfully entangles folklore and foodlore. John Sandall, the orphaned son of a suspected witch, is taken in at nearby Buckland Manor and put to work in the kitchens. Before her death, John's mother tells him that their true name is Saturnall, and this means that they are keepers of feast. John soon shows that he does indeed possess certain gifts and, under the guidance of the manor's master cook, slowly hones his art, coming to the attention of the headstrong daughter of the house, Lucretia. With an arranged marriage hanging over her, she fasts as a way of retaining control of her future. Throughout the novel, food is shown to be both a source of sustenance and a thing of ritual; recipes are legacies, the threads connecting generations. The earlier child's-eye chapters, though more opulent in tone, are less compelling than the later accounts of the battlefield but Norfolk's writing is at its strongest when he's describing the symbolic significance of certain dishes: spiced wine, delicate curls of spun sugar, slivers of almonds, and the flaking flesh of river fish.</p>",
  "<p>The banner said it all: \"Imagine: disabled and poor.\" The sight of wheelchair-bound protesters demonstrating outside the Greek parliament against the latest round of cuts that Athens must enact in return for rescue loans reinforced the uncomfortable truth that, in the country where Europe's debt drama first began, the crisis is far from over.</p> <p>While politicians were fixated on Germany's constitutional court ratifying the eurozone bailout mechanism and the general elections in Holland last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/eurozone-crisis-greece-cuts-talks-protests\" title=\"\">Greece's three-party coalition was locked in fraught negotiations over a new \u20ac12.5bn (\u00a310bn) austerity package</a>. The cuts in disability benefits, ordered by debt inspectors from the \"troika\" of lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF, threw into sharp relief the tough process that the weakest member of the eurozone is being forced to suffer.</p> <p>For the first time in living memory, military personnel took to the streets alongside police officers, fire brigade officials, teachers and doctors as Greeks vowed to resist further pay and pension cuts that have already led to plummeting living standards.</p> <p>This week, before a general strike scheduled for 26 September \u2013 the 17th this year \u2013 judges will walk off the job, shaking one of the central pillars of Greek society.</p> <p>Nearly three years into the debt crisis, the mood among Greeks has shifted from one of bewilderment and shock, borne of seeing their seemingly robust economy collapse almost overnight, to fury and fear as poverty and panic spread.</p> <p>Increasingly, ordinary people are speaking of \"blood being spilled\" and even \"civil war\". After the hiatus of a long summer, there are few who doubt that Greece is about to enter an autumn of mass discontent as the endless efforts to keep bankruptcy at bay move into a menacing new phase.</p> <p>\"The situation is terrible,\" says Vassilis Grillas, a cab driver. \"Every day, I see people who are in an awful state, who can't pay their bills \u2013 who, like me, are afraid that their homes will be confiscated because we all owe so much more than we have. If they keep on pushing us like this, blood will be spilled. Everyone will revolt. There will be a mass uprising for sure.\"</p> <p>With about 1,000 jobs reportedly being axed every day, the statistics agency Elstat announced last week that unemployment had reached an unprecedented 23.6% \u2013 compared with 16.3% a year ago. The surge mirrors the dramatic decline in GDP in a country that has been plagued by recession for the past five years.</p> <p>On Friday, as eurozone finance ministers met in Cyprus, the current holder of the rotating EU presidency, it became clear that Greece will have to wait at least six weeks before lenders decide whether it deserves the next \u20ac31.5bn instalment of aid, which is crucial to recapitalising Greek banks and the cash-starved economy. Deliberations over the loan, which was initially due in July, have put Athens's fragile coalition on tenterhooks.</p> <p>Despite the IMF and EU both signalling that Greece will be granted the two-year extension it has called for to implement unpopular fiscal adjustment policies, the parties supporting the three-month-old government still find themselves in a difficult position: all three campaigned on refusing to endorse austerity measures that hit the most vulnerable members of society hardest.</p> <p>As creditors continue to insist that painful cuts are the price of further aid, politicians from the Greek president downwards have voiced fears that Athens is being pushed too far.</p> <p>Last week, President Carolos Papoulias decried the policies, telling visiting Canadian officials: \"We've been given a merciless lashing. I think we have paid enough for our mistakes, and Europe must realise that it needs to help Greece.\"</p> <p>The normally mild-mannered octogenarian expressed concern that the foundations of Greek democracy were being imperilled. The sight of police and senior naval and army officers taking to the streets last week prompted government officials to voice similar fears. Some spoke privately of \"the quiet before the storm\" amid anxiety that the prevailing uncertainty has prompted a rise in extremism. The far-right <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/golden-dawn\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a> party is not only gaining in popularity but increasingly taking law and order into its own hands, with attacks on immigrants nationwide.</p> <p>Although there has been a discernible change in attitude towards Greece among fiscal hardliners in the EU led by Germany, the death spiral in which the economy finds itself \u2013 Greek debt still accounts for 166% of GDP \u2013 shows little sign of reversing. That has added to the mood of fury and fear, provoking criticism even among reform-minded Greeks of the troika and its policies.</p> <p>\"They don't seem to care about the country, all they seem to care about is balancing the current account and budget, re-financing debt that is non-sustainable,\" says Theodore Pelagidis, professor of economic analysis at Piraeus University. \"No attention is given to improving competitiveness or the production markets. These are home economics, not the economics that should be applied to a country.\"</p>",
  "<p>You can pass the fiercest privacy laws in Europe, but, historically, they don't stop Franco-Italian celebrity magazines running pictures of the Duchess of York having her toe sucked, the Grimaldis of Monaco in all sorts of private moments \u2013 or, now, the Duchess of Cambridge with her top off. Nor are debates about \"the public interest\" much heeded in the European paparazzi game parks.</p> <p>The British press didn't publish the snaps of topless Kate and wouldn't have dreamed of doing so long before Leveson (or even the birth of the Press Complaints Commission, I think). Private estates offer \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\". But this is France, not Wales. And it's time to cool down.</p> <p>National law, locally enforced, can address some problems. It can make phone-hacking a criminal offence, for instance. But a few fuzzy topless snaps, published in Paris and Milan in a trice (and Ireland, if Dickie Desmond so decrees) \u2013 and all over Twitter in two minutes anyway?</p> <p>You can see why William, remembering his mother, should decide to sue. You can see why British editors, anxious to stress the sanctity of their embattled system, should call for heavier fines and retribution (in France). And you can see why lawyers are willing to go through the necessary motions (for a fee). But it needs saying that none of this now makes much sense. The law in the US, where Prince Harry was playing strip billiards, finds no First Amendment offence in putting such snaps on the web. If whoever took photos of the royals wanted to sell them to a US celebrity site instead, he or she could do so unhindered.</p> <p>Suing won't address this while there is no relevant international law to apply. Suing merely conflates the story. If governments want to do something positive about it, they should get together and start harmonising their constitutions. Fat chance!</p> <p>The most obvious trouble with Leveson is that he's working on one corner of the problem (the press) in one small sub-country (England).</p> <p>And the most sensible advice to anyone concerned about privacy? Don't take your top off on a sun-baked Provence terrace you can see from the road. That's like holding a vegetarian convention in lion country. And while we're on the subject, don't kiss a woman who isn't your wife in a Soho street or crowded park if you'd be embarrassed by what transpires. Privacy begins at home.</p>",
  "<p>Nicknamed Wilee after the cartoon character Wile E Coyote, the reckless hero of this fast-moving thriller (directed and co-scripted by the ingenious screenwriter of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and <em>Panic Room</em>) is one of those antisocial cyclists causing havoc in the streets as they take absurd risks delivering messages and packages around New York. The film's McGuffin is a coded message Wilee must take from Columbia University Law School on 116th Street to a back alley in Chinatown. It's of vital interest to an anxious mother, gangsters in the States and mainland China, and a vicious cop (Michael Shannon) in hock to the mob. The writer-director keeps up a Tour-de-France speed and ferocity, uses yellow lines to indicate both the hero's route and the various strategies he can choose from in every fraught situation, and gives no one much time to think. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an immensely likable hero and the stunt work is astonishing.</p>",
  "<p>One of the rare truly committed left-wing film-makers around (his few peers include Ken Loach and John Sayles), Gu\u00e9diguian laid into Woody Allen's <em>Midnight in Paris</em> when it was shown out of competition at Cannes last year where his own <em>Les neiges du Kilimandjaro</em> was in the Un Certain Regard section. He accused it of ignoring \"poor Parisians earning below the minimum wage\". Well, he's earned the right to say that after years spent making movies dealing sympathetically with the poor, the insulted and the injured of the working class, mainly in and around Marseille, and his new film is characteristically honest and affecting. The central character is the middle-aged factory worker and socialist shop steward, Michel, a man so honest that he puts his own name in a ballot over enforced redundancy he organises and finds himself taking early retirement. Then one night, while he's playing cards with his wife Marie-Claire (Gu\u00e9diguian regular Ariane Ascaride), his sister-in-law and her husband, all fellow socialists, they're attacked by masked gunmen, brutalised, traumatised and robbed of every penny they possess along with their wedding rings.</p> <p>When one of the thieves is revealed as a redundant fellow worker, we have a strong sense of the revenge story that might follow were this a typical mainstream movie. But the thief is a young father supporting his small sons, though he has no respect for Michel and Marie-Claire, whom he regards as pampered old middle-class sellouts. Despite the plot being somewhat contrived, the film is worked through in an honourable, immensely moving and eventually inspiring manner. It left me with tears in my eyes and feeling that I was in the presence of principled, unreconstructed old lefties (Gu\u00e9diguian as well as his leading actors) who represent what is best in humanity.</p>",

As ever, Grizzly Bear remain the most welcoming listen of the three, despite being the group most shaped by jazz.You can really hear the jazz from the off, as Daniel Rossen \u2013 one of Grizzly Bear's pair of chief songwriters \u2013 weighs in with the tremendous three-legged folk shuffle of Sleeping Ute (say it out loud). At once roomy and ultra-saturated with sound, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk3tURx8a2Q\" title=\"\">Sleeping Ute</a> is no lullaby either; at one point it sounds like Grizzly Bear are upending a billiard table and throwing it down the stairs.</p> <p>Those who came to Grizzly Bear through pastoral, Fleet Foxy moments such as Two Weeks from <em>Veckatimest</em> may find <em>Shields</em> harder to penetrate. At least one particularly forthcoming track \u2013 Yet Again \u2013 has been released prior to the album. But for all its unimpeachable loveliness, it's not quite the new fan magnet that <em>Veckatimest</em>'s standouts were. <em>Shields</em>' charms don't always float as easily on the breeze. The galumph of A Simple Answer takes a moment or two to settle in the ear, and then off it soars. Two songs further in, the surprise duet&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZso9n-cWkI\" title=\"\">Gun-Shy</a> sounds rather a lot like the electronic soft rock of Metronomy;&#xa0;it's an unexpected tangent, even from a band who take tuition from masters as diverse as Radiohead and Van Dyke Parks.</p> <p>Those who have stuck around since 2006's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/sep/01/popandrock.shopping\" title=\"\"><em>Yellow House</em></a>, or even before, when Grizzly Bear was just Edward Droste in his bedroom, will likely find&#xa0;lusher pastures here. There&#xa0;are quiet passages in What's Wrong, where the singing dies away, allowing&#xa0;rumbling drums and tinging cymbal and mournful horns to reverberate elegantly.</p> <p>The band have stressed the collaborative nature of <em>Shields</em>, the first Grizzly album not to be named for a specific time and place (unless, of course, there's some studio in South Shields they are keeping mum about). Droste has written melodies for Rossen and vice versa; both Chrises (Taylor and Bear) have expanded their already considerable remit. It's possible these greater levels of democracy have muddied Grizzly Bear's immediacy. It's more likely, though, that <em>Shields</em> is a grower and that Grizzly Bear are artists not merely computing business plans, but striving for a 21st-century take on widescreen American orchestral rock, as their ambitious album closer, Sun in Your Eyes, suggests.</p>",
  "<p>We know what to expect by now from contemporary Scandinavian musicians, the restraint and lyrical melancholy, but you would hardly expect it from a duo of <a href=\"http://mariusneset.com/\" title=\"\">tenor saxophone</a> and&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.danielherskedal.com/Home.html\" title=\"\">tuba </a>\u2013 even with occasional help from a small choir. Yet these two young Norwegian virtuosi make haunting, almost unearthly music together. The question of whether it counts as jazz doesn't really arise, since it doesn't count as anything else, and it seems to take people from a jazz background to invent and play it. I'd say that if you enjoyed John Surman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/01/john-surman-saltash-bells-review\" title=\"\">latest album</a>, you will certainly enjoy this.</p>",
  "<p>Within hours of the Duchess of Cambridge news, anyone wishing to express their disgust for French photographers was already facing a severe adjective shortage, not least because the royals were using them up at such a rate. Having started the day understandably pissed off after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-photos-privacy-\" title=\"\">publication of photographs</a> showing Kate topless, the royal reaction swiftly progressed, as reported by the BBC's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19604535\" title=\"\">Peter Hunt</a> in the manner of a grief counsellor illustrating the seven stages of bereavement.</p> <p>At first, he said, the couple were \"annoyed\". Also \"saddened\" and \"disappointed\". But they were also \"philosophical\". Then, just when you might have expected them to enter \"acceptance\" followed with luck by \"hope\", the labile pair became \"hugely saddened\", then \"furious, upset\" over this \"grotesque\" event, passing through \"disbelief\" to become \"angry\" and next \"incandescent\" to the point of \"consulting lawyers\". By teatime on Friday legal proceedings had been launched and for William, now suffering from hurt, disgust and shock as well extreme incandescence in the relentless Malaysian heat, there had to be real concerns about spontaneous combustion.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in case anyone missed the connection, unnamed palace sources compared the horror at Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet (it's hoped, should you wish to rent, that Linley's captivating website will shortly be restored) with the torments of Princess Diana. The affront, a royal person said, had \"set the clock back 15 years\". It was \"reminiscent of the worse excesses of the press and paparazzi\". Really? A few blurry pictures at Ch\u00e2teau Posh, destined to be denounced by Kate fans the world over and not reproduced by our own, proudly sanctimonious red-tops, are similar to Diana's loss of consciousness in a mel\u00e9e of camera flashes and shoving paparazzi? Aren't we missing, at the very least, a drunk French driver embarking on a fatal race through a tunnel and, before that, Diana's preference for Al Fayed's security outfit over British police protection?</p> <p>Reflexive allusions to Diana's death when royal privacy is briefly or idiotically compromised, as with Harry in Vegas, are not just tasteless and disproportionate: they actively misrepresent a relationship with the press which was one even the late princess's champions acknowledge of staggering caprice. Assuming Kate does not, like both Princess Diana and Prince Charles, entrust her most private experiences to a professional biographer, or summon favoured journalists with details of photo-opportunities, or make a <em>Panorama</em> programme about her marriage and infidelity, or become emotionally dependent on her long-suffering staff, she can still \u2013 even with paparazzi roaming the Luberon \u2013 expect to enjoy a personal life that more closely resembles, in privacy terms, that of her unknowable grandmother-in-law.</p> <p>Of course, even if the topless pictures fail by some margin to sound the desired palace warning that any slippage by journalists will expose the Cambridges to persecution equivalent to Diana's, it does not mean the press is behaving nicely. Last week, while the French slobbered over Kate's breasts, a genteel British media made do with studying her womb. Basically, it wanted to know, is there anything occurring in there after this long bloody wait or not? Tricky to tell through her clothes, even with many helpful close-ups of glowing \u2013 hormonally so? \u2013 skin and snaps of the abdominal area with clutch bags held suspiciously to the fore (\u00a9 all loyal websites), but she's definitely been drinking a lot of water.</p> <p>It is, you might think, no excuse for this icky speculation that Kate actively signed up for traditional reproductive services as she did not for topless photography in France, and that no palace functionary has complained that the obsession with her impregnation sets the clock back by 500 years. Even if she is a respected Middleton professional doggedly doing her duty, the speculation is dodgy and potentially, were nothing to emerge, cruel. To date, however, radio phone-ins have not gone mad with indignation, media specialists have not distanced themselves from their stomach-examiner colleagues and a Mr Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the <em>London Evening Standard</em> and the <em>Independent</em>, has not vented, along with hundreds of others on Twitter, about \"gutter press morality\".</p> <p>The main objection to the photographs in <em>Closer</em> is that they were taken somewhere \u2013 minus, obviously, their staff and protection officers \u2013 where the couple had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p> <p>Its breach could not be justified by the public interest which evidently excuses current guessing about the couple's family planning and, more routinely, exhaustive coverage of the duchess's blow-dries, dresses, make-up, eyebrows, knees and body language. Although Prince William, according to the invaluable Hunt, vowed to protect his wife from unwelcome press, he presumably welcomed her future, in the absence of a conventional career plan, as a full-time clothes horse and promoter of his family business, available for continual public assessment and photography as required. It is not a job that would appeal to everyone, particularly given the unavoidable tension between stimulating public interest so as to ensure an adulatory press for watching the Olympics, and containing it so as to provide privacy for subsequent recuperation in the Luberon.</p> <p>When William established, as his biographer Penny Junor has said, that he would \"tolerate absolutely no intrusion into his privacy\", his idea of this condition was inevitably a modified, royal version of privacy which was well established by the time Walter Bagehot identified, in 1867, the valuable concept of \"a family on the throne\u2026 It brings down the pride of sovereignty to the level of petty life\".</p> <p>Unlike Leveson's celebrities, objecting that they never invited the public to share their lives, William and Kate have committed to precisely that transaction, performing, in exchange for their palaces and prestige, at what would normally be wholly family events. They already have the benefit, if that accurately describes their kind of celebrity, of their elders' historic willingness to act out domestic playlets for the camera, from the princesses performing wartime service to the barbecues in the 1969 documentary <em>Royal Family</em>, to the Queen's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666\" title=\"\">James Bond </a>cameo. Supposing William and Kate genuinely see themselves not as contracted national pets but as any \"young couple enjoying a holiday\" (the BBC) they should get out of sovereignty now and take Pippa and her legendary party pieces with them.</p> <p>Though it is not, you could argue, as demeaning as life as a dependent female royal, the use of the French pictures is lubricious, prying and indefensible. It can only be hoped, recalling a key event in her William courtship, that it will be less upsetting for the confident duchess than it might be for someone who had never appeared in a fashion show wearing, effectively, underwear. It may further help the Cambridges process the experience if they compare it with a 2009 appearance by Kate's Uncle Gary, at his Maison de Bang Bang in Ibiza, expatiating about William and his niece's breasts to undercover <em>News of the World</em> reporters in terms of ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 coarseness this column is reluctant, nb Leveson, to repeat. Back then they did not proclaim themselves hugely saddened by his revelations, let alone incandescent.</p>",
  "<p>It is four days since the report of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough </a>Independent Panel demolished 23 years of lies and slurs about the catastrophic day that resulted in the deaths of 96 football supporters and the besmirching of an entire community. Today, the families of the victims of that disaster, led with dignity and commitment by Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall, meet their legal advisers. The truth has finally been established, now justice is required. The current flood of mea culpas, including the very necessary apology of David Cameron, must not wash away the need for both criminal prosecutions and radical reform.</p> <p>Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire, accused of manipulating a \"black propaganda\" campaign, belatedly apologised on Friday following, among others, Boris Johnson, David Bernstein of the FA, Kelvin MacKenzie and former Tory MP Sir Irvine Patnick, who fed the lies that shaped the <em>Sun</em>'s infamous front page. The length of the list of those culpable, leading members of the establishment who denigrated their fellow citizens, and behaved perniciously, indicates that sorry is not enough. What Michael Mansfield QC, representing 60 of the families, rightly calls, a \"calamitous failure in democratic accountability\" demands to be properly addressed.</p> <p>We now know that lives, many of them young, were lost on 15 April 1989, because of an unsafe football ground and the negligence of senior officers, camouflaged by the subsequent perjury of dozens of police and emergency services staff. It beggars belief that blood samples were taken from the victims, one as young as 10, to scrabble for evidence that alcohol had fuelled the tragedy. The truth was just visible in the inquiry of Lord Chief Justice Taylor, soon after the disaster; however, much of the media and many politicians preferred the fabricated \"evidence\" that the behaviour of drunken, ticketless louts caused the loss of life. That calumny has survived two decades, reinforced by snobbery, and contempt for working-class football supporters whom it was alleged had brought it upon themselves.</p> <p>Recompense is required not just for the dead but also for the survivors, scarred mentally and physically (further wounded because they were deemed responsible for the carnage). For the families there is also new knowledge. Forty-one victims were alive beyond the cut-off point arbitrarily decided by the coroner, Stefan Popper. Today, Anne Williams is cruelly aware that her 15-year-old son Kevin was calling for her long after 3.15pm. Individuals must be called to account. It is also vital for the re-imposition of standards in public life. Without that, the public's last vestiges of trust, confidence and respect for those who are supposed to protect citizens and deliver justice when events go horrendously wrong will be shredded still further.</p> <p>Beyond the restitution of individuals, the system itself requires repair. A botched inquest, a flawed inquiry, a farcical review of evidence, a series of unsympathetic governments, an unsatisfactory judicial process and an unforgiving press, tells us so. Hillsborough demands a robust, long-term legacy that radically tackles a system still riddled with deceit, secrecy and snobbery. One that licenses crude cover-ups and permits toxic myths to take hold \u2013 the cases of the killing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\" title=\"\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>, an electrician smeared as a terrorist, and the shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a> that triggered the London riots, come to mind.</p> <p>Of course, society has changed significantly over the past two decades. It is less deferential and more questioning. The advent of social media means that the transgressions of the state have a greater chance of being exposed. In addition, there is stronger legislation to protect the rights of the individual. The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents\" title=\"\">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a>, for instance, has been instrumental in providing the facts that the Hillsborough families sought for more than two decades. It was the refusal to disclose material under the act that led to the admirable actions of Labour MPs Andy Burnham and Maria Eagle in establishing the independent (and crucially non-adversarial) panel that has finally opened the lock on Hillsborough.</p> <p>However, while there are reasons for optimism that a disaster and cover-up on such a scale is less likely to occur, there is no justification for complacency. The servants of the state continue to invest corruptly to avoid culpability and evade the twin duties of accountability and responsibility that are an essential part of leadership. The families fought magnificently to expose that malignancy; it is imperative that that malignancy is now properly excised. The question is how?</p> <p>We have seen a stream of miscarriages of justice over the years including the Guildford Four, the Cardiff Three, Stephen Lawrence and numerous deaths in custody. The Independent Police Complaints Commission's record is unimpressive, evidenced, for instance, in the case of newsvendor Ian Tomlinson. Now led by the respected Dame Anne Owers, it needs to show teeth, autonomy and integrity. Many members of the police do an excellent job under immense pressure. However, it is time too for a major inquiry into the quality of policing and what needs to change to establish a force fit for the 21st century. This should not be in the hands of lawyers but follow the impressive model of the Hillsborough Independent Panel.</p> <p>The coroners' courts, too, require attention. Lack of disclosure, the poor resourcing of families seeking justice, cover-up and misinformation continue to be a pattern for relatives seeking the truth when their loved ones die in the hands of the police and in the care of other public bodies. Against the initial wishes of the government, a chief coroner has recently been appointed and that is a positive step. Since Hillsborough, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents\" title=\"\">Human Rights Act</a> has come into force. However, the powers of the coroner remain limited; families are often marginalised and those coroners who do challenge the establishment are frequently sidelined. In addition, if the Justice and Security bill, currently going through parliament, becomes law, even greater secrecy and unaccountability is likely.</p> <p>The story of Hillsborough is one of epic courage and a belief in the power of social solidarity. The families \u2013 backed by a handful of dedicated MPs, among them the Labour MPs for the Liverpool Walton constituency where Anfield lies, Peter Kilfoyle and his successor Steve Rotheram \u2013 demonstrated that it is possible for the citizen to successfully take on the darkest side of the state. That the establishment of the truth took such a woefully long time signals how much is yet to be done.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What with all that free time between </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\"><strong>the Olympics</strong></a><strong> and the Paralympics, it's no wonder you've written a book.</strong></p> <p>It always was going to be the year of my life. I just didn't think it would be quite like this!</p> <p><strong>The book's about your childhood, and each chapter is centred on an animal that featured heavily in your life. Why?</strong></p> <p>I could kid myself that I wasn't really writing about me, although I think it is horribly revealing about me.</p> <p><strong>And about your (human) family. It's quite hard-hitting, isn't it?</strong></p> <p>It's not a children's book. It's an adult's book... It is a very dysfunctional family, and who wants a functional one? We all, in our way, have dysfunctional families.</p> <p><strong>Are you a bit of an anthropomorphiser?</strong></p> <p>Oh, totally. Certainly through childhood, that's how you connect with animals. They're people in your family. And if you could spend every minute of every day with them you would. And obviously if they could talk, your conversations would be two-way instead of one-way... you just want to hear them say \"I love you too\". That's why it's a discovery about love, of course it is.</p> <p><strong>You grew up in a horse-racing family. [Balding's father is the horse trainer Ian Balding, who trained several horses for the Queen.] It seems like a strange world. Is it?</strong></p> <p>Yes! It's a big, big goldfish bowl, and it's a successful one, but it's almost entirely self-contained. It doesn't even connect that much with other sports, apart from footballers who have racehorses.</p> <p><strong>Though you've added masses of sports to your portfolio as a presenter.</strong></p> <p>I needed to prove that I could present on television or radio, not that I could present racing. When I started in radio, luckily I had a boss who said: \"You sound great doing the racing results. If you can sound like that on everything else, then we're getting somewhere.\"</p> <p><strong>You've been a huge hit this summer. Do you know why?</strong></p> <p>I genuinely don't know. I think I was very lucky in where I was positioned \u2013 for example, the swimming was fantastic. But also I've been doing it a long time now: I'm 41, and yet this is my fifth Olympic Games. It's long enough to know how to get through it, so you pace yourself properly, and you know what you need to know.</p> <p><strong>It's been quite a challenge, though. How have you coped?</strong></p> <p>It makes me completely useless as a partner, friend, daughter, sister. I've been hopeless this summer for anyone else's sake, but I'm all right on the telly!</p> <p><strong>Whether it's on the telly or on the page, you seem to have a nose for the good story.</strong></p> <p>The fun is in the minute detail. During&#xa0;the Olympics and Paralympics, I've said to athletes, \"Look, when you get asked what does this mean to you, or what does it feel like\" \u2013 which they get asked endlessly&#xa0;\u2013 \"make it tiny. Don't go for the big thing, where you say, 'This is a dream', or 'This is all I've ever wanted'. Go for the tiny thing, the thing that a four-year-old said to you, something small, because that's what connects with people.\"</p> <p><strong>It's true: in your book the story about you shooting your breakfast across the table at the Queen is funny because of the sausage-marmalade combo. It works because you're eating something disgusting!</strong></p> <p>It's really nice though. Have you never tried it? I still have it occasionally.</p> <p><strong>The Queen isn't the only royal in the book. What about when you cut Princess Anne up when you were both jockeys in an amateur race?</strong></p> <p>I had a very clear dream last night that Princess Anne had quite a long chat with me about that. I'm clearly haunted by it.</p> <p><strong>The Queen, Princess Anne\u2026 not exactly your run-of-the-mill childhood, was it?</strong></p> <p>It was bizarre, it was extraordinary, it was immensely privileged in many&#xa0;ways, but I think it also contained a lot of the day-to-day struggles that a lot of parents have with children. I was on the edges of high society but wasn't in it. And my mother being from a very, very well connected family and my father not at all, that conflict of class is very&#xa0;real&#xa0;to me. I get it. I understand it. And I think that's quite an interesting position to be in. And, gosh, if I ever get into writing novels...</p> <p><strong>Will you?</strong></p> <p>God, I'd love to!</p> <p><strong>Any temptation to be the next Dick Francis?</strong></p> <p>I don't think so! I think you have to write what you find flows. And that was the interesting thing about&#xa0;writing this. It did start to flow so easily.</p> <p><strong>You write very forcefully about the imbalances between boys and girls&#xa0;and men and women when you&#xa0;were&#xa0;growing up.</strong></p> <p>I still think it's an eternal struggle of gender equality. It's true now, it was true then, it's certainly true in other countries now. Why are we so clearly defined by gender? Why are there things that are boys' things to do&#xa0;and girls' things to do, and who is that benefiting? I could have sugar-coated that hugely. I make that big because I want to show a mirror to an awful lot of people and say: \"Look, you're doing this. You're doing this to your children. As soon as they're born&#xa0;you're putting girls in pink and boys in blue.\"</p> <p><strong>How did it affect you?</strong></p> <p>I was just a bit of a misfit. I was a misfit from very early on and I don't know why, and I'll probably never know why, but it's sort of about the struggle to fit in and then realising that you don't want to fit in. Fitting in is boring. But it takes you nearly your whole life to work that out.</p> <p><strong>Do you think people will be surprised to discover that you were a child kleptomaniac?</strong></p> <p>Not my teachers! They knew all about&#xa0;it. Yes: but in a way that was terribly cathartic because for a long time that was the most shameful thing that had happened to me, and I hated it if people brought it up, or if I thought it was going to be brought up. That was an awful thing. It was a shameful secret, so I feel much better now everybody knows. I was a shoplifter. There we are. Full stop. And I got caught.</p> <p><strong>The book ends when you're 19, although you give us a summary of your adult life in an epilogue. Describing the development of your sexuality, you write that you realised you'd been \"looking in the wrong section of the library\". But it must have been a little more involved than that?</strong></p> <p>Yes, obviously it was, but that's quite deliberately not the story. People like to think of you as a certain person, or a certain type of person, and they do love to give you a label. We like luggage labels, and we like people labels. The interesting thing that's happened this summer is that I'm a presenter, and not even necessarily just a sports presenter, and certainly not any longer a lesbian presenter. So I think in that sense there's been a shifting of attitude, because now everybody knows and it's just part of the story but it's not the most interesting thing.</p>",

  "<p>David Foster Wallace is one of those novelists who seem to push along the evolution of the form. You can recognise his prose style by a single sentence. He mixed high and low references, postmodern philosophy and popular television, maths theory and stoner slang. The people he wrote about tended to be well-educated and not very happy, for reasons that had something to do with the zeitgeist and something to do with America. Everything they experience has been packaged for them by one kind of experience-packager or another (advertisers, tennis academies, production companies, etc) and they respond to this fact with habitual irony that turns out to be just as hard to escape or stomach as the packaging.</p> <p>One test of good writing is whether it expands the scope of what seems literary. Wallace wrote about feeling stressed out while you wait for your drug dealer to arrive and project-managing corporate focus groups. He died while working on a novel about the IRS. His sentences spliced over-the-top grammatical pedantry into lazy, semi-ironic college-kid run-ons. Somehow he managed at the same time to be a nerd and a dude.</p> <p>And yet his reputation as a novelist isn't straightforward. People talk about his nonfiction at least as much as the fiction: the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">Federer piece</a>, the <a href=\"http://harpers.org/media/pdf/dfw/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf\" title=\"\">cruise-ship piece</a>, the <a href=\"http://harpers.org/media/pdf/dfw/HarpersMagazine-1994-07-0001729.pdf\" title=\"\">State Fair piece</a>\u2026 His most famous novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780349121086/infinite-jest\" title=\"\"><em>Infinite Jest</em></a>, is so long that even at his publisher's marketing meetings people used to joke: \"Has anyone here actually read this thing?\" For all the sophistication of his prose, he sometimes gives the impression of a writer who never outgrew his precocity. <em>Infinite Jest</em> is about a rogue video so absorbing it renders anyone who watches it completely passive. There's a subplot involving the Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N.). One of his short stories describes an artist who becomes famous for what he shits. Of course, this kind of thing is supposed to be funny, but it isn't just the humour that seems sophomoric. Wallace's obsession with the problems of irony and authenticity and boredom, with TV and advertising and pot, suggests that his sense of what matters to people remained fundamentally shaped by his college years.</p> <p>One thing DT Max's new biography makes clear, though, is that this is a guy who suffered. Wallace hanged himself in 2008, at the age of 46, after years of carefully medicated depression. Max has written the book before his subject's literary reputation has had a chance to settle, but the biography itself feels fresh rather than hurried. You get the painful sense of a life that should still have been in progress. One problem with literary biographies is that their subjects tend to analyse themselves better than their biographers can. Max solves this by mining Wallace's own work, particularly <em>Infinite Jest</em>, for sophisticated expressions of the author's mental states. The technique not only brings Wallace to life, it brings the work into play as well. As it happens, Max is a very smart writer himself and has managed to write the biography without falling in love or out&#xa0;of love with his subject.</p> <p>This can't have been easy, for Wallace doesn't always come across as easy to like. He grew up in Urbana, near the campus of the University of Illinois, where his father taught philosophy, on a street just a few blocks from prairie land. He told an interviewer that his father read <em>Moby-Dick</em> to him and his sister Amy when they were five and three years old. (Their father denies this.) His mother used to cough ostentatiously when her kids made grammatical mistakes. On a summer road trip, they once decided to replace any mention of the word \"pie\" with 3.14159 \u2013 that was the kind of family he belonged to.</p> <p>When he was nine, he suffered his first episode of \"depressive, clinically anxious feelings\" \u2013 what his mother later referred to as the \"black hole with teeth\". Even if the depression went away, he was turning into an anxious kid. He wasn't very good at sports, he sweated a lot, puberty gave him a bad case of acne. As a teenager he discovered pot and tennis and tried to discover girls \u2013 but they were harder to figure out than the \"trajectory of a tennis shot\". He watched a lot of TV. But he also found his schoolwork easy, and since he liked winning, he devoted&#xa0;a great deal of his obsessive energy to doing well.</p> <p>Wallace went to Amherst, the prestigious liberal arts college in Massachusetts, and eventually graduated top of his class \u2013 having become a well-known, almost cultish figure on campus. But he had also taken time off to cope with depression. \"What's wrong?\" his room-mate asked him once, seeing Wallace sitting on a packed suitcase. \"I don't know. There's something wrong with me,\" he said. (The room-mate was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/mark-costello\" title=\"\">Mark Costello</a>, who turned into a pretty good novelist himself.) He was eventually diagnosed with \"atypical depression\" and put on a drug called Nardil to deal with it \u2013 which he took for much of the rest of his life. At Amherst he fell in love with technical philosophy and maths theory (he turned out not to be very good at the maths itself), and then moved on to postmodern fiction. Some of his friends were discussing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099532613/the-crying-of-lot\" title=\"\"><em>The Crying of Lot 49</em></a>, so Wallace read it. As Costello remembers, it was like \"Bob Dylan finding Woody Guthrie\". For one of his senior projects, Wallace wrote a novel, which eventually became <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780349109237/the-broom-of-the-system\" title=\"\"><em>The Broom of the System</em></a>, his first published book.</p> <p>The rest of his life followed the pattern he set up at Amherst. School and writing, studying and teaching, interrupted periodically by bouts of depression and time in rehab to cope with addiction. Pot was always a problem for him, but during one visit to <a href=\"http://www.yaddo.org/\" title=\"\">Yaddo</a>, the writers' colony in upstate New York, he fell under the wing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/12/interview-jay-mcinerney\" title=\"\">Jay McInerney</a> and started drinking a lot, too. Wallace once joked about the difficulties his future biographer would face: \"Dave sat in the smoking lounge of the library, pensively taking a drag from a cigarette and trying to think of the next line.\" As it happens, Max's biography does a good job of dramatising not only the struggles of composition but the slightly depressing fun of a writer's life \u2013 these&#xa0;visits to Yaddo, the book tours (what Wallace referred to as facing the \"eye of Sauron\"), the groupie sex. (He once ditched Costello at a book launch when a young blonde came up to him and said: \"Do you want to meet my puppy?\") <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/michael-chabon\" title=\"\">Michael Chabon</a> has written about the need for writers to have \"manageable vices\" \u2013 Wallace had a pretty hard time managing his. During&#xa0;one period of self-doubt, he signed up for postgraduate work in philosophy at Harvard, then checked himself a few months later into the psychiatric institute at McLean Hospital. The four weeks he spent there, Max writes, \"changed his life\" \u2013 he got clean and spent the rest of his life as a recovering addict.</p> <p>The novel that grew out of this difficult period became <em>Infinite Jest</em> \u2013 which included many of the voices and stories he heard in his recovery sessions. Wallace remained an experimental writer, but the hip irony of his first two books had been replaced by what he called \"single entendre\" writing. Rehab had taught him the power of sincerity. Rumours of the novel made their way through New York publishing circles \u2013 this was going to be Wallace's \"big shit\", as he put it himself. Even after ferocious editing the book weighed in at 484,000 words. By the time of its publication, Wallace had started to make a name for himself, not only as a cutting-edge fiction guy, but as a magazine writer who covered kitsch events in a literary, humorous, memoiry way. The world was ready to take him seriously, and <em>Infinite Jest</em> became a big hit. Wallace's readings sold out, celebrities showed up to hear him talk, he had become a celebrity&#xa0;himself.</p> <p>Celebrity brought its own problems. He once complained to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jonathan-franzen\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen</a> that his destiny in life seemed to be to \"put my penis in as many vaginas as possible\". This is a typical Wallace line \u2013 candid, self-mocking and boastful at the same time. The boy once known as \"mushface\" took pleasure from the fact that he had figured out how to get the girls into bed. But sex also brought out the worst in him. He tried to push one girlfriend in front of a moving car, he threw a coffee table at her; once he even arranged to buy a gun to kill her husband. Then there was the sheer number of his relationships. He once told a friend that he had slept with an underage girl. As Max writes, \"He saw that the need to make every woman fall madly in love with him had made him highly manipulative.\" It made him, as Wallace put it himself, not so different from \"the people selling Tide\". Of course, what partly redeems a writer is his gift for self-exposure, and Wallace managed to turn his sexual boastfulness and self-doubt into interesting fiction: the short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780349111889/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men\" title=\"\"><em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em></a>.</p> <p>But Max finds more to admire about Wallace than his prose. He could be very generous towards other writers \u2013 such as Franzen, whose first book Wallace read and loved at a time when his own writing was going particularly badly. And in more practical ways, too. When he started making money, not just from the fiction, but from the <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/\" title=\"\">MacArthur \"genius\" grant</a>, which he won in 1997, he began giving it away to help his friends. And many of these friends came from the people he met at recovery meetings, who seem to have treated Wallace like something of a holy fool. He worked very hard for his students, triple-marking their submissions in different coloured pens. And he got over his womanising phase, and married a woman with a teenage son, and managed to be happy with ordinary domestic existence, in spite of the fact that his work \u2013 on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780241144800/the-pale-king\" title=\"\"><em>The Pale King</em></a> \u2013 wasn't going well. Until he decided to come off the Nardil, just to see if that was the problem, and if maybe he was ready to live an entirely drug-free life.</p> <p>After that, nothing went right or felt right any more \u2013 Max's account of those last years is harrowing. And Wallace himself emerges as something of a hero. First, he tried living without any medication, then he tried one kind after another, and all this tinkering produced an ever more fragile sense of his relation to the world. Throughout the book Max makes a strong case that Wallace's analysis of what's wrong with America and modern life is deeply grounded in his own struggles and issues \u2013 the various insecurities and obsessions, the whole problem of a sophisticatedly mediated existence. Eventually, he went back on the Nardil. It takes a while to reach some kind of balance with these drugs, but Wallace was finding it harder and harder to keep going. You get the picture of this incredibly smart, increasingly humble man trying to figure out, for reasons both personal and literary, how to be alive in the universe, and failing.</p> <p>Towards the end his wife put him on a more or less constant suicide watch. At one stretch, she didn't leave the house for more than a week. But then he seemed better and one day Wallace persuaded her to go out. \"You don't go to the chiropractor if you're going to kill yourself,\" she thought. When she came back to the house he had hanged himself from a trellis on the patio. He left her a two-page note and a stack of what he could salvage from that difficult last novel among the lamps in the garage where he used to write.</p> <p><em>Benjamin Markovits's most recent novel is </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571233373/childish-loves\" title=\"\"><em>Childish Loves</em></a><em> (Faber)</em></p>",
  "<h2>Group A</h2> <p>Kevin Pietersen's absence makes England's defence more onerous but Jade Dernbach and Graeme Swann can give them control with the ball and Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler provide explosive hitting. Afghanistan's progress has enraptured romantics but this is about profile and development for them. Despite playing the most T20 games, thanks to the IPL, India flatter to deceive but if they can recapture their ambition, sated after winning the World Cup, Yuvraj Singh's return after cancer surgery offers sentiment and impetus.</p> <p><strong>Look out for </strong>Mohammad Shahzad, classy rotund batsman who does not lack power</p> <h2>Group B</h2> <p>Australia's fall to ninth place in the rankings, one above Ireland, has provoked much mirth and they do look heavily reliant on the veteran Hussey brothers, the quixotic David Warner and the 41-year-old Brad Hogg. West Indies look like possible champions if the unity holds with Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, the Bravo brothers and Sunil Narine all matchwinners. Ireland's bowling is their weaker suit but with Kevin O'Brien's potential for devastating hitting and the experience of Tim Murtagh and Ed Joyce they will be dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Look out for</strong> Chris Gayle, the world's best T20 batsman, endangering the crowd</p> <h2>Group C</h2> <p>A young man's game? Not for the hosts' stellar batsmen Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara who are all in their mid-30s but retain strikerates the envy of most elite batsmen. South Africa have formidable strength and balance with Hashim Amla in the form of his life, AB De Villiers a huge threat, trademark spinners who spear it in and Dale Steyn's nous and pace, but the other quicks have been erratic. Zimbabwe are improving and look less likely to be trounced but should not trouble the others.</p> <p><strong>Look out for</strong> Lasith Malinga, hostile and capable of routing teams with his yorkers</p> <h2>Group D</h2> <p>Pakistan's bowling with Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Umar 'the Guldozer' Gul looks spicy but runs and consistency might be a problem. The cliche about New Zealand punching above their weight holds true and in Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor, Jacob Oram and Daniel Vettori they possess IPL royalty, and their bowling should be strong enough to get them into the Super Eights but no further. Tamim Iqbal is marvellous but Bangladesh simply haven't got the depth of talent to give them more than a puncher's chance.</p> <p><strong>Look out for</strong> Saeed Ajmal, the No1 spinner, smothers and hoodwinks equally effectively</p>",
  "<p>England begin their defence of the World Twenty20 title with a critical fixture against Afghanistan in Colombo on Friday. At the turn of the century such a sentence would have been beyond comprehension. There was no such thing as Twenty20 cricket in 2000 and the notion that Afghanistan could be among the 12 best teams in the world was also unthinkable.</p> <p>Most people now welcome the advent of Twenty20 cricket. Everyone rejoices in the remarkable emergence of Afghanistan as a credible cricketing nation. The match on Friday will be a source of genuine concern for England. Lose it and their place in the next round of the competition will be in jeopardy (they would have to defeat India next Sunday to have a chance of staying in the tournament).</p> <p>Moreover, the shorter the game the better the chances for the underdog. We know that Afghanistan can bowl: in Bridgetown two years ago they restricted South Africa to 139 for seven. Their batting may be a little more naive, but it only takes one inspired innings. In any case, a bit of naivety is to be welcomed. Last time, in St Lucia, the Afghan players broke off to applaud the local steel band for playing the Afghan national anthem.</p> <p>Afghanistan provide most of the romance, but Ireland are on hand to contribute a little bit more if necessary. However, they now possess so many household names in Birmingham and beyond that they are rarely underestimated. William Porterfield and Boyd Rankin of Warwickshire will soon be collecting their Championship medals. If there were a runners-up medal, George Dockrell (Somerset) would be picking up one of those as well. England may not need reminding what Kevin O'Brien or Ed Joyce can do if it is their day.</p> <p>Here we must celebrate the ICC's T20 rankings, not so much because England somehow sit at the top, but because Ireland and Australia have been vying for the No9 slot in recent times. Bangladesh are currently No8 (<em>Ed, please keep this in for the </em>Observer<em>'s Melbourne edition</em>).</p> <p>Australia and Ireland meet on Wednesday in Colombo and the old-fashioned English tradition of barracking for the underdog will surely come to the fore. But which team will that mean supporting? Nowadays Ireland do more than travel hopefully and tunefully.</p> <p>This is the fourth T20 World Cup and the previous three \u2013 in South Africa, England and the Caribbean \u2013 have been deemed a success. The main reason for that, which is always forgotten when organising the 50-over World Cup, is that the tournament usually \"leaves 'em wanting more\". The games come thick and fast and it is all over in less than three weeks.</p> <p>This competition in Sri Lanka should be no exception \u2013 with one caveat: the country can be beset by thunderstorms at this time of year. It is not just the England and Wales Cricket Board that thinks it has the capacity to control the weather; the International Cricket Council seems pretty confident of that as well.</p> <p>The format is simple enough: there are four groups of three teams. After two preliminary matches, eight teams qualify for the Super Eights (the anticipation is that Afghanistan, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh will be shed, but don't bank on that). From the Super Eights come the four semi-finalists.</p> <p>Most of the fixtures take place in Colombo and Pallekele near Kandy, though Sri Lanka open the tournament in distant Hambantota against Zimbabwe on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the women play their preliminary fixtures in Galle before joining up with the men in Colombo for the semi-finals.</p> <p>No one is too confident about the likely outcome in the men's tournament. England may be the holders, they may be ranked as the best team in the world by the ICC, but Ladbrokes has them as seventh favourites \u2013 even below Australia. Instead India are the favourites, perhaps based on the presence of players who are so familiar with this format of the game in the Indian Premier League. It will be fascinating to monitor the value of all that IPL experience over the next three weeks. Their captain, MS Dhoni, is used to lifting ICC \u2013 and IPL \u2013 trophies.</p> <p>Sri Lanka must be a threat on their own turf. The old soldiers, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Lasith Malinga, are still there, along with an intriguing unknown. Akila Dananjaya is 18, the son of a carpenter from Panadura, south of Colombo, and he was selected for Sri Lanka's preliminary squad before he had played a game as a professional cricketer. He impressed Jayawardene so much in a net session (when he was supposed to be mimicking Saeed Ajmal) that he was fast-tracked. Naturally, Dananjaya does not bowl in the manner of Graeme Swann or Danny Briggs; he bowls \"mystery spin\" with carrom balls and doosras abounding. His youth makes him even more mysterious than Ajantha Mendis, who is back in favour.</p> <p>West Indies are also fancied on the perfectly reasonable basis that it only takes Chris Gayle or Kieron Pollard to run riot and the match is over. They, too, possess a bit of mystery in Sunil Narine, who may enjoy bowling in Sri Lanka this autumn rather more than he did in England this summer.</p> <p>As for England, they have the luxury, like Australia, of being underdogs \u2013 as they were last time. Charlotte Edwards has a better chance of lifting a trophy than Stuart Broad \u2013 England's women are expected not only to cruise to the semi-finals but they are also favourites to win.</p>",

Insiders believe he has already instructed lawyers to begin the necessary legal action to terminate publication. Its website remained down on Saturday evening. Desmond's company, Northern &amp; Shell, co-owns the Irish Daily Star with the Dublin-based Independent News &amp; Media (INM).</p> <p>Desmond said: \"I am very angry at the decision to publish these photographs and am taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture. The decision to publish these pictures has no justification whatever and Northern &amp; Shell condemns it in the strongest possible terms.\"</p> <p>Desmond was not informed of the decision by the newspaper's editor, Michael O'Kane, to publish the pictures of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, and was extremely upset when he discovered it had, despite the company initially saying it had no editorial control. He immediately distanced himself from the action. Northern &amp; Shell issued a statement saying that the company abhorred the decision and was \"profoundly dismayed\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman added: \"We consider all aspects of privacy very carefully, and would never condone this action.\"</p> <p>The editor of the Daily Star on Sunday, Gareth Morgan, launched an even stronger attack. He said: \"We're absolutely horrified here in the office, and as a company. This has no merit as an editorial decision, it has no merit morally, it's frankly a horrible decision.\"</p> <p>INM's management has changed since its joint venture was agreed with Northern &amp; Shell. Its former chief executive, Gavin O'Reilly, has gone and a source said that Desmond is disenchanted with the new structure.</p> <p>INM also distanced itself from the paper's actions. It said in a statement: \"The decision by the Irish Daily Star to republish pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from the French magazine Closer was regrettable and in poor taste. Independent News and Media had no prior knowledge of the decision to publish.\"</p> <p>Desmond spoke after St James's Palace denounced the publication of the photos in France as \"grotesque and totally unjustifiable\", adding: \"There can be no motivation for this action other than greed.\"</p> <p>The palace has sought to dissuade others from using the pictures by launching legal action against Closer after it printed four pages of the shots showing the couple at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet in Provence.</p> <p>The move to publish in the Republic of Ireland, which would seem in breach of the UK editors' code of practice relating to privacy, came after the editor of Italian gossip magazine Chi announced he was to use 30 previously unseen topless shots over 24 pages under the headline \"The Queen is Naked\" on Monday.</p> <p>The royal couple could sue the Irish Daily Star in Britain because it is owned by a media company with some of its assets in the UK, an Irish legal expert said on Saturday.</p> <p>Peter Preston, the Observer's media commentator, said: \"The Daily Star sells over 64,000 in the Republic. It's a big player, signed up to honour and obey the Irish press ombudsman who so impressed Lord Justice Leveson.\"</p> <p>Preston said there were ramifications from printing the pictures \"far beyond the simple point that Irish law is not English \u2013 or French \u2013 law where privacy is concerned\".</p> <p>\"How many cases can the Prince of Wales \u2013 expensively, slowly \u2013 mount? How many extra copies of overseas magazines or papers will be sold on the back of them? It's all an object lesson in hoping that old law can manage new sorts of crisis. And that it's high, digital time to move on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Extradition is diplomatic, political and legal. Its purpose is to ensure that those who are alleged to have committed serious crimes within one legal jurisdiction cannot escape prosecution by simply moving to another. Two principles underpin the proper approach to extradition.</p> <p>First, the obligation on any government to ensure that the rights of its citizens both at home and abroad are protected. Second, that it is in the interests of all of us that criminal behaviour wherever it is committed should be prosecuted. In abstract these principles seem unexceptionable but in practice they have the potential to cause a serious diplomatic, political or legal clash. Any such clash damages the confidence of the public in extradition.</p> <p>A clash has arisen between the United Kingdom and the United States, which is why Nick Clegg asked me to review the issue of extradition.</p> <p>What makes the clash particularly disturbing on both sides of the Atlantic is that it arises as a result of a treaty entered into by the Blair government and the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11 with the understandable purpose of making the transfer of alleged terrorists between the two countries as effective and efficient as possible. The British Parliament quickly ratified the treaty and passed the necessary consequential domestic legislation. The American Senate, which has the power to ratify treaties, delayed under the influence of the Irish lobby, but ultimately did so. A treaty between close allies with a common interest in dealing expeditiously with terror suspects might be thought to be an ideal way in which to regularise these matters. But unhappily this has not been the effect in this case.</p> <p>The most controversial element arises from the fact that in accordance with the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, \"probable cause\" has to be shown before a UK request for extradition of an American citizen will be granted. For British citizens the reciprocal test is \"reasonable suspicion\". That these tests embody different standards to the disadvantage of United Kingdom citizens was accepted by the Blair government during the ratification process, though now it appears that one of those responsible has departed from that view. The Baker Inquiry established by Theresa May reached the conclusion that that there was no practical difference between the two tests. With that conclusion I respectfully disagree. To put the matter as simply as I can one may have a \"suspicion\" that someone has committed a crime but that is a different and lower standard than being satisfied that it is \"probable\" that a crime was committed by that person. The proper course should be to raise the British standard to the American one so that UK citizens do not suffer a disadvantage compared to their US equivalents.</p> <p>If the present British government is to fulfil its duty to protect the rights of its citizens at home and abroad, and at the same time meet its treaty obligations, such a change is both necessary and possible, not least to restore public confidence in Britain in the process of extradition between the United States and the United Kingdom.</p> <p>But it seems necessary to go further. An act committed in one country may produce consequences in another. Questions may then arise as to where the alleged criminal should be prosecuted. At present that decision is taken in the United Kingdom by the prosecuting authorities and in private. In the interests of transparency and proper recognition of the rights of UK citizens the decision should be taken by a judge in open court. It is argued that such a procedure, which is commonly called \"forum bar\", would delay the outcome of proceedings for extradition. And a similar objection is made to the requirement that prima facie evidence should be available to a court when extradition is sought.</p> <p>But accepting such requirements would fulfil the responsibility of the British government to protect the human rights of its citizens at home and abroad, a responsibility which it shares with Parliament.</p> <p>A further argument worth consideration is whether the penal consequences of extradition, prosecution and conviction such as the length of any sentence and the conditions in which it may be served should be taken into account.</p> <p>It must surely be right that the courts in this country should not be obliged to prioritise the principle of mutual recognition which underpins the concept of extradition to such a degree that the threshold for resisting extradition on human rights is set at a level which effectively deprives a person of any human rights protection at all.</p> <p>Both the United States and the United Kingdom have a common interest in resolving these issues in such a way as to preserve the effectiveness of extradition while ensuring its fairness in operation.</p>",
  "<p>A growing number of breakfast clubs in primary schools are being forced to close because of budget cuts, despite evidence of increasing demand. As the academic year gets under way, the cuts risk leaving many vulnerable children in danger of going to school hungry and unable to concentrate in lessons, according to experts.</p> <p>Requests made under freedom of information law to 128 local authorities by the Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister for children and families, found 40% reporting a decrease in the number of breakfast clubs.</p> <p>Some of the cuts are severe. Essex county council said the county had 219 breakfast clubs in schools last year, but 169 this year. In Surrey, 2,870 children were being given breakfast last year but only 1,200 in 2012.</p> <p>\"That 40% of councils we know about are seeing numbers falling is extremely worrying,\" said Hodgson. \"For some children, their free school meals through the week may be the only good meal they get, and we know that hungry children struggle to concentrate in class. Breakfast clubs are therefore incredibly important in improving education outcomes in all areas, but certainly in the most deprived.\"</p> <p>The findings are backed up by anecdotal evidence from organisations in the field. The educational charity <a href=\"http://www.continyou.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ContinYou</a> provides grants for primary school breakfast clubs in partnership with Kellogg's. \"We used to get about two calls a month from schools looking for funding to establish or continue supporting breakfast clubs,\" said Karin Woodley, the charity's chief executive. \"Last week we received 15 inquiries. At least one in eight breakfast clubs has closed in the last 12 months and teachers keep telling us this is due to local authority budget cuts.\"</p> <p>At one point there were believed to be 20,000 school breakfast clubs in Britain. While a proportion of parents use breakfast clubs because working hours make it difficult to feed their children at home, more and more schools are reporting that the service is being used by families unable to afford enough food.</p> <p>In <em>Observer Food Monthly,</em> Carmel McConnell, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.magicbreakfast.com/\" title=\"\">Magic Breakfast</a>, which supplies food and support to about 200 clubs, describes the situation as \"pure social failure\". \"We used to have 20 or 30 schools on our waiting list. Now we have 130,\" she says. \"The forms they fill in would make you weep: children coming into school listless because they're hungry. We're also seeing more midweek hunger as pay packets and benefits run out at home.\"</p> <p>According to figures gathered by Magic Breakfast, 88% of teachers say the introduction of a breakfast club leads to improved attendance and attainment, while 93% say it has led to better concentration in class.</p> <p>Earlier this year the Royal College of General Practitioners, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health called on the government to give the 1.3&#xa0;million children in England already entitled to free school meals free breakfasts too. Wales introduced free breakfasts in primary schools in 2007, but the Department for Education said it had no plans to follow suit.</p> <p>A DfE spokesman acknowledged the importance of the service. \"Breakfast clubs can improve children's attendance, concentration, motivation and promote healthy eating habits.\"</p> <p>However, he said that it was up to schools how they spent the funds they were given. The \"pupil premium\", aimed at the most disadvantaged children, would be doubled, the DFE said, but not until 2014-15.</p>",

With no eventual reveal that the whole thing was a spaceship, or the result of any perception filters, this was the full-blooded tale of a real town under real siege from a lone gunman \u2013 and it came complete with its own noble sheriff, the Doctor on horseback, and, irresistibly, its own High Noon moment.</p> \n<p>Writer Toby Whithouse delivered a complex morality dilemma fizzing with sharp dialogue, Adrian Scarborough\u2019s Kahler-Jex brought some British eccentricity, and director Saul Metzstein did an effective job of recreating the look of classics of the genre. If anything, A Town Called Mercy was more effective as a western than as a Doctor Who episode.</p> \n<h2>\u201cToday I honour the victims first. His, the Master\u2019s, the Daleks\u2019, all the people who died because of my mercy\u201d</h2> \n<p>One of the classic western tropes is the wounded traveller confronting his demons. Here that role fell to Kahler-Jex, reflected off the Gunslinger \u2013 with both sides of that struggle refracted through the Doctor himself. This was also the source of the episode\u2019s emotional wallop, drawing excellent performances (once again) from Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. In fact it was Gillan who emerged as the real star of the episode: pratfalling with the pistol but facing off against the Doctor.</p> \n<p>Seeing the Doctor holding a gun is never going to be a comfortable sight, but Whithouse pushed him to that point deftly \u2013 certainly with more delicacy than displayed in the previous episode\u2019s clunky business with Solomon, which was presumably designed as the build-up to this week\u2019s events. The end point, however, was worth it \u2013 with it now falling to Amy to be the Doctor\u2019s keeper. Her line: \u201cThis is what happens when you travel on your own for too long,\u201d was genuinely moving. And fans can\u2019t help but worry about what\u2019s going to happen to the Doctor when Amy\u2019s gone. Because given that she\u2019s a blown-up Dalek, Jenna-Louise Coleman\u2019s Oswin isn\u2019t going to be much immediate use.</p> \n<h2>Pond watch</h2> \n<p>The Tardis crew ended up in the Old West because the Doctor misfired in his mission to take them to the Day Of The Dead festival in Mexico. That\u2019s the sort of cultural reference Whithouse is good at, because that is <em>exactly</em> the sort of place a couple like the Ponds would choose to holiday if they had a space-time machine that made money no object. It says a lot about their changing relationship with the Doctor that he has become a travel agent for them.</p> \n<h2>Fear factor</h2> \n<p>Again, being a Whithouse script, this was full of paranoid philosophising of the kind we\u2019re used to from Being Human. Jex was great for this \u2013 I liked the \u201cWe all carry our prisons with us\u201d line in particular. But this was not really one for behind-the-sofa moments. The Gunslinger was cute as much as anything else. In the end, he found a kind of nobility.</p> \n<h2>Mysteries and questions</h2> \n<p>Well done to <strong>@FindOutForYourself</strong> in the comments for picking up the repeat pattern of the malfunctioning light-fitting. I must say I\u2019d made a link between its appearance both here and in Asylum Of The Daleks, but had completely missed the significance in Dinosaurs On a Spaceship. It seems inevitable that it will play into the Ponds\u2019 exit, since their final adventure is with the Weeping Angels. What happens when a light flickers? It goes dark and you can\u2019t see!</p> \n<p>Mind you, while we\u2019re all theorising about the terrible end possibly facing the Ponds <strong>@xandaca</strong> pointed to their \u201cfading interest\u201d in travelling with the Doctor \u2013 something that\u2019s borne out both here and in the Next Week trail.</p> \n<p>And yes, <strong>@PhaseShift</strong>, it was you who made the connection last week that maybe Oswin is <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Jagaroth\" title=\"\">a Jagaroth</a>!</p> \n<h2>Time-space debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 A Town Called Mercy was filmed at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernas_Desert\" title=\"\">Desert Of Tabernas</a> in Almeria, Spain, which also provided the location for A Fistful Of Dollars, and For A Few Dollars More.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cCan everyone who isn\u2019t an American please drop your weapons?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Doctor Who has been to the Wild West before, in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/gunfighters/\" title=\"\">1966 William Hartnell story The Gunfighters</a>. Whithouse did reconsider watching it, but was advised by Moffat and Mark Gatiss not to, because: \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a jewel in the crown.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 A noble and moving performance from Ben Browder as poor Isaac. Browder of course has sci-fi form as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRFqXigg_do\" title=\"\">the star of Farscape</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Was anybody else a bit befuddled by the exact nature of the plan? Confuse The Gunslinger by all putting Jex tattoos on, then drive him mad by shorting his blaster with the sonic screwdriver? Surely they would have been stumped if Jex hadn\u2019t done what he did?</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cNo, his name\u2019s Susan and he wants you to respect his life choices.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Next week!</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s At Home With The Ponds time with The Power Of Three and \u201cthe year of the slow invasion\u201d. It features not only the return of Brian, but Rory in his pants.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6d7356c-35df-444b-aa63-782a4127441b\"

  "<p>The row over publication of photographs of a topless Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing on holiday in France intensified on Saturday after the Irish <em>Daily Star</em> published the pictures in its Saturday edition.</p> <p>St James's Palace denounced the move as motivated by greed and has sought to dissuade others from using the pictures by launching legal action against a French magazine, <em>Closer,</em> after it printed four pages of the shots of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet in Provence.</p> <p>However, the crisis has deepened with the decision by a British publisher to use the paparazzi shots for the first time \u2013 albeit not in its British publications which would, on the face of it, breach the UK editors' code of practice.</p> <p>The move to publish in the Republic of Ireland came after the editor of an Italian gossip magazine announced he was to use 30 previously unseen topless shots over 24 pages under the headline \"The Queen is Naked\" on Monday.</p> <p>The editor of the Irish <em>Daily Star</em>, Mike O'Kane, said the pictures would not feature in the Northern Ireland and British editions. But Richard Desmond, chairman of co-owner Northern and Shell, said he was taking \"immediate steps\" to close down the joint venture with Ireland's Independent News and Media, which runs the paper. St James's Palace, which had described the publication of the photos in France as \"grotesque and totally unjustifiable\", said: \"There can be no motivation for this action other than greed.\"</p> <p>O'Kane said the printing of the pictures was only causing upset in the UK, and not the rest of Europe. \"The duchess would be no different to any other celeb pics we would get in, for example Rihanna or Lady Gaga. She's not the future queen of Ireland, so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the UK, and they are very, very tasteful pictures.\"</p> <p>The newspaper carried an image of <em>Closer</em> magazine on its front page and ran 13 photos of the duchess over a spread inside under the headline \"Kate fears new intimate pics\".</p> <p>The editors' code of practice in the UK stipulates that it is \"unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent\" and defines private as \"public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Northern &amp; Shell sought to distance the company from the decision to publish. \"The Irish <em>Daily Star</em> is a joint venture with Independent News &amp; Media over which we have no editorial control.</p> <p>'We are consulting with our lawyers as a matter of urgency over what we believe to be a serious breach of their contract. We abhor the decision of the Irish <em>Daily Star</em> to publish these intrusive pictures of the duke and duchess which we, like St James's Palace, believe to be a grotesque invasion of their privacy.\"</p> <p>The royal couple could sue the Irish <em>Daily Star</em> in Britain because it is owned by a media company with some of its assets in the UK, a top Irish media lawyer warned on Saturday, saying: \"If the paper's owners have assets in the UK then the duke and duchess could enforce a judgment against that publisher in a British court.\"</p> <p>He also confirmed that the heir to the throne and his wife would make a complaint to Ireland's press ombudsman, who has the power to demand that a publication prints an apology.</p> <p>He said that the Irish <em>Daily Star</em> should be careful of \"leakage across the border\" in terms of its southern edition being sold in Northern Ireland where UK jurisdiction would apply.</p> <p>Peter Preston, the <em>Observer's</em> media commentator, said: \"The <em>Daily Star</em> sells over 64,000 in the Republic. It's a big player, signed up to honour and obey the Irish press ombudsman who so impressed Lord Justice Leveson.\"</p> <p>Preston said there were ramifications from printing the pictures \"far beyond the simple point that Irish law is not English \u2013 or French \u2013 law where privacy is concerned.</p> <p>\"How many cases can the Prince of Wales \u2013 expensively, slowly \u2013 mount? How many extra copies of overseas magazines or papers will be sold on the back of them? It's all an object lesson in hoping that old law can manage new sorts of crisis. And that it's high, digital time to move on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bill Binney believes he helped create a monster.</p> <p>Sitting in the innocuous surroundings of an Olive Garden in the Baltimore suburbs, the former senior National Security Agency (NSA) official even believes he owes the whole American people an apology.</p> <p>Binney, a tall, professorial man in his late 60s, led the development of a secret software code he now believes is illegally collecting huge amounts of information on his fellow citizens. For the staunch Republican, who worked for 32 years at the NSA, it is a civil liberties nightmare come true.</p> <p>So Binney has started speaking out as an NSA whistleblower \u2013 an act that has earned him an armed FBI raid on his home. \"What's happening is a violation of the constitutional rights of everybody in the country. That's pretty straightforward. I could not be associated with it,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Binney, a career NSA employee who first volunteered for the army in the mid-1960s, has now become a high-profile thorn in the side of NSA chiefs when they deny the programme's existence.</p> <p>At a hacking conference this summer in Las Vegas, NSA director General Keith Alexander said the NSA \"absolutely\" did not keep files on Americans.</p> <p>\"Anyone who would tell you that we're keeping files or dossiers on the American people knows that's not true,\" Alexander told an audience of computer and security experts. But Binney himself was at the same conference and publicly accused Alexander of playing a \"word game\".</p> <p>\"Once the software takes in data, it will build profiles on everyone in that data,\" he told a convention panel there.</p> <p>Binney's outspokenness has earned him media appearances on shows across America's political spectrum ranging from ultra-conservative Glenn Beck's TV show to the liberal radio icon of Democracy Now.</p> <p>\"This is not a political issue. People on both sides are concerned,\" Binney said.</p> <p>The story Binney tells is one of extreme over-reaction by America's national security establishment post-9/11. He recounts developing a small software system, called ThinThread, in the late 1990s at the NSA where he was the technical director of the organisation's 6,000-strong World Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group.</p> <p>ThinThread correlated data from emails, phone calls, credit card payments and Internet searches and stored and mapped it in ways that could be analysed.</p> <p>Binney wanted to use ThinThread to track foreign threats but it worked too well and kept catching data on Americans too.</p> <p>So Binney's team built in safeguards that encrypted that data. But, by 2000, the NSA decided to go with developing a larger scale programme called Trailblazer to be built by outside contractors (that eventually failed to make it past the design stage) and ThinThread was effectively mothballed.</p> <p>Then September 11 happened. Within a few weeks, Binney says, he realised parts of ThinThread were now being used by the NSA in a massive and secret surveillance operation.</p> <p>But his safeguards had been removed allowing for far more targeted surveillance of American citizens. \"I knew the dangers so I built in protections. And you could still find the bad guys with the protections in it. But that wasn't what they wanted so they took those things out,\" Binney said.</p> <p>Binney quickly left the agency and kept his silence. But that was not the end of the story. In late 2005, the New York Times broke the story that the NSA was engaged in large-scale warrantless electronic surveillance.</p> <p>The scandal eventually led to the passing of amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2008 which, many critics say, simply gave legal protection to the agency's data-mining operations.</p> <p>The programme has thus effectively continued under the Obama administration, which has launched a ruthless crackdown on national security whistleblowers, especially those leaking NSA secrets.</p> <p>Binney gradually began to protest behind the scenes. Yet that earned him an FBI raid by armed agents as he showered at his home. \"Here's a guy coming into my shower and pointing a gun at me. I'd been co-operating with these people. Why are they doing this?\" he said.</p> <p>Over the past year Binney has gone fully public, detailing what he believes is a massive effort under the Obama administration to collect virtually all electronic data in the country, from Facebook posts to Google searches to emails.</p> <p>It is a deeply secret programme, Binney says, that is called Stellar Wind. He points to the NSA's creation of a giant data centre at Bluffdale in Utah as part of the system.</p> <p>The gigantic building is set to cost $2bn and be up and running by 2013.</p> <p>It is being designed to store huge amounts of accessible web information \u2013 such as social media updates \u2013 but also information in the \"deep web\" behind passwords and other firewalls that keep it away from the public.</p> <p>As an example of Stellar Wind's power, Binney believes it is hoovering up virtually every email sent by every American and perhaps a good deal of the people of the rest of the world, too.</p> <p>\"I didn't expect it from my government. I thought we were the good guys. We wear white hats, right?\" he said.</p> <p>For Binney, Bluffdale is a symbol that the national security policy conducted by Obama has been little different than that of Bush.</p> <p>Obama has renewed the Patriot Act, tried to broaden the powers of detention of American citizens for national security reasons, and deployed the anti-spy Espionage Act more times than all other presidents combined.</p> <p>\"They are still continuing the same programmes \u2013 actually, Obama is doing more in some areas,\" Binney said. Nor is Binney optimistic of rolling back the surveillance.</p> <p>Last week the House of Representatives voted for a five-year extension to the controversial 2008 FISA amendments.</p> <p>Yet Binney believes there has been too much of a sacrifice of civil liberties in order to fight terrorism. \"People should feel the ability to go out there and and do anything that they want to without being looked at all the time. Monitored. Watched,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The terrorists win, OK? We've lost because we have destroyed our society just to combat them and there was really no reason to do that.\"</p> <p>Binney is also determined to keep on speaking out. \"I don't see any other recourse. Everybody needs to wake up to what we are doing here and whether we want it or not. There is a big hole at the end of this tunnel and it drops off to nowhere.\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The game was seen as an England trial for the outside-halves Owen Farrell and Toby Flood, two of the three occupants of the national 10 jersey this year. But they were upstaged by the third, Charlie Hodgson, retired from Test rugby but averaging more than 17 points an outing for Saracens this season, who came off the bench to chisel a draw for his side on a day when two of the contenders for the title made dents on each other but no impression.</p> <p>Farrell, who was making his first start of the season, could have had 15 points in the first-half, but only one of his five penalty attempts was successful and he was replaced on 50 minutes by Hodgson who within eight minutes of his arrival had landed two penalties to draw Saracens level but wasted a late chance to win the game. Two of Farrell's misses were from close to in front of the posts but the player who rarely missed a kick in last season's Six Nations summed up a typically hard-fought encounter with his inaccuracy.</p> <p>Flood's three penalties from three gave Leicester a 9-3 interval lead, but he too was handicapped by a wonky area. Two of his penalty kicks to touch failed to make the line and an attempted touch-finder rolled over the dead-ball line to give Saracens a scrum. He had no more fortune trying to orchestrate attacks against the most obdurate of defences, tackled early and hard by Farrell and was unable to use support runners to confound tacklers.</p> <p>There was little to the way of flow, not least because unforced errors abounded and the subsequent scrums tended to result in a free-kick or penalty. The Leicester prop Dan Cole rose from one collapse, in which his front-row colleague Logovi'i Mulipola was blown for using the ground as support, pointing to his head and gesturing to the Saracens flanker Jackson Wray.</p> <p>It could have been a signal to everyone on the field because few were using their heads. There were flashes, Mouritz Botha and Schalk Brits off-loading smartly to give Chris Ashton an early run, Scott Hamilton and Vereniki Goneva combining cleverly for Leicester on 15 minutes, but on the few occasions a player found himself in space it was quickly filled by a defender.</p> <p>Saracens looked the more likely to break through with Alex Goode the most deceptive runner on the field, but they were careless in possession. One Goode counter-attack had Leicester scrambling but Botha dropped the ball after being tackled by Dan Cole and Sam Harrison and perhaps the most disappointing feature of the afternoon was the failure of both sides to capitalise on abundant turnover possession, switched on as they were far more in defence than attack.</p> <p>Leicester's initial supremacy was based on a dominance up front. Flood kicked two penalties in the opening five minutes, the first after Joel Tomkins had held on after tackling Manu Tuilagi and the second after Brits had popped up from a scrum. The Tigers kept infringing on the ground, Julian Salvi, Mulipola, Tom Youngs and Cole all gave Farrell opportunities to go for goal and Leicester were made to pay for their indiscipline by Hodgson. With so many penalties and stoppages, play tended to take place in between the 22s and there were few clear attacking opportunities: it may have been a balmy afternoon but handling errors would not have been more numerous had it been pelting with rain.</p> <p>Ashton had scored three tries in his first two appearances for Saracens but he found himself on short rations. He wasted a counter early in the second period by dropping the ball, but his mazy run in the Leicester 22 10 minutes later was a rare moment when a tryline was threatened.</p> <p>Leicester could not get as close, Tuilagi and Thomas Waldrom making half-breaks but losing control of the ball. Flood had the chance to regain the lead for the Tigers 13 minutes from the end after Kelly Brown had piled over the top of a ruck, but he pulled it to the left.</p> <p>A dreary draw appeared likely but Saracens made a late push for victory. Salvi's driving tackle on John Smit ended a series of attacks from a short-ranged line-out and Hodgson manoeuvred himself into position to drop the winning goal, just to the left of the posts. Richard Wigglesworth's pass was perfect and the stage was made for the veteran: Tuilagi, Anthony Allen and Harrison did enough to put him off and the kick, from 20 metres, drifted wide, as did Flood's effort from longer range in the last play of the afternoon, a fitting end to a match that neither side did anywhere near enough to win.</p>",

  "<p>Wasps presented their new owners with a first win of the season, their new boy, Stephen Jones, gift-wrapping the offering with a perfect kicking display and 23 points.</p> <p>Twenty-four hours after hearing that the consortium led by a former player, Ken Moss, had formally taken control, Jones had recovered from a fortnight of back spasms to give his new team the kind of control that might have brought success had he been around for those close games against Harlequins and then Bath.</p> <p>Wasps had not won in the Premiership since April, about the time Moss and his consortium stepped in. Eventually they hope to find Wasps a home of their own, but the feeling is that they could be still be at Adams Park in two years and have to turn around a loss running at \u00a32m a year.</p> <p>However, after going close in their two games away from High Wycombe, the Berkshire sunshine and a manicured surface clearly suited their ambitions on Saturday. Their director of rugby, Dai Young, thought a bonus point flattered them and certainly the rush of tries in the second half gave the scoreboard a slightly lopsided feel, one that London Irish are getting used to. In three weeks they have conceded 123 points and their coach, Brian Smith, admitted that heads went down. \"Even-stevens at half-time but falling apart at the end is very disappointing.\"</p> <p>Actually they were two points up at half-time before Jones landed his fourth penalty and then instigated the move that saw the wing Tom Varndell barge his way over in the corner for the first of his two tries.</p> <p>Jones found Christian Wade, the wing making plenty of ground through the middle to link with his captain, Hugo Southwell. In a game so plagued by fumbles the full-back was allowed a quick juggle before making the scoring pass.</p> <p>Ten minutes later the game was beyond London Irish. This time it was the forwards who set the platform, driving a maul before Joe Simpson peeled off the back. Two phases later and the former England scrum-half was over and Wasps were in the driving seat.</p> <p>All that remained was for Jones to land his fifth penalty, replacement prop Zak Taulafo to rumble over and Varndell to end a sweeping 70-yard break for the bonus-point try. Needless to say Jones landed both conversions.</p> <p>Jones, a 34-year-old in the middle of one of the youngest and more promising Premiership backlines, had opened his account early following a couple of eye-catching interventions by another new boy, Ashley Johnson. However, Irish were back on terms 10 minutes later through Steven Shingler, the fly-half ruled Welsh by the IRB even though he wants to play for Scotland, and went ahead through the wing Marland Yarde.</p> <p>First the flanker Ofisa Treviranus, on loan from Munster, knocked on over the Wasps line before the midfield of Sailosi Tagicakibau, still learning his trade at inside centre, and the England international Jonathan Joseph did the preliminary work for the England Under-20 wing.</p> <p>Mind you, Yarde was left plenty to do when he headed for the minefield of midfield before having a rethink, swerving left and dotting the ball down near the corner. From 20 yards out, he had probably jinked and side-stepped for twice that distance before reaching safety.</p>",
  "<p>The front cover of <em>The Oatcake</em> fanzine carried the headline: \"Michael Owen finally signs for a big club\". So big, it turned out, the former Ballon D'Or winner, once of Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United and now trying to resurrect his career at Stoke City, was restricted to a 90th-minute substitute appearance. He was unable to influence the match \u2013 he did not manage a single touch \u2013 but he must have been impressed by what he saw of Stoke's refusal to be broken by a superior team.</p> <p>This was the fifth time Roberto Mancini has managed a team here and, after four successive 1-1 draws and a defeat in the FA Cup, he is still waiting for his first victory.</p> <p>His side had the better of the play, denied a winner by Ryan Shawcross's goal-line clearance with the last kick of the match, but they were below their best and only sporadically threatened after Javi Garc\u00eda had marked his debut by heading in Carlos Tevez's free-kick for the equaliser.</p> <p>They were, however, entitled to be aggrieved to be behind in the first place. Peter Crouch was guilty of a clear infringement in the build-up to the opening goal, using his left hand twice in quick succession before slotting a shot past Joe Hart.</p> <p>\"If we want to talk about the first goal, we should talk about NBA,\" Mancini said. \"It's basketball, not football.\" He was smiling but there was a clear flicker of annoyance after a game in which Stoke did not create another clear chance.</p> <p>The champions had most of the ball, culminating in a frantic spell of pressure in stoppage time, but there were spells, too, when they looked unusually disjointed, perhaps thinking a little too much about Tuesday's game against Real Madrid.</p> <p>Mancini took off Tevez, his most dangerous player, just after an hour and gave David Silva, a substitute, 16 minutes on a day when Scott Sinclair had a quiet debut and, for the most part, the team generally controlled the play but lacked creative ideas.</p> <p>Mancini said Sergio Ag\u00fcero, who was not even on the bench, could still play at the Bernab\u00e9u despite the Argentinian's knee injury keeping him out since the seventh minute of the first match of the season. What is certain is that City will need to be more switched-on against the La Liga champions.</p> <p>Stoke presented a very different form of opposition to Cristiano Ronaldo<em> et al</em> but it would be demeaning to describe their tactics as exclusively long-ball. Charlie Adam displayed some neat touches on his debut, even though he was guilty of losing Garc\u00eda in the penalty area for the equalising goal.</p> <p>Steven Nzonzi, another new player, had an impressive debut. Shawcross's final, desperate clearance epitomised his efforts to keep check of Tevez and Mario Balotelli when they were linking up well. Less edifying was Andy Wilkinson's elbow on Balotelli that risks an FA sanction.</p> <p>The home side will be disappointed they could not do more to make Maicon's first game in the Premier League an uncomfortable experience but Owen, watching from the bench, will know a little more now about the spirit of togetherness at his new club and Jonathan Walters, the man whose place is now under threat, worked hard to show that he wants to stay in the team.</p> <p>\"Looking at the major incidents, we had the run of the ball but I think we deserved it,\" Tony Pulis, the Stoke manager, said. \"We worked so hard. We were playing against one of the top teams in Europe \u2013 just look at the players they left out, the ones not even on the bench, it is a phenomenal squad they have got \u2013 and to cope with a team like that you have to play as one. And that's what we did.\"</p> <p>Pulis was less impressed by the nature of Garc\u00eda's goal, describing it as \"very, very poor marking and very unlike us''. Owen, he explained, was still not properly fit after his long summer without a club.</p> <p>As for Crouch's handball, Stoke have been the victim of too many poor refereeing decisions in the past for them to feel too guilty. \"I'll take that on the chin. It's lovely for us, a smaller club, getting a decision against a bigger club,\" Pulis said unapologetically.</p> <p>His team had to dig in deep during those final, frantic moments when Garc\u00eda and the substitute Edin Dzeko almost won the match. Garc\u00eda, the \u00a316m signing from Benfica, had his chance from Silva's corner only for Asmir Begovic to turn the ball against the right-hand post then gratefully gathering the rebound.</p> <p>A minute later, however, Stoke's goalkeeper was dangerously close to ruining an otherwise impressive performance, charging to the edge of his penalty area for a ball he was never going to reach. Dzeko got there first and his looping shot was heading into an exposed net before Shawcross, scrambling back, hooked the ball to safety, with inches to spare.</p> <p>\"Here it is always difficult, not only for us but all the teams,\" Mancini said. \"We had two incredible chances at the end and we were unlucky. It is a difficult pitch for us.\"</p>",

  "<p>Major US banks are being investigated for insufficiently safeguarding against being used by drug dealers or terrorist groups to launder dirty money, it was reported Saturday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/business/money-laundering-inquiry-said-to-target-us-banks.html?_r=0\">An article in the New York Times</a> suggested that federal and state authorities were ready to launch an aggressive crackdown on the failure to monitor transactions, in a move aimed at flagging to financial institutions that weak compliance is unacceptable.</p> <p>Officials told the Times that regulators are close to taking action against JP Morgan, while other firms including Bank of America are also being investigated over perceived shortcomings when it comes to putting a check on money-laundering activities.</p> <p>It comes just months after a Senate committee roundly criticised HSBC for ignoring warning signs that it was being used by money launderers and drug cartels in Mexico.</p> <p>US politicians also accused HSBC of circumventing US sanctions on countries including Cuba and Iran \u2013 a charge that has also been levied against JP Morgan.</p> <p>The Senate report was also highly critical of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), stating that the regulator needed to take \"stronger action\" on banks that exercise poor anti-money laundering controls.</p> <p>The OCC is now leading the crackdown on non-compliant banks, according to the New York Times report.</p> <p>It suggested that a \"cease-or-desist\" order could be issued against JP Morgan in the coming months, forcing the bank to review its checks, and implement measures to firm up its safeguards.</p> <p>Prosecutors from the justice department and the Manhattan district attorney's office are also investigating lapses at a number of financial institutions, it was reported.</p> <p>If action is taken against JP Morgan it will comes as a further blow to a bank still reeling from a $5.8bn trading loss that led to a political firestorm in the US and led to a tighter regulation of Wall Street.</p>",
  "<p>The patient sits on a hospital gurney. The doctor asks how she feels, takes her blood pressure and gives her a capsule to swallow. She is then led to a brain scanner that resembles a giant washing machine, and she lies in front of it before it sucks her in. Doctors study a series of vivid images of her head and brain, looking for activity before she is allowed to leave the scanner. The patient is asked who she would like to have with her at this moment. She replies: \"My husband.\"</p> <p>When asked how she feels, she replies: \"Light. It's pleasant. There's an airiness and openness to the senses. A slight heightening of sensory perception, which I liked. The visual feeling is vivid. The colours are lush, which I enjoy. I might be a bit more alert to sounds. I feel physically relaxed and that is a pleasure.\"</p> <p>The patient is the writer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/lionel-shriver\" title=\"\">Lionel Shriver</a>, and she has just taken the drug MDMA as part of an experiment that will be shown on Channel 4 at the end of this month. She is one of six volunteers who also include the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/keith-allen\" title=\"\">Keith Allen</a> and a former MP who will be shown taking the drug and undergoing a series of tests, some of which will be done in the scanner in order to see the change in brain activity caused by MDMA.</p> <p>The experiment has been designed by Val Curran, professor of psychology at University College London, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/david-nutt\" title=\"\">David Nutt</a>, professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London. It will feature 26 volunteers, only a small number of whom will appear on television.</p> <p>The broadcasting of controversial research will seem to many like a publicity stunt, an easy way to court controversy and increase viewing figures. But there is a real concern among many scientists that the government's classification of the drug as Class A overstates the danger it poses to society and inhibits important research that could help people suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office disagrees: \"Televising the use of illegal drugs risks trivialising a serious issue. Our licensing regime allows legitimate research to take place in a secure environment so that harmful drugs can't get into the hands of criminals. There is no evidence to suggest that the current listing of MDMA as a Schedule 1 substance is a barrier to attracting funding for legitimate purposes.\"</p> <p>Nutt insists that without funding from Channel 4 the study wouldn't have been possible: \"We have failed to get money for research from conventional sources, which is why the Channel 4 intervention is fantastic. Nearly half a million people are believed to take ecstasy or MDMA every year in the UK, but there has been very little research into what it does in the brain. These experiments will give us a much clearer picture of the fundamental effects of MDMA on the resting brain than anyone has been able to get before.\"</p> <p>Yet to some, the prominence of the experiments on primetime television might be seen as an endorsement of drug-taking. Professor of psychology Andy Parrott of Swansea University, who has researched MDMA for 15 years, says: \"Once people start writing that MDMA is being used for therapy, kids will look at that and think it's a safe drug.\"</p> <p>MDMA, or methylenedioxy- methylamphetamine, was first patented in 1912 by German scientists looking for a substance to control bleeding. The US military experimented with it in the 1950s and this may have led to instances of it being used recreationally in the US in the 1970s. In 1976, an American chemist, Alexander Shulgin, who became known as the godfather of ecstasy, took MDMA himself as part of a personal investigation of psychoactive substances. Shulgin was an industrial chemist who had personal experience of psychedelics and worked closely with America's Drug Enforcement Agency. He described the feelings MDMA induced as \"an easily controlled altered state of consciousness with emotional and sensual overtones\". In his journal he wrote: \"I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvellous feeling of solid inner strength continued\u2026 through the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the&#xa0;experience.\"</p> <p>Shulgin promoted MDMA among psychologists, who began to use it as an aid to psychotherapy. But its use in therapy was about to become overshadowed by its popularity as a recreational drug. MDMA became popular in nightclubs in Dallas in the early 80s and then spread through the rest of the world. By 1987, rebranded by clubland as ecstasy and often mixed with small amounts of other drugs such as ketamine, heroin and acid, and fillers and binding agents such as corn starch and cellulose, it had become a major part of British youth culture.</p> <p>Drugs like MDMA (but not MDMA explicitly) were made illegal in 1977 in the UK and in the US in 1985, but this did little to prevent its immense popularity as a recreational drug.</p> <p>The case of Donna Kilgore was the first <a href=\"www.maps.org/news-letters/v18n3/v18n3-20to22.pdf\" title=\"\">widely publicised success of MDMA</a> in treating a psychiatric condition. In 1993, she was raped by a stranger who burst into her home in Alaska. Her cries alerted the police who caught the rapist. After the attack, Kilgore tried to get on with her life, which was made easier by the fact that she could not remember much of her experience. After four years, she began having flashbacks, panic attacks, fits of anger, migraines and faints. She consulted a series of psychiatrists who prescribed a series of drugs. Some of the drugs dulled the pain, others exacerbated it. Finally, in 2002, a new psychiatrist linked her condition to her rape for the first time, diagnosed her with PTSD, and sent her to Dr Michael Mithoefer in South Carolina. Mithoefer was one of many therapists who were convinced that MDMA could play a major role in curing patients of a range of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. He was licensed to carry out experiments with MDMA and Kilgore was his first patient.</p> <p>The result was dramatic. \"What MDMA did was clear the fog so I could see. Down there was guilt, anger, shame, fear. And it wasn't so bad. I thought, 'I can do this,'\" she said in an interview. \"'This fear is not going to kill me.' I remembered the rape from start to finish \u2013 those memories I had repressed so deeply.\" Clearly, this is just one patient's experience: many more, larger studies would be needed before MDMA is adopted as a treatment.</p> <p>The dangers of MDMA, or at least ecstasy, had already been highlighted in the UK by the death of Leah Betts who died at the age of 18 in 1995 after taking an ecstasy tablet which contributed to her death. The tragedy of Leah Betts and other similar deaths has tended to be the driver of government policy rather than the experience of Donna Kilgore. The government has rejected expert advice on two occasions to change the classification of the drug from Class A, which also includes heroin and cocaine, to Class B, which includes cannabis.</p> <p>The division between some scientists and government was demonstrated in 2009 when David Nutt was chairman of the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. He pointed out that horse riding was more dangerous than taking ecstasy, pointing to statistics that showed that horse riding had an adverse event once in every 350 outings while social ecstasy use led to an adverse event once in every 10,000 experiences. The then home secretary, Jacqui Smith reacted angrily to Nutt's remarks and insisted he apologise to the families of people who had died after taking ecstasy. Later the same year, Nutt was dismissed after he issued a paper that classified drugs according to the harm they caused, placing alcohol and tobaccos as more harmful than drugs such as ecstasy and cannabis.</p> <p>In Nutt's study, volunteers' pre-drug experience, unlike that of clubbing ecstasy users, is deliberately sterile. For the documentary they undergo two days of tests, one with MDMA and one with a placebo (clearly what might make good television doesn't make the most rigorous of trials). Both days are identical. They arrive at Hammersmith hospital where they change into medical scrubs and begin a series of tests. First their breath and urine are analysed to ensure they have not been taking alcohol or drugs. Some of the volunteers failed and were told they could not participate in the experiment.</p> <p>The volunteers have more medical tests and fill out questionnaires before a nurse arrives with a brown envelope containing a capsule. The patients and researchers do not know if it is MDMA or a placebo.</p> <p>According to the researchers, some of the volunteers have behaved as if they had taken MDMA even when they have taken the placebo, describing a sense of euphoria and even showing similar brain activity during the scan to people who have taken MDMA.</p> <p>The volunteer waits for about an hour before the first of series of scans and tests. The tests are commonly used by psychologists, but the volunteers undertake them in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. This allows the researchers to track the movement of oxygen-rich blood to parts of the brain.</p> <p>The volunteers were also asked to write down six positive and six negative memories before they began the trial. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, who oversaw the experiments, explains: \"They are presented with these memories in the scanner. The instructions are very short: remember the crash, remember the beach. They closed their eyes and we instructed them to go back there and to try and relive it as much as&#xa0;possible.</p> <p>\"The reason we are doing that is that MDMA has been looked at in terms of psychotherapy and in particular in terms of PTSD. People have horrible memories, and in psychotherapy the idea is that they should be able to talk about them. In PTSD, when faced with that prospect, it can be so overwhelming that they can't do it. So the rationale for using MDMA is that it allows people to open up. We are using the bad memories from healthy people who don't have trauma associated with PTSD to see the effect on brain activity.</p> <p>\"The prediction that it would make positive memories more positive and negative memories less negative is true. To shift the recollection of memories in a positive direction is what we wanted. People become very emotionally tender under MDMA, and that is the kind of space which would be ideal in psychotherapy. This would allow people to revisit a traumatic memory and overwrite it or control it.\"</p> <p>While psychologists have worked on this theory previously, this is the first time it has been examined using fMRI. The researchers are still analysing their findings. The broadcast experiments are part of a larger six-month study that will be described in detail in a peer-reviewed article next year. Nutt isn't alone in this line of study: in the US the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies is conducting a phase 2 pilot study using MDMA-assisted pychotherapy to treat war veterans suffering from PTSD.</p> <p>Another area where MDMA could be useful is in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Scientists believe it could be successful at targeting the part of the brain that causes rumination and repetitive thinking about negative experiences. MDMA or a similar drug could act as a switch that would shut off depressive or anxious thoughts. \"We all have low moods, we all have bad things happen to us, but we don't dwell on them, we are able to switch them off. When it gets to a disorder like depression or PTSD, you can't switch them off because this network is over-engaged,\" says Nutt.</p> <p>\"We think that switching these things off even transiently, reducing that process might be therapeutic, but also it might be a way of helping individuals to see there is another way. Depressive people generally believe they are worthless. If they could be allowed to believe for a few hours that they are not, this could give them a sense that there is another world.\"</p> <p>The researchers are also examining the low that many ecstasy takers say they experience after taking the drug. They want to see if taking MDMA in a clinical setting as opposed to a nightclub, combined with other drugs, dancing, dehydration and not sleeping, produces a significant low.</p> <p>\"When you take MDMA,\" says Val Curran, \"you get a massive release in the brain of serotonin, and there's a huge dip shortly after you take the drug. It takes your brain time to build up those of levels of serotonin. In a rat it takes three weeks, but in a human it's probably more like three days. We want to know if there is a function impairment because that has never been tested.\"</p> <p>To explore this all volunteers are being examined three days after they take the placebo or MDMA to see if they are experiencing a low and taking tests to see if they have any symptoms.</p> <p>Andy Parrott says that any stimulant that works on the central nervous system may have unpredictable results. \"MDMA releases material in the brain; the effect depends on what else is going on in the brain. MDMA is very like LSD. If you have it in a good frame of mind, you have a good trip; in a bad one, you have a bad trip. So with MDMA if you have a patient with a lot of bad material in their brain that might well be heightened.\"</p> <p>Parrott also highlighted a specific problem that arises if a patient is given a therapeutic drug for a limited period. \"Suppose the therapy ends, the patients feels low, wants another drug, therapist says no. Patient just goes out on the street to get one. It's only 50p a tablet in Liverpool and it's almost pure. You will always get a certain amount of people that will self-medicate.\"</p> <p>Nutt does not think that there are any dangers in the setting of the experiments or the dose (85mg of MDMA), and fMRI findings would be added to other existing studies. \"One of our reasons for doing this is to get an underpinning in neuroscience to strengthen the rationale for doing more studies, more trials on patients, and we are trying to gear up to do that in the next year. Once you can show what the brain responses are, you have some sense that what you are doing is meaningful in terms of the illness and also that the drug is safe and well&#xa0;tolerated.</p> <p>\"We are getting meaningful changes in some of these tasks. The changes in the brain are in the regions we predicted, so that does suggest that the underpinning theories are right. This gives us the confidence to go out there and look for money to make up for the missed opportunities of the last 30&#xa0;years.\"</p> <p>Lionel Shriver at least appears to have tolerated it well. Four hours after taking her capsule, she leaves the hospital, looking slightly dishevelled and with a thin veneer of perspiration on her forehead. She says: \"I can tell there is a little buzz going on. Long may it last.\"</p> <p><em>Drugs Live: The Ecstasy Trial is on Channel 4 on 26 and 27 September at&#xa0;10pm</em></p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 15 September 2012 to remove a spelling error in the headline</p>",
  "<p>In Vakilabad prison, northern Iran, there is a long beam that can take up to 60 nooses. The condemned are made to stand on stools which are then kicked away. Vakilabad's record is 89 executions in one day.</p> <p>The true number of those executed in Iran is impossible to quantify, especially for those convicted of drug offences, but it is clear there is a large disjunction between official figures and the reality. In 2010 the Iranian authorities acknowledged that 172 people had been executed for drugs offences. However, the Foreign Office is aware of credible reports suggesting the real figure could be at least 590.</p> <p>In the 12 months to November last year, there were at least 600 executions, according to Amnesty International, 81% of which were for drugs offences.</p> <p>And, among increasingly vocal human rights groups, the concern now is that the UK has unwittingly helped fuel the killing machine.</p> <p>There is no shortage of those awaiting execution. It is estimated that as many as 4,000 Afghans alone are on death row in Iran for drugs offences. There are reports that some are executed without a trial and that others are juveniles. Human rights groups claim that many of those executed come from the most disadvantaged sectors of society. Some are women. Many of those arrested have been duped into carrying drugs for others.</p> <p>One man who was executed is believed to have been Haj Basir Ahmed, a 40-year-old Afghan, hanged at Taybad prison on 15 September 2011. He phoned his family at eight in the evening to say he had learned he was to be executed the following hour. His family have heard nothing since and his body has not been returned because Iran demands \u00a310,000 for the repatriation of the executed. His is a typical case, according to human rights groups.</p> <p>Such draconian treatment of pawns in the drugs trade would find little or no support in the UK, which abolished capital punishment in 1969. The foreign secretary, William Hague, has called the human rights situation in Iran \"shameful\". But it has emerged that the UK has provided indirect assistance to an Iranian judicial system engaged in what Amnesty describes as a \"killing spree of staggering proportions\".</p> <p>Why the death toll is rising in Iran is open to conjecture. Some believe that the Iranian authorities are nervous about the Arab spring and are using drugs laws as an excuse to eliminate their opponents. But there is also a greater resolve in Iran to tackle the drugs trade which, the country's authorities claim, has led to 1.2 million addicts. According to Iran's annual Drug Control Report, in 2011 there was a \"41% increase in arresting narcotics traffickers and distributors\". The report says that some 8,000 foreign nationals were arrested for drugs offences in 2010 and 2011.</p> <p>Bordering Afghanistan, a country responsible for 93% of the world's opium production, Iran faces a formidable challenge in combating trafficking. Those efforts have been given a considerable boost by the introduction of 200 sniffer dogs at airports and ports. Seizures attributed to the dogs jumped from 23,912kg in 2010 to 42,500kg in 2011.</p> <p>According to documents obtained by the <em>Observer</em>, the UK was one of five donor countries that, via the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), gave almost $3.4m (\u00a32m) to train the dogs. The four-and-a-half year project, which started in 2007, also provided specialised vehicles, satellite phones, drug testing kits and body scanners. It was not the UK's only contribution to Iran's counter-trafficking operations. In 2009 the Foreign Office confirmed that it had spent more than \u00a33m between 2000 and 2009 providing counter-narcotics assistance in Iran.</p> <p>Another UNODC document reveals that in August 2010 the UK and France pledged almost $730,000 to fund a two-year, intelligence-led, anti-trafficking programme targeting Iran's borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan that \"resulted in seizures of six tons of different types of drugs and arrests of drug traffickers\".</p> <p>It is understood that much of the pledged money for the programme was distributed to another project outside Iran. However, UNODC documents reveal it provided the model for its \"Iran Country Programme for 2011-2014\", suggesting it has left an impact.</p> <p>Tackling trafficking through Iran \u2013 particularly heroin \u2013 is seen as crucial by western governments. UNODC estimates that 140 tonnes (37%) of the 380 tonnes of heroin produced in Afghanistan is trafficked annually through Iran and on to the European market. But human rights groups are concerned that the UK has supported a programme that has resulted in excessive punishments for often minor players in the drugs trade.</p> <p>Even trafficking small amounts can prove fatal. In 2010 Iran introduced a new law prescribing corporal punishment for most drug crimes and the death penalty for anyone who \"imports, produces, distributes, exports, deals in, puts on sale, keeps or stores, conceals and carries\" more than 30 grams of a number of listed drugs, including psychotropic substances. \"We're talking about hundreds of people being killed by Iran every year because they carried some drugs across a border,\" said Damon Barrett, deputy director of the charity <a href=\"http://www.ihra.net/\" title=\"\">Harm Reduction International</a>. \"These are mostly people living in poverty with no other options. Meanwhile, western donors, including the UK, as well as the United Nations, provide money and assistance to the Iranian authorities for drug enforcement.\"</p> <p>Iran is not the only country that uses the death penalty to have received UK aid. The UK was one of six countries that, via the UNODC, gave $6m to Pakistan last year and a further $11m in 2010 to support anti-drug trafficking programmes. The UNODC also has a counter-trafficking memorandum of understanding with six east Asian countries, of which five retain the death penalty for drug offences. At least $26m has gone to these countries' counter-narcotics programmes via the UNODC, almost a quarter of which came from the UK.</p> <p>Now, however, politicians are questioning the wisdom of a policy that appears contrary to the UK's own guidance to officials, who are warned that prior to providing assistance they must obtain assurances confirming that \"anyone found guilty would not face the death penalty\".</p> <p>As Hague writes in a foreword to the guidance, it is \"in police stations, detention centres and court houses that the state exerts its greatest powers over individuals and so where fairness, human dignity, liberty and justice are most critical.\" The European parliament has passed a motion expressing concern that money and assistance from member states \"could lead towards increased death sentences and executions\". An early day motion signed by MPs has raised similar fears.</p> <p>In May the UNODC published a paper that acknowledged it placed itself \"in a very vulnerable position vis-\u00e0-vis its responsibility to respect human rights\" if it funded countries that actively supported the death penalty for drug trafficking. The UN's human rights council has warned that \"co-operative assistance \u2026 could facilitate the apprehension of alleged drug offenders, who may be subject to the death penalty in violation of international human rights law\".</p> <p>A government spokesman declined to give details about which countries' counter-narcotics programmes it had funded. \"We provide aid to a range of international partners to tackle the international drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses to the UK,\" the spokesman said. \"We take human rights very seriously and provide clear guidance to our officials. It is our policy not to disclose details about specific programmes or locations as to do so may reduce the effectiveness of this work.\"</p> <p>But human rights groups said that there was an urgent case for greater transparency. \"We know that human rights abuses are rife in the war on drugs,\" Barrett said. \"At a time when every penny is being shaved off budgets, we deserve to know how much money the UK is providing for drug enforcement overseas, and what that money has achieved, beyond risking the UK's complicity in abuse.\"</p>",
  "<p>An Oxford-educated British businesswoman has set out to challenge the \"creeping ubiquity\" of hardcore pornography by launching an elevated style of adult video which she believes is the sex education aid of the future.</p> <p>Cindy Gallop, 52, claims that too many people \u2013 young men in particular \u2013 are learning their bedroom techniques chiefly from viewing hardcore porn on the internet, which makes them inconsiderate lovers. She aims to \"reform porn\" and \"rehabilitate\" the younger generation with an alternative campaign for tasteful erotica.</p> <p>\"When you have sex with younger men you see the creeping ubiquity of hardcore porn in the culture, in an era where it is more freely and widely available than ever before and kids are accessing it younger and younger,\" said Gallop.</p> <p>Her new website, <a href=\"MakeLoveNotPorn.tv\" title=\"\">MakeLoveNotPorn.tv</a>, seeks to offer an alternative to hardcore porn because, she believes, parents and sex education teachers still give too little guidance about how to develop healthy sexual relationships. Enthusiastically single and unashamed to date men less than half her age, Gallop wears figure-hugging black ensembles, attends glamorous parties and is not shy in correcting her aggressive young lovers. \"I date younger men, often in their early twenties, and I was finding that hardcore porn had become their de facto sex education.\"</p> <p>Now she's taking her coaching to the next level, aiming to re-educate people via the internet, \"so that young men don't think that's always the normal way of behaving in the bedroom and their girlfriends don't have to pretend to like it\".</p> <p>Her website features couples and individuals engaging in real-life sexual activities with the kind of genuine passion and intimacy missing from most porn. \"I wanted to separate the myths of hardcore porn behaviour from the reality of healthy but hot sexual relationships,\" she said.</p> <p>Born to an English father and Chinese mother in London, Gallop studied English literature at Somerville College, Oxford, then went into advertising. In 1998 she moved to New York, where she still lives, to launch the US office of the British advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty. After 27 years in the business she became a consultant and is currently working with beauty brand L'Or\u00e9al.</p> <p>MakeLoveNotPorn.tv is still in its development phase and is invitation-only while she works on selecting the best content and smoothing technical glitches. \"About 18,000 have signed up so far and we are inviting people in in batches of 500 to 1,000 while we're perfecting the site,\" she said.</p> <p>Requests to join are coming in from around the world, and the site is expected to go fully live before the end of the year. Invited members pay $5 per video chosen from the menu, and contributors who star in their own erotic show submit videos for inclusion on the site.</p> <p>Gallop says that she maintains high standards and that has had no shortage of quality contributors. One popular video shows a couple who work in the pornography business, but for the website they share how they make love together outside their work. Their encounter is a graphic and uninhibited coupling, but intimate and communicative, with the odd giggle, and each partner enjoying equal pleasure and control.</p> <p>Feminist writer and fellow New York \"educational porn\" maker Tristan Taormino, who pays professional porn actors to star in her videos for the porn company Vivid, said: \"What Cindy is doing is fantastic. The more the merrier. Both men and women access my porn and it's also important for men to know that they don't have to be like the guys in the hardcore stuff \u2013 always ready, always knowing exactly what they're doing, that can be oppressive for them, too.\"</p> <p>Gallop came up with the concept of MakeLoveNotPorn in 2009, delivered a lecture on the subject for TED, the organisation devoted to spreading ideas, and launched a prototype. But it took her two more years before an investor provided the $500,000 needed to go ahead fully because, despite the promise of lucrative returns, venture capitalists \"wouldn't touch it with a bargepole\", Gallop said.</p> <p>She almost gave up, but the floods of public emails thanking her for breaking taboos inspired her to carry on, she said.</p> <p>MakeLoveNotPorn.tv is legal and for over-18s only but Gallop eventually wants to create gift vouchers that can be bought for younger teenagers.</p> <p>\"They are accessing hardcore porn online anyway, whether we like it or not, and what they see on my website is a much more healthy form of sex education,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The chief constable of West Yorkshire police will be investigated by the police watchdog following disclosures about the conduct of officers, it emerged on Saturday.</p> <p>The independent panel report into the Hillsborough tragedy suggested Sir Norman Bettison may have been part of a \"black propaganda\" operation to smear football fans to cover up for failings of South Yorkshire police where he was an inspector in 1989.</p> <p>A meeting of West Yorkshire Police Authority's special committee on Saturday agreed to record a complaint against the chief constable and immediately referred it to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation.</p> <p>Special committee chairman Richard Baldwin said: \"A number of factors led to the committee taking the decision to refer the complaint to the IPCC, including the gravity of the subject matter, the wholly exceptional circumstances, and a pressing need to maintain public confidence in both policing governance and the police complaints system. It is important that the facts are fully established and evidence considered from other sources before any further decisions are taken.</p> <p>\"The IPCC, as an independent body with a statutory duty to uphold the police complaints system, is best placed to conduct such investigations.\"</p> <p>On Friday, Sir Norman issued his second statement in 48 hours on the affair after again criticising Liverpool football fans. The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said his words flew in the face of the damning conclusions of the Hillsborough independent panel.</p> <p>Within hours of the Liberal Democrat leader's intervention, Bettison issued a statement apologising if the families of the 96 who died had been upset by his remark that \"fans' behaviour \u2026 made the job of the police in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles harder than it needed to be\".</p> <p>The words were included in a statement \u2013 issued after the report was published this week \u2013 in which he made clear he was staying in his post despite the independent report revealing further details about his key role in a South Yorkshire police internal review team condemned as a \"black propaganda\" unit.</p> <p>The storm grew as his employers, the West Yorkshire police authority, began an investigation into matters that the report raised about his role. Asked about Bettison's position, Clegg said: \"His words were ill-judged. That is obvious. After a report like that, to suggest the fans were an impediment to the police operation when the report revealed the truth that the burden of responsibility lay with the police and other emergency agencies was insensitive and ill-judged.</p> <p>\"He will need to react pretty clearly to clarify what he meant. It flies in the face of the basic thrust of the report.\"</p> <p>Within hours, Bettison apologised. \"Let me speak very clearly,\" he said. \"The fans of Liverpool football club were in no way to blame for the disaster.</p> <p>\"I formed this clear view on hearing all the evidence that was presented at the Taylor inquiry.</p> <p>\"The evidence was overwhelming. The police failed to control the situation, which ultimately led to the tragic deaths of 96 entirely innocent people. I can be no plainer than that and I am sorry if my earlier statement, intended to convey the same message, has caused any further upset.</p> <p>\"My role was never to besmirch the fans. I did not do that. I am deeply sorry that impression and slight has lingered for 23 years.\"</p> <p>The Hillsborough independent panel, which had unprecedented access to 450,000 documents, uncovered the true scale of the South Yorkshire police cover-up, which began in the hours after the fans were crushed to death at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.</p> <p>Fresh evidence in the panel report showed 164 police statements were doctored, victims were tested for blood alcohol levels and checks were carried out on the police national computer to access criminal records in order \"to impugn the reputation of the deceased\".</p> <p>Criminal charges may now be laid against serving and former officers after South Yorkshire police set in motion a referral to the IPCC.</p>",
  "<p>Vince Cable likes to proclaim that he acts as a check on his coalition partners' \"nasty\" tendencies when it comes to all of our rights at work, but he is pushing ahead with the majority of the recommendations in the flawed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/beecroft-report\" title=\"\">Beecroft report</a>, produced by No 10 adviser Adrian Beecroft.</p> <p>The business secretary has already been consulting to introduce fire-at-will for micro-businesses and he's bringing forward a number of measures from the controversial report too, through the enterprise and regulatory reform bill currently going through parliament.</p> <p>When Beecroft was summoned to explain himself in parliament, he admitted there was little evidence to support his proposals. That is why parts of his report have been criticised by business groups, including the Federation of Small Businesses, Institute of Chartered Accountants and the manufacturers' organisation, the EEF. But what do these changes mean in a practical sense for all of us in the workplace?</p> <p>While protection against dismissal on grounds of discrimination begins for employees on day one, unfair dismissal exists to protect people at work against all other forms of unfair treatment and against being fired for any reason other than performance, redundancy or conduct. The government started its attack on employee rights by implementing legislation earlier this year which doubled the qualifying period needed to claim unfair dismissal from one to two years.</p> <p>The attack on our rights continues in this bill by giving the business secretary powers to cap compensation awards when someone has been unfairly dismissed to a maximum of a year's pay (regardless of how much they have lost). The Law Society has said \"this cap will prevent a substantial number of claimants who have been unfairly dismissed from recovering their full losses\". He is expected to announce that he plans to use these powers immediately, drastically weakening the deterrent effect of the unfair dismissal regime.</p> <p>Cable has also talked up his new plans for compromise agreements. At the moment, these are a useful tool which allow employees and employers who are in a dispute to reach an agreement. However, he is now trying to sell us a new version, which he calls \"settlement agreements\". What he doesn't tell us is that these are different and dangerous. His vision seems to allow for unscrupulous employers to offer employees a pay off, simply because they don't like them; if this is refused, the employee would simply be expected to go back to work, leaving a cloud over the relationship. What's more, if this resulted in a dispute at an employment tribunal, the employee wouldn't be able to mention that the employer had done this. Frank conversations between employers and employees take place in workplaces across the country every day, but there is potential here of a no-fault dismissal bribe.</p> <p>And in situations where things do go drastically wrong, many employees will not be able to afford the costs of the new tribunal fees. The reality is that Cable is making it easier for employers to push employees out the door with a poorly compensated \"settlement agreement\", while making it more expensive and complicated for staff to get a fair hearing. Even if they are judged to have been unfairly dismissed at a tribunal their compensation would be restricted making it easy for employers to gamble.</p> <p>These proposals have been rushed together to appease Beecroft's champions within the Tory-led government. They ignore that there is no evidence that this will boost growth and jobs. They ignore the impact on the millions working in businesses who will have less security and less confidence in the future. And they ignore the fact that we are not going to compete in the global economy based on insecure and low-paid jobs.</p> <p>We need to reform the economy so that it works for all. We can improve our already flexible labour market. We support compulsory Acas pre-conciliation, for example. And there is much support needed for businesses \u2013 like unlocking finance \u2013 to enable them to start and grow, but that doesn't mean throwing away the rights at work for all. The UK already has the third most deregulated labour market in the world according to the OECD, but is just one of two G20 countries in recession. The blame for this lies squarely with this government's failed economic policy \u2013 we are in a recession made in Downing Street, but this has been caused by ministers' failed policies, not protections at work.</p> <p>Cable was right when he said in February that the government doesn't have a \"compelling vision\" and it's true today. But her was wrong last weekend when he said Beecroft's proposals were dead. They're not. They're alive and well as he implements Beecroft by the back door, and employees should be worried.</p>",

They were in a private place, so in my view this was a breach of law,\" said Gaultier.</p> <p>He said it was unheard of for an editor to be jailed and celebrity magazines in France are generally willing to risk fines if the benefits of boosting circulation and revenues outweigh any fines for breaching the law.</p> <p>Over five pages, Closer published what it described as exclusive pictures of the duchess topless under the headline: \"Oh my God \u2013 sex and sun en Provence.\" The pictures were apparently taken on the terrace of a guest house during a brief holiday with the duke in France last week.</p> <p>Royal photographer Harry Page told Sky News that from what he had seen, they were taken with long lenses and the couple would have had no idea they were being photographed.</p> <p>Closer magazine defended its decision, with its editor-in-chief Laurence Pieau describing the photos as a beautiful series that showed a couple in love and saying they were in no way degrading.</p> <p>She said the magazine had more intimate shots from the same series that it opted not to publish. \"There's been an over-reaction to these photos. What we see is a young couple, who just got married, who are very much in love, who are splendid,\" Pieau told French TV news channel BFM.</p> <p>\"She's a real 21st Century princess,\" she added: \"It's a young woman who is topless, the same as you can see on any beach in France or around the world.\"</p> <p>Closer published a dozen shots of the duchess as she relaxed in Provence at a chateau owned by Lord Linley, the Queen's nephew, ahead of the couple's diamond jubilee tour of south-east Asia and the South Pacific on behalf of the Queen.</p> <p>With a cover headline Oh my God!, the photos show the couple soaking up the sun on the balcony of a 19th-century hunting lodge, oblivious to lurking paparazzi.</p> <p>They show her taking off her bikini top, sunbathing on a sun lounger and at one point pulled down the back of her bikini bottoms as Prince William applies sun cream.</p> <p>Sources at St James's Palace said they had no advance warning about the photos before publication and by the time they learned of Closer's plans it was too late to try and get an injunction to prevent the magazine going on sale in France on Friday morning.</p> <p>The publication of the pictures is a blow to Buckingham Palace as it tries to move on from a scandal over naked shots of Prince Harry that tarred the image of the royal family, which had been bolstered by the duke and duchess's wedding, the Queen's 2012 diamond jubilee and her surprise cameo in the London Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>Newspapers in Britain were not offered the photographs publisher by Closer. They were offered a different set of long-lens shots last week, but turned them down.</p> <p>Publication of the pictures was also condemned by Bauer, the owner of Closer magazine in the UK, which had licensed Berlusconi's company to publish the French version. The company demanded Closer remove the pictures from its website immediately and in a veiled threat to sever ties with the publisher, said it was \"reviewing the terms of our licence agreement with Closer France\".</p> <p>\"Like our readers, we are appalled and regret the pain the publication of these photographs has caused,\" said Paul Keenan, chief executive of Bauer media, who said the company \"deplore the publication of these intrusive and offensive pictures\".</p> <p>Executives on two national tabloids said the set of photos being touted around last week were different. \"They were also long lens, but you couldn't see anything. These pictures nobody has seen, as far I am aware,\" one picture editor said.</p> <p>Page, a photographer who has worked with national newspapers for the past 30 years, said: \"From what I have seen, these photos have been taken from a very long way. Kate and William would have had no idea they were being taken.</p> <p>\"They were on a 640-acre estate in the south of France. I think they would have expected a certain degree of privacy. They were on a private holiday.</p> <p>\"Remember the toe-sucking photos of Fergie [Sarah Ferguson], again in the south of France. That is exactly 20 years ago this month and there was a scramble for them. But now there is not a single newspaper in Britain who would publish these pictures.\"</p> <p>The royal family only rarely and reluctantly resorts to legal action over media coverage, despite being constantly in the spotlight. The Duchess of Cambridge has taken action over invasion of privacy once before, receiving an apology, damages and legal costs from picture agency Rex in March 2010 after it distributed photos of her taken during a private holiday in Cornwall.</p> <p>The Prince of Wales won a protracted legal battle over privacy with the Mail on Sunday in late 2006, when the court of appeal ruled that the paper had infringed his copyright and confidentiality by publishing extracts from his private diaries about the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.</p> <p>Princess Diana sued the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror in 1993 over secretly-taken pictures of her exercising in a gym and won an injunction against the publishing preventing further publication. The Queen dropped legal action against the Daily Mirror after a reporter breached royal security to work as a palace footman in 2003,.</p> <p>The publication of the topless pictures of the duchess are also likely to be taken into account by Lord Justice Leveson, who is currently drafting his final report offering recommendations to the government on the future of press regulation. The latest controversy will underline the difficulties any future British regulator will have in controlling overseas internet publication of content that can be viewed online in the UK.</p>",

This means building up knowledge about what may or may not be achievable, be informed by expert evidence and at the same time be mindful that social considerations can sometimes involve increased burdens which smaller suppliers might find difficult to bear.</p> <p><strong>It doesn't represent best value to seek social value in every contract opportunity.</strong> Social value isn't a free gift \u2013 even from community organisations.

This requires a significant investment of resource and expertise to move away from generally nationally prescribed output based measures, to measures which begin to track wellbeing and the impact of wellbeing.</p> <p>Kirklees are at a stage now where we are identifying ways in which both output and outcome based measures can be aligned to a 'value set' \u2013 which we've identified as the broad priority areas for Kirklees (health, housing, environment etc).

The impact of policy actions can play out over long periods of time and in the current climate it is crucial that members and leaders are supported to understand how social value and impact affect people's lives in the long term \u2013 and in turn how that evidence can be used as part of future policy design.</p> <h2><strong>Tim Gilling is acting executive director of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.cfps.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Centre for Public Scrutiny</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>How councils embrace the act will influence the extent to which culture change is achieved.</strong> Compliant councils are likely to simply meet the legal duty. Aspirant councils are likely to be those that are already tackling these issues \u2013 for example Kirklees. These councils will use the act as a springboard to open up the way decisions about services are taken by being transparent, inclusive and accountable for outcomes.</p> <p><strong>Getting the language right will help.</strong> Accountability in this context is about demonstrating an understanding of people's needs and aspirations and then creating a transparent plan for meeting those needs and achieving those aspirations. To some extent it is a political judgement about where the balance of short-term and long-term actions sit in those plans. And keeping in touch with the experiences of people who use services is vital.

A huge number of the providers are very cost effective, and already generate a lot of social value, but just don't communicate this to the local authority.

  "<p>The opposition Syrian National Council has come under attack from within and without. Western governments <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/syria-opposition-groups-national-council\" title=\"\">have given up</a> on its ability to unite the opposition and some high-profile members <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/28/234827.html\" title=\"\">have resigned</a>.</p> <p>Western governments, along with Qatar, Saudi and Turkey, have begun building channels of communication with grassroots opposition groups and activists by training them to run liberated areas and prepare for a post-Assad Syria.</p> <p>A western diplomat who works on Syrian issues has told me that these countries are tapping into such groups to prevent the spread of militias after the downfall of the regime. The diplomat said that although the SNC receives sufficient relief resources, the funds are misspent. And, despite frequent attempts, the council failed to reform itself.</p> <p>Ziour al-Omar, a Kurdish figure and a former member of the SNC, said:</p> <blockquote> \"When the council was formed, there was a kind of balance between its components: secularists, liberals, nationalists, Islamists and other religious groups. <br> The imbalance occurred at a later stage when Islamist forces managed to control the decision-making process within the council, a development that had been watched closely and with discomfort by the international community.\" </blockquote> <p>Members of the SNC sense the attempts to sideline it and have taken steps to assert its presence. The council is building ties with the more popular Free Syrian Army (FSA) and there is a plan to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/05/syria-rebels-down-jets-live#block-50473b12c0e3ec4f5dc5bc14\" title=\"\">change the FSA's name</a> to the Syrian National Army \u2013 the similarity of names is not a coincidence but a clear attempt to maintain the Syrian National Council as the leading brand.</p> <p>Despite its current failure, however, sidelining the Syrian National Council is a mistake. While it is an effective policy to build channels of grassroots communication, that is not enough. Instead of abandoning the council, the west and its allies in the region must throw their weight behind reforming the council.</p> <p>There are several risks in abandoning the council. Political legitimacy will be a decisive factor in maintaining order after the downfall of the regime. Without a legitimate political body, the risk of the country lapsing into chaos is extremely high. Establishing legitimacy must not be deferred to the transition period, as some suggest, because it takes time, and should be proven through palpable contribution to the downfall of the regime.</p> <p>Because of this lack of legitimacy and the council's performance, anti-regime fighters are planning the future of the country without the council. The rebels believe the council is idly waiting to be handed the keys to the country by the Free Syrian Army. They have a point. How can a political body that claims to represent people in a complex struggle against a brutal regime have members living in different parts of the world without dedication to the cause?</p> <p>According to Hussein Jamo, a Kurdish-Syrian journalist who embedded with the FSA in Aleppo for a week, the fighters began to give up on the council by the turn of the year. Criticism by activists and fighters on the ground heightened when the SNC failed to provide relief work after the regime's violent escalation that turned several cities to rubble. SNC member Ridwan Ziada has blamed the donor countries for this, saying the first funds received by the council were in February.</p> <p>The persistence of rifts within the opposition and the rise of extremism are driving more people towards the Assad camp. Also, the failure of the council has a direct impact on the unity and operations of the anti-regime fighters. The selective distribution of ammunition, according to Jamo, is a major cause of rifts among brigades of the FSA. Ziour al Omar said the council's top leadership distributes the money they receive among themselves and then spend it for the uprising as they see fit. \"Each member then distributes it to his own supporters,\" he said.</p> <p>The west must tie support and funding for the council to reform and inclusiveness. Some groups and figures within the council have already established channels of financial support in the region, which means the west must work with its regional allies.</p> <p>The unconditional flow of funding, along with other factors, impede progress. Influential members feel they do not need to bow to pressure and cede monopoly over the council. According to an SNC member, Syrian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Riad al-Shiqfa has said: \"The west has no choice but to deal with us [the council].\"</p> <p>There is a pervasive attitude among SNC members that the issue of unity has been put forward by the international community to justify inaction. SNC member Ghassan Mufleh called the issue of unity a \"concoction\" and said that \"a person with conscious\" should not speak about reassuring the minorities when the majority is being persecuted. Such a statement is an example of why many Syrians are averse to the council.</p> <p>Different countries share some of the blame for the current state of the council, due to heavy interference early on (particularly from Turkey), the little support for the council when it was more representative and because some allied themselves with certain groups or individuals within the opposition. Those factors led to rifts, confusion and mixed messages.</p> <p>Yet, the council has proven that it would not reform itself on its own. The international community must take serious steps to help the council reform or to form a new one.</p>",

Going under the name Michael Green and casting himself as an internet marketing guru, Shapps in 2007 claimed audiences could \"make $20,000 in 20 days guaranteed or your money back\" \u2013 if they spent $200 buying his bespoke software.</p> <p>The picture used to illustrate <a href=\"http://www.fotosearch.com/FSA863/x29555922/\" title=\"\">Michael Green on the site is that of a model that can be brought for generic use on websites for as little as $125.</a></p> <p>A year later 2008 Shapps transferred his share of the company to his wife, Belinda, and the Tory chair says he has nothing to do with the firm.
