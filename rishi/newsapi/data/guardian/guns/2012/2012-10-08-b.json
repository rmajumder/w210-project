  "<p>Doctors and government health officials should set limits, as they do for alcohol, on the amount of time children spend watching screens \u2013 and under-threes should be kept away from the television altogether, according to a paper in an influential medical journal published on Tuesday.</p> <p>A review of the evidence in the Archives Of Disease in Childhood says children's obsession with TV, computers and screen games is causing developmental damage as well as long-term physical harm. Doctors at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which co-owns the journal with the British Medical Journal group, say they are concerned. Guidelines in the US, Canada and Australia already urge limits on children's screen time, but there are none yet in Britain.</p> <p>The review was written by psychologist Dr Aric Sigman, author of a book on the subject, following a speech he gave to the RCPCH's annual conference. On average, he says, a British teenager spends six hours a day looking at screens at home \u2013 not including any time at school. In North America, it is nearer eight hours. But, says Sigman, negative effects on health kick in after about two hours of sitting still, with increased long-term risks of obesity and heart problems.</p> <p>The critical time for brain growth is the first three years of life, he says. That is when babies and small children need to interact with their parents, eye to eye, and not with a screen.</p> <p>Prof Mitch Blair, officer for health promotion at the college, said: \"Whether it's mobile phones, games consoles, TVs or laptops, advances in technology mean children are exposed to screens for longer amounts of time than ever before. We are becoming increasingly concerned, as are paediatricians in several other countries, as to how this affects the rapidly developing brain in children and young people.\"</p> <p>The US department of health and human services now specifically cites the reduction of screen time as a health priority, aiming \"to increase the proportion of children aged 0 to two years who view no television or videos on an average weekday\" and increase the proportion of older children up to 18 who have no more than two hours' screen time a day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/10/12/peds.2011-1753.full.pdf\" title=\"\">American Academy of Pediatrics has also issued guidance</a>, saying \"media \u2013 both foreground and background \u2013 have potentially negative effects and no known positive effects for children younger than 2 years\". The <a href=\"http://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/limiting_screen_time_at_home\" title=\"\">Canadian Paediatric Society says no child should be allowed to have a television</a>, computer or video game equipment in his or her bedroom.</p> <p>Sigman goes further, suggesting no screen time for the under-threes, rising gradually to a maximum of two hours for the over-16s. Parents should \"encourage\" no screens in the bedroom, he says, and be aware that their own viewing habits will influence their children.</p> <p>But the issue is controversial and his opinions and standing are questioned by <a href=\"http://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/directory/dorothy-bishop\" title=\"\">Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at Oxford University</a> who says that although this is an important topic, Sigman's paper is not \"an impartial expert review of evidence for effects on health and child development\". \"Aric Sigman does not appear to have any academic or clinical position, or to have done any original research on this topic,\" she said. \"His comments about impact of screen time on brain development and empathy seem speculative in my opinion, and the arguments that he makes could equally well be used to conclude that children should not read books.\"</p> <p>Sigman says he chooses not to have a job at a university and works in health education. \"I go into schools and talk to children, usually about alcohol \u2013 trying to delay the age at which they start drinking,\" he said. Limiting the use of electronic media, he said, was a similar public health issue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/default.aspx?go=10080\" title=\"\">Dr Louise Arsenault, senior lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry</a>, said: \"The findings from this study are intriguing and add to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that a sedentary lifestyle is not optimal for the future of young children.\" It was \"crucial to keep this activity in context with the rest of children's lives\". Screen media could be a marker of a more generally unhealthy lifestyle that needed to be talked about by health practitioners, she said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/pcls/people/lynne-murray.aspx\" title=\"\">Professor Lynne Murray, research professor in developmental psychopathology at the University of Reading</a>, said there is \"a well-established literature showing the adverse effects of screen experience on the cognitive development of children under three\", but the adverse effects could be mitigated if the child was watching and interacting with \"a supportive partner \u2013 usually adult\".</p> <p>The RCPH's Professor Blair said there were some simple steps parents could take, \"such as limiting toddler exposure as much as possible, keeping TVs and computers out of children's bedrooms, restricting prolonged periods of screen time (we would recommend less than two hours a day) and choosing programmes that have an educational element.\"</p> <p>But Justine Roberts, co-founder of Mumsnet, said it was hard for parents to compete with technology. \"It would be great if someone could invent a lock that could automatically ensure a daily shut down of all the different devices in and around the home after a designated period. Until such a thing is invented, it's going to be an ongoing battle to keep on top of everything,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The highly-respected Pew Research organization has published a poll \u2013 and it's a shocker: Mitt Romney leads President Obama 49% to 45% among likely voters. This is one of Romney's few \u2013 and certainly largest \u2013 national leads in a non-Rasmussen poll this year.</p> <p>The headline result on its own would be attention-grabbing, but the detailed findings are even more impressive. The Pew poll, at least in its registered voters electorate (Romney and Obama are tied among this subset), has been the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/skewed-polls-nonsense_b_1923107.html\">most pro-Democratic polling outfit</a> this entire cycle. Their <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama\">last poll before this</a> had Obama ahead by 8 points among likely voters. Let's break down the poll further and try to figure out what it means.</p> <p><strong>1). There has been a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/\">major change in party identification</a><br></strong><br>I'd argue that a lot of the volatility is from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/unskewing-polls-party-id-bunk\">major switch in party ID</a>. Pew's likely voter screen jumped from a 10-point Democratic edge in party ID to a 5-point Republican lead. Their registered voter results show an 11-point Democratic lead turning into a tie.</p> <p>Among analysts, I've been one of the most ardent in arguing that party ID should not be what tells us whether a poll is right or wrong. That said, I've also pointed out that when you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/231503188505796610\">concentrate on one pollster</a>, party ID should remain relatively stable. It's the reason I critiqued a July Pew poll that I felt was \"too Democratic\". You just shouldn't have 10- to 15-point swings in two weeks. I feel the correct party ID weighting among likely voters should be somewhere between 11 points pro-Democratic and 5 points pro-Republican, while a registered voter number should be between 11 points Democratic and a tie.</p> <p><strong>2). Pew has had wild October swings before</strong></p> <p>Pew Research reported Obama leads over John McCain of 14 and 15 points in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/national.html\">October 2008</a>. These leads were larger than Obama's final lead of 6 points and previous lead of 7 points. Those numbers were not, however, the result of wild party ID swings. It could mean that this year something has fundamentally shifted \u2013 or Pew just got really unlucky with their sample. Either way, it's a lesson that any poll result should be questioned and compared with other results.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney's got a winning racial coalition in this poll</strong></p> <p>All through this cycle, you couldn't escape articles saying that Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/thenextamerica/politics/obama-needs-80-of-minority-vote-to-win-2012-presidential-election-20120824\">couldn't win without winning white voters</a> by a 20-point margin. He's got a 21-point lead among them in this poll. That's impossible for Obama to overcome even if this country is becoming more diverse. That 21-point lead would likely give Romney a 1- or 2-point lead if the electorate looked as it did 2008. But given what seems to be a growing Democratic enthusiasm problem, it lifts him to a 4-point advantage.</p> <p><strong>4). Romney has broken through in the midwest in this poll</strong></p> <p>Given Obama's strength with African Americans, college-educated whites, and Latinos, many \u2013 myself including myself \u2013 have long believed that Romney needed to win in the one region where there are fewer of these demographic groups: <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/05/18/romney_faces_a_blue_wall_--_but_is_it_solid.html\">the midwest</a>. Romney leads there by 6 points overall and by 21 points among whites. That <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national-exit-polls.html\">result is better</a> than George W Bush managed in 2004 and is also better than George HW Bush in 1988, who won there by 5 points. If the poll is right, Romney is going to be doing pretty darn well in Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</p> <p><strong>5). Obama has a problem among men</strong></p> <p>Romney and Obama are tied among women in this survey, but Romney leads by 8 with men. It puts a whole new spin on the term \"<a href=\"http://swampland.time.com/2012/08/29/the-gender-gap-is-hurting-romney-beyond-his-control/\">gender gap</a>\".</p> <p><strong>Conclusion: we can't take too much from any one poll</strong></p> <p>There are reasons to believe the Pew poll is probably too pro-Romney. Still, with this normally Democratic-leaning poll, and the Daily Kos- and SEIU-sponsored <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Taniel/status/255367755317002241\">Public Policy Polling national poll</a> (coming out tomorrow) also having Romney in the lead, it's fairly safe to assume that this is not down to some conservative push to call this race tied.</p>",
  "<p>Roy Moore thinks he's been called to put God back where God belongs: in the classroom, in the bedroom and in the courtroom. Moore <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/politics/politicians/2012/10/06/watch-alabama-chief-justice-candidate-say-gay-marriage-will-destroy\">is a former chief justice of the Alabama supreme court</a>, first elected in 1999. <a href=\"http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/180360/roy-moore-in-running-to-be-alabamas-theocratic-judge-supreme/\">He holds</a> that Jesus is good, taxes are bad, abortion is really bad and the state should use its power to punish homosexuality, which he called a \"criminal lifestyle\".</p> <p>Moore was booted off the court in 2003, falling foul of the constitutional prohibition against government-endorsed religion. As chief justice, he'd parked a two-ton Ten Commandments stone monument in the doorway to the state judicial building and refused to move it.</p> <p>Now, Moore's back, lamenting what he sees as our catastrophic moral decline, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/secularism-leads-to-sharia-law_n_1554106.html\">warning</a> that secularism, gay marriage and the teaching of evolution will inevitably lead to sharia law \u2013 and trying to get reinstated. Since Alabama is both rock-hard Republican and churchier-than-thou, Moore has a real shot at getting elected again.</p> <p>Win or lose, he is Exhibit A in a growing trend of politicisation of the American judiciary. </p> <p>Allowing party hacks and legal toffs to appoint judges is a lousy idea. Allowing citizens to vote them into \u2013 or out of \u2013 office is an even lousier idea. Most Americans have only the haziest understanding of due process and can't even name their state supreme court justices. But throw party politics and a ton of money into judicial races, and they become as unsavoury as your average name-calling, scandal-mongering, shit-slinging congressional campaign.</p> <p>If you believe that the judicial branch of government should be as apolitical as possible in this fallen world, having judges raise hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of dollars from people who may appear before them one day in order that they can run 30-second spots begging for votes, leaves a still worse taste.</p> <p>The United States supreme court dumped a gallon of arsenic into the stew with its <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/scotus-campaign-finance/index.html\">Citizens United</a> decision, ruling that corporations and unions can give unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns. Retired US supreme court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/buying_justice_the_impact_of_citizens_united_on_judicial_elections/\">who opposed Citizens United</a>, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If you're a litigant appearing before a judge, it makes sense to invest in that judge's campaign. No states can possibly benefit from having that much money injected into a political judicial campaign. The appearance of bias is high, and it destroys any credibility in the courts.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Nevertheless, <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/campaign_money_patterns_entering_new_phase_in_2012_judicial_races/\">across the country</a> \u2013 in Montana, West Virginia, Illinois, Texas, Oregon \u2013 state judicial races attract fat checks from those who want to buy a court. In Iowa, Republicans are spending big to unseat Justice David Wiggins. In 2009, the Iowa supreme court ruled that same-sex marriage is legal in a unanimous vote. Conservatives had a fit of the vapours, then vowed revenge.</p> <p>Two years ago, a failed gubernatorial candidate called Bob Vander Plaats <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/videonetwork/658365831001/Bob-Vander-Plaats-victory-speech-judicial-retention-\">helped unseat</a> Chief Justice Marsha Ternus and Associate Justices Michael Streit and David Baker. Now, Vander Plaats is at it again, <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/09/25/903481/iowa-newspapers-condemn-politicized-campaign-to-oust-supreme-court-justice/\">bringing reinforcements</a> in Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and culture warrior former Senator Rick Santorum. They're touring Iowa on a bus, urging people to vote against Wiggins and, since the Iowa caucuses are the first step on the road to the White House, getting a jump on the 2016 campaign. </p> <p>The Republicans' <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/impartial-justice-at-risk.html\">biggest target this year is the Florida supreme court</a> \u2013 specifically, Justices Peggy Quince, R Fred Lewis and Barbara Pariente, who must win a majority of votes to keep their seats. Lewis and Pariente were appointed by Lawton Chiles, Florida's last Democratic governor; Quince, one of two African Americans on the seven-member court, was chosen jointly by Chiles and incoming Republican Governor Jeb Bush. She and Pariente are the court's only women.</p> <p>For the first time ever, the Republican party of Florida (RPOF), aided by their Tea Party shock troops, is mounting a concerted campaign against specific justices. RPOF pretends this is some grassroots effort, an outburst of populist anger at a bunch of out-of-touch liberal judges. But the power (and the money) behind the effort comes from an outfit called Americans for Prosperity, funded by the Koch brothers.</p> <p>The play here is to create three shiny new vacancies on Florida's highest court, which would be filled by Tea Party poster boy Governor Rick Scott. This is a rightwing wet dream: a forelock-tugging, corporation-loving, quiescent court, which would ignore inconveniences such as the Clean Water Act and the 14th Amendment, and never get in the way of the free market.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theledger.com/article/20121007/NEWS/121009471?Title=Vote-on-Justices-Highlights-Battle-Over-Judiciary-\">Merit retention</a>\" of judges is supposed to be a mechanism for citizens to rid the courts of the incompetent and the unethical. No one accuses Quince, Lewis and Pariente of incompetence or unethical practices. The best Republicans can do is call them \"judicial activists\", a meaningless phrase they throw at any jurist who rules against them. The great <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/BROWN-VS-BOARD-OF-EDUCATION-50-years-later-2777225.php\">Brown v Board of Education decision in 1954</a>, the one which declared segregation unconstitutional \u2013 that's judicial activism. Handing the presidency to George W Bush on the dodgiest of legal theories in Bush v Gore is high-minded and statesman-like.</p> <p>Republican disdain for Florida's court goes back to the 2000 presidential recount imbroglio, when the justices refused to allow certification of Florida's dubious election results. In the dozen years since, the court has been the only institution <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/01/3029764/police-and-fire-unions-blast-gop.html\">standing against attacks on unions</a>, public education and public employees. The court has stopped Republican governors and the Republican-controlled legislature from trying to curtail women's reproductive rights and knock down that metaphorical, but necessary wall separating church and state. Most recently, the court slapped down Gov Scott's <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/florida-court-recall-idINL1E8KPJ2V20120926\">attempt</a> to take power over all state agencies, and <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/florida-court-recall-idINL1E8KPJ2V20120926\">rejected</a> Republicans' pet 2010 initiative that would have let Floridians refuse to buy health insurance no matter what federal law may say.</p> <p>Republicans won't admit they're trying to saw off one of our government's three branches; they prefer to run television ads attacking Quince, Pariente and Lewis for their \"extremism\" and accusing them of being soft on crime. The latter charge <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/florida-justices-under-attack-for-ruling-that-turned-on-defense-attorneys/1253953\">refers to the court's 5-2 decision in 2003</a> granting Joe Elton Nixon, a confessed murderer, a new trial because his defense had been incompetent. Nixon was never going to be freed from prison and there was no question of his guilt. But that pesky old US constitution (the one conservatives swear they love, but seem not to have ever read) guarantees all citizens a fair trial \u2013 not just the nice people. Yet, to hear the Republicans squeal about it, you'd think that the Florida supreme court had declared Nixon innocent, popped open a bottle of champagne and given him a ride to the nearest Hooters.</p> <p>All this happened nine years ago. Six years ago, when Pariente, Quince and Lewis were last up for retention, there was nary a peep out of the GOP. But that was before the Republican party lost what was left of its marbles and began muttering to itself about Kenyan socialists, black helicopters and UN invasion forces.</p> <p>In the meantime, our liberties are threatened as the rule of law is weakened by grubby politics, and our justice system grows increasingly partisan.</p>",
  "<p>The law of libel in England and Wales is among the most limiting in the free world: in the latest <a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Global%20and%20Regional%20Press%20Freedom%20Rankings.pdf\" title=\"\">global press freedom rankings, the UK as a whole ranks 31st</a>, along with Belize and Micronesia. The need to update the law to reflect the digital age, to limit libel tourism and to restrict damages was one of the few areas of common ground at the last election. So it's welcome news that <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120912/debtext/120912-0003.htm#column_366\" title=\"\">the coalition's defamation bill has now reached the House of Lords</a>. But it is less good news that, despite efforts by Lib Dem backbenchers and the opposition, it is a flawed piece of work that falls far short of providing the defence that serious journalism \u2013 digital and newspaper \u2013 so badly needs.</p> <p>As campaigning organisations like Index on Censorship <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/08/promises-libel-law-reform-kept\" title=\"\">argue in a letter to the Guardian today</a>, the bill as it stands would not have protected any of the journalists, scientists, doctors and activists caught up in recent cases. These are of course precisely the areas where divergent views are most valuable, but their defence is most fraught.</p> <p>The bill is certainly not all bad. It should bring better protection for scientific journals, it strengthens the defence of \"honest opinion\" and makes libel tourism harder, if not hard enough. Website archives will no longer need to fear a defamation case months or even years after original publication. And a new \"serious harm\" test should end trivial prosecutions.</p> <p>What is lacking is a sense of the scale of the challenge faced by serious journalism. This is only partly about traditional news organisations fighting to preserve investigative journalism \u2013 they are concerned by an apparent weakening of the defence of \"responsible journalism\" that, in translation to legislation, seems likely to generate a whole new series of tests. It is also about the new world of blogging and posting where discussion of legitimate concerns on a forum can be shut off by a single threatening phone call from an in-house lawyer. These are the places that might provide early warning of problems in a chain of care homes or difficulties with a government contractor. If this kind of expression is to flourish as it should as a vital arm of democratic accountability, it needs protection against the rich and powerful whose interests it may be crossing. A robust public interest defence that offers some security where matters under debate are of public concern and are the subject of honest opinion is a serious omission.</p> <p>Like any attempt to strike a balance, weighing free expression against protection of reputation is art as much as science. And that's another reason why this bill is important. Legal decisions here reverberate across the common law jurisdictions from Canada to the Caribbean. The better free expression is protected here, the better the UK can argue internationally against oppression and persecution.</p>",
  "<p>And so the carousel bobs round again. Same names and offences. Same outcries and frustrations. Hot air on radio chat-shows; frigid indifference from those in power.</p> <p>After watching Luis Su\u00e1rez flinging himself to the turf at Anfield on Sunday, Tony Pulis was piety personified. \"I am concerned about the simulation and putting pressure on the ref,\" he said. \"It's a tough enough job as it is. For professional footballers to be doing that is just not right. Give him three games and he will stop falling over.\"</p> <p>There is more chance of the Football Association making Pulis its next technical director. But the Stoke City manager cuts directly to the chase. What should be done to stop Gareth Bale, Ashley Young and others doing what, deep down, they know is wrong \u2013 but, when they get away with it, the scoreboard often tells them is right?</p> <p>Let's breeze through the options...</p> <h2><strong>Extra referees behind the goal</strong></h2> <p>Seen as a miracle cure-all by the Uefa president, Michel Platini, but much like a 19th century 'health potion' you suspect there is more spin and quackery than substance behind it. Uefa's chief refereeing officer, Pierluigi Collina, however, believes extra referees have made a significant impact. In the in-no-way-biased <a href=\"http://www.uefa.com/uefa/footballfirst/matchorganisation/refereeing/news/newsid=1854936.html\" title=\"\">\"Additional assistant referees \u2013 a success story\" on Uefa's website</a>, Collina points to a \"clear reduction of incidents, particularly holding, pulling and also blocking at set pieces \u2013 so mainly at corners and free-kicks \u2026 we noticed that during Euro 2012, there was an increased number of goals scored from headers. This is a consequence of the diminishing of pulling and pushing which makes it easier for an attacker to score a headed goal. We also had better control of the goalline to assess whether the ball crossed the line or not.\" Tell that to Ukraine's supporters, who saw a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPYNpo0FFd4\" title=\"\">perfectly good Marko Devic goal ruled out against England</a>.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it happening</strong> Probably quite high.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it making a difference</strong> Low. So far it doesn't seem to have discernable effect on diving in Champions League games.</p> <h2><strong>Live video evidence during matches</strong></h2> <p>Sounds preposterous, or utopian, or possibly both. But if changing human behaviour is about altering incentives, then this is a pretty dramatic one. Why dive when a fifth official in the stands can alert the referee, who would be waving a yellow card in your direction within 30 seconds or less?</p> <p>Supported by Dave Whelan, who argues: \"We have to say to Mr Blatter, whatever you say, the Premier League will help our officials with more technology. Tennis, cricket, rugby league: why not football? Why can't we get the decisions 99.9% correct?\" The obvious downside is that it would slow the game down, at least initially. But once players realised they were going to get punished for diving it might actually stop them doing it, and would then mean no loss of time at all.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it happening</strong> Zilch, while Sepp Blatter or Michel Platini is around.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it making a difference</strong> Very high.</p> <h2><strong>Retrospective video evidence</strong></h2> <p>The sensible, live-in-a-semi-and-have-2.4-children choice and supported by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Pulis, David Moyes and every caller to 6-0-6 whenever this issue is discussed. However, Fifa is less keen because it regards the referee as omnipotent and fears establishing a precedent where other incidents are re-refereed at a later date.</p> <p>Roy Hodgson, while manager of West Bromwich Albion, pointed out another potential flaw: \"It will raise to some extent questions, sometimes, about delegates and assessors, such as are they local people seeing things with local eyes, or are they as neutral as we hope the referees will be?\" That said, Major League Soccer created an anonymous five-person panel to rule on suspensions for simulation (which has been followed by other leagues) in 2011 and the world has not ended.</p> <p>Another issue is where you draw the line? Earlier this year, Wenger argued for a \"superior committee of ethics\", adding: \"With this committee, an obvious dive should be punished by a three-match ban. But it has to be obvious diving. For example, Ashley Young against QPR, I would not suspend him because I don't know if he lost his balance. He made more of it to get the penalty but it is not an obvious case for me.\" But what constitutes an obvious case? Purposely clipping and tumbling over an opposing player's foot is one thing; drawing contact when you're flat out before allowing yourself to go down quite another.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it happening</strong> In the Premier League? Moderate to low.</p> <p>Either the Fifa's rule-making body Ifab would have to allow it, or the FA and its stakeholders (ie the Premier League, Football League, Uefa, Fifa, PFA, LMA, and the PGMO, which represents match officials) would have to approve it.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it making a difference</strong> High, although not 100% perfect. Would you care about a one-match ban if a cynical swan dive in the World Cup final earned your side the winning penalty?</p> <h2><strong>Players and managers to realise they have a duty to the game</strong></h2> <p>Don't be silly. Actually, that's a bit unfair. David Moyes is one of a handful of managers who have come out against simulation, saying; \"I've said to my players that I don't want them diving. Of course people will go down but I don't like it. I will say it to them if I think they are going down outrageously or cheaply.\" But really, the stakes are too high these&#xa0;days.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it happening</strong> Arrange these words: frozen first will have hell over.</p> <p><strong>Chances of it making a difference</strong> Not going to happen.</p>",
  "<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-text\">given his most detailed foreign policy speech to date</a>. But how does Romney's vision for America's place in the world compare to the policies currently being pursued by the Obama administration \u2013 and there any contradictions?</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Called for the arming of anti-Assad rebels with weapons powerful enough to combat \"tanks, helicopters and fighter jets\". Romney has consistently criticised Obama for not giving enough support to the rebels.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has encouraged Gulf states to arm the rebels, but only with small arms, out of concern that more powerful weapons could fall into hostile hands after the revolution, as happened with the flow of guns out of Libya to other parts of north Africa, including Islamist rebels in Mali. The US has also offered training, intelligence information and military advice to the Syrian rebels.</p> <p><strong>Contradictions:</strong> While Romney criticises Obama for not doing enough to confront those he regards as Islamist extremists in other parts of the Middle East, including the newly elected government of Egypt, he would arm groups in Syria about which he knows little.</p> <h2>Libya</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397400444\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347532375488/A-US-flag-lies-amid-the-r-004.jpg\" alt=\"A US flag lies amid the rubble at the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya,where Chris Stevens was killed\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US flag lies amid the rubble at the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where US diplomat Chris Stevens and three others were killed on 11 September Photograph: Stringer/EPA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Blamed Obama for failures around the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the US ambassador. Romney has accused Obama of failing to recognise that the attack is evidence that al-Qaida is still a force to be reckoned with and should be confronted in Libya. He also blamed the president for poor security at the consulate and for not confronting the Islamist militias responsible for the attack. Romney portrays this as a reflection of Obama's weakness.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Sought to strengthen the hand of the shaky new civilian regime in Libya, offering intelligence assistance including the use of drones to track extremist camps. The US has worked with the new government to try to draw the militias into the military and under central control, or to disarm them. But has steered clear of any suggestion of direct military intervention.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions &amp; contradictions:</strong> Romney has not said how he proposes to combat extremists in Libya. Ground troops or drone attacks are likely to create a severe backlash in a country where, while Nato's bombing raids were welcome and crucial in support of last year's revolution, there was strong opposition to foreign forces on the ground.</p> <p>In fact, Libya is a relative success story despite the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, illustrated by the large numbers of people in Benghazi who turned out to challenge the militiamen, driving them from their base, and to protest in support of the US.</p> <p>Romney seems to see no contradiction between his call to arm Syrian rebels while condemning Obama for not taking on armed groups in Libya.</p> <p>Romney is also open to charges of flip-flopping on Libya after initially opposing US air attacks in support of the rebels last year and then backing it.</p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Opposes the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of the last US combat troops. He has accused Obama of effectively telling the Taliban it only has to keep fighting for another two years and then the Americans will be gone.</p> <p>Romney proposes sticking with Obama's transition of the main combat role to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014 but keeping a significant US military contingent in the country as back-up. He said that pulling out of Afghanistan too early will only lead to more war, and potentially more terrorist attacks on the US, because it will abandon Afghanistan to the extremists responsible for 9/11.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Set the deadline for withdrawal from America's longest war in the face of a now unpopular and, to many people, unwinnable conflict. It is also costly.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> While Romney has committed to keep the US military in Afghanistan, he has not said how he intends to achieve what American forces have been unable to do in a decade of fighting \u2013 defeat the Taliban. One way out is to negotiate, although a Romney administration will find that hard to do given the language he has used to describe the Taliban.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Previously criticised Obama for not taking a stronger stand in confronting Iran over its nuclear programme. The implication was that he believed the US should be willing to resort to military action sooner rather than later. But Romney has shifted ground toward Obama's position that increasingly tough sanctions are, for now, the way to press Tehran. Romney, notably, did not embrace the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's call for a \"red line\" that, if Iran's nuclear programme crossed, would automatically trigger an attack.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Puts the emphasis on diplomacy and sanctions, saying that Tehran is far enough away from developing a nuclear weapon that there is no urgent need for military action. But the president has repeatedly said he will not permit Iran to develop an atomic bomb and that he is prepared to use force to prevent it if necessary.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> Romney, like Obama, has not specified at what point he would consider military action against Tehran. He also made no mention of diplomacy while supporting Obama's sanctions policy. But it's difficult to see how Romney could separate sanctions for the diplomatic track.</p> <h2>Israel-Palestine</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397400445\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/7/30/1343659358640/Mitt-Romney-in-front-of-J-004.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney in front of Jerusalem's Old City\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney is pictured in front of the Old City of Jerusalem as he delivers foreign policy remarks at Mishkenot Sha'ananim, July 29, 2012.   REUTERS/Jason Reed  (JERUSALEM - Tags: POLITICS) :rel:d:bm:GF2E87T1CO301 Photograph: Jason Reed/REUTERS</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Reed/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Was secretly recorded at a fundraising describing the Palestinians as not interested in peace and as committed to the destruction of Israel. On a visit to Israel in July, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/01/romney-israel-comments-lags-polls\">Romney portrayed Jewish culture as superior</a>, saying that it explained why Israelis were prosperous and Palestinians lived in relative poverty. The Republican candidate has also accused Obama of abandoning Israel and jeopardising its security over Iran. He has firmly allied himself with the Israeli government on almost every issue, including saying he would not press it to negotiate with the Palestinians.</p> <p>Romney attempted to row back in his foreign policy speech, saying that he will \"recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel\". He accused Obama of failing in that goal.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Early in his presidency he attempted to press Netanyahu to take peace talks seriously by freezing expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Netanyahu pushed back, and the pair's relationship has soured, made worse by differences over Iran. But Obama significantly increased military assistance to Israel and won praise from Netanyahu and Israeli military chiefs for it.</p> <p><strong>Contradictions and unanswered questions:</strong> Romney appears to have confused the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank with Hamas in Gaza, exposing a woeful ignorance of the issues which will make a difficult situation worse if he inherits the White House. He has effectively surrendered even the pretence at an American-led peace process and Washington as a neutral arbiter. That will only strengthen the view in much of the Arab world that US policy is driven primarily by serving Israel's interests.</p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has revived cold war era rhetoric by calling Vladimir Putin's Russia America's \"No 1 geopolitical foe\". He has portrayed Russia as a menace to the new democracies of eastern Europe. Romney has criticised Obama for missile reduction treaties and calling off plans for missile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. Accuses Obama of showing weakness.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Attempted a \"reset\" with Russia but it quickly ran into the mire. He has since accused Moscow of \"evil behaviour\". However, Obama concluded that there were more pressing foreign policy problems and that it was important to maintain a working relationship on issues such as Iran and Syria.</p> <p><strong>Contraditions &amp; unanswered questions:</strong> Romney has attempted to defend his much-derided \"foe\" remarks by pointing to its power at the United Nations, including its blocking of stronger measures against Syria and its reluctance to impose sanctions on Iran. But he said that it does not make Russia an enemy and that it is not the primary national security threat to the US. Romney has not said how he will face down Moscow.</p> <h2>China</h2> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> On the one hand, he derides Obama for \"pivoting\" policy toward Asia when unrest in the Middle East and Putin's Russia are more immediate threats. On the other, Romney has warned about China's growing assertiveness \"sending chills through the region\". Romney is keen to take on China over what he says is unfair trading through the manipulation of the value of its currency.</p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> The President's pivot toward Asia is as much about reassuring US allies \u2013 some of them newfound, such as Vietnam \u2013 worried about rising Chinese influence. What is billed as the biggest US military build-up in the region since the Vietnam war is more politically than militarily significant, as Obama treads a path of continuing to assert American influence in the region without getting into a confrontation with Beijing.</p> <p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> Besides threatening a trade war with China, Romney has not said how he intends to handle China's rising influence and power. But Beijing may conclude from Romney's criticism of Obama that it is not a priority for the Republican candidate.</p>",
  "<p>Tanya Gold is right (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/maria-miller-feminist-abortion\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 6 October): there have been no recent advances in neonatal care that have made a foetus born before 24 weeks more likely to survive \u2013 the foetal lungs are too immature to respond adequately to the most sophisticated mechanical ventilation. I share her contempt for politicians who express their opposition to legal abortion to gain rightwing votes. But she seriously overstates the proportion of abortions after 24 weeks: in 2011, this was less than 0.01% (146) and only 1.4% at 20 to 24 weeks. Since the early 1970s, the number of late abortions has tended to fall and those obtained early to rise. The decision of parliament in 1990 to reduce the upper limit for almost all abortions from 28 to 24 weeks has had no effect on these trends.</p> <p>It is women themselves and not the law that determine when abortions are done. They request abortion with considerable regret as soon as they are sure the pregnancy is unwanted. This is usually before nine weeks: later requests are made when only when there has been delay in recognising the pregnancy, personal circumstances change unexpectedly or the foetus is discovered to be malformed. Any consideration of why abortion is right or wrong must include the part played by the man in the pregnancy being unwanted, and the disproportionate harm to the woman if the pregnancy were to continue. I feel strongly that the long-term wellbeing of the woman should take precedence over the existence of the foetus.<br><strong>David Paintin</strong><br><em>Emeritus reader in obstetrics and gynaecology, Imperial College St Mary's London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy Hunt and Maria Miller are the latest in a dishonourable line of opponents of a woman's right to choose who skulk behind mendacious misrepresentation of supposed medical advances and purport to be concerned only about time limits.</p> <p>We&#xa0;must not be misled by this whittling tactic against reproductive rights. The purpose of these attacks is to render abortion illegal, and, as is evident from all countries where this law applies, to create a two-tier world. In discrete clinics in leafy suburbs, protected by politicians, plutocrats and police chiefs, wives, daughters and mistresses of the elite get safe, hygienic abortions on demand. By contrast, the full weight of the law bears down on amateur provision of unreliable abortion to the hard-pressed women of the working classes.</p> <p>The over 80% of the UK population that regularly polls in support of a woman's right to choose must make its voice heard. Our politicians must not collude in this class-driven attack on the rights of the most vulnerable in society.<br><strong>Mary Pimm and Nik Wood</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is disingenuous for people to challenge potential changes in the legal limit of abortions from 24 weeks to 20 on the grounds that many foetal abnormalities are not discovered until after 20 weeks' gestation. At present, the 1967 act states that abortion may be carried out at any time up until birth where there is \"serious risk of handicap\" to the child. Many involved in the disability rights movement are deeply concerned that the law continues to enshrine fewer rights for disabled unborn babies than able-bodied ones, and there seems little political motivation to alter this part of the law.</p> <p>In the meantime, those campaigning to retain the gestational age for abortions at 24 weeks should refrain from inaccurate and misleading comments regarding the rights to abort a disabled child.<br><strong>Rev Karen Gardiner</strong><br><em>Elstree, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The health secretary's reactionary call for halving the period in pregnancy when abortion may be permissible (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 6 October) lacks logical as well as scientific justification.</p> <p>Defenders of women's right to choose whether and when to have an abortion should beware of accepting the anti-abortionists' implicit claim that abortion should be banned from the point when the foetus, if removed from the womb, could theoretically survive.</p> <p>There is no logic to this claim, and the test is purely hypothetical: some foetuses could be helped to survive outside the mother at almost any stage, others couldn't. So long as it is a foetus and not a baby, it's part of and dependent on the mother, who should have unfettered rights to decide its future.</p> <p>Once born, it is a baby and a human, and quite different considerations apply, but not until then.</p> <p>The alleged link between potential hypothetical viability and the ban on abortion is based purely on religious superstition about \"the beginning of life\" and should be firmly resisted.</p> <p>Otherwise, scientific advances will eventually make foetuses potentially viable from the moment of conception \u2013 and we shall be back to the cruel days when all abortions were banned and back-street abortionists flourished.<br><strong>Brian Barder</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is glaringly inconsistent for some ministers to seek to cut the abortion rate by reducing the 24-week limit while supporting penalising the children of unemployed parents through cuts in benefits. If the survival and welfare of children is crucial, economic support should be available as a practical alternative to abortion. If saving public money is paramount, surely Tories should seek to raise the abortion limit to&#xa0;five years or older?<br><strong>John Eoin Douglas</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 Surely there is no more reason to suppose that Jeremy Hunt will allow his personal views on abortion to influence his judgment than there was to imagine that his relationship with the Murdochs would influence his views on BSkyB?<br><strong>Arthur Gould</strong><br><em>Loughborough, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 How about putting a 12-week time limit on Jeremy Hunt's tenure at the Department of Health?<br><strong>Lesley Abdela</strong><br><em>Burwash, East Sussex</em></p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson shored up his position as the strongest successor to David Cameron as Tory leader when he delighted the Conservative conference by voicing support for the return of grammar schools.</p> <p>In remarks which have not been heard from the lips of any frontbench Tory for the best part of a decade, the London mayor said he believed that academic selection was right for children at some point in their education.</p> <p>Johnson was given a warm, though by no means rapturous, reception when he addressed a rally hosted by the ConservativeHome website with the provocative title: \"Boris 2012 \u2013 Re-elected and Olympotastic\". It comes before his official speech to conference on Tuesday.</p> <p>But Kenneth Clarke dared to sound a mildly sour note when he questioned the Boris-mania and advised the mayor to set his \"nose to the grindstone\".</p> <p>The former chancellor, who was supported by Johnson in the 2001 Tory leadership contest, told Channel 4 News: \"At the moment, it's terribly fashionable to see Boris as an aspirant prime minister. I'd have thought it's disastrous for Boris unless he gets it under control.\"</p> <p>Clarke offered his advice shortly before Johnson showed his unerring ability to please the Tory tribe when he spoke in favour of selection in education. He told the rally: \"Because I don't have jurisdiction over education in London I can say, without fear of causing any political plaster to fall off the ceiling, that I'm a strong believer in competitive education. What was the Olympics? It was a great pageant of competition. We were encouraging people to come first, second and third.</p> <p>\"We should be able to allow children to compete academically in my view in that way \u2026 I personally have no objection to selective admissions at some stage in a child's development. Where that stage is found \u2013 people object to 11, I can see problems with that. But at some stage \u2013 I have no problem.\"</p> <p>Johnson, who last week warned that Downing Street's apparent interest in building a third runway at Heathrow while ruling out new Thames Estuary airport risked an \"economic catastrophe\", said he would continue to speak out. But he was on his best behaviour as he voiced strong support for the prime minister.</p> <p>\"Nobody should have any cause to doubt my admiration for David Cameron. Let me remind you I was one of the first people \u2013 on that afternoon in 2005, long before Dave announced his candidacy, I rang him up when the number of Cameroons could have been comfortably fitted into a telephone box had one of them not been Nick Soames. In tough circumstances he [Cameron], George Osborne, the rest of the government are doing exactly what is needed for this country to clear up the mess Labour left.</p> <p>\"When I look ahead I see only one cloud on the horizon. That is the possibility that while I am still mayor, no matter how remote we may think it is, that the two Eds \u2013 Balls and Miliband \u2013 could get back into power: unchastened, unpunished, unchanged in their basic view of what they think the country needs.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than 100 people have now been infected with a rare and deadly form of meningitis caused by contaminated steroid shots, health officials announced Monday as police were called in to help track down those still at risk.</p> <p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 105 cases of the illness had been confirmed and that another person had died in the past day, taking the number of fatalities to eight. Officials are attempting to trace thousands more patients who were given the suspect injections. </p> <p>The number of recorded cases almost doubled over the weekend, to 91. On Monday, CDC said a further 14 infected patients had been identified. Cases have been noted in nine states, as far apart as Florida and Minnesota. In Tennessee, where 35 cases have been identified, four people have died.</p> <p>The source of the outbreak has been traced to batches of a drug prepared by the New England Compounding Center (NECC), a pharmacy compounder, based in Massachusetts, that has a checkered health and safety record. It is thought that around 18,000 vials of potentially contaminated methylprednisolone acetate were shipped by the company to 76 clinics in 23 states from July to September.</p> <p>In Ohio, officials have enlisted sheriff's offices to help track down all those who are at danger of being struck down with the illness. </p> <p>\"If that means knocking on doors, then that is what we will do,\" said Beth Bickford, executive director at the Association of Ohio State Health Commissioners.</p> <p>All of those affected were given the shot for back pain, for which the steroid is a common treatment. They then developed symptoms including fever, headache, nausea and neurological problems consistent with deep brain stroke. It could take weeks for some to recover.</p> <p>Investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were sent to the NECC premises last week. They found a fungal contaminate in a sealed vial of the methylprednisolone acetate. They also found a \"foreign material\" in another, opened container.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the FDA said Monday that the investigation was \"ongoing\" and that tests to confirm the exact species of fungus were continuing. Asked if criminal proceedings could be brought against the owners of the company, the FDA official said it could not speculate on the outcome of the investigation or comment on potential litigation.</p> <p>Complaints against NECC were made as long ago as 2002 and as recently as this year. A 2006 warning letter from the FDA to company owner Barry Cadden cited a string of health and safety violations, including the misbranding of drugs and the copying of FDA-approved, commercially available products.</p> <p>Over the weekend, NECC recalled all of its products, calling the move a precautionary measure. It has also suspended all operations and taken down its website. A man answering the phone at Cadden's address on Monday said that the pharmacist was not at home. Asked when Cadden he would be available, he hung up.</p> <p>The outbreak has led to questions over the practice of pharmacy compounding, in which drugs are mixed and altered to patients' requirements.</p> <p>The sheer numbers of shots sent out by NECC \u2013 close to 18,000 doses \u2013 has raised concerns, as has the fact that clinics in 23 states were using the company despite it being unaccredited and having a poor record</p> <p>The outbreak has also highlighted potential failings in the regulation of compounders. The FDA only has limited authority over the day-to-day operations of compounding pharmacies. Moreover, products do not have to win FDA approval before they are sold on, and the regulator has no jurisdiction over how the products are manufactured or labelled for use.</p>",
  "<p>Over the gates of Auschwitz were the words <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100176441/daily-mail-rightminds-recommends-nazi-slogan-arbeit-macht-frei/\" title=\"\">\"Work Makes You Free\"</a>.

Over the gates of the Ngenya detention camp, run by the British in Kenya: \"Labour and Freedom\". Dehumanisation appears to follow an almost inexorable course.</p> <p>Last week three elderly Kenyans established the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/kenyan-mau-mau-veterans\" title=\"\">right to sue the British government for the torture</a> that they suffered \u2013 castration, beating and rape \u2013 in the Kikuyu detention camps it ran in the 1950s.</p> <p>Many tens of thousands were detained and tortured in the camps. I won't spare you the details: we have been sparing ourselves the details for far too long. Large numbers of men were castrated with pliers. Others were raped, sometimes with the use of knives, broken bottles, rifle barrels and scorpions. Women had similar instruments forced into their vaginas. The guards and officials sliced off ears and fingers, gouged out eyes, mutilated women's breasts with pliers, poured paraffin over people and set them alight. Untold thousands died.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">government's secret archive, revealed this April</a>, shows that the attorney general, the colonial governor and the colonial secretary knew what was happening. The governor ensured that the perpetrators had legal immunity: including the British officers reported to him for roasting prisoners to death. In public the colonial secretary lied and kept lying.</p> <p>Little distinguishes the British imperial project from any other. In all cases the purpose of empire was loot, land and labour. When people resisted (as some of the Kikuyu did during the Mau Mau rebellion), the response everywhere was the same: extreme and indiscriminate brutality, hidden from public view by distance and official lies.</p> <p>Successive governments have sought to deny the Kikuyu justice: destroying most of the paperwork, lying about the existence of the rest, seeking to have the case dismissed on technicalities. Their handling of this issue, and the widespread British disavowal of what happened in Kenya, reflects the way this country has been brutalised by its colonial history. Empire did almost as much harm to the imperial nations as it did to their subject peoples.</p> <p>In his book Exterminate All the Brutes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/sven-lindqvist-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Sven Lindqvist</a> shows how the ideology that led to Hitler's war and the Holocaust was developed by the colonial powers. Imperialism required an exculpatory myth. It was supplied, primarily, by British theorists.</p> <p>In 1799 <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1006895/Charles-White\" title=\"\">Charles White</a> began the process of identifying Europeans as inherently superior to other peoples. By 1850 the disgraced anatomist Robert Knox had developed the theme into fully fledged racism. His book The Races of Man asserted that dark-skinned people were destined to be enslaved and then annihilated by the \"lighter races\". Dark meant almost everyone: \"What a field of extermination lies before the Saxon, Celtic and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians\" title=\"\">Sarmatian</a> races!\"</p> <p>Remarkable as it may sound, this view soon came to dominate British thought. In common with most of the political class, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade\" title=\"\">W Winwood Reade,</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/27/recognition-alfred-russel-wallace-darwin\" title=\"\">Alfred Russell Wallace</a>, <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spencer/\" title=\"\">Herbert Spencer</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Farrar\" title=\"\">Frederick Farrar,</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton\" title=\"\">Francis Galton,</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Kidd\" title=\"\">Benjamin Kidd</a> and even Charles Darwin saw the extermination of dark-skinned people as an inevitable law of nature. Some of them argued that Europeans had a duty to speed it up: both to save the integrity of the species and to put the inferior \"races\" out of their misery.</p> <p>These themes were picked up by German theorists. In 1893 Alexander Tille, drawing on British writers, claimed that \"it is the right of the stronger race to annihilate the lower\". In 1901 Friedrich Ratzel argued in Der Lebensraum that Germany had a right and duty, like Europeans in the Americas, to displace \"primitive peoples\". In Mein Kampf, Hitler explained that the German empire's eastward expansion would mirror the western and southern extension of British interests. He systematised and industrialised what imperial nations had been doing for five centuries. The scale was greater, the location different, the ideology broadly the same.</p> <p>I believe that the brutalisation of empire also made the pointless slaughter of the first world war possible. A ruling class that had shut down its feelings to the extent that it could engineer a famine in India in the 1870s in which between 12 million and 29 million people died was capable of almost anything. Empire had tested not only the long-range weaponry that would be deployed in northern France, but also the ideas.</p> <p>Nor have we wholly abandoned them. Commenting on the Kikuyu case in the Daily Mail, Max Hastings charged that the plaintiffs had come to London <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2174549/The-folly-judges-vulture-lawyers-nation-addicted-masochism.html\" title=\"\">\"to exploit our feeble-minded justice system\"</a>. Hearing them \"represents an exercise in state masochism\". I suspect that if members of Hastings' club had been treated like the Kikuyu, he would be shouting from the rooftops for redress. But Kenyans remain, as colonial logic demanded, the other, bereft of the features and feelings that establish our common humanity.</p> <p>So, in the eyes of much of the elite, do welfare recipients, \"problem families\", Muslims and asylum seekers. The process of dehumanisation, so necessary to the colonial project, turns inwards. Until this nation is prepared to recognise what happened and how it was justified, Britain, like the countries it occupied, will remain blighted by imperialism.</p> <p>\u2022 Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\">@GeorgeMonbiot</a></p> <p>\u2022 A fully referenced version of this article can be found at <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The tweet, posted a little over two years ago by someone with deep connections in the internet world, was illuminating. It said, simply:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A friend working for Facebook: 'we're like electricity.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I recalled that tweet last week when Facebook made two announcements of note. First, as everyone knows by now, it has <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/10/04/technology/facebook-billion users/index.html\">a billion users</a> \u2013 including, I suspect, nearly everyone I know. I scarcely use the social network myself, but I am constantly invited to look at items that others post there \u2013 and which are unavailable unless I log in. It is getting more and more difficult to avoid Facebook in daily life, and if Facebook gets its wish, it will be an outright necessity.</p> <p>The second announcement was relatively minor in the bigger scheme of things \u2013 Facebook's plan to <a href=\"http://newsroom.fb.com/News/Testing-Promoted-Posts-for-People-in-the-U-S-1c6.aspx\">charge a fee</a>, rumored to be $7, for users who want to place a post high in their followers' news feeds. Wall Street saw the fee as yet another way Facebook might generate revenues \u2013 an ever-stronger mandate from shareholders and the financial community in the wake of the company's fumbled IPO.</p> <p>Both moves spoke to the growing influence of this still-young company, and to its genuine potential to become what amounts to a public utility. It's not as essential as electricity yet, but that goal is not as far out of reach as you might think.</p> <p>Facebook's ever-expanding user base is easy to understand. It's the ultimate (so far) positive feedback loop \u2013 the network effect run wild. The service does offer value to its users, after all: convenience and connections. Sorry to say, most people value their privacy so little these days that they shrug off just about every new abuse of their personal data because the convenience and connections are worth it. Even people and companies that are deeply suspicious of Facebook's motives \u2013 with ample reasons for their suspicions \u2013 now feel obliged to use the service anyway, compounding Facebook's authority by posting items there and nowhere else. For people like me, who try to avoid using it, this increasingly means either signing in or not seeing things I'd like to see.</p> <p>One of Facebook's most audacious initiatives has been in the developing world. As featured in <a href=\"http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/\">an in-depth piece</a> in the Atlantic magazine's new Quartz business news site, Facebook is subsidizing mobile phone data service, making it \"free\" for users \u2013 but with a catch: for all practical purposes, Facebook then becomes their entry into the internet. The company has made no secret of its desire to become what amounts to an alternative internet, and this is a brilliant \u2013 if disturbing \u2013 way to make that a <em>fait accompli</em> in a number of places where mobile data services are much more important and ubiquitous than what happens on desktop and laptop personal computers. In such places, Facebook will be wedded to national information networks and the governments that control them. </p> <p>Electricity? Not exactly. But close enough.</p> <p>Facebook's goal is not just to connect people with each other, but also to be the ubiquitous entry point for those connections. It wants to become what amounts to a public utility. The more Facebook makes itself an essential part of our lives \u2013 or, more accurately, the more we make it so \u2013 the easier it will be for the company to start charging us for using it. Users have been the product until now; advertisers buy access to us and our personal data. But the $7 fee, which is surely aimed more at businesses than average users, is a way of ensuring that messages get seen.</p> <p>Only Facebook (and maybe Twitter) could even attempt to do this kind of thing, because it owns the user experience so completely. In its best walled-garden days, AOL couldn't have pulled this off with email, because even then, it didn't have Facebook's kind of dominance.</p> <p>Market dominance always leads to distortions. Competition is always the preferred cure. But we have other methods, too, and it's not too soon to be contemplating them. We have antitrust laws designed to curb abuses, and we regulate public utilities because we can't trust them not to abuse their positions.</p> <p>Will policy-makers awaken anytime soon? They'd better.</p>",
  "<p>In a newly painted classroom at a former infants' school in Warrington, a group of 11-year-olds is devising radio ads for their new school. \"Where's the best school for education? Is it in Orford?\" a girl trills out. \"Computer says no,\" replies one of the boys, deadpan.</p> <p>\"Is it in Padgate?\" \"Computer says no.\"</p> <p>\"Is it King's Leadership academy?\" This time they all chorus: \"Computer says <em>yes</em>! So come to the best school <em>ever</em>!\"</p> <p>If the people of Warrington were confused about their new school's location, no one could blame them. The man charged with overseeing the project, Sir Iain Hall \u2013 a former \"super-head\" in Manchester \u2013 only set foot in this formerly vacant building during the second week of July. \"It was horrendous. It was in a very poor condition inside, but we had to be able to see through that. I doubt we would have opened at all if we hadn't got this site then,\" he says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kingsleadershipacademy.com/\" title=\"\">King's Leadership academy</a> had a difficult birth. Hall and the parents' group that approached him to set up this new free school, one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/03/free-school-primary-places-labour?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">55 that opened last month</a>, spent the early part of this year embroiled in increasingly bitter negotiations with Warrington borough council over their demands for a site.</p> <p>They were not alone. Investigations by Education Guardian indicate that, of 68 free schools approved in the \"second wave\" of applications \u2013 most of which were due to open this year \u2013 eight have no permanent site. At least two have delayed opening until next year as a result, and nine have had to open in temporary accommodation while conversion or building work is done.</p> <p>Among those that have secured sites, a number have found themselves in dispute with local authorities over planning. Three want to open in disused offices, one in a job centre, one on a business park and one in a shopping centre. In more than one case, planners have deemed the proposed sites unsuitable.</p> <p>Ministers have been taking an increasingly robust approach to the problem. In Warrington, the local authority refused to hand over or share the site of Woolston community high school, which closed this summer and whose buildings had been earmarked for a special school. So a specific threat was made: \"We must reserve the right to actively pursue the use of the powers \u2026 if that is necessary to open the free school this September and thereafter to secure a permanent home for it,\" a Department for Education official wrote in an email earlier this year.</p> <p>The \"powers\" referred to are held under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/32/contents\" title=\"\">2010 Academies Act</a>. In effect, if a local authority refuses to hand over a vacant education site \u2013 usually for a peppercorn rent on a 125-year lease \u2013 the government can \"scheme\" it into its own ownership. Warrington decided to cave in and hand over a chunk of local playing field instead. DfE officials then sat in Warrington town hall \u2013 according to both free school and local councillors \u2013 searching Google Maps for a building the school could occupy until its new home was built. The lease was finally signed in the nick of time, in late July.</p> <p>Colin Froggatt, the council's leading member for children and young people's services, says it was put in an impossible position. \"We could have considered it an empty threat, but the jungle drums our officers were hearing from the Department for Education were saying they were serious in their intent,\" he says. \"This is a new area of law, and our legal advice was that, if we went to judicial review, we couldn't know if we would win or not. So the DfE can just muscle in, and it's hard luck for local authorities.\"</p> <p>At King's Leadership academy, Hall defends the government's stance. Local parents wanted mainstream education to continue on the site of Woolston school, he argues: \"The DfE didn't do anything till 500 parents signed a petition saying they wanted local education for their children. Did the DfE force the council? I don't think so. We could have co-existed on the site.\"</p> <p>As well as threatening to use their powers under the 2010 Act, ministers can also put pressure on planning authorities. Guidance sent out by Michael Gove, the education secretary, and Eric Pickles, the communities and local government secretary, says local authorities must look positively on these applications. If they refuse, it says, Pickles has the right to override their decisions. \"The answer to proposals for the development of state-funded schools should be, wherever possible, yes,\" it says.</p> <p>In most cases, the mere existence of the powers is sufficient to bring local councils to heel. In Swanage, Dorset, a group that plans to open a free school next year has found itself without a home after the owner of a former grammar school site pulled out of a deal in which he would have given some land in return for permission to build 52 new homes.</p> <p>A government team is now identifying suitable alternatives and negotiating with landowners. Steve Tooley, the lead on premises for education in Swanage, says the prospect of the DfE forcing the local authority to hand over a piece of land is unlikely but \"not completely off the radar. We are in good conversations with Dorset county council \u2013 I wouldn't say they were supporters, but they are realists. They were, and probably still are, opposed to the free school because it isn't in line with their plans for education in the area, but we hope it will be resolved amicably and quickly.\"</p> <p>The problems have been particularly acute in London, and four of the eight siteless schools are in the capital. Plans for the Newham free school collapsed, mainly owing to a lack of interest from parents, but it was also struggling to find a permanent home.</p> <p>In East Finchley, a group hoping to open in September 2013 is in delicate negotiations with Barnet council. Toby Blume, one of the founders of the Archer Academy, says there is huge demand for places in the area. But, despite support from the local authority, the school has not yet secured a site. The group wanted a new local authority school, he says, but was thwarted by lack of finance and a provision in the 2010 Act that, in effect, gives the government the power to force all new schools to become academies or free schools.</p> <p>\"The local authority are aware they have a problem, but they aren't in a position to address it \u2013 so we had to take it on ourselves,\" Blume says.</p> <p>Not all London authorities have been so keen to have a free school in their area. CET Primary Schools, set up by educational charity Constable Educational Trust, has opened two schools in Tower Hamlets and Westminster and is in the early stages of planning two more in Hackney and Brent. The process has often been fraught, according to Ronda Fogel, the group's primary scheme project director.</p> <p>In one case \u2013 she refuses to say in which area \u2013 the council turned down CET's bid for a site it owned. \"We said there was a presumption the site should be used for education; they said we couldn't have it. So we have formally maintained an interest in it \u2013 that means they can't now use it for anything else. It's very political.\"</p> <p>Natalie Evans, chief operating officer of the New Schools Network, which supports proposed free schools, says securing suitable sites is proving to be the biggest challenge. The network is pressing ministers to make further legal changes \u2013 in particular, Evans says, the system through which sites are identified and bought needs to be decentralised. At present a team from the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/armslengthbodies/b00199952/the-education-funding-agency-efa\" title=\"\">Education Funding Agency</a> does the job, but with more than 100 free schools now open or in the pipeline, she says, it is struggling to cope. She would like to see the government buying up sites and inviting schools to apply to run them.</p> <p>\"We are continuing to raise concerns with ministers \u2013 there are a number of schools that haven't been able to open because they haven't got buildings,\" Evans says. \"Clearly more needs to be done, because there are still issues, and groups are still having problems. It's a great shame, when groups have worked so hard, that they are thwarted by not being able to get premises or by the planning system.\"</p>",
  "<p>The house I grew up in was filled with the ghosts of Soviet tyranny. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-er3fkMnFYY\" title=\"Nikita Khrushchev\">Nikita Khrushchev</a> was a neighbour when my parents moved in, <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/vyacheslav-molotov/\" title=\"Vyacheslav Molotov\">Vyacheslav Molotov</a> still living there when I was born. The petrol bombs that bear Molotov's name may have granted him an unwanted immortality, but to us he was just another old man shuffling through the&#xa0;entrance.</p> <p>The building was an apartment block close to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LJuXp5IucQ\" title=\"the Kremlin\">the Kremlin</a> and reserved for the leaders of the nation. It was grand and pink and fin-de-si\u00e8cle, but even here the facilities were basic. The wires were pinned on to the wallpaper and when I was born, cooking was still done on a stove in the corner.</p> <p>On the third floor a man in a grey suit was always waiting, smoking cigarettes and watching everybody. We assumed he was KGB. Years later, when the Soviet system finally collapsed, we found out we were probably right. All our rooms, we were told, were bugged.</p> <p>My parents were young when they had me in 1980, students in their early 20s, but we lived in the heart of Moscow's power elite because my maternal grandfather was a distinguished scientist. He was the head of biology in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences\" title=\"Soviet Academy of Sciences\">Soviet Academy of Sciences</a>, which basically meant he ran biology across the entire country.</p> <p>Under communism, that got you selected alongside party bosses and generals as somebody deserving a truly prestigious home, and No&#xa0;3 Romanov Lane was nothing if not prestigious. The house was so packed with the shades of Russian and Soviet history that it takes centre stage in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/apr/10/molotovs-magic-lantern-rachel-polonsky\" title=\"Molotovs Magic Lantern\">Molotov's Magic Lantern</a> by Rachel Polonsky, one of the best books on Russia to come out in years. At its front were huge granite slabs memorialising the revered people who had lived there, the Soviet equivalent of blue plaques. The contrast between these leaders of the past and the Soviet elite of my era could not have been more striking.</p> <p>I remember the shortages and the empty shelves. My mother and I would queue for hours for the most basic goods \u2013 one Soviet skill that proved useful when we ultimately moved to Britain. It was well into the 80s before my father managed to get his hands on a car. It was a Lada, and it broke down all the time. One year, on a trip to Volgograd \u2013 or Stalingrad as it was previously known \u2013 we were left stranded when it took days for a new part to arrive.</p> <p>Like so many families in the Soviet Union, we had a strange and divided relationship with communism. My mother's grandfather was a senior official during the war, controlling food supplies and organising the evacuation of his ministry to the east when Moscow was threatened by the Nazis.</p> <p>He had power and prestige, but with that came the fear faced by any high-ranking official of the period. People he worked with were sent to the labour camps for arriving only a few minutes late for work, or for not being able to immediately provide the exact information from memory that a more senior party official demanded. One time he discovered money had been taken from a safe at work. He was so terrified of what might happen were news to get out that he used his own money to cover up the loss, paying people's wages out of his own meagre savings.</p> <p>In 1952 his superior, <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/politics-and-society/anastas-mikoyan/\" title=\"Anastas Mikoyan\">Anastas Mikoyan</a>, probably the most likable of Stalin's blood-drenched cronies, fell out of favour and was lambasted at the party congress. If there had been a purge, my great-grandfather would probably have found himself on a death list. To his dying day he was certain that only <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-EwVVm89og\" title=\"Stalins death\">Stalin's death</a> five months later saved him, and he remained too terrified to talk about the period: my father would try to ask questions and he would wave him away, pointing to the corners of the room in case those listening heard and came to take his family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398421800\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349710237241/evgeny-lebedev---stalin-008.jpg\" alt=\"evgeny lebedev - stalin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lebedev's great-grandfather remained convinced that only the death of Stalin in 1953 saved his life</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite this, both my grandmothers were strongly in favour of communism. They still are. I can see why the promise of \"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need\" appeals, but what surprises me is how even now they believe in Stalin. Both talk with pride about how they wept at the news of his death. It is not that they do not know what happened under his rule: the famine, the camps, the fear. But they maintain Stalin did not know what was going on. Mistakes were made and things got out of hand, but the Great Leader was not to blame.</p> <p>This is not an uncommon view in Russia, but I find it difficult to understand how two such worldly wise people can cling to such a belief. Maybe it is simply a desire for the stability and security communism promisedBoth were certainly vocal during my childhood that the only alternative was anarchy.</p> <p>By the time I was born, my father, Alexander, no longer believed in communism. Around our apartment were hidden the forbidden books of <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1970/solzhenitsyn-autobio.html\" title=\"Alexander Solzhenitsyn\">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a>. He saw the state the country was in and quite rightly blamed the system. Yet these doubts did not stop him from starting work in the foreign intelligence service after he graduated, even though it was a decision that many in our family disapproved of. He immediately established a reputation as one of the sharpest brains in his cadre, with a prodigious memory and eye for detail.</p> <p>His father had never joined the Communist party as he disapproved of the perks and special access to food it provided to its members. His career as a brilliant optical engineer stalled as a result. Even my maternal grandfather disapproved, despite his work for the Soviet state. He saw foreign intelligence as the descendant of the monstrous organ of internal repression he had so feared in his youth, although by the 1980s foreign and domestic intelligence were operationally separate.</p> <p>Nevertheless, for a young and ambitious man like my father, the service was an attractive proposition. He saw it as an opportunity to travel, to progress, and even to argue for change from within.</p> <p>As a child, I did not know what his real job was. The official story was that he was a diplomat and I had no reason to doubt it. I only discovered the truth when I was 11 and found some medals in a drawer, awarded for service to his country. I was sworn to secrecy, but carried the secret with pride. I was still a boy and the idea was exciting; glamorous, even. In a land of grey bureaucrats, my father was someone special.</p> <p>My first school was an elite kindergarten in Moscow. Soviet child-rearing was not like the western-liberal style: you were ordered to do gymnastics, to sleep in the afternoon, to eat everything they put in front of you, however unpalatable it might have been. Once I fell over and burst my nose open. I knew it was a bad idea to ask the nursery staff for help \u2013 there would be little sympathy there \u2013 so I ran off into the forest and hid.</p> <p>My first holiday was to the radioactive wasteland of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbCcutzXzYg\" title=\"Chernobyl\">Chernobyl</a>. In 1989, three years after the meltdown, my grandfather was researching how <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=101OEaksU0s\" title=\"radiation\">radiation</a> had affected animal life in the area, and he took me along. I remember abandoned vehicles everywhere, and these gigantic distended mushrooms. We shot a duck on a lake and checked it with a Geiger counter. The readings were normal so we built a fire, cooked and ate it.</p> <p>My father was posted to the London embassy when I was eight. At 29 he was incredibly young to get such a prestigious job, although the reality of his daily work was less glamorous than I imagined. He was mostly stuck in an office reading the newspapers, occasionally meeting people, and then writing home about what was going on.</p> <p>Arriving in Britain was a shock. Everything was so colourful: the way people dressed, the cars, the range of goods in the shops. With the freedom to speak, freedom to purchase and freedom to travel it seemed like another planet and I immediately loved it. In fact, I loved everything about Britain, even the weather. It is a beautiful mixture \u2013 and when the sun comes out, British people really appreciate it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398421801\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349709516854/evgeny-lebedev-tanks-in-r-008.jpg\" alt=\"evgeny lebedev tanks in red square\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanks in Red Square during the abortive anti-Gorbachev coup of 1991.

I can remember taking our Siberian husky for a walk when tanks rolled down the street past our apartment and parked by the Kremlin. Then, one night shortly afterwards, we were returning from seeing my paternal grandmother when a curfew was imposed. We were on the Moscow metro and people began to be ushered out and the stations closed. When we reached street level there were units of soldiers patrolling the streets with machine guns. This was the night of the attempted coup against <a href=\"http://www.history.com/topics/perestroika-and-glasnost\" title=\"Mikhail Gorbachev\">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, when the old guard made one last ditch attempt to reverse his reforms.</p> <p>My grandmother was very much in favour of the coup. She wanted to save the Soviet Union at any cost. Her husband, my grandfather, said that if they started bashing communists, our house would be the first to be attacked because it was full of Soviet officials, military commanders and party leaders. One night people came and daubed swastikas by the entrance and from then on I found myself looking over my shoulder as I approached the front door.</p> <p>My parents, however, were against the coup. They went to protests at the White House, where the Supreme Soviet met, when Muscovites gathered to make clear there could be no going back. Stuck to the walls of the metro stations were <a href=\"http://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/leaders/boris-yeltsin/\" title=\"Boris Yeltsin\">Boris Yeltsin</a> \"Wanted\" posters. These provoked a fierce argument back at our apartment between my father and maternal grandmother. He said Yeltsin was a patriot; she thought him a criminal threatening the state she had served her whole life.</p> <p>We had to return to London before the crisis was over and it was a year before we visited again. By then the USSR had dissolved and even to a child it was clear how much things had changed. Moscow was not the same city; the recent past was being removed from sight. Street names had changed. Landmarks vanished. Historic sites were being demolished and replaced by monstrous new buildings. It is a very Russian propensity, the desire to wipe the past clean and start from scratch. They did it in 1917; they did it again, to a lesser degree, in 1991. Everything people knew was turned upside down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398421802\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349710650923/evgeny-lebedev-end-of-cou-008.jpg\" alt=\"evgeny lebedev end of coup\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muscovites in Red Square celebrate the failure of the  hardline communist coup in 1991, signalling the dawn of a strange and wild new Russia. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Afp/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Russia had become a wild place. You heard about death everywhere. People were being stripped at gunpoint just for their clothes. My grandfather started carrying a second world war pistol inside his jacket. At weekends we went to the country and he taught me how to use it, just in case.</p> <p>Before, people had thin wooden doors, and apartment blocks were left open. Now giant iron doors appeared everywhere. Bullet-proof. Double-skinned. Steel. And people were behaving so strangely. Everywhere that was not locked up started to literally fill up with shit. People used to just shit and piss in every available space. You would even see it in lifts, or in apartment lobbies that had been left unlocked.</p> <p>I can imagine why the East Germans or Czechs would have felt overjoyed at the collapse of communism, but in Russia it was different. It had been a superpower and Russians are proud people. They were proud to be living in a country that could stand up to America, which others were scared of. Then suddenly, it just fell apart. My maternal grandmother made no secret of the fact that she believed herself totally vindicated, and that all her most dire predictions had come to pass.</p> <p>My father resigned from government service and started launching business enterprises. He tried everything. He was hungry to try all the things he had not been allowed to do under communism \u2013 to buy and sell. He loved the process. He wanted to take all the great things he has seen in the west and try them in Russia. I remember he started selling shoes; one time the consignment went wrong and we had thousands and thousands of left shoes. But he was doing well. Soon he had a new car, a driver and security. He knew how dangerous it was. In Moscow in the 1990s, people were settling business deals not by doing a better job than their competitors, but by killing them. It would be as if Tesco, instead of competing on price or service, just had everyone in Sainsbury's arrested, or shot.</p> <p>It was 1997 when I first felt the chaos intrude into my own family. I had asked to go to boarding school in Britain but I came back in the holidays and that was when I realised we were now in danger too, for my father was called in for questioning by the police. He knew exactly what had happened. His business rivals had bribed senior officials to go after him and shut him down. It happened, he told me, all the time. That did not stop the police arriving shortly afterwards at my grandfather's apartment. They tore it apart as my mother and I stood there, watching.</p> <p>That was only the start. Sometime later, behind my father's chair at work, we found a bullet in the wall. It had been fired from an apartment across the street. Another time, we received a tip-off of an assassination attempt. A search was conducted of the surrounding buildings and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher found by a nearby window.</p> <p>My father refused to leave. He had seen free countries and refused to accept that the same was not achievable in Russia. He started using his money to fund a free press \u2013 especially Novaya Gazeta, the freest and bravest newspaper in Russia, where journalists are murdered with horrifying frequency, simply for telling the truth. All this time the police were harassing us, endlessly questioning my&#xa0;father.</p> <p>Even now my father refuses to back down, without concern for the personal or professional cost, when he sees injustice, corruption and other abuses. I respect him for that. He is a patriot and that is why he believes his country deserves to be better than it is.</p> <p>I am also a patriot. Russia is the land of my birth and I am proud of it. I wish to do all I can to help it take its rightful place as one of the world's leading nations, not only economically or militarily, but culturally and politically too. Nevertheless I now live primarily in Britain and my British side helps put into perspective the challenges it now faces. Living in a free, liberal and open country with due process and the rule of law throws the present injustices that exist in Russia into sharp relief.</p> <p>As for my Russian side, the side that grew up in a bugged apartment a stone's throw from the Kremlin, that shows me how lightly British freedoms are taken by the people of this country. It sets off alarm bells when I see the state impede civil liberties, or when technological advances and unethical behaviour threaten our privacy in ways far more sophisticated than the KGB could ever have conceived.</p> <p>It is because of this sense of how fragile these freedoms are that I am involved in the Independent, the Evening Standard and the Journalism Foundation, which supports and promotes free and independent journalism throughout the world. When you argue for freedom in Britain today, it can sound obvious, even banal. But I grew up in one of the least free places in the world at a time when it ruled a quarter of the globe. Freedom is never banal to me. That is why I hope these organisations can help protect freedoms in one of my countries \u2013 and help promote a stronger, healthier and more outward-facing society in the other. I feel optimistic.</p> <p>\u2022 Evgeny Lebedev is the owner of the London Evening Standard and The Independent newspaper titles, and editor-in-chief of independentvoices.com</p>",
  "<p>Pregnant women and children have been warned against eating game such as pheasant, deer and grouse killed with lead shot because it could pose a serious risk to their health.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/oct/lead-shot#.UHMc982XPdw\" title=\"\">official statement released on Monday</a>, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that everyone who ate lead-shot game regularly should cut down on it because it was potentially toxic.</p> <p>Dr Alison Gleadle, the agency's director of food safety, said that advice was \"especially important\" for pregnant women, toddlers, children and women trying for a baby as exposure \"can harm the developing brain and nervous system\".</p> <p>The FSA said people who regularly ate small wild game birds shot with lead, such as grouse, pheasant, duck and partridge, faced significant exposure risks if they ate more than 100g (3.5oz) a week. Cooking those game birds in acidic liquids such as wine, vinegar or tomato juice made lead dissolve, and easier for humans to absorb.</p> <p>Much larger animals, such as deer, would have lower concentrations of lead. The agency said eating one 120g portion a week was \"less of a concern for adults\". Most game sold in supermarkets was safe to eat, it stressed, as it was more likely to have been farmed and safely killed.</p> <p>The release of the FSA's advice follows a row last week after its expected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/warning-health-risk-eating-game-lead\" title=\"\">publication last Wednesday was delayed</a> following disputes in its expert advising panel, the lead ammunition group, over the terms and extent of the warning.</p> <p>The Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) has been at the forefront of campaigns against lead shot. Its analysis showed lead shot was to blame for poisoning thousands of waterbirds.</p> <p>It alleges that up to 70% of duck in the UK has been shot using lead, in breach of a ban in 1999, and has published reports on the growing amount of scientific and medical evidence about the risk of eating lead-shot game.</p> <p>The British Association of Conservation and Shooting (BASC), whose director, John Swift, chaired the lead ammunition panel, had insisted that the agency publish a risk assessment with its formal warning.</p> <p>Christopher Graffius, head of communications for the BASC, said the risks of eating lead-shot game \"should not be exaggerated\" and insisted it posed a minimal risk to consumers. He said that \"pound for pound\", chocolate had more lead in it than game.</p> <p>\"There is lead in all foodstuffs and we should see the purported risk of lead in game meat in a sensible perspective,\" Graffius said. \"There is no evidence of harm to those of us who eat game less than once every week. Compared with other meats wild game is low in fats and entirely natural, representing a healthy option to intensively reared products.\"</p> <p>Dr Deborah Pain, director of conservation at the WWT and a member of the lead ammunition panel, said she hoped the FSA's advice would accelerate action against the use of all lead shot.</p> <p>\"Lead is toxic and concerns for human health add to the already strong argument for replacing lead with non-toxic shot, which has long been available, for all shooting. We were pleased to see that the FSA had published their human health advice,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>BAE Systems and EADS are fighting to keep their proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger on track amid mounting shareholder opposition and wrangling between the British, German and French governments over the plan.</p> <p>Invesco Perpetual, BAE's biggest shareholder with 13.3% of the company, took the unusual step of going public with its concerns on Monday, before Wednesday's UK Takeover Panel deadline for both groups to thrash out an agreement.</p> <p>Invesco said it could not see the rationale for the merger between Britain's biggest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus. \"Other than diversification \u2013 which investors can achieve for themselves more cheaply and simply \u2013 Invesco does not understand the strategic logic for the proposed combination,\" the fund manager said.</p> <p>The intervention, which echoes concerns raised by the EADS shareholder Lagard\u00e8re and some Conservative MPs, makes it likely that there will be an extension to Wednesday's deadline.</p> <p>In a point-by-point critique, Invesco added that the deal would \"materially jeopardise\" BAE's position in the US defence market; the proposed holding of stakes by the French and German governments would result in a business driven by politics and not by shareholder value; and there would be lower dividends for BAE shareholders in the future.</p> <p>\"Invesco believes BAE is a strong business with distinctive positions in the global defence market (especially in the US and UK) and good standalone prospects. We look forward to discussions with the board of BAE and other BAE shareholders in the coming days,\" it said.</p> <p>Invesco's damning analysis of the deal struck a chord with other City institutions, which felt that BAE has yet to effectively communicate the reasons for the tie-up, putting the company's chief executive, Ian King, under pressure to explain the strategy behind the transaction.</p> <p>His hands are tied until the offer documents are published, which will also provide more detail about how the companies agreed to a valuation that would see EADS shareholders emerge with 60% of the business compared with BAE's 40%. There has been grumbling from both shareholder registers over the split.</p> <p>\"There's never been a clear articulation of this concept,\" one BAE investor said. \"The problems are beginning to look insurmountable.\" Another said: \"The odds are stacked against it because there are so many challenges.\"</p> <p>Invesco's outburst came as representatives of the UK, French and German governments held further discussions in a bid to break an impasse over the structure of the new company. One BAE investor, remarking on Invesco's \"surprising\" statement, said: \"The deal already seems to be struggling, without shareholders needing to get involved.\"</p> <p>The UK can block the deal under the terms of its golden share in BAE, while the French and German governments control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings. Talks to resolve the future of the governmental interests in BAE and EADS are running parallel to the corporate process, which suffered a serious stumble with the Invesco intervention.</p> <p>It is not just national security at stake, but tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in each country. In the UK alone, BAE and EADS employ more than 50,000 people.</p> <p>Under the ideal scenario for the UK government, the French and German states would emerge with stakes of 9% each in the merged business. The French media conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re \u2013 a 7.5% shareholder in EADS and another critic of the deal \u2013 would have to sell down its stake in order to ensure that the French state's stake does not creep into double figures. This is an assurance that is being sought by the UK government as well as Berlin. The German interest in EADS is represented by Daimler, the car manufacturer, which would transfer some of its stake to the state-owned KfW in a process that would help create the 9% German shareholding.</p> <p>A source with knowledge of the government talks said they were on a knife-edge. They were pushed closer to the precipice on Friday when German officials used a conference call with their French and UK counterparts to ask for guarantees on the size of the French shareholding and, then, that the headquarters of the combined company would be in Munich. The latter demand shocked all parties, including BAE and EADS, because it was thought the business would be based at the Airbus HQ in Toulouse, with Farnborough in Hampshire as the head office of the defence business. Pushing for Munich, said one source, could collapse the deal.</p> <p>On Monday, the British defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said he wanted France and Germany's interests represented by single-digit stakes. He added: \"We believe for this to work this company has to be allowed to operate as a commercial company, and not as a branch of the French or German government, and that means a reduction in the stakes held by the French and German governments.</p> <p>\"We have made our position clear, so let us see what happens,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking after the latest tripartite discussions on Monday, a UK government source said: \"The talks are continuing.\"</p> <p>In France, some commentary has been critical of the UK's concerns. Last night, Le Monde said the talks were entering a critical period. It said: \"Does the United Kingdom want a written engagement from France or simple assurances that the two countries will not use their shares to influence the decisions of the new company? Nothing is clear cut. London has in any case confirmed, through Hammond, that it will block the deal if France and Germany try to keep their influence over the running of the new group.\"</p> <p>German economic commentators described the merger talks as close to collapse, with political stalemate being cited as the biggest barrier. Germany is fearful of being marginalised because the French and British governments have apparently decided on the terms of a tie-up, sources close to the government said. The subsequent need to redress a perceived imbalance led to the Munich demand.</p> <p>Analysts added that if the merger did go ahead, the biggest losers could end up being the employees of EADS. Discussions between EADS and IG Metall, Germany's top metal workers' union, broke down at the end of last week over fears that job security is not guaranteed in the event of a merger. J\u00fcrgen Kerner, a member of IG's executive board, said workers felt let down at the lack of solidarity shown to them by the company's management.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed that no actions have followed the fancy promises of EADS's executive board,\" he said. He added a merger would only work if EADS's 50,000 employees in Germany were given job guarantees.</p> <p>However, it is understood that Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, has been using US government concerns over the transaction, and the unease on the Tory backbenches about job security, to leverage a better deal for Britain. The formidable obstacle of Washington is next and it is one that is being eyed nervously by BAE shareholders. If a deal is agreed between European governments, the transaction moves across the Atlantic to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a state body chaired by the US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. Because the Pentagon is BAE's biggest single customer, a merger with another foreign entity requires the blessing of CFIUS. Clay Lowery, a former US treasury official who oversaw the CFIUS process under George W Bush, said he expected the deal to go through, but scrutiny is likely to last longer than 75 days \u2013 the minimum 30-day inquiry plus a 45-day extension. \"I believe if this transaction comes together it will go through. But some of the national security mitigation steps could be tougher than they are currently for BAE. And it could be a longer negotiation than 75 days,\" said Lowery.</p> <p>BAE's US interests, as well as those of EADS, are covered by special security arrangements that ringfence the operation of Pentagon contracts from non-US interference. For instance, the board of BAE's US subsidiary, BAE Systems Inc, must be dominated by US nationals and the unit cannot operate outside the US without the Pentagon's blessing. Lowery added CFIUS could require that the combined BAE and EADS US business becomes a \"proxy\" company sealed off from its owner, with the parent receiving the profits and nothing else. This was one scenario Invesco was alluding to when it warned that the deal could \"heavily impair\" BAE's commercial prospects \u2013 \"especially in the US\".</p> <p>The Financial Times reported that at least six of the biggest 20 BAE shareholders are warning that they support Invesco.</p> <p>Lowery added: \"he focus at BAE and EADS has got to be what's going on in France, Germany, Spain and the UK, as well, of course, as with their shareholders and employees. But at some point they will have to turn to the US and the CFIUS process.\" If BAE and EADS overcome Monday's ructions and bring France, Germany and the UK together, more difficulties certainly lie ahead.</p>",

Here are a few thoughts:</p> <p>\u2022 More people will turn up to David Cameron's speech on Wednesday - partly because it will be held in a much bigger hall. But the reception and atmosphere tonight was less like a political speech and more like some form of live entertainment: Boris was cheered and applauded to the rafters, and the scenes when he arrived in the middle of the crowd and made his way to the stage, with heads turning and people leaping up from their seats, bordered on megalomania. All this for a politician. Cameron's reception will be nothing like that. I think Boris showed tonight beyond doubt that in terms of his public image he is one of a kind, and is gathering strength. His conference speech last year was well-attended and well-received, but the fuss and buzz was nothing like this. Unbelievably, he is scheduled to speak again in the main hall tomorrow morning. The conference organisers could not have planned this better to build momentum for the mayor at the expense of Cameron.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Boris was conspicuously loyal, praising Cameron and the coalition and attacking Labour and Eds Miliband and Balls. But wasn't it strange to say that \"while I am mayor\" Labour could get back into power - something surely designed to conjure up the image of himself as the leading anti-Labour force? And his firm opposition to a third runway at Heathrow seemed to be aimed squarely at the coalition: \"Move off that idea. It's not going to happen. We need a better solution.\" The supposed point of this rally, his passing on of advice on how to beat Labour, was skipped over speedily - perhaps because his own experience in London is almost completely irrelevant to the national Tory party's attempt to win in 2015.</p> <p>\u2022 He used all his usual rhetorical tricks: he was funny, irreverent, self-deprecating, multilingual, anti-French, policy-light, and a political clothes-stealer, even at one point making a slight dig at Margaret Thatcher, when he said: \"The 103 bodies that can dig up the roads - basically under Thatcherite legislation put down when very few private utilities existed \u2026 We have finally got to grips with the consequences of that legislation.\" To put it mildly, even this kind of timid criticism of Thatcher is unheard of here. But the crowd showed no objection, something as impressive and unexpected in its way as Boris's achievement in getting the London Olympic parade to cheer the name G4S.</p> <p>\u2022 I've learned one other thing too.

The CBI said that, although it would be attractive to some workers, it was \"a niche idea and not relevant to all businesses\". The British Chambers of Commerce said it was \"unlikely to be a game-changer\". <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/08/osbornes-shares-rights-scheme-unions\">Trade unions have attacked the plans strongly.</a> And here's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/08/employee-shares-for-rights-what-proposals-mean\">a Guardian Q&amp;A about what they mean.</a></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/08/osborne-housing-benefit-plans-reaction\">\u2022 Charities have said that families with children are likely to be hit hardest by the Conservatives' plans to cut housing benefit for the under-25s.</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/civil-service-union-work-brought-under-control\">Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, has told the conference that curbs on union activity in the civil service will save the taxpayer more than \u00a315m</a>.</strong> There were 250 people paid full time as civil servants and allowed to spend all their time on union work, Maude said. This cost the taxpayer more than \u00a330m a year. Maude said that his curbs on this would halve the cost of \"facility time\" to the taxpayer.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, has announced that councils will be given new powers to stop travellers setting up illegal camps.</strong> (See 3.58pm.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Lib Dem councillors have strongly attacked the government's decision to fund a council tax freeze.</strong> Yesterday the Conservative-led Local Government Association expressed reservations about the plan.

She said that in her seat she got about 20,000 votes, Labour 18,000 and the Lib Dems 8,000. \"If the Lib Dem vote collapses and a large amount goes to Labour, I would lose my seat.\" Thirty-three of the 40 are in a similar situation. \"We need to be very, very nervous about a Lib Dem collapse,\" she said. \"By all means stick to hugging a hoodie, but please hug the Lib Dems too.\"</p> <p>Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Tory MP, disagreed with Rudd's approach. Before previous elections, \"that kind of talk, meetings like this, seemed awfully interesting \u2026 but when the election actually came it was judged by history to have been decided by quite different factors.\" The party the Tory party most had to fear was the Tory party itself, he said. The public understood the need for austerity \"but what people won't forgive is if the Conservative party descends into one of its periods of civil war \u2026 Stop obsessing about Ukip, stop obsessing about the Lib Dems, concentrate on unity. That's the only way to win.\"</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, said he agreed with Parris, and thanked him for writing a column saying he couldn't remember why he had once called for Hunt to resign. \"It cheered me up immensely!\" said Hunt. On election day the voters would be asking themselves not \"do I like the feel of Ed Miliband or is David Cameron a toff\" but \"did this group of people do fundamentally important things that other governments have ducked? So what we have to do is make absolutely sure that what we do does work.\"</p> <p>He <a href=\"http://main.wgbh.org/imax/shackleton/sirernest.html\">quoted the explorer Ernest Shackleton</a> to stiffen Tory spines: \"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.\"</p> <p>The enemy was Labour, Hunt said, but the Tories would be helped by Ed Miliband's taking his party \"decisively to the left\".</p> <p>The panel was asked if the failure of the planned boundary changes was also a big problem for the Tories. Hunt said: \"It's clearly a setback. It's a massive unfairness in the system. It will make the mountain harder to climb.\"</p> <p>When the panel were asked if it would be a good idea to reduce the voting age, one of the delegates interrupted to yell: \"No!

[Osborne has] ruled out a higher rate of income tax ... he's ruled out this big extra increase in housing taxation. What does that leave? It sort of depends on what you mean by the rich.</p> <p>You might mean by the rich that top 1% who pay 50p tax at the moment. If he's not going to do anything with that tax rate then beyond avoidance and evasion measures, there is not a lot you can do unless you're going to do something with wealth or housing.</p> <p>But if by rich you mean the four million or so of us who pay the 40p, then clearly you can do a lot more, including increasing that, increasing national insurance contributions, increasing other bits of council tax.</p> <p>[Osborne] didn't define what he meant by rich which makes it very easy for everyone to think I'm not rich, someone else is going to pay.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Pearce</strong>, the director of the&#xa0;Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said the Treasury could over time achieve huge savings by raising benefits in line with earnings rather than inflation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Earnings growth has been weak this year, and using the relevant three-month average figure to July 2012 would mean benefits are uprated by 1.5%, rather than the 2.5% expected level of CPI.</p> <p>This might not look like much, but it will be applied to a baseline of some \u00a350bn of spending, depending on how wide the chancellor casts his net, and the new baseline will then be lower for the uprating in subsequent years - such that, by 2016/17, the government will be making quite large benefit savings.</p> <p>This kind of fiscal drag for the poor is a favourite Treasury manoeuvre to cut social security spending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:59:48.592Z\">at 4.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072ddc4c0e361310bc6c9e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T14:05:56.899Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some more reaction to the George Osborne speech.</p> <p>From <strong>Craig Bennett</strong>, Friends of the Earth policy and campaigns director:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Generous shale gas tax breaks show the chancellor clearly isn\u2019t listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Slashing people's employment rights under the guise of ownership schemes won't create jobs and it won't create growth.</p> <p>His attempts to dupe the electorate that he knows what he is doing have been rumbled. George Osborne has as much knowledge about economics as a stick of rhubarb.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth,</strong> director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne was right to acknowledge that the country must face up to the challenge of global competitiveness through enterprise, effort, aspiration and a real sense of urgency. We face a choice of becoming a Ruritanian museum or a dynamic and prosperous economy, which could be uncomfortable for some in the Conservative party.</p> <p>The chancellor's announcement of a new form of business ownership, with individuals swapping greater employment flexibility for an equity stake in the company, could be a useful option for some new and fast-growing businesses. It is an innovative and imaginative proposal that deserves to be tried out, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, general secretary of Unite:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne's repetition of 'we are all in this together' is an insult to millions of families struggling to make ends meet and meaningless to the one in seven children who regularly go without a hot meal. His cuts will turn decent people into desperate people.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Helen Barnard</strong>, programme manager for poverty at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up masterplan for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Campbell Robb</strong>, chief executive of Shelter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most under-25s who can live with their parents already do so. Being under 25 is being used as shorthand for people who don\u2019t have responsibilities or adult commitments, whereas in reality more than half of young people who claim housing benefit already have a family of their own. Others have left home to get married, move for job opportunities, or escape serious problems in their family home.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Sarah Jackson</strong>, chief executive of Working Families, a work-life balance charity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employers beware. Offering owner employee contracts - where employees effectively sell their employment rights for shares - is unlikely to deliver the highly motivated, engaged workforce you need.</p> <p>Few men or women with family responsibilities would want such a contract and we would advise callers to our free legal helpline to think long and hard before accepting such a one-way deal. Shares can go down as well as up. You could end up with no job security or employment rights and worthless shares.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Fiona Weir,</strong> chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single parents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This announcement [the proposed welfare cuts] comes at a time when families are already struggling, and risks plunging even more children into poverty. It\u2019s vital that we separate fact from fiction. The vast majority of people who receive government support do so because they can\u2019t earn enough to support their families, or even find a job in the first place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T16:05:57.920Z\">at 5.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072d5db58f91d7bbadac0b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:32:11.866Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong> has been talking about the welfare cuts being floated by George Osborne.

(<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/sep/25/liberaldemocrats-clegg-cameron-miliband-interactive\">You can also see that in this graphic of Guardian/ICM polls since the election</a>.)</p> <p>\"The budget was the worst received budget since the late 1990s,\" said Ipsos Mori's Gideon Skinner. \"Across all ages, across all social classes, across men and women, the Conservative vote has fallen,\" he said. \"They have gone to the left, to the right. You've lost votes to Ukip, but the same number [5%] to Labour. It's not gone just to one wing or one demographic group. The fall is just as much among urban voters as it is among rural.\"</p> <p>\"David Cameron's ratings are falling as well,\" he added. Showing graphs comparing the popularity of incoming prime ministers, he said: \"Cameron's ratings are not a million miles away from where Gordon Brown's were at the same time.\"</p> <p>Ed Miliband, meanwhile, \"has at least steadied the fall\" in his ratings - but all these figures were compiled before the conference speech Miliband made last week that has been widely hailed as an important move towards improving his image.</p> <p>Skinner said of the 2012 budget: \"The rhetoric, the story of 'we're all in it together', it just doesn't resonate with people.\"</p> <p>One chink of light for the Conservatives was that the economy remained the public's number one concern. \"It's all about the economy, the economy, the economy and jobs,\" Skinner said, and the Tories still have a lead over Labour on that issue - albeit only one of 30-25.</p> <p>Fraser Nelson of the Spectator said the budget had been so disastrous for the government not because it was harsh, \"but because it was so comically, shambolically delivered. People just got the general sense that the government doesn't know what it's doing.\"</p> <p>Skinner mentioned in passing that Europe remained low on the public's list of concerns, but Rory Stewart, the Penrith and the Border MP with a colourful background in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed scepticism about this, given that Cameron's EU \"veto\" in December 2011 had bumped up his personal ratings.</p> <p>\"Let's just focus on Europe for a second,\" he said (in truth, it's never far from the surface here), going on to say that there was a strong argument for an EU referendum given that \"since the 1970s people have not become comfortable with Europe and the politicians have not given people a chance to express that, and this is fundamentally unjust\". He conceded though that this didn't really matter much if people didn't feel strongly about this \"crisis of legitimacy\", as the polls suggest.</p> <p>My impression was that he didn't quite believe the polls on this point, however, and Nelson backed him on this, saying: \"They do [care about Europe]. They care about it a lot.\"</p> <p>Skinner said of Cameron's anti-EU poll boost: \"It was a one-off. It lasted for two months.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:31:10.491Z\">at 4.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072d322c0e361310bc6c9dc\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:20:35.742Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">George Osborne's speech - summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne said that firms will be allowed to suspend employee rights for new workers provided they offer them shares in the company.</strong></p> <p>The employee-owner scheme, as it is being called by the Treasury, would particularly appeal to small and medium-sized companies expanding fast, he said (see 12.47pm). Announcing the scheme<a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\"> in his speech, </a>he took inspiration from Marx.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a voluntary three-way deal.</p> <p>You the company: give your employees shares in the business.</p> <p>You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership.</p> <p>And what will the government do?</p> <p>We'll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares ...<br>&#xa0;<br>Owners, workers and the taxman, all in it together.</p> <p>Workers of the world unite.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that he was consulting on tax cuts for shale gas.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An enterprise strategy means investing in renewable energy, and opening up the newly discovered shale gas reserves beneath our land.</p> <p>We are today consulting on a generous new tax regime for shale so that Britain is not left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Tories were still committed to the \"we're all in this together\" philosophy that they proclaimed before the general election. </strong></p> <p>The Tories have been reluctant to use this slogan recently (partly because Rebekah Wade used the phrase to describe the party's links with News International, and partly because the cut in the top rate of tax and other moves have made it less plausible). Ed Miliband's decision to rebrand Labour as a one-nation party was also a deliberate attempt to occupy this ground. But Osborne said the sentiment still applied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the eve of the election, I told this conference: we're all in this together.</p> <p>It was more than a slogan. It spoke of our values and of our intent ...</p> <p>Three years later, my message remains the same:</p> <p>We're not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against another, if we divide, denounce and demonise.</p> <p>We need an effort from each and every one.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another passage in the speech he insisted that the Conservatives were the real one-nation party, although he defined one-nation almost entirely in terms of the group also being defined as \"strivers\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We modern Conservatives represent all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out.</p> <p>Whether it's the owner of the corner shop staying open until midnight to support their family.</p> <p>Or the teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the after-school club.</p> <p>Or the commuter who leaves home before the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, because they want a better life for them.</p> <p>Or the pensioner, who has saved all their life, and doesn't want to spend it all as they want to pass something on to their children.</p> <p>Or the entrepreneur who doesn't cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story.</p> <p>They are all part of one nation, one nation working together to get on.</p> <p>That is the nation we represent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, as the government tried to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next spending round, he wanted 80% of the money to come from spending cuts rather than tax rises (as happened in the last round of spending cuts).</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he and Iain Duncan Smith had agreed to reduce welfare spending by \u00a310bn by 2015 and he identified three areas where there would be cuts: indexing benefits in line with inflation; housing benefit for the young; benefits for families with several children.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For how can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work?</p> <p>How can we justify giving flats to young people who have never worked, when working people twice their age are still living with their parents because they can't afford their first home?</p> <p>How can we justify a system where people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child, whilst those who are out of work don't?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had increased taxes overall on the very richest in every budget he had introduced.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that when it came to getting the wealthy to pay more, his priority would be dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance.</strong></p> <p>He would continue to insist on those with \"the broadest shoulders\" paying the most, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to the richest, the first place I will look is to those who are still not paying the taxes we expect them to pay today.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was unrealistic to cut the size of the public sector any faster than it is already being cut.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're reducing the size of government, from almost 50% of our national income to 40%, in just five years.</p> <p>I just don't think it's realistic to cut a great deal faster than that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government would not abandon its economic strategy.</strong></p> <p>Edward Heath did in 1972, and the result was \"more inflation, more strikes and the three day week\".

This is why business has supported his deficit plans for the last two and a half years, and still does. But this has to go hand in hand with dynamic action for growth.</p> <p>The bulk of the deficit reduction must come through reduced government spending, including tackling benefits, but the focus has to be on helping people back into work. None of us wants to make the lives of the less well-off even more difficult.</p> <p>To achieve this, we need to deliver better public services at lower cost and, in my view, the government needs to be bolder in bringing in charities and companies with innovative ways of serving the public.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what he said about the employee-owner scheme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In some of Britain's cutting-edge entrepreneurial companies, the option of share ownership may be attractive to workers, rather than some of their employment rights.

Our members know what it's like to take tough decisions in order to succeed, and he is right to stick to that path.</p> <p>The IoD applauds his innovative proposal on employee ownership, which could make a real difference to jobs and shareholding. This scheme has the potential to reduce the employment law burden on companies and make employees better off at the same time. The key to the success of the idea will be in encouraging employers and workers to make use of it.</p> <p>The chancellor is also right to hail the potential of shale gas.

Removing housing benefit from under 25s will make it even more difficult for hard pressed young people to find employment and move on. It is not the answer. Neither is punishing children because a parent is out of work. There is already a welfare cap coming in which places limitations on benefits for large families.

Priti Patel (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\">one of the rising stars of the Tory right wing</a>), said that if the European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso \"wants to press ahead with a treaty change before 2015 that is going to be a real wake-up call for our prime minister and our government\".</p> <p>She added: \"We cannot sit back and watch some shoddy deal \u2026 without giving the British public a say.\" This was a \"tremendous opportunity for a British prime minister to rebalance our relationship and put Britain first\".</p> <p>Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and popular anti-EU lightning rod, also called for a referendum. He pointed out that in May the combined GDP of the Commonwealth overtook that of the eurozone, and lamented: \"We are obliged to restrict trade with the growing bits of the world in the way that we didn't do in the 1930s.\" Meanwhile, \"Europe is now spiralling down as it mulishly does all the things that have caused it to be in its present predicament.\"</p> <p>The ubiquitous ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie warned that it would be more difficult to win an EU referendum than many anti-Brussels campaigners thought. \"The polls are not as wide in our support as some of us would like to believe. From the AV referendum we know that the British people tend to prefer the status quo unless there is a very good reason to change, and I think that would be the case with either renegotiation or leaving.\"</p> <p>All that was before the anti-EU side had to grapple with the opposition of business and the media and before the EU could make \"cosmetic\" changes to try to head off a UK exit.</p> <p>He added: \"Are we organised for the moment if David Cameron finally - or some other person - gives it to us? Probably at the moment the answer to that question is no.\"</p> <p>Hannan and Patel agreed with all that, but Patrick O'Flynn of the Daily Express, also on the panel, demurred, saying: \"There is no status quo.

Labour, or his Tory critics, would be foolish to underestimate him. Gordon Brown made that mistake when he became Prime Minister, regarding his opponent as a chinless wonder and privileged weakling. In October 2007, in the week of the infamous election that never was, Mr Cameron bounced back with another powerful peroration: \u201cCall that election. We will fight. Britain will win.\u201d</p> <p>But the reminder of that speech, made five years ago last week, illustrates Mr Cameron\u2019s dilemma. By now his party is used to these last-minute rescue jobs.

Ed Balls, who actually wants to take my job, is the man who racked up these debts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne said the Tories wanted some of the savings to come from welfare and that this was a dividing line with Labour.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be clear, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the broadest burden but our perception of fairness - and this is perhaps where we differ from the Labour party - also extends to the welfare system.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused some people of abusing the welfare system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also think it is unfair that person leaves their home early in the morning and they pull the door behind them and they are going to do their job and they look at their next-door neighbour, the blinds are down and that family is living a life on benefits. That is unfair as well and we are going to tackle that as part of tackling this country's economic problems.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted a public debate on whether it was fair to limit child-related benefits available to the unemployed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you are on benefits you automatically get extra money when you have a child, so, you can be better off ... We are just asking the question, does that work? Is that the right value we have in our society?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He also questioned whether it was fair to pay housing benefit to people who go straight from school onto the dole, and he said the government would propose specific policy measures over the next few months to address these issues.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that advocating a 50p top rate of tax was \"a phoney conception of fairness\".</strong> Under the coalition, the rich were paying more in tax than under Labour, he said. But he abolished the 50p rate because it was making Britain \"uncompetitive\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The people who were paying the price for that phoney 50p rate were actually the poor looking for work, not the rich. So I found other ways to tax the rich. We\u2019re clamping down on tax avoidance in a way that has never been done before in this country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:13:05.706Z\">at 10.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072835958f93d334375427c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T07:40:09.442Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AntiAstroturfer in the comments has spotted a wonderful typo in an earlier post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 0814, a great typo:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Q: Shouldn't you admit that you will miss your target to have debt falling by 2015?</p> <p>Osborne says he has cut the budget deficit by 25%.

All of this will require some tough choices, but those choices will be guided by clear principles and a vision of what the welfare system should be.</p> <p>It should be a support for those who need our help but also a system that always requires those who are out of work to make the same kind of choices as those in work.</p> <p>Now we must pose some of the questions we need to answer. For example, is it right that school leavers should be able to move directly from school to a life on housing benefit without finding a job first?</p> <p>Is it right that people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child while those who are out of work don\u2019t?</p> </blockquote> <p>The Treasury have also been briefing about the speech and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-deal-welfare-cuts\">you can read Patrick Wintour's preview story for the Guardian here.</a></p> <p>Osborne has been giving interviews this morning and he is about to go on the Today programme.

They cannot get the mortgages they would need, not at current prices, and not with lenders in their current mood. They have to live at a great distance from their place of work, and spend huge quantities on travel and hardly get to see their children in the evenings. They are obliged to rent at ever higher prices. In the past 10 years, the number of rented households in London has doubled, and rents went up 12 per cent last year alone.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of such people would like to buy, and to get on the same magic property escalator that has boosted the Milibands.

  "<p>We the undersigned represent free expression and civil society organisations from across the globe. We welcome the UK government's attempt to revise English libel law, but remain concerned that the legislation fails to deliver the reform that was promised in their election manifestos and in the May 2010 coalition agreement. English libel law has been shown to have a chilling effect on free speech around the world. We believe that the defamation bill will address this in part by tackling libel tourism, where foreign claimants have brought libel actions to the English courts against defendants who are neither British nor resident in this country. However, the bill as it stands would not have prevented any of the libel cases that we have seen over the last few years against journalists, scientists, doctors and activists who have spoken out on issues that are in the public interest.</p> <p>We call on the government to include a strong public interest defence in the defamation bill to allow free and open debate in the UK and abroad. In addition, restrictions must be placed on corporations to limit their ability to use libel law to bully and silence their critics. The UN human rights committee has warned that unduly restrictive libel law in the UK could have a negative impact on the right to freedom of expression worldwide.</p> <p>We believe it is of the utmost importance that the government delivers reform that protects freedom of speech both in the UK and abroad.<br><strong>Kirsty Hughes</strong> <em>Index on Censorship</em>, <strong>Yuri&#xa0;Dzhibladze</strong> <em>Centre for the Development of Democracy and Human Rights, Russia,</em> <strong>Nigina Bakhrieva </strong><em>Nota Bene, Tajikistan,</em> <strong>Fulemana Braimah</strong> <em>Media Foundation for West Africa</em>, <strong>Jo Glanville</strong> <em>English PEN,</em> <strong>Anna Gerasimova</strong> <em>Belarusian Human Rights House</em>, <strong>Leila Alieva</strong> <em>Centre for National and International Studies, Azerbaijan</em>, <strong>Zoe Titus</strong> <em>Media Institute of Southern Africa</em>, <strong>Olga Zakharova</strong> <em>Freedom Files, Russia,</em> <strong>Tracey Brown </strong><em>Sense About Science,</em> <strong>Alex Postica</strong> <em>Promo LEX Association, Moldova</em>, <strong>Eko Maryadi</strong> <em>Alliance of Independent Journalists of Indonesia</em>, <strong>Sardar Bagishbekov</strong> <em>Public foundation \"Golos svobody\", Kyrgyzstan</em>, <strong>Alexandra Delemenchuk</strong> <em>Centre for Civil Liberties, Ukraine</em>, <strong>Rasul Jafarov</strong> <em>Human Rights Club, Azerbaijan</em>, <strong>Harry Hummel</strong> <em>Netherlands Helsinki Committee, </em><strong>Gunnar M Ekel\u00f8ve-Slydal</strong> <em>Norwegian Helsinki Committee</em>, <strong>Arthur Sakunts</strong> <em>Helsinki Citizens' Assembly</em>, <em>Vanadzor, Armenia</em>, <strong>Ekaterine Popkhadze</strong> <em>Georgian Young Lawyers' Association,</em> <strong>Brigitte Dufour</strong> <em>International Partnership for Human Rights, Belgium,</em> <strong>Edlira Papavangjeli</strong> <em>Albanian Helsinki Committee,</em> <strong>Agn\u00e8s Callamard </strong><em>Article 19,</em> <strong>Mykhailo Kameniev</strong> <em>Foundation of Regional Initiatives, Ukraine,</em> <strong>Arkadiy Bushchenko</strong> <em>Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union,</em> <strong>Henrikas Mickevicius</strong> <em>Human Rights Monitoring Institute, Lithuania</em></p>",
  "<p>A new breed of company in which workers will be forced to lose some maternity rights and all access to unfair dismissal tribunals has been unveiled by George Osborne as he tried to introduce a big deregulation of the labour market through the back door.</p> <p>Osborne revealed that workers could be given shares by their employer worth between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000, and any gains in those shares would be exempt from capital gains tax.</p> <p>In return they would be asked to give up their rights over unfair dismissal, redundancy and requests for flexible working and time off for training. They would also be required to provide twice as much notice of a firm date of return from maternity leave \u2013 16 weeks instead of eight.</p> <p>Osborne told the Conservative party conference in Birmingham that the new \"employee-owner\" status would be optional for existing employees but existing companies and new startups could choose to offer only this type of contract for new hires, making it a compulsory condition of employment. Fast-track legislation will be introduced so firms can use the new type of contract from April 2013.</p> <p>He made the announcement in a speech promising he would not buckle or give up in the face of economic storms.</p> <p>The employee-ownership scheme, endorsed by the Liberal Democrats according to Treasury sources, will be seen as a rebranding and adjustment of previous proposals for compulsory no-fault dismissal laid out by the venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft in a report to Downing Street. The business secretary, Vince Cable, rejected the original Beecroft proposals, saying he was opposed to a hire-and-fire culture.</p> <p>Critics fear the new scheme will mean that almost all new small firms will use this arrangement to circumvent labour market laws in return for giving the employee access to an initial \u00a32,000 bonus.</p> <p>The difficulty for Osborne is that not many new startups issue shares and few will have proven records of profits. Osborne told the conference: \"Workers: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership. And what will the government do? We will charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares. Zero percent capital gains tax for these new employee-owners. Get shares and become owners of the company you work for. Owners, workers and the taxman, all in it together. Workers of the world unite.\"</p> <p>The chancellor recruited a raft of big names in business to back the plan, including Beecroft himself, who said: \"This is a creative and exciting version of proposals I made in my report. Growing businesses need a motivated and flexible workforce if they are to succeed and this new employer-owner status has the potential to deliver exactly that.\"</p> <p>Stuart Rose, former chief executive of Marks and Spencer, said: \"This is a win-win for entrepreneurs and employers in small and medium-sized companies that need a flexible dedicated workforce focused on growth.\"</p> <p>Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: \"There's far too much regulation of employment in this country and what our members are crying out for is the opportunity to employ people and they are scared to employ people at the moment because there's a perception that there is just too much regulation \u2013 it's too difficult if it doesn't work out.\"</p> <p>Despite evidence that he is missing his borrowing and debt targets, Osborne used his speech to insist he would not turn back on his economic plan, promising: \"We will finish the job we have started.\"</p> <p>He also confirmed that he would be seeking an additional \u00a310bn of welfare cuts from 2015-16, and added that 80% of the deficit reduction would be borne by spending cuts as opposed to tax rises. The March budget set out illustrative plans for \u00a36bn welfare cuts in 2015-16 and \u00a310bn the year afterwards, but Osborne would like to go faster and make the announcement in the autumn statement on 5 December.</p> <p>Tory sources said senior Lib Dems had agreed the broad numbers, but none of the detail of how they would be achieved.</p> <p>Osborne signalled that some of the cuts would come from holding down the level of benefits: \"How can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work? Where is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker leaving home in the dark hours of early morning who looks up at the closed blinds of their next door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?\"</p> <p>He also proposed cuts to child tax credits for families with more than three children and holding down the housing benefit budget by withdrawing benefits to those aged 25 or under. These cuts will produce little in savings, prompting the IPPR thinktank to suggest the bulk of savings will come from linking those non-pensioner benefits that are not already frozen to average earnings for 2013-14, rather than to the consumer price inflation. He did not spell out details of tax rises planned after 2015-16, save to rule out a mansion tax or any temporary wealth tax.</p> <p>Osborne added he was not going to introduce a tax on people's homes \u2013 a key pledge of the Lib Dems \u2013 saying: \"It would be sold as a mansion tax but once the tax inspector had his foot in the door you would soon find most homes in the country labelled a mansion. It's not a mansion tax. It's a homes tax and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it.\"</p> <p>He said: \"Just as we should never balance the budget on the backs of the poor so its an economic delusion to think you can balance it only on the wallets of the rich.\"</p> <p>The bulk of the speech was a highly political attempt to defend his overall economic strategy, claiming the economy was healing and no one could trust Labour with the economy again.</p> <p>He said he would not repeat the mistake of Edward Heath who in 1972, \"two years into office, was faced with economic problems and over-powerful unions and buckled and gave up\".</p> <p>In his most dramatic warning he claimed: \"It is not too much to say that the future prosperity of our country, the future of a free enterprise system under law, even the stability of Europe is in question in a way it has not been in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>He also sought to wrest back the mantle of \"one nation\" seized by Ed Miliband at the Labour conference. He said: \"We are not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against one another, if we divide, denounce and demonise. We need an effort from each and every one. One nation working hard together. We are still all in this together.\" He said he would look for more income from being tougher on tax evasion.</p> <p>More broadly, he admitted his forecasts had been blown off course, saying: \"The truth is the damage done by the debts and the banking crisis was worse than we feared. The rise in world oil prices has been larger than anyone forecast. And sadly the predictions that you made, I made, that almost everyone has made about the euro turned out to be true.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jacob Zuma, the president of South Africa, is facing an official investigation and public outcry over plans to upgrade his private residence and build a nearby town, dubbed \"Zumaville\", at a cost of millions to taxpayers.</p> <p>Anger was surging on Monday over the 238m rand (\u00a316.62m) renovations of Zuma's rural home in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal province, after it was revealed that Nelson Mandela and other former presidents' homes had received substantially less from the state. This followed controversy over proposals for a 2bn rand town, the first to be built since the end of apartheid, two miles (3.2km) from the Zuma homestead.</p> <p>\"Nkandlagate\" could not come at a worse time with violent strikes threatening to spread from mining to other industries and focusing attention on the gap between haves and have-nots. Zuma, 70, faces a tense re-election battle within the governing African National Congress in December.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Zuma said: \"I have paid visits to a number of areas where you can't believe that you are in South Africa. Why should I see that, as the president of the country, not even of the ANC, and think that I could sleep peacefully when I know there are people who live in things you can't even describe as a house?\"</p> <p>Those <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/editorials/2012/10/08/nkandla-splurge-giving-taxpayers-sleepless-nights\" title=\"\">words are being thrown back at him</a>, with some observers comparing his hometown patronage to some of Africa's least democratic leaders. \"He's behaving like a monarch rather than the president of the republic,\" said Aubrey Matshiqi, a research fellow at the Helen Suzman Foundation. \"It makes me think of the king of Swaziland or Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa [self-crowned emperor of the Central African Republic].\"</p> <p>Upgrades to Zuma's private residence, which have soared to 238m rand from an estimate of 6.4m (\u00a3447,821) two years ago, include a helipad, underground living quarters with about 10 air-conditioned rooms, a medical clinic for the president and his family, houses for security staff, air force and police units, underground parking, playgrounds and a visitors' centre.</p> <p>Zuma \u2013 who shares the property with his four current wives and their children \u2013 previously said he would meet most of the bill, but government documents revealed he will pay 5%. Taxpayers already maintain two state residences in Pretoria and Cape Town.</p> <p><a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-08-00-nkandla-security-dwarfs-that-of-other-presidents-homes\" title=\"\">Newspaper reports</a> in South Africa said public spending on Zuma's residence dwarfed that for the past presidents FW De Klerk, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Zuma came in for more criticism when his residence was declared a \"national key point\", meaning details are secret under an apartheid-era law.</p> <p>Thuli Madonsela, the public protector, has received several complaints about irregular expenditure on the residence and has begun gathering information which could lead to a full investigation.</p> <p>The civil society group Corruption Watch has also filed questions to the government.</p> <p>The president is already pressure after it emerged in August that ground had been broken for the construction of a new town in the area. Initial estimates show the government will invest more than 1bn rand (\u00a370m) of taxpayers' money, <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-03-00-taxpayers-will-have-to-pick-up-r1-bn-tab-for-zumaville\" title=\"\">South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian reported</a>, with a further 1bn rand required from the private sector.</p> <p>The development project, known as the Umlalazi-Nkandla Smart Growth Centre, will reportedly span 200 hectares, enough space for 10,000 middle-class homes. It will include government offices, a library, theatre, a school with boarding facilities, a community safety centre, a recreation centre with a swimming pool and tennis courts and light industrial units including an agricultural market.</p> <p>Residents of Nkandla \u2013 a rural backwater which has an unemployment rate of 47.4% \u2013 have already seen some tangible benefits from having the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/20/zuma-south-africa-politics\" title=\"\">number one citizen in their midst</a>. Julius Malema, the expelled ANC youth league president and Zuma's arch political enemy, has accused himZuma of building a \"New York City of KwaZulu-Natal\".</p> <p>The president has hit back at the criticism, arguing that people should not be penalised for happening to live near him. \"Why should people at Nkandla, 3km from where Zuma stays, starve?\" he <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-09-13-jz-denies-instructing-ministers-to-fund-zumaville\" title=\"\">asked parliament</a> last month. \"Why must they be isolated? Why should others who are in other areas be more important than those? Should they be punished because they are neighbours of Zuma? I don't think so.\"</p> <p>The president insisted that he did not personally intervene on behalf of his hometown. \"The president has not instructed ministers to provide funding and a budget for the Nkandla-Mlalazi Smart Growth Centre. It is important to emphasise that even at a national level, Nkandla is not the only district that is receiving attention for rural development.\"</p> <p>But opposition politicians have seized their chance to hammer Zuma's credibility as a former Zulu herd boy still in touch with ordinary people. Lindiwe Mazibuko, parliamentary leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), said: \"The DA has learnt that thousands of people living on the outskirts of Nkandla, in villages like Babanango, Kataza and Ebizimali, are still without the most basic services. Yet 2bn rand will be spent on a multi-purpose centre a few kilometres away from President Zuma's homestead.\"</p> <p>She added: \"How can a leader ask the country to make sacrifices, and tighten belts in hard times, when he leads such publicly-funded extravagance? This impoverished region of the country needs clinics, hospitals and decent classrooms. He has decided to build them literally in his own backyard. President Zuma's behaviour upends the very concept of social justice which is written into our constitution.\"</p> <p>Political commentators have also excoriated the president. Justice Malala <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2012/10/08/zuma-is-above-mere-middle-class-morality\" title=\"\">wrote in the Times of South Africa</a>: \"On Friday we had the incredible spectacle of the minister of public works, the until-then-relatively-credible former trade union leader Thulas Nxesi, making a complete ass of himself as he tried to defend the fact that taxpayers' money is being used to build the president a 238m rand palace in his home village, Nkandla.</p> <p>\"When journalists cornered Nxesi he then revealed that, actually, we are judging the president from a middle-class viewpoint. I think the country is going to the dogs when we start saying that looting the state is part of African culture, which is basically what Nxesi was saying.\"</p>",
  "<p>Since last gracing these pages, I've been appointed dean of my faculty, which is alarming news for all concerned. Having spent the best years of my life complaining about how universities in the UK are run, I fear I will spend the next five years explaining why it just can't be any other way. And it's all my fault now.</p> <p>Over the years, I've written about admissions, teaching methods, examinations, cumbersome regulation, funding and just about anything else that irritated me. And a common theme has been to compare what we do here with the US.</p> <p>Of course, there isn't a single way in which things happen in the US: the variety is astonishing. But, oddly, in its chaotic free market the US has been able to achieve a level of co-ordination that we never have in the centralised UK. For example, there is an honour code among universities that they will all have the same deadline for final acceptance of postgraduate admission offers. This is to stop mid-rank institutions pressurising excellent candidates to accept an offer early, before they know whether they have been accepted into an elite university. This seems to be enforced entirely by moral pressure, whereas here there is almost nothing as systematic unless it is part of a formal system such as Ucas.</p> <p>The American way has emerged through a process of evolution rather than decree. If, as it is sometimes said, the UK university system is part of a command economy then we must all be listening to different, conflicting commands, or at least interpreting them in our own way, where \"own\" can refer not only to universities, but also to faculties, departments, or, indeed, different people in adjacent offices.</p> <p>When I started my academic career the term \"Americanisation\" was akin to \"vulgarisation\": indicative of fizzy-drink dispensers in the common room, and libraries named after the drinks companies. Well, now we have fizzy drinks everywhere and if only we could find the donors, who knows what we would rename? For enough dosh, I'd change my own name. Americanisation is often now a goal, not a term of abuse.</p> <p>One area in which we could certainly learn is flexibility of studies. Here, at the age of 17 applicants decide what to study until they reach 21. But the decision is made in varying degrees of ignorance. Students enrol in philosophy wanting to gain insight into the agonies of the human condition. Instead, we make them puzzle over whether names are really \"disguised definite descriptions\". A genuinely fascinating question, but not exactly what many are expecting. Economics students want to find out how to create wealth in a sustainable fashion. First, though, they are sent to the statistics class, and many never reappear. Law students \u2013 well some of them, anyway \u2013 want to learn how to fight the injustices of the system. Instead, they are taught how to pretend that inconsistent judicial decisions can be distinguished on the basis of some spurious principle.</p> <p>And what happens when they find out they should have enrolled for something else? Largely they put a brave face on it. In the US, by contrast, you enrol at a university and decide what to study when you are there, changing direction if your initial hunches haven't worked out.</p> <p>Why don't we allow students to work out their own direction? A combination of institutional rigidity and Thatcherite internal markets mean that it is administratively painful for everyone, and financially painful for the losing department, if a student changes degree course.</p> <p>So will I bring in more flexibility as dean? Ha! The most common phrase to hear in a university is \"we want to do this, but they won't let us\". On becoming dean, I thought I would be one of \"them\" and so could start making changes. But no, even the deans, it seems, are under the thumb of \"them\". One day perhaps I will find out who \"they\" are.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Wolff is professor of philosophy at University College London and now dean of arts and humanities</p>",

  "<p>Kevin Stanford, the embattled high street fashion tycoon, has hit back at the private equity firm which rescued his All Saints chain from the brink of administration last year, after being asked to step down from the business.</p> <p>Stanford is understood to be furious that news of his departure leaked and has attacked Lion Capital's stewardship of the chain since it took control last year.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Kevin has legitimate concerns about the way that All Saints has been managed since the involvement of Lion Capital. He is perplexed at the appearance of confidential information in the media.\"</p> <p>Lion Capital has also backed buyouts at Weetabix and clothes chain American Apparel.</p> <p>All Saints found itself in the hands of administrators to failed Icelandic banks Kaupthing and Landsbanki after shares pledged by Stanford and Baugur, the Icelandic investment group run by his friend Jon Asgeir Johannesson, were forfeited.</p> <p>Initially, the banks had sought to retain Stanford, who has an unrivalled reputation for building successful high street fashion chains, most famously Karen Millen. However, they fell out and the banks threatened to call in administrators if All Saints management could not find a buyer for their stake.</p> <p>All Saints continued to be turbulent following its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/05/fashion-chain-all-saints-bought-by-lion-capital?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">rescue last year</a>, with Lion Capital's fellow rescue partner Goode Capital disappearing from the share register in March. Stanford was said to have a 15% stake in the group, though the ownership is difficult to confirm as the trail of holding companies disappears to the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>Since 2008 Stanford has been struggling to claw back elements of his wider business empire, which was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/05/kevin-stanford-retail-comeback?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">substantially lost</a> in the wake of the Icelandic banking crash.

  "<p>The police and army in an increasingly violent Afghanistan will struggle to secure the country when foreign forces leave and the people face a corrupt presidential election in 2014, the Red Cross and a thinktank have warned.</p> <p>At stake is the limited and fragile stability that has insulated Kabul and most other urban areas from more than a decade of escalating aggression since the US invasion. There are growing fears the country could face a full-blown civil war after Nato troops hand over security to the Afghan police and army, and leave.</p> <p>\"Time is running out,\" said Candace Rondeaux of the International Crisis Group thinktank, in a blunt report about the handover from coalition to Afghan troops. \"Steps toward a stable transition must begin now to prevent a precipitous slide toward state collapse.</p> <p>\"Plagued by factionalism and corruption, Afghanistan is far from ready to assume responsibility for security when US and Nato forces withdraw in 2014.\"</p> <p>The Long Hard Road to the 2014 Transition also argues that time is running out to ensure a 2014 presidential vote is credible or acceptable. President Hamid Karzai is due to step down in that year and powerbrokers are already jostling for position.</p> <p>\"It is a near certainty that under current conditions the 2014 elections will be plagued by massive fraud,\" the report stated. \"Vote-rigging in the south and east, where security continues to deteriorate, is all but guaranteed. High levels of violence across the country before and on the day of the polls are likely to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands more would-be voters.\"</p> <p>The last decade has brought improvements for Afghans in areas including women's rights, health and education. But for many civilians, particularly in rural areas, the steady rise of the Taliban and insurgents linked with them has also brought insecurity and misery.</p> <p>\"I am filled with concern as I leave this country,\" the outgoing head of the Afghanistan office of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Reto Stocker, told journalists in Kabul. \"Since I arrived here, in 2005, local armed groups have proliferated, civilians have been caught between not just one but multiple frontlines, and it has become increasingly difficult for ordinary Afghans to obtain healthcare.\"</p> <p>The conflict was now less brutal for civilians, however, than was the fighting that tore Afghanistan apart in the 1990s, when noncombatants were often directly targeted as a deliberate means of warfare, he said.</p> <p>But many were still killed and injured, others had fled their homes to escape violence, and many Afghans who had escaped being drawn into the conflict still lived in abject poverty, extremely vulnerable to drought, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p> <p>The fragile economy was also likely to suffer, as the departure of foreign troops would hit a country dependent on war spending, from construction to fuel transportation, Stocker added.</p> <p>\"Hardship arising from the economic situation or from severe weather or natural disaster has become more widespread, and hope for the future has been steadily declining,\" he said.</p> <p>Afghanistan's insecurity also appears to be fuelling its drug control problems. The country is already the world's largest producer of opium, with the UN saying on Monday the number of Afghan families growing cannabis as a cash crop leaped by more than a third last year.</p>",

He has always maintained that he has had nothing to do with the business in recent years.</p> <p>Sources close to the Tory chairman said that Shapps was at the party conference with a \"massive\" schedule.</p> <p>\"It's in the hands of the ASA and we have completely complied with their requests,\" the source said.</p>",

Proving that success comes in threes, on Monday Dunham, 26, announced she has signed a book deal worth more than $3.5m. </p> <p>Random House secured her forthcoming advice book \u2013 Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's Learned \u2013 after what by all accounts was an energetic tussle between publishers over the 66-page proposal.</p> <p>Her book is set to contain personal essays about sex, mortality and food. <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/lena-dunham-sings-book-deal-for-more-than-3-5-million/\">According to the New York Times</a>, a chapter in the proposal reads: \"Red lipstick with a sunburn: How to dress for a business meeting and other hard-earned fashion lessons from the size 10 who went to the Met Ball.\" </p> <p>In front of an audience made up of enough twentysomethings to fill a Brooklyn warehouse party, Dunham discussed her book with television critic Emily Nussbaum at the New Yorker Festival on Sunday.</p> <p>Dunham told Nussbaum that she is a frequent consumer of advice books and has read He's Just Not That Into You as well as Be Honest \u2013 You're Not That Into Him Either.</p> <p>\"I didn't take either of them seriously, but I was so fascinated by the person who felt like they had gotten to a place where they were literally a dating pro,\" Dunham said. \"That idea, that you could master the most mysterious emotion and write a book about how to handle it properly.\"</p> <p>So what advice would Dunham give to the lead character \u2013 played by herself \u2013 of her Emmy-nominated show, which is based on the lives of 20-somethings in New York? </p> <p>\"I know she's a mess and she's exhausting and those things but I think her unsinkable Molly Brown quality will serve her well,\" Dunham said. \"She just needs to let her freak flag fly.\"</p> <p>Dunham kept under wraps most of the details of season two of Girls \u2013 which has finished shooting, and airs in January. But she confirmed that Chris O'Dowd \u2013 who played Officer Nathan Rhodes in Bridesmaids and was last seen on Girls marrying the much-younger Jessa \u2013 will return. She said Community's Donald Glover was also joining the cast.</p> <p>It is safe to say that Dunham will employ some of her trademark nudity in season two, which she admitted was a directorial crutch.</p> <p>\"I definitely have a tendency to be like, this scene is not exactly what it should be, I'm gonna take off my pants,\" Dunham said.</p> <p>Nussbaum and Dunham also talked about the negative attention the show has received. People have accused Dunham and her cast of nepotism, and criticized a lack of diversity in the show.</p> <p>Dunham's parents are both well-known members of the art world and the girls of Girls are all children of famous parents. Zosia Mamet (Shoshanna) is the daughter of playwright David Mamet, Jemima Kirke (Jessa) is the daughter of former Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke and Allison Williams (Marnie) is the daughter of newscaster Brian Williams.</p> <p>\"I have plenty of counter-arguments to that, but it's not elegant to share them,\" Dunham said. \"Like it's not classy to go on Twitter to say, 'I had to have summer jobs since I was 12.' It's not a cool move, so I didn't do that, but I sort of stewed with them.\"</p> <p>Dunham, who was born and raised in New York City, said she couldn't argue with criticisms that there weren't enough minority characters on the show to realistically portray her hometown.</p> <p>\"That is a real criticism and that is something I've thought about and I didn't claim to be making a perfect mirror of the life of young New Yorkers \u2026 if I in any way accidentally made that promise, than mea culpa.\"</p> <p>She said she had studied race and gender politics at her notoriously liberal alma mater, Oberlin College, and that defending more severe criticisms about the portrayal of race on the show is a losing battle.</p> <p>\"What I didn't like was the other angle, that there isn't enough minority characters on the show, but, therefore you are racist, you were raised by racists, you come from a world where people don't think about class or privilege and you have a broken relationship to the world around you,\" Dunham said. \"That is hard to hear and it's upsetting.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GLms7lA1MJ4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GLms7lA1MJ4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>The documentary film-maker behind Kony 2012 has spoken about his high-profile public breakdown in a series of interviews coinciding with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_QsMdSCpNU\">the launch of the organisation's latest video</a>.</p> <p>Referring to the incident, in which he was picked up by police while naked and rambling on the streets of San Diego, Jason Russell said his mind \"clicked\" after weeks of promoting and then defending his campaign against the Lord's Resistance Army and its murderous leader, Joseph Kony.</p> <p>\"I wasn't in control of my mind or my body,\" Russell told NBC's Today show. In a separate interview with Oprah Winfrey, Russell said he put the episode down to \"extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration\".</p> <p>The fresh media appearances come as Invisible Children, Russell's organisation, launches a new video aimed at renewing its campaign against the use of child soldiers and atrocities carried out by the Lord's Resistance Army.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z_QsMdSCpNU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z_QsMdSCpNU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>Posted on YouTube on Sunday, the film Move serves as a follow-up to the Kony 2012 video that went viral earlier this year, being seen by about 100 million people in a week.</p> <p>But the success of that campaign led to a backlash, with critics claiming the film it simplified the story of Kony's reign of terror and failed to sufficiently note that Kony \u2013 a wanted war criminal \u2013 and his followers were no longer a force in northern Uganda. Kony and his immediate circle are thought to be operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>Showings of the film \u2013 which focused on the story of Jacob Acaye, a former child abductee of the LRA who witnessed his brother being killed by Kony's men \u2013 in Uganda prompted an angry response from those who believed that it presented an unfair portrayal of the country.</p> <p>At the height of the Kony 2012 debate, Russell embarked on a whirlwind tour of interviews and media appearances. The travel and lack of sleep took its toll on his mental wellbeing, he said.</p> <p>He told Today: \"It was so chaotic. It was so exciting because it felt like the world was for us, and then at the same time it was heartbreaking and felt almost like a nightmare because it felt like the world was against us.\"</p> <p>He added: \"My mind couldn't stop thinking about the future \u2013&#xa0;I literally thought I was responsible for the future of humanity. It started to get into the point where my mind finally turned against me and there was a moment that click, I wasn't in control of my mind or my body.\"</p> <p>As well as the new video, which has already been seen by tens of thousands of people, Invisible Children is planning a November 17 march on the White House to further highlight the crimes of the Lord's Resistance Army.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on October 9 to state that Invisible Children, not Kony, is planning the November 17 march to the White House.</p>",
  "<p>The French village of Laguiole in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is famous for cheese, and for the manufacture of France's most famous knives of the same name. In the past, this has always been a matter of pride for the village's 1,200 residents. Now, they are engaged in a bitter chicken-and-egg-style legal battle over who owns the rights to the name.</p> <p>The row over the Laguiole has pitted local identity against international business, tradition against trademark, and seen the Laguiolais, as they are known, tear down their village sign and march to Paris. \"Our name no longer belongs to us, so what do you want us to do with this sign?\" the mayor, Vincent Alazard, asked a crowd of cheering protesters.</p> <p>Villagers are furious after losing a court battle to reclaim the rights to the Laguiole name from a company based in the Paris region which has registered it as a trademark. They have accused the firm of stealing their heritage and, worse, applying the village name to cheap products from China.</p> <p>Inflamed by passions invoked by the idea of <em>terroir</em> \u2013 a profound Gallic notion of the land with its geography, geology and qualities \u2013 they want France's socialist government to introduce rules for regional products similar to the Appellation Control\u00e9e regulations that apply to French wines.</p> <p>On Monday, jJunior government minister Sylvia Pinel went to Laguiole on Monday to mediate in the long-running dispute.</p> <p>\"The world Laguiole has been kidnapped. It has been stolen from us,\" said Michel Bras, who runs a Michelin-starred restaurant in the village.</p> <p>\"It is very easy to ride on the backs of people who made sacrifices, who made the most of what little they had, to establish the name of this area. These people have been swindled by someone who does not know the place.\"</p> <p>The origin of the Laguiole knife, which emerged in the early 19th century, is arcane. Some say it started with a folding knife, with a bone, wooden or ivory handle, others that it was a fixed knife. What is not disputed is that manufacture of what is now the most famous Laguiole, a steak knife with its metallic insect motif \u2013 a bee or a fly \u2013 started in the village of the same name.</p> <p>In 1993, businessman Gilbert Szajner registered Laguiole as a trademark and began licensing its name for other products, including table linen, corkscrews and lighters, imported from Asia. The Laguiolais still have the right to make and market Laguiole knives, but not other products. If they want to diversify, they have to pay Szajner to use the name.</p> <p>In September, the local council lost a legal fight to annul the trademark on the grounds that it could lead to consumers being confused about the origin of products. The court ruled that the knife was better known than the village and that Laguiole knives had become a generic product not necessarily linked to a particular place.</p> <p>Emmanuelle Hoffman-Attias, a specialist trade lawyer, said the court had \"judged the Laguiole knife had entered into current language\" and decided it was \"the object that was famous, not the village\".</p> <p>However, she added that separate attempts by private businesses to register Courchevel, the ski-resort, and Saint-Tropez, had been refused as a misappropriation of an already famous name.</p> <p>Thierry Moysset, director of the Laguiole Foundry, the largest of a dwindling number of cutlery makers in the village, is furious. He would like to expand his range of products, but cannot. \"I'm trying to generate jobs here but the law forbids me from doing it,\" he said. \"It is a crazy situation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Talking to Women's Wear Daily in a recent interview, Thierry Gillier, founder of French fashion chain Zadig &amp; Voltaire, happened to voice his view on the Chinese market. Discussing the new hotel he will be opening in Paris, he explained: \"It will be a slightly private hotel, not open to everybody. It won't be open to Chinese tourists, for example.\"</p> <p>While this has been <a href=\"http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/zadig-voltaire-to-open-hotel-in-paris-6345788\" title=\"\">quietly amended in the online version of the article to \"busloads of tourists\"</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19841600\" title=\"\">Gillier has apologised to his \"friends from China\"</a> after his comments sparked outrage on the country's social networking sites and beyond, what he said exposes a wider problem within the fashion industry. Brands know China is a new frontier, with consumers hungry for fashion: forecasts suggest <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2011-02/11/content_11980217.htm\" title=\"\">Chinese consumers will buy 44% of the world's luxury goods by 2020</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/2012/10/01/Zadig-Voltaire-China-Tourist-Ban-100112.aspx\" title=\"\">\u00a345bn was spent by Chinese people on shopping trips to France this year</a>. However, an eye on this market has tended to come hand in hand with a belief that it is somehow less sophisticated than its western counterpart, more interested in logos than design. If this was once true, it's changing \u2013 and fast. With Vogue China now seven years old and growing fat through advertising, stores such as Hong Kong's Lane Crawford and Joyce selling everything from Christopher Kane to Victoria Beckham, and a thriving fashion blogger scene, it's clear that Chinese consumers have become fashion-literate.</p> <p>The recent success of a brand such as Prada says a lot about increasingly sophisticated shopping habits in China. While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/burberry-warns-profits-sales-luxury-fashion\" title=\"\">Burberry has seen a fall in growth from 20%</a> in the second half of 2011 to mid-teens for the first quarter of 2012, <a href=\"http://www.accessoriesmagazine.com/56202/prada-first-half-profit-jumps-nearly-60\" title=\"\">Prada's profit grew 60%</a> with most of the increase put down to the Chinese market. Buying something from the Italian brand is obviously a prestige purchase, but it's not one that is immediately apparent to passersby. Prada's goods are often unbranded, and so usually only recognised by in-the-know fashion experts. The opposite of, say, a monogrammed Louis Vuitton bag or a Burberry check mac, items that were previously highly prized.</p> <p>In the mould of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/13/feminine-minimalism-phoebe-philo-cartner-morley\" title=\"\">fashion favourite Phoebe Philo at Celine</a>, discreet but very well-made (and incredibly expensive) designs suit the mood of the moment. Consumers now want the stealth wealth symbols sought after everywhere from London to Los Angeles. Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent are doing well with their low-key branding, with HSBC predicting the two brands' sales will increase in China this year.</p> <p>The wider industry is starting to pay attention to the changes. New ventures like <a href=\"http://www.luxup.com/\" title=\"\">Lux Up</a>, a members-only site founded by a team including ex-Vogue fashion features director Harriet Quick and Averyl Oates, previously buying director at Harvey Nichols, mixes shopping events at brands ranging from Marni to Loewe with slick design and editorial content. Launched in September, it is designed for Chinese visitors on shopping trips to different cities around the world.</p> <p>Brands are also adapting their strategy from aggressive expansion to prioritising a sense of exclusivity. Louis Vuitton has advocated a one-store-at-a-time policy, while Hermes, part of the so-called \"absolute luxury segment\" that is doing so well in China, has said it will only open 20 stores worldwide over the next five years. The French brand advocates a kind of \"slow\" luxury, with its iconic bags still handmade in France. This is a brand perception that Hermes is keen to protect; its waiting lists are constant. Playing hard to get means its products are instantly more desirable. That \"luxury logic\" works anywhere around the world, and China is no exception.</p>",
  "<p>So now we know the secretaries of state for women and equalities, health and even the home secretary are in favour of reducing the abortion limit below its current 24 weeks. Maria Miller and Theresa May have backed a reduction of four weeks, while Jeremy Hunt is using his position at the head of the health service to suggest the limit should be halved. Why?</p> <p>Although only a few MPs have publicly suggested scrapping legal abortions altogether, constant harking to a subject that affected fewer than 3,000 women last year having abortions after 20 weeks has led to fears among women's groups that the Tories are set to ape the US right with an attack on women's reproductive rights.</p> <p>Those who argue for reducing the limit further - Nadine Dorries MP among others - cite evidence that more than half of foetuses born at 24 weeks survive and that this fact should take precedence over the right of the mother to determine her own future. Yet the scientific community does not support a reduction in the time limit implemented in 1990. Much of the scientific evidence is available from parliament's own review in 2006 <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmsctech/1045/1045i.pdf\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>At the same time as Dorries introduced a bill to cut the abortion limit to 21 weeks in 2006, the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee was moved to publish a report on scientific developments since the limit was reduced from 24 weeks in 1990.</p> <p>The report found that 89% of abortions are carried out before 13 weeks of gestation while just 2% took place at 20 weeks or over. A far higher proportion of these were due to foetal abnormalities, many of which can only be picked up at the 20-week abnormality scan.</p> <p>None of this explains the latest concerted attack, which pre-dates even the latest reshuffle which put those opposed to current limits into extraordinary positions of power.</p> <p>Although abortion is largely seen as a personal rather than party political issue - all votes on the issue have been free to date - it seems fair to say that the current crop of Tory MPs have form on this matter. (This wasn't always so. Even <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xp7NLa68NOkC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=margaret+thatcher+david+steel+abortion+bill&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j9VIN-8XgU&amp;sig=mNS2wppAdYpxThwXhTcSMcn_KNk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d9hyUNOHH5CY1AXiz4HACg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=margaret%20thatcher%20david%20steel%20abortion%20bill&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher </a>backed David Steel's bill which legalised abortions in 1967). Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17620641\" title=\"\">Andrew Lansley </a>ordered a review of abortions clinics, at a cost of \u00a31m, after a report in the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9161735/One-in-five-abortion-clinics-breaks-law.html\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a> found that 1 in 5 \"broke the law\" by offering \"pre-signed consent\". Following <a href=\"http://www.cqc.org.uk/media/findings-termination-pregnancy-inspections-published\" title=\"\">inspections</a>, just 14 out of 249 clinics were found to offer such consent.</p> <p>There were two more attempts by a Conservative MP, this time Angela Watkinson, to change the law on abortion in 2007. <a href=\"http://www.abortionreview.org/index.php/site/article/219/\" title=\"\">One</a> aimed to force doctors offering abortion or contraception advice to under-16s to inform the child's parents while the other attempted to introduce compulsory counselling and a week-long \"cooling off\" period before women are granted an abortion. Both were defeated in parliament, which didn't stop Dorries teaming up with Frank Field MP to introduce a bill that attempted to strip abortion providers of their role in counselling women. This too was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/07/nadine-dorries-abortion-amendment-defeated\" title=\"\">heavily defeated in the House of Commons last year.</a> It remains to be seen who else will join the bandwagon at the party \u00adconference this week but it&#xa0;seems fair to suspect there will be another \u00adattempt to reduced the abortion law before 2015.<br></p>",

Allowing gay marriage would cause deep divisions in society \"without giving gays a single right they do not have in civil partnership\", he said.</p> <p>At a Coalition for Marriage rally on the fringe of the Conservative conference in Birmingham on Monday, Carey joined David Burrowes, the backbench MP for Enfield Southgate, and former MP Ann Widdecombe in protesting that neither the Lib Dem nor Tory 2010 manifesto included a pledge to legalise gay marriage.</p> <p>Carey claimed that in some countries where same-sex marriage had been made legal \u2013 including Mexico, Brazil and the Netherlands \u2013 it had led to unforeseen consequences such as three-person marriages.</p> <p>Asked about opponents of gay marriage being described as \"bigots\" \u2013 on one occasion by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister \u2013 Carey said: \"Let us remember the Jews in Nazi Germany. What started against them was when they started to be called names.</p> <p>\"And that was the first stage towards that totalitarian state. We have to resist them. We treasure democracy. We treasure our Christian inheritance and we want to debate this in a fair way.\"</p> <p>Widdecombe said: \"This is not an anti-gay rally. It is defending marriage.\"</p> <p>Outside the town hall rally, attended by about 400 people, gay rights protesters accused the platform of promoting \"marriage apartheid\" by denying the right to marry on equal terms.</p> <p>Cameron has joined the US president, Barack Obama, in endorsing same-sex marriage and is poised to report on the results of a 12-week consultation before proceeding to legislate. All main parties, including the SNP government in Edinburgh, now endorse the change.</p> <p>Burrowes urged ministers to stage a referendum on the issue, as has been done in 32 US states with mixed results. He said there had been no pressure for a change to civil partnership before the election \u2013 \"no letters, emails or tweets\" from voters \u2013 but MPs' postbags were now full of the controversy. \"If the government can think again about pasties and caravans it can certainly do so about the important issue of marriage,\" he said.</p> <p>Widdecombe, a former Home Office minister, said such consequences would include the replacement of cherished liturgy and names such as \"mother\" and \"father\" with \"progenitor A and progenitor B\" or \"partners to the marriage\". Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, was proposing to use the word \"carers\", she said.</p> <p>Carey argued that teachers, doctors and other professionals might be forced out of their jobs if they refused to embrace the proposed change to the law, an intolerant restriction on free speech that Widdecombe said could make the Church of England force disestablishment.</p> <p>\"I know, David Cameron, that is not the sort of Britain you want,\" she said.Carey hinted that the prime minister might have conceded the policy on \"pragmatic\" grounds to sustain his coalition with the Lib Dems \u2013 \"the very worst of reasons\".</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, the chief executive of gay rights group Stonewall, said: \"We're deeply saddened that Lord Carey seems to be resorting to student union abuse. The reality is that gay people are very well aware of the consequences of the Holocaust, for obvious reasons, and when someone descends to this level of rhetoric it suggests they don't think they have very powerful arguments to rely on.</p> <p>\"Lord Carey is perfectly entitled to his view and we respect that. It's the view of many people of his generation and we accept that, but to compare Cameron to Hitler is just sad as well as being entirely inappropriate.</p> <p>\"It's extraordinary that he should resort to this sort of invective and profoundly unchristian. There will be gay people of faith who are very disturbed by what he has said.</p> <p>\"The argument is lost already but that doesn't mean the battle won't be a rough one when the time comes. But it is surprising they couldn't come up with a more persuasive argument for this, the apex of their campaign for which they have had had plenty of time to marshall their arguments.\"</p>",

Both those bands contained one brother each, and now they have come together \u2013 did so in May this year, in fact \u2013 as An Blonds, under the influence of Elliot Smith, Air, Giorgio Moroder and Angelo Badalamenti: an enticing mix, we're sure you'll agree.</p> <p>But what have the Standlee siblings \u2013 originally from Seattle, Washington, now resident in London (Nathan) and Manchester (Ryan) \u2013 been doing since their respective former outfits split? As they tell it, \"after attempting to lead a normal life\" with a series of boring office jobs (because life in Team Waterpolo was akin to Beatlemania at its peak), Nathan \"had a meltdown\" before moving to the big smoke and starting work on some demos. Ryan heard them, asked if he could have a go at the vocals, and An Blonds were born. Last month they played their first show, in Manchester, and this week they release their debut EP Invitation to Love on Twisted Tape, label home of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jun/19/new-band-deap-vally\" title=\"\">Deap Valley</a>.</p> <p>It's a fine EP, its five tracks going some way towards justifying that mouthwatering list of influences. The opener, Honesty, is lovely, aware in its jerky rhythm of R&amp;B but not exactly R&amp;B, indie but not lacking in polish and melody. Prince's Raspberry Beret may even have been a starting point, <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xanhf8_pop-life_music\" title=\"\">or Pop Life</a>. It could be us projecting, but they actually do sound like Americans based in London and Manchester, such is the combination of sheen and edge. Ryan's breathy, stoned, dazed vocals <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjNCSw41QSA\" title=\"\">recall Luke Steele in Sleepy Jackson</a>, and when he sings, \"Don't ever take advantage of me and my delicacy\", one imagines he's referring to his sensitivity rather than something tasty and pickled he might keep about his person. Quiet is like Prince minus the sex and sensuality \u2013 the running theme here would appear to be not carnal knowledge but the damage that we do to each other in the name of love (\"His bruises ran deeper than the skin\").</p> <p>The mood might be Lynchian and noir, nevertheless this is, to quote XTC, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLSkC4N1BIc\" title=\"\">pop</a> \u2013 the final minute of Quiet is a keening Hey Jude of a coda as the singer whispers, \"You will watch the death of every storm\". This is good songwriting \u2013 every one of the tracks features a startling transition: the one at 2.08 during the slowly burbling El Mudo should, if you're remotely on the same page as us, rob you of your breath. Currents is a bit like the Monkees if they were a 2012 alt band aware of developments in electronica, indie and R&amp;B. The final track, Creeps, really makes good on the Air allusion \u2013 we're guessing they own a copy of the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159097/soundtrack\" title=\"\">soundtrack to the Virgin Suicides</a> and dig its blend of 70s soft rock and melancholy ambient pop. Now we'd like to hear an album by An Blonds.</p> <p><strong>The buzz: </strong><a href=\"http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/152809-listen-blonds-stream-debut-ep-released-8th.html\" title=\"\">\"Five intriguing Lynch-inspired tales of love and regret, all wrapped in smokey electronics and warm pop melodies\"</a></p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> This totally deserves the attention of a wider audience</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Journey to the centre of Rusholme</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373051/\" title=\"\">Journey to the centre of the Earth </a></p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Invitation to Love EP is out now on Twisted Tape</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Sleepy Jackson, Elliot Smith, Air, Giorgio Moroder</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/an-blonds\" title=\"\">soundcloud.com/an-blonds</a></p> <p><strong>Tuesday's new band:</strong> The Winter Olympics</p>",
  "<p>It's a warm autumn Texas evening at Austin's <a href=\"http://www.centralmarket.com/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">Central Market</a> and the gourmet supermarket is buzzing with local folk doing their weekly shop, sampling artisan cheeses, microbrews and good wines, or sitting at the outdoor cafe to eat tasty, home-cooked dishes.</p> <p>The experience is far removed from the normal US homogenised food shopping experience, and although Austin is also home to Central Market's gourmet shopping competitor, Whole Foods, the experience of buying quality meat, fish and produce and knowing where it comes from is restricted to these gourmet and pricey retail chains, or upscale farmers markets.</p> <p>That's where <a href=\"https://food-hub.org/\" title=\"\">Foodhub</a> comes in. It's a self-proclaimed online dating site for locally sourced food in the Pacific Northwest, and one of the participants at last week's <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco</a> held in Austin. Funded by the <a href=\"http://www.ecotrust.org\" title=\"\">Ecotrust</a>, an incubator for social enterprise, Foodhub has created an online B2B marketplace for professional food buyers and sellers \u2013 akin to Match.com or Craigslist \u2013 where members post descriptions of products they need to purchase or need to sell. Retail grocers, schools, restaurants and caterers can research social and shareable profiles of manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, winemakers and artisan producers and vice versa.</p> <p>Foodhub's goal is to provide the framework for sustainable regional food networks and provide a useful service that meets the aspirations of its members. Take the growing trend of schools that have a mandate to buy direct from area farms but don't know how to make that mandate a reality, for example.</p> <p>At present Foodhub serves buyers and producers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Alaska and California but, as the non-profit organisation is keen to stress, its tech platform is open for anyone to use with the big idea that Foodhub's model will spread across the US and, conceivably to other parts of the world too.</p> <p>Of course, matching buyers and sellers of locally sourced good quality food is just one part of creating a vibrant and sustainable regional food system. Often, the matchmaking can fall down over the thorny issue of distribution, with so many producers dependent on expensive third party trucking companies or, if they aren't producing on the scale demanded by big distributors, relying on UPS and FedEx.</p> <p>And that's where <a href=\"http://www.orfoodex.com/\" title=\"\">FoodEx</a>, a fulfilment hub for locally sourced suppliers comes in. Last week, at SXSW Eco, FoodEx and Foodhub announced a new joint venture where FoodEx will develop the distribution backbone for Foodhub's online marketplace. Massachusetts-based FoodEx has its own trucking fleet, warehouse capacity and an online transaction platform that allows wholesale food buyers to order from a number of different regional producers and then have product delivered through one fulfilment and invoicing system.</p> <p>In doing so FoodEx provides a transparent distribution service for small food producers and buyers that challenges the economic perils of being reliant on third party brokers. In real terms that means a local farmer who normally would have to sell apples to the main wholesale market for as little as $8 (\u00a35) for 50lbs (even though those apples may later be sold to retailers for five times that amount) will now be able to negotiate the price directly with the retailer. And the FoodEx system isn't just wishful thinking. In September it moved $80,000 (\u00a350,000) worth of produce on behalf of farming clients.</p> <p>FoodEx is also committed to creating an aggregated pickup system for farms so that it can maximise the loads its trucks carry. \"We're trying to reinvent how food distribution is going to work,\" FoodEx's founder, JD Kemp, told the SXSW Eco conference.</p> <p>\"That means creating a scalable business model for locally sourced food while doing everything we can not to put extra trucks on the road.\"</p> <p>At present, big food distribution companies in the US, such as Texas-headquartered Sysco, control more than 90% of the distribution market \u2013 so the Foodhub/FoodEx merger isn't exactly going to upset the apple cart, so to speak. But, similar to <a href=\"http://plana.marksandspencer.com/\">Marks &amp; Spencer's Plan A</a>, Walmart's pledge to ethical sourcing and lowering its transportation footprint, along with FedEx's commitment to develop a cleaner transportation fleet demonstrates that even industry giants can be open to change if sustainability makes business sense.</p> <p>\"It's about potatoes, not squash blossoms,\" says Kemp, explaining that sustainable, locally-sourced food needs to be seen as mainstream not niche or artisan. To do that, organisations like Foodhub/FoodEx need to win over not the chefs but the procurement officers at major companies. \"They want food vendors to be like every other vendor,\" Kemp told SXSW Eco.</p> <p>If Foodhub and FoodEx can use the power of their platforms to persuade the big boys of the food economy to take them seriously, they may yet shake up the highly inefficient industry of how we buy and sell our food, and get us eating good food in the process.</p> <p><em>Matthew Yeomans provides editorial consultancy for many companies.

  "<p>\"Wherever children are, we've got to be there with them.\"</p> <p>No, not the words of an overbearing parent. The sentence above is what came from the lips of just about every broadcaster or producer who stepped onto the stage at the MIPJunior conference in Cannes this weekend.</p> <p>The gist: lots of children are using tablets, laptops, smartphones, iPod touches and handheld games devices, so owners of children's brands and/or shows know they need to take them to those platforms. Otherwise children will find other new characters and stories to love who are there.</p> <p>In a research presentation based on a survey in July 2012 of 933 British 7-16 year-olds, 1,120 parents and 202 teachers, Family Kids and Youth managing director Dr Barbie Clarke claimed that 58% of British children aged 7-16 are using a smartphone, tablet or iPod touch, and that of those, 78% download apps.</p> <p>It has finally dawned on the TV industry that significant brands are being built on these devices: Angry Birds, Moshi Monsters, Cut the Rope and Talking Tom Cat being four prominent examples.</p> <p>It's generating a heady mix of fear and excitement. Fear, because the brands above have built fervent fanbases in the tens of millions without needing a TV show to do it. And now they're all making their own animation content.</p> <p>Yet broadcasters, producers and big studios are also quite excited about the potential to follow suit, creating their own new characters and stories on digital platforms (apps and YouTube in particular) and then bringing them back to TV.</p> <p>MIPJunior highlighted both. It had Russian developer ZeptoLab talking about how its two Cut the Rope games have generated 250m downloads and have 50m active monthly players, but also Disney explaining how its first new character created for mobile phones \u2013&#xa0;Swampy the alligator from the Where's My Water? game \u2013&#xa0;had powered to 100m downloads in its first year.</p> <p>Swampy is now sploshing his way to other parts of Disney's business, including animation, merchandise, toys and even amusement parks. Cut the Rope has a TV game-show deal with Sony Pictures Television, while ZeptoLab is making a series of 50 one-minute shorts to be distributed digitally.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Angry Birds has passed 1bn downloads and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/08/angry-birds-star-wars-announced\">announced a partnership with Star Wars</a> that will encompass a new Angry Birds game, as well as a line of toys and merchandise; Moshi Monsters has parlayed its 60m registered users into a multimedia franchise encompassing magazines, music and its own online TV network; and Talking Tom Cat's creator Outfit7 is working with Disney on animated webisodes.</p> <p>This idea of building a children's brand digitally and then (perhaps) bringing it back to TV is catching on. Hence Cartoon Network's boss Stuart Snyder <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/appsblog/2012/oct/06/cartoon-network-mipjunior-stuart-snyder\">telling the MIPJunior audience</a> that \"I don't think everything has to be created as a show. Things can be developed as shorts, they can start as games, they can start as apps.\"</p> <p>Or look at CBeebies, which launched its The Lingo Show on its website, before bringing it back to TV. \"We are looking for more online brand initiation. The Lingo Show started online and went to TV. It would be good to look for more high-quality commissions there,\" said Alison Stewart, head of CBeebies production, animation and acquisitions at the BBC.</p> <p>\"The Lingo Show was a massive success, and it was brilliant to see how that brand grew, and came to TV later. we'd love to be able to do that again with the right commission.\"</p> <p>So, broadcasters are increasingly keen to commission webisodes and apps first, but the independent developers and producers who they might work with are also realising that they can launch ideas without having to wait for a commission.</p> <p>For example, CBeebies' partner on The Lingo Show was Bath-based firm Complete Control. It now has a division devoted to making its own content, including a set of children's characters called the Roodie Noodies who made their debut in an iOS game.</p> <p>\"We didn't know where it fitted,\" said creative director Glynn Hayward. \"We didn't think it was a pre-school show, so we didn't have a natural home for it until the App Store arrived.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397386905\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349712440142/whale-trail.jpg\" alt=\"Whale Trail\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ustwo's Whale Trail has been picked up by Penguin for a storybook app</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>London studio ustwo also talked about its Whale Trail game, which launched in October 2011 and is now nearing 1m downloads across iOS and Android.</p> <p>This brand, too, is branching out, with Penguin Books having signed a licensing deal to turn it into a storybook app, which will be released in December. \"The tagline is currently 'Yellow Submarine for the digital generation',\" said ustwo's creative director of own-IP content Neil McFarland.</p> <p>\"Penguin want to build stories and are looking for great places for those to come from, and they'll take them where they can find them. They saw it as a story that could grow.\"</p> <p>One important trend is the desire of independent producers and developers to retain control of their intellectual property, rather than hand it over wholesale to a broadcaster or publisher.</p> <p>\"Keeping control of IP and being in charge of our own destiny is very important,\" said ZeptoLab chief executive Misha Lyalin. \"We have direct access to an incredible amount of consumers\u2026 I think now it would be foolish to give up on your content ownership.\"</p> <p>Those views were matched by Josh Selig of Little Airplane Productions, whose Small Potatoes pre-school TV show has evolved into a popular Facebook community for teenage girls.</p> <p>\"If you hold onto your IP, you can riff with your IP. You can play, you can experiment. This is the best time in history for experimenting with IP,\" said Selig.</p> <p>In short, this is the state of affairs. Broadcasters want to start building new children's brands online and in apps, and they are increasingly keen to commission independent developers and producers to do it.</p> <p>Yet those independent companies are looking at the App Store and YouTube channels, and wondering if they shouldn't do this themselves first, to build an audience and put themselves in a position to keep hold of more rights if they do a deal with a broadcaster.</p> <p>Fear, excitement and disruption in equal measures. No wonder the children's entertainment industry is such an interesting place right now.</p>",
  "<p><em>The following remarks were prepared for delivery:</em></p> <p>\"I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell. He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy. Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute. It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.<br> For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students. It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders. VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands. Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way. May God bless all who serve, and all who have served. Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall\u2014the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war. General Marshall once said, \"The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.\" Those words were true in his time\u2014and they still echo in ours. Last month, our nation was attacked again. A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead\u2014murdered in Benghazi, Libya. Among the dead were three veterans. All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both. President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America. And he is right. We all mourn their loss. The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting \"Death to America.\" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do. These are the right questions. And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events\u2014and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.  The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East\u2014a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself. The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  We saw all of this in Benghazi last month\u2014but we also saw something else, something hopeful. After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people. They waved signs that read, \"The Ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya is sorry.\" They chanted \"No to militias.\" They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound. Then they burned it to the ground. As one Libyan woman said, \"We are not going to go from darkness to darkness.\" This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. It is the struggle of millions and millions of people\u2014men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers\u2014all of whom have had enough of the darkness. It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making. It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria. In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair. We have seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to George Marshall. In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism. Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts. Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world. We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets. We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies. We led. And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century. This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country\u2014it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership\u2014a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best. And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.  I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out\u2014no one else. But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history\u2014not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama. The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put \"daylight\" between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran. Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability. It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us. And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital. And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, \"Are you with us, or are you with them?\"\u2014the American President was silent. Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.  In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains. The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight. Our ally Turkey has been attacked. And the conflict threatens stability in the region. America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East. The President is fond of saying that \"The tide of war is receding.\" And I want to believe him as much as anyone. But when we look at the Middle East today\u2014with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates\u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office. I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East\u2014friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us. Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\" It is time to change course in the Middle East. That course should be organized around these bedrock principles: America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them\u2026 no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them\u2026 and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words. I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region\u2014and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions\u2014not just words\u2014that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security\u2014the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf. And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure. The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow. The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war. The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines. I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark. I will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results. I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs. And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government\u2014to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities\u2026 to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary\u2026 and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property. I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years. I will reverse that failure. I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones. I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies. In Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.  In Egypt, I will use our influence\u2014including clear conditions on our aid\u2014to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran\u2014rather than sitting on the sidelines. It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.  And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation. Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew. There is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East\u2014and it is not unique to that region. It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well\u2014 in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are \"pivoting\" away from them \u2026 in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region \u2026 and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security. But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked: \"Where does America stand?\" I know many Americans are asking a different question: \"Why us?\" I know many Americans are asking whether our country today\u2014with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war\u2014is still capable of leading.  I believe that if America does not lead, others will\u2014others who do not share our interests and our values\u2014and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years. I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence\u2014wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively\u2014to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better\u2014not perfect, but better.  Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership. They want more\u2014more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies. So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind. So many people still have faith in America. We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves\u2014that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events. Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall: \"He \u2026 always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.\" That is the role our friends want America to play again. And it is the role we must play.  The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity.

  "<p>Just over a week after its fighters abandoned their last major stronghold in southern Somalia, al-Shabaab have banned Muslim aid group <a href=\"http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Islamic Relief</a> from the territory it controls, threatening programmes for more than a million people in an area where food and water shortages are still critical a year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/30/somalia-famine-aid-refugees-shabaab\" title=\"\">after famine</a>.</p> <p>In a statement on Twitter, al-Shabaab said it had officially revoked Islamic Relief's permit to work in areas under its control \u2013 an ill-defined territory, the frontiers of which have become ever more fluid since the al-Qaida-linked militants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia\" title=\"\">pulled out of the port city of Kismayo on 28 September</a> with Kenyan troops and their Somali allies closing in.</p> <p>British-registered Islamic Relief \u2013 funded by British and European donors, among others \u2013 was previously one of the few international organisations able to work directly in al-Shabaab territory.</p> <p>The militants, who have imposed a harsh form of sharia law in the areas they hold, are deeply hostile to western aid agencies, and angered locals by banning food aid in the south during last year's drought, in which tens of thousands of Somalis died. Last November, they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/28/al-shabaab-bans-aid-agencies-somalia\" title=\"\">banned</a> about 16 aid agencies from the south.</p> <p>Iftikhar Ahmad Shaheen, regional director for east Africa at Islamic Relief, said al-Shabaab's tweet came as a shock, with staff on the ground given no warning of the militants' decision. \"Normally, al-Shabaab will talk to you first, then they will show their dissatisfaction,\" he said. \"We didn't hear anything from them whatsoever for the past month \u2026 The staff [in Somalia] didn't know anything.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said on Twitter: \"Islamic Relief has repeatedly failed, despite the persistent warnings, to comply with the operational guidelines.\" It also said the group was \"found covertly extending the operations of banned organisations, particularly WFP\", referring to the UN's <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/\" title=\"\">World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>WFP has had no access to al-Shabaab areas since January 2010, and a spokeswoman in Nairobi said the agency was neither working directly nor indirectly with any humanitarian organisations in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab.</p> <p>Shaheen also denied al-Shabaab's allegations. \"I can testify that to the best of my knowledge, for the past five to six years, Islamic Relief has never worked with WFP in Somalia,\" Shaheen said.</p> <p>Shaheen said his group would try to engage with al-Shabaab to resolve the situation. \"If this decision is confirmed, it could put many lives at risk, jeopardising our work providing food, water, sanitation, healthcare and support for income generation to 1.3 million people in Somalia,\" he said.</p> <p>Under pressure from African Union peacekeeping force Amisom, Somali troops and allied militias, the al-Shabaab militants have been forced to abandon a string of towns this year, taking refuge in the bush or resorting to hit-and-run attacks or suicide bombs in the capital Mogadishu and elsewhere. It is not clear where the rebels went after leaving Kismayo. In the past, they have abandoned towns or villages without engaging Amisom troops, only to launch attacks later.</p> <p>Shaheen said his group's ability to continue working in the south, where Kenyan and Somali forces are extending their control of Kismayo, would depend on the tactics adopted by al-Shabaab as it adapts to life without a major base. Kismayo was a key financial asset for the militants, who earned money from charcoal exports and taxes levied on local businesses. \"If they don't become hostile against the agency, we can continue working. It depends on the mode they take,\" Shaheen said.</p> <p>Although the situation in Somalia has improved since last year, a <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-10-08/new-survey-somalia-food-crisis-remains-critical-likely-worsen\" title=\"\">report by Oxfam on Monday</a> warned that food and water shortages were at critical levels in the south and likely to deteriorate.</p> <p>Oxfam surveyed about 1,800 households across 40 regions and found 72% of those questioned were concerned about not having enough to eat during the next four months, with 42% saying they were skipping meals.</p> <p>April to June rains were below average in many areas, and this hit harvests. Although there is little danger of another famine, Oxfam warned that southern Somalia \u2013 especially parts of the Gedo region, Lower Juba and Bakool \u2013 was still in crisis, especially given the conflict and risk of flooding during the October to January rains.</p> <p>The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit <a href=\"http://www.fsnau.org/in-focus/somalia-post-gu-2012-food-security-and-nutrition-outlook-august-december-2012\" title=\"\">said in August</a> that, while the number of people in need has decreased, approximately 2.12 million people would face food insecurity for the remainder of this year. It has estimated that 236,000 children in Somalia remain acutely malnourished.</p> <p>With the rains due to start again soon, Somalia also faces the threat of flooding, which could contaminate its paltry existing water supplies and increase the risk of water-borne diseases such as cholera. There have already been floods in Hiran province.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith have revived the prospect of removing housing benefit from people aged under 25 as part of a further package of welfare cuts worth \u00a310bn. In typically divisive language, they ask: \"Is it right that school leavers should be able to move directly from school to a life on housing benefit without finding a job first?\"</p> <p>Prime minister David Cameron originally floated the idea in June. His justification? \"There are many [claiming housing benefit] who will have a parental home and somewhere to stay \u2013 they just want more independence.\"</p> <p>Is the prime minister correct to assume young people on housing benefit can and will be able to move back to live with their parents? If history tells us anything, I think not.</p> <p>Before housing benefit, young people living in hotels, hostels and similar accommodation claimed board and lodgings allowance. In 1985, Margaret Thatcher's government reformed it by capping the level of allowance and then removing it after eight weeks in cities such as London for the under-26s. The parallels with Cameron's proposals are straight forward. Removal of benefit and entitlement based on age, not need. Just like the Conservatives of 2012, the Conservatives of 1985 claimed young adults would flock home to their parents.</p> <p>As now, others disagreed. The social security advisory committee warned: \"We think the major problem with the proposals is the risk of creating a class of rootless young people \u2026 we do not believe it can be assumed that adequate alternative accommodation is open to claimants under 26 either in the public or private sector, or that permanent residence with parents or friends is an option which is realistically available.\"</p> <p>The committee was proved right. A 1998 report by Crisis noted: \"[The reforms] were undoubtedly a factor in the continued rise in the level of single homelessness throughout the 1990s.\"</p> <p>St Mungos say a key reason why people end up sleeping rough is a difficult family background. The simple fact is, for some young people housing benefit is the only safeguard they have from a life on the streets. Without it, the journey from home to homelessness can be a very slippery slope.</p> <p>And yet, as bad as the situation was in the 1980s and 1990s, the context today is worse. The number of people sleeping rough is accelerating. In London last year, rough sleeping increased by 43%.</p> <p>This has been driven to some extent by the government cutting the supporting people budget by an estimated 11%. This, combined with the removal of the ringfence that guaranteed this money was spent on helping vulnerable groups like rough sleepers, has led many local authorities to use that money to plug the gaps in other budgets and cut hostel provision.</p> <p>At the same time, Cameron's government is actively preventing young adults from returning to the family home. In social housing, the bedroom tax on tenants with spare rooms will force families into downsizing once their children move away to university or to find work.</p> <p>In the private rented sector, we now know that many London families are moving to smaller flats in order to fit within new caps on local housing allowance.</p> <p>This government's housing policies are completely incompatible with each other. It has created a policy framework that will force more young adults out of the family home and prevent many from returning.</p> <p>The prime minister and his cabinet are wedded to driving forward the same old failed Thatcherite agenda, wilfully ignoring the housing crisis at the root of so many social and economic problems. Meanwhile, they divert attention by picking on those most affected by this crisis.</p> <p><em>Nicky Gavron is a Labour London Assembly member and London group spokesperson for housing and planning, Follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickygavron\" title=\"\"><em>@nickygavron</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more debate, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",

  "<p>ProfJohn <a href=\"http://www.hagelin.org/about.html\" title=\"\">Hagelin</a>'s decision not to run against Mitt Romney and Barack Obama left this year's US presidential race without a major candidate who is a scientist and who acknowledges \u2013 publicly \u2013 his ability to both counteract gravity and prevent crime.</p> <p>Two decades ago, Hagelin and a team of fellow scientists performed a bold experiment. Their aim was to drastically reduce the amount of violent crime in Washington DC \u2013 a metropolis then noted for its high incidence of murder, rape and robbery. The Hagelin method was to systematically blanket the city with mental emanations from transcendental meditation and yogic flying.</p> <p>Hagelin is, by his own admission, a remarkable man. A professor of physics and director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy at the <a href=\"http://www.mum.edu/\" title=\"\">Maharishi University of Management</a>, in Fairfield, Iowa, he is a practised expert in quantum physics, transcendental meditation and yogic flying.</p> <p>Hagelin ran for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000, as the Natural Law Party's designated candidate. He was not elected in any of those years. In the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm\" title=\"\">election of 2000</a>, he lost to George W Bush by only 50,372,288 votes and to Al Gore by 50,916,183 votes. The Natural Law Party, based at the <a href=\"http://istpp.org/\" title=\"\">Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy</a>, has since closed its national office.</p> <p>In 1993 Hagelin invented his crime-prevention recipe. His method consists of \"forming coherence groups in major cities to lower the stress throughout our society, in order to alleviate the prime cause of criminality\". In plain words, he pays people to meditate, and levitate themselves off carpets. When a sufficient number of skilled people do this at the same time and in the same place, the crime rate drops. It's a simple as that.</p> <p>Hagelin demonstrated this anti-crime technique in the summer of 1993. From 7 June to 30 July, 4,000 trained meditators meditated and levitated in or near Washington DC.</p> <p>At a press conference the following year, just weeks before the presidential election, candidate Hagelin announced the <a href=\"http://www.pnyv.org/fileadmin/images_articles/reports/Tm-Maharishi-Study.pdf\" title=\"\">results</a> of the experiment: it was a success. While the meditators were meditating and levitating, Washington's crime rate dropped by 18%.</p> <p>This was a fact. The crime rate did drop by 18%. However, the rate that dropped by 18% was not the number of crimes actually committed \u2013 in fact, during the experiment, Washington's weekly murder count hit the highest level ever recorded. The 18% drop was from Hagelin's computer prediction of what would have happened had his meditators not been meditating and levitating.</p> <p>For his influence on criminals, John Hagelin was awarded the 1994 <a href=\"http://www.improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig1994\" title=\"\">Ig Nobel Peace Prize</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Marc Abrahams is organiser of the Ig Nobel prizes and editor of the Annals of Improbable Research</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What has George Osborne announced?</strong></h2> <p>New employees will be able to <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/press_91_12.htm\" title=\"BIS: No capital gains tax on employee share ownership for new owner-employees \">exchange some of their employment rights for shares in the business they work for</a>, any gains on which will be exempt from capital gains tax (CGT).</p> <h2><strong>What is CGT?</strong></h2> <p>It is a tax you pay when you sell an asset, and is charged on the difference between its value at the time you acquire it and its value when you dispose of it. If, for example, you were given \u00a32,000 of shares and sold them some years later for \u00a320,000, the gain would be \u00a318,000. However, each tax year you are allowed to make a set amount before paying tax \u2013 in the current tax year CGT does not kick in until you have made at least \u00a310,600 from selling assets.</p> <h2><strong>How will it work?</strong></h2> <p>Detail is scarce, but the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills says employees can be given between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000 of shares exempt from CGT. In return they will give up their rights on unfair dismissal, redundancy and the right to request flexible working and time off for training, and will be required to provide 16 weeks' notice of a firm date of return from maternity leave instead of the usual eight.</p> <h2>Will it be optional?</h2> <p>Companies will be able to decide if they want to use the scheme. They will be able to offer the new type of contract as an option to existing employees, but will be able to force it on new recruits if they choose. The government plans to bring the rules into force in April 2013.</p> <h2><strong>What are the current rules on unfair dismissal, redundancy and flexible working?</strong></h2> <p>Employees who have been unfairly dismissed can, within three months, take a claim to a tribunal if they have been with a company for at least two years, unless they were employed before 6 April 2012 in which case it is a year.</p> <p>If they have been dismissed for an \"automatically unfair\" reason they can make a claim regardless of how long they worked for their employer (automatically unfair includes when an employee tries to exercise one of their statutory employment rights such as taking time off for parental leave).</p> <p>If you are made redundant you should be entitled to statutory redundancy pay if you have worked for your employer for at least two years. The amount you are entitled to will be based on your weekly pay, age and continuous employment.</p> <p>If you have a statutory right to ask for flexible working \u2013 for example, if you have a child under 17 and have worked for longer than 26 weeks at a company \u2013 your employer must, by law, seriously consider an application you make, and only reject it if there are good business reasons for doing so.</p> <p>Under Osborne's plan, employees taking the share option will no longer have the above rights.</p> <h2><strong>Which companies will be able to do it?</strong></h2> <p>The government said companies of any size will be able to use this kind of contract, although it is \"principally intended for fast growing small- and medium-sized companies that want to create a flexible workforce.\"</p> <p>In theory this means any large company could employ people on the new-style contract, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of workers across the country losing their employment rights. In reality, employer groups say the contracts are a niche idea and the number of businesses who adopt the scheme may be small.</p> <h2><strong>What's the benefit for employees?</strong></h2> <p>It is difficult to see what benefit there is beyond the possible financial bonus of a shareholding increasing in value and not attracting CGT. However, mature companies are unlikely to see stratospheric share price gains in the short term, while small, fast-growing businesses are by no means guaranteed to survive let alone exhibit good returns.</p> <p>If you received \u00a32,000 in shares and they increased by 100% you would still only have \u00a34,000 but could be sacked tomorrow. Moreover, smart investors outside the scheme would simply sell off their shares in separate tax years or offset their capital gains against something else anyway, making the \"perk\" in the new contract pointless.</p> <p>It is unclear whether employees would be able to accept \u00a32,000-\u00a350,000 in shares and then quit the next day, keeping their bounty.</p> <h2><strong>What's the benefit for employers?</strong></h2> <p>Companies will be able to employ people and fire them at a stroke, without any repercussions. However, the government is consulting on making sure that if an employee leaves or is dismissed the company is not able to simply take the shares back but must buy them back \"at a reasonable price\".</p>",
  "<p>Shale gas is the great hope of George Osborne and his fellow Conservatives who detest what they see in the renewable energy sector: subsidy junkies and woolly minded greens. But in a brief section of <a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\" title=\"\">his speech to his party conference on Monday</a>, he managed to give comfort to both. \"An enterprise strategy means investing in renewable energy,\" he said, a far warmer phrase than in previous speeches and presumably wrung out of him by the Lib Dems. But then he completed the sentence: \"... and opening up the newly discovered shale gas reserves beneath our land.\"</p> <p>\"We are today consulting on a generous new tax regime for shale so that Britain is not left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic,\" said Osborne. It's certainly true that the shale gas industry in the UK needs all the help it can get, having drilled only a handful of wells, far short of the hundreds or thousands needed to really know how much gas could be released by fracking. Furthermore, the CBI and Deutsche Bank among others <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/03/shale-gas-game-changer-fracking\" title=\"\">have said there can be no repetition of the US gas miracle</a>, given differences in mineral rights, population density and environmental regulations.</p> <p>The Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, illustrated the tension with the chancellor by giving <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/gastech_ed/gastech_ed.aspx\" title=\"\">a speech on gas on Monday,</a> in which he said: \"I know that industry analysts do see shale as a rather different proposition here than in the US. Questions about regulatory oversight and the involvement of local communities need to be answered rather than simply dismissed. And, of course, the deployment of any new energy source must be consistent with our carbon plan and carbon budgets.\"</p> <p>The government's dilemma on gas, courting investors for a 50% increase in the number of gas-fired power stations on the grid while insisting that carbon reduction targets can still be met, was neatly illustrated by Ed Davey's morning. After delivering a speech at the <a href=\"http://www.gastech.co.uk/conference/\" title=\"\">Gastech conference</a> in east London, in which he promised a golden future for gas-fired power generation in the UK as many as 20 new power stations to be built, he was whisked across the river <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EUClimateAction\" title=\"\">to City Hall to extol the government's climate change policy</a>, which he said included tougher carbon reduction targets for the EU.</p> <p>It left his audience wondering how the two \u2013 a massive expansion of fossil-fuelled power while cutting greenhouse gases \u2013 could be compatible.</p> <p>Connie Hedegaard, the European commissioner for climate change, who shared his platform at the second event, said: \"Gas can be part of the solution, but it definitely can't be the whole solution. It's clear that with renewable energy you get a much more longer term and sustainable solution. That's why we need CO2 targets and renewable targets.\"</p> <p>The UK opposes setting a European renewable energy target beyond 2020, when the current one expires.</p> <p>The reaction to Osborne's announcement ranged from lukewarm praise to fiery opposition. One government source said: \"It will make no difference to the pace of the decision [on whether shale gas gets the go-ahead]. But its not totally ridiculous as preparation for the decision.\"</p> <p>Some sections of the energy industry were unimpressed. Volker Beckers, chief executive of RWE npower, one of the UK's big six energy company, told me: \"There will be very little volumes of shale gas in the UK. We have more major [energy] problems to solve.\"</p> <p>Laura Sandys, Conservative MP and part of the ministerial team at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), highlighted the problem of public opposition shale gas is likely to face: \"Onshore wind is a walk in the park, by comparison.\"</p> <p>Mild praise came from CBI director-general, John Cridland, who said: \"It makes sense to maximise the amount of energy we can produce at home at reasonable cost. [This] sits alongside investment in renewables. I don't want all my eggs in one energy basket.\"</p> <p>But Friends of the Earth's Craig Bennett said: \"The chancellor clearly isn't listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas. With a fossil-fuelled economic strategy firmly rooted in the 1970s, George Osborne is looking increasingly incapable of dealing with the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>Campaigners also doubted that the government could square the circle of more gas while cutting carbon drastically overall. WWF-UK pointed to a set of scenarios it commisioned last year showing that to decarbonise the electricity sector by 2030, as Mr Davey has proposed, gas plants would only be able to run infrequently as back up to renewables. That is unlikely to appeal to investors, who expect to receive a return for the 25 year life of their power stations.</p> <p>The consultation on shale gas will not be a formal one, but rather an \"engagement with industry\". A statement from the Treasury said: \"With the shale gas industry at an early stage of development, the government believes that a targeted tax regime will help unlock investment. The use of field allowances to encourage investment in the North Sea has demonstrated the effectiveness of a targeted tax regime in stimulating investment and production that would not otherwise have gone ahead. The government will engage with companies to ensure that the final structure of the regime is appropriately targeted while maintaining a fair return for the exchequer.\"</p> <p>Osborne's speech also comes against the background of two key letters today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target\" title=\"\">One from companies including Asda, Microsoft and EDF</a> calling for a 2030 target for carbon emissions from power stations, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">and a second from nuclear and wind energy companies</a> including Areva, Siemens and Vestas calling on the government to firm up its green commitment or lose hundreds of millions of pounds of investment.</p>",
  "<p>The evictions of Somalia's al-Shabaab from its stronghold in Kismayo, and of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/22/libyan-protesters-militia-benghazi\" title=\"\">Ansar al-Sharia from Benghazi in Libya</a> are the latest successes in a concerted, US-driven effort to eradicate al-Qaida-related groups from the Middle East and Africa. But it is doubtful that this is the end of extremism in either location, or that force of arms will deliver long-lasting security solutions in the region.</p> <p>We have witnessed similar events before. Iraq produced the template: al-Qaida-linked fighters are driven out against a backdrop of burgeoning local hostility, only to return when the military \u2013 and social \u2013 climate is more favourable.</p> <p>This pattern began with America's 2006-07 \"awakening\" and \"surge\" campaigns in Iraq. To counteract the growing influence of the al-Qaida-dominated Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), local Sunni tribes were \"awakened\" from their tolerance of the group by a combination of the extremists' own over-zealous prosecution of sharia law and hefty American bribes. Turning the tribes against the ISI paved the way for a concentrated military operation \u2013 the \"surge\" \u2013 involving thousands of extra American troops, to drive the extremists out.</p> <p>Following the Iraqi surge, hundreds of Islamist fighters \"migrated\" to Afghanistan. On the extremists' part, this is a deliberate strategy known as hijra (migration or flight) \u2013 a reference to the hijra of the prophet Muhammad and his companions from Mecca to Medina to evade a murderous onslaught. Later, when President Obama deployed an extra 47,000 troops there during 2009-10, the Islamist fighters drifted back again.</p> <p>By then, Iraq's Sunni tribes were increasingly at odds with the Shia-dominated, US-backed government which they felt discriminated against them. Consequently, they were less hostile to the poisonously sectarian ISI, which was able to re-establish itself.</p> <p>At the end of 2011, US troops withdrew from Iraq, opening the floodgates for an ISI surge of its own. This year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/al-qaida-surge-iraq-jihadist\" title=\"\">Operation Breaking Walls</a> resulted in more than 400 deaths during the month of Ramadan alone.</p> <p>It seems likely that we will see a similar pattern repeated in Libya and Somalia. Dispersal is an acceptable outcome for al-Qaida-type groups whose survival depends on mobility. Hence the recent, rather baffled, reports from Kismayo and Benghazi that, following the September 11 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/chris-stevens-us-ambassador-libya-killed\" title=\"\">murder of the US ambassador, Christopher Stevens</a>, and three other diplomats in Benghazi, the extremists \"just melted away\", abandoning offices and weapons without a struggle. Some of its fighters will undoubtedly have progressed to Syria, currently a magnet for international jihadists, while the rest have gone underground.</p> <p>The present US-inspired weapons amnesty in Benghazi \u2013 which offers iPods, laptops and the chance to win a new car in exchange for surrendered arms \u2013 is reminiscent of the awakening campaign. And like that campaign, it misunderstands the nature of loyalty in a tribal society, believing it can be bought.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the extremists are among those queuing to swap guns for raffle tickets and, by confronting them rather than attempting to absorb them into the fabric of the new Libya, the American strategy further polarises a society that is already struggling to establish its first \"national unity\" government. The prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/libyan-prime-minister-abushagur-dismissed?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Mustafa Abushagur</a>, has been dismissed by a vote of no confidence after 25 days during which he proposed two cabinets, both of which failed to win approval.</p> <p>In Somalia too, al-Shabaab's current defeat at the hands of US-trained, mostly Kenyan, troops, has a backdrop of tumbling popularity among the all-powerful local clans, many of whom supported the group until it banned western aid organisations from areas it controlled during last summer's drought and famine.</p> <p>While al-Shabaab may have temporarily melted away to its remaining strongholds in the interior, Somalis have long blamed the chaos and instability that has plagued them for more than 20 years on \"foreigners\" and outside interference \u2013 an analysis they share with the Islamists.</p> <p>If the new president ,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">Hassan Sheikh Mohamud</a>, is unable to function without hefty international support the country is still, effectively, ungovernable and elements of the population may once again look to al-Shabaab to provide some semblance of (albeit extremist) law and order and reject the manipulations of the west. The same dilemma exists in Hamid Karzai's Afghanistan, and the new Libyan regime has yet to prove its ability to go it alone.</p> <p>The network of al-Qaida-related groups has widened over the years, and the security vacuums created by the Arab spring have afforded them new opportunities, particularly in Libya, Yemen, Mali and Syria; hundreds of jihadi \"migrants\" have converged on the latter, adding to its woes.</p> <p>At the same time, the regional drive for democracy presents a real chance to break the Iraq-style cycle of migration and return. If newly elected Muslim governments were able to fill the gaps left by dispersed extremist groups with stability, justice and security of their own making, such groups would have no further role and may look, instead, to participate in the political process.</p>",
  "<p>Businesses will be allowed to remove \"gold-plated employment rights\" in exchange for handing out shares to employees which will be exempt from tax, George Osborne has said.</p> <p>In his Tory conference speech on Monday, the chancellor unveiled a \u00a3100m \"employee-owner\" scheme that will allow shares worth \u00a32,000 to \u00a350,000 to be exempt from tax if employees give up certain work rights, such as the right to claim unfair dismissal. He said the measure was aimed at the tens of thousands of small and medium-sized firms.</p> <p>The chancellor's plan would allow businesses hiring staff to insist they forfeit employment rights in two broad areas in exchange for the shares, which would be exempt from capital-gains tax. Existing employees would have the right to refuse.</p> <p>Employees would:</p> <p>\u2022 Give up their rights under UK law on unfair dismissal, redundancy and the right to request flexible working and time off for training.</p> <p>\u2022 Women would have to give twice as much notice of the date when they want to return from maternity leave. Women currently have to give eight weeks, but this would increase to 16.</p> <p>During his speech, Osborne also confirmed he would seek an additional \u00a310bn of welfare cuts from 2015-16, and that 80% of the deficit reduction would be borne by spending cuts rather than tax rises.</p> <p>The last budget had outlined detailed plans for \u00a36bn of welfare cuts in 2015-16 and \u00a310bn the year after but Osborne would like to go faster.</p> <p>Tory sources said senior Liberal Democrats had agreed these broad numbers, but none of the detail of how they would be achieved.</p> <p>These announcements were coupled in Osborne's speech with a promise to stick to his plans to cut the deficit. He said he would not repeat the mistake of Edward Heath in 1972, who \"two years into office was faced with economic problems and over powerful unions buckled and gave up\".</p> <p>He signalled that some of the cuts would come from freezing benefits. He said: \"How can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work?\"</p> <p>\"Where is the fairness, we ask, for the shift worker leaving home in the dark hours of early morning, who looks up at the closed blinds of their next door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits\".</p> <p>The chancellor also indicated he would cut child-tax credit for larger families and maintain the current housing benefit budget by withdrawing benefits to those aged 25 and under. He defended his strategy and claimed the economy \"is healing\", but \"we will finish the job we have started\".</p> <p>Osborne said taxes for the most well-off would be increased over the next few years, but he ruled out a mansion tax or temporary wealth tax. \"Even Denis Healey thought this was a bad idea,\" he added.</p> <p>He said he would not introduce a tax on homes because \"it would be sold as a mansion tax, but once the tax inspector had his foot in the door you'd soon find most homes in the country labelled a mansion. It's not a mansion tax, it's a homes tax, and this party of home ownership will have no truck with it.\" He promised to look for more income from tougher tax evasion.</p> <p>He added: \"Just as we should never balance the budget on the backs of the poor, so it is an economic delusion to think you can balance it only on the wallets of the rich.\"</p> <p>Discussing the coming spending review, Osborne said: \"Our published plans require us to find \u00a316bn of further savings and ... the broadest shoulders will continue to bear the greatest burden.\"</p> <p>More broadly, the chancellor admitted his forecasts had been blown off course. \"The truth is, the damage done by the debts and the banking crisis was worse than we feared. The rise in world oil prices has been larger than anyone forecast. And sadly the predictions that you made, I made, that almost everyone has made, about the euro turned out to be true\".</p> <p>He attacked critics such as Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, saying: \"Our critics gamble everything: our credibility, our financial stability, our low interest rates, the cost of our debt \u2013 they would risk everything on the dubious idea that a few billion more of spending would dramatically improve the fortunes of a trillion and a half-pound British economy.\"</p> <p>He said he wanted the Conservatives to be a one-nation party that speaks for the corner-shop owner, the teacher, the commuter and pensioner. \"They are all part of one nation \u2013 one nation working together to get on.\"</p> <p>Osborne also made a surprise announcement that he would be consulting on generous tax breaks for the shale gas industry, a move designed to mirror tax deals being offered in the US.</p> <p>It was not clear how much the energy department knew about the proposal, but Ed Davey, the energy secretary, told a gas conference in London on Monday that he hoped to lift a suspension on shale gas exploration that had been imposed last year amid concerns over the technology used to exploit it.</p> <p>\"I hope it will prove possible for me to give a green light to shale,\" Davey said.</p>",
  "<p>The number of Afghan families growing cannabis as a cash crop leapt by more than a third last year, the UN has said.</p> <p>The increase adds to the drug-control problem in a country that is already the world's top producer of opium.</p> <p>Prices for the best quality resin have nearly tripled since 2009, to $95 (\u00a360) a kilogramme, adding to the lure of a crop that can earn farmers more than opium poppies. It is also is generally looked on more leniently by authorities targeting drug crops.</p> <p>As a result, Afghanistan's importance as a source of cannabis resin for world markets may be growing, the report warns, as other producers, such as Morocco, are producing a smaller share.</p> <p>Afghan farmers were expected to produce around 1,300 tonnes of cannabis in 2011, the Afghanistan cannabis survey estimated. That is a similar amount to the previous two years, but with many more farmers turning to the crop.</p> <p>Jean-Luc Lemahieu, the head of the UNODC office in Afghanistan, said: \"It is clear that while the domestic consumption is very high, it does not nearly cover the 1,300 tons produced during 2011. The export of cannabis is thus a significant economic life line.\"</p> <p>Around 65,000 households grew cannabis in 2011, compared with 47,000 the year before, its said. The survey omits \"kitchen garden\" growers, who cultivate a handful of plants for themselves or to sell locally: these are believed to produce a tiny fraction of the national crop.</p> <p>\"The cannabis price rise has developed in parallel with the opium price hike caused by the opium crop failure in 2010, making its per-hectare income similar to that of opium and thus financially very attractive to farmers,\" the UN report said.</p> <p>\"But because cannabis cultivation is less labour intensive \u2013 less weeding is involved and the extraction of 'garda' (powdered cannabis resin) can be done at home in a matter of weeks with the help of family members instead of hired labour \u2013 it is actually more cost-effective than opium.\"</p> <p>Unlike opium, which matures rapidly and needs little irrigation, cannabis is a water-intensive crop that needs a long time to grow, prohibiting the planting of another crop. Partly for this reason, farmers tend to grow the plant on a sporadic basis rather than every year.</p> <p>But the two illicit crops often coexist, with the centre of cannabis cultivation shifting from the north to the opium poppy heartland in the south over the last five years, the report said.</p> <p>\"There is a clear geographical association between opium and cannabis cultivation at the provincial level,\" the report said. \"That association exists at a household level, too, with almost two thirds of cannabis-growing households (58%) also reporting poppy cultivation in the preceding season.\"</p> <p>Three-quarters of farmers said they grew the crop because of high sales prices; the 2011 crop was worth around $95m, the UN estimated, although this was less than the 2010 crop. That year, a larger crop was produced, but by fewer households.</p>",
  "<p>Employment lawyers and the business community have reacted with surprise at George Osborne's plans to allow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/osborne-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog\" title=\"George Osborne's speech at the Conservative conference: Politics live blog\">employers to force new workers to swap their employment rights for a stake in their new company</a>.</p> <p>The idea, which will see firms offer shares worth between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000 to employees who agree to waive rights around unfair dismissal, flexible working and maternity leave, was described as \"niche\" and likely to open up more opportunities for tax abuse or avoidance.</p> <p>John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"In some of Britain's cutting-edge entrepreneurial companies, the option of share ownership may be attractive to workers, rather than some of their employment rights. But I think this is a niche idea and not relevant to all businesses.\"</p> <p>Barry Stanton, head of the employment group at Boyes Turner LLP, said there was \"no guarantee\" that companies which adopted the scheme would be more inclined to act fairly in dismissing employees who are also owners of the business. \"Ownership of \u00a32,000 of shares is not going to count for much in many businesses,\" he said.</p> <p>He added that the biggest surprise is employers will be able to force new recruits to sign up to these contracts from April 2013. \"This is likely to have a significant impact, particularly among technology companies where shares might commonly have been offered already. Those companies are likely to be at the forefront of the use of these new contracts. For some businesses these are the only contracts that will be offered, and new employees will have no right to complain of unfair dismissal.\"</p> <p>But Stanton said Osborne was unable to tamper with anything that affected employment rights derived from EU law. \"Employees under the new contracts will retain protection against discrimination, which is governed by EU law.\"</p> <p>Alan Higham who has run small businesses on and off for 11 years said he wouldn't use the scheme. \"I worry it would create suspicion among employees that I might sack them unfairly. Employees wouldn't easily be able to see the value in the shares today.\"</p> <p>Higham said there could also be hidden costs to companies: \"If I employ 10 staff and decided to give them \u00a32,000 each of shares, then I would need to spend \u00a310,000 in getting a professional valuation done.</p> <p>\"Under current tax rules I would also have paid them \u00a32,000 each to change their contract, on which PAYE and national insurance would be charged. As this is a gift I would also have to pay tax on this. On this basis it could cost me \u00a310,000 and a further \u00a39,400 to give away \u00a320,000 of shares. There will probably also be some sort of ongoing admin and HMRC compliance to do, which will also cost.\"</p> <p>Tim Johnson, a tax adviser, said that because details were sparse it was difficult to know what the effect would be: \"I've no objection to the principle, but it appears just the sort of fiddly change to the tax system that will be little used and simply clutter it up. It will also likely open up more opportunities for abuse/avoidance and create work for tax advisers.\"</p> <p>Stanton wondered whether the opposition would be able to easily reverse it: \"If Labour restore employment protection to owner-employees, will the employees have to give back the shares or can they get the best of both worlds by keeping the shares and having their rights restored?\"</p> <p>Paul Callaghan, partner in the employment team at Taylor Wessing, said: \"Osborne is potentially forcing all new employees to waive the main employment rights including unfair dismissal and redundancy rights in exchange for \u00a32,000 of shares. This makes Adrian Beecroft's fire at will proposals look moderate.</p> <p>\"From April it may become the norm for job offers to require this waiver which will also involve the loss of flexible working rights and stricter maternity rights. This is likely to have a disproportionate effect on women.\"</p> <p>Selwyn Blyth at Pinsent Masons said there could be a cultural shift involved as businesses would be forced, to some degree, to move from a culture of the \"managers and the managed\" to one where employees have an increasing say over how the business is run.</p> <p>\"Employers could still face a tribunal claim if these newly contracted out employees felt their dismissal was discriminatory. However, for those employers who do choose to go down this route, these plans would give them more flexibility than they have ever had before to dismiss workers without fear of litigation.\"</p>",

  "<p>Sole practitioners have been having a hard time in the wake of the Legal Services Act 2007, which opened the door for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/06/alternative-business-structures-solicitors\" title=\"\">alternative business structures (ABSs</a>). These new forms of legal practice have given household names like the Co-op and the AA the opportunity to expand their legal offerings to consumers and have allowed law firms to be managed and owned by non-lawyers.</p> <p>The death knell had already sounded for many one-partner firms following cuts in legal aid. A significant challenge for the survivors is the burden of regulation. Roger Buston, sole practitioner and executive committee member of the Law Society's property section, believes there is too much regulation by the <a href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk\" title=\"\">Solicitors Regulation Authority</a> (SRA): \"We are now faced with an ongoing burdensome fundamental regime based upon outcomes focused regulation from the SRA and continuing professional development from our own professional bodies,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Like most small businesses I do find some regulation excessive,\" says Susan Singleton. \"Thankfully I employ no one and do not hold clients' money so that relieves me of much of it, but if I want to provide 30 minutes of advice to a client in Saudia Arabia or the USA by internet I need to spend at least as long obtaining original ID from them. It is disproportionate, off-putting to clients and not, as far as I know, something the government is even tackling in its supposed bonfire of the regulations.\"</p> <p>The SRA's requirement for compliance officers for legal practice (COLP) and compliance officers for financial and administration (COFA) is an added administrative burden for law firms, but, says Singleton, \"it is really easy in a firm of this size to be both the COLP and COFA. The rules are nothing like as complex as people - usually consultants selling things - want to make out.\"</p> <p>Further problems for one-partner firms include securing affordable indemnity insurance and getting onto mortgage lenders' panels. Nicola Phillips was, until recently, a conveyancing sole practitioner in Horsham, but recently obtained an ABS licence and is now in partnership with her mother. \"Sole practitioners have a hard time as the public generally think you will not have the same things in place as a large company,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Lots of lenders do not let sole practitioners on the panel. Getting PII insurance has been ok but the cost is high so you really need the work coming in and the lenders' panel restrictions means you have to have another solicitor act for the lender which has to be paid for by the firm.\" Being a two-partner firm has helped Phillips get on a number of mortgage lender panels and, she says, should help with joint referral schemes as these are often not open to sole practitioners.</p> <p>Buston believes the difficulties sole practitioners face when they try to get on lenders' panels lie with lenders' misconceptions rather than inherent inadequacies of sole practitioners. \"Some mortgage lenders labour under the mistaken impression that the size of a legal firm is the appropriate determinant for both its probity and its competence,\" he says. \"Smaller firms are more likely to undertake a bespoke service built upon client recommendation. Simply having a different and more traditional set of standards and business model does not by itself suggest a lack of probity or competence.\"</p> <p>Forward thinking sole practitioners are embracing new opportunities: the fact that they are able to be more flexible and to diversify more readily than larger firms can be an advantage and they may not be quite the casualty of ABS that naysayers predict. Niche sole practitioner firms, in particular, can be relatively secure: \"I do not see ABSs as a threat at all. Very few people even in larger firms have my experience in the specialist areas [competition law and intellectual property] in which I practice,\" says Singleton.</p> <p>Phillips warns that for others longevity is less certain: \"I do not think many sole practitioners will survive these times unless they really do their marketing and form good relationships with local papers and networking groups and those in areas who can refer work.\"</p>",

But, he said private investors were \"queuing up\" to get involved, and the \"time was ripe for community finance organisations to put their money in at the early stage and reap the rewards later\".</p> <p>Community-funded energy projects are much more likely to get through planning than those funded by private companies, and this, coupled with advances in green technologies, and reduction in cost of the technology, make such investments good options, he said.</p> <p>Smith added: \"Don't be scared. This could be a nice bit of business, we've invested \u00a3600,000 in to 15 projects so far. They might take a lot of planning, but there are so many benefits to the local community on top of fuel security, including new jobs.</p> <p>On housing, Frost, who spoke along with Smith in the 'product innovation' break out session, said: \"Investing in businesses might offer quicker returns, but housing is a growing area for CDFIs.</p> <p>\"We work with 16 local authorities on this, some of them we've partnered with for 10 years now. They refer people to us who are having difficulty with doing essential housing repairs and loan us money which we loan on to locals... We have had no defaults so far,\" he said.</p> <p>All local authorities by law have to provide financial assistance to poor or vulnerable people to maintain their private homes. By loaning money to a CDFI, rather than giving individuals grants, the money could be continually recycled to help more people, he said.</p> <p>Pat Conaty, a fellow of the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation</a> who researches emerging CDFI markets, said political leadership was needed, as witnessed internationally, to open both markets.</p> <p>He explained: \"For example, for the last ten years the German government has had a loan scheme to retrofit houses with greener technologies. The cooperative banks borrow money from the government at 1.5% and loan it out at 3%.

  "<p>\"The boldest measures are the safest.\" It makes sense for this maxim to be stamped in tall lettering above the entrance to Dishonored's plague-ridden capital city, Dunwall. Here is a society that runs on whale oil, a sort of fuel that only a madly courageous culture would choose to pump through the veins of its infrastructure, a juice fetched from sea monsters just as likely to sink a ship under their deadweight as drag one under alive. It's the proverb of a whaler: go big or go home. Be bold and you might just harpoon Moby Dick, whose blubber could fuel the streetlights and security systems back home for months. Be meek and you'll die cold and hungry. Yes, Dunwall is a city fuelled by bold measures.</p> <p>It's also the adage of the effective assassin, and Dishonored \u2013 more than any other \u2013 is a game built around the assassin. You play as Corvo, a supernatural cutthroat and one time bodyguard to the Empress, framed for her murder. In the game's opening chapter you must break from prison and begin to enact revenge against a range of high-profile targets. As you creep through whorehouses, skulk through local whisky distilleries, kidnap scientists from top-floor laboratories and attend highfalutin' society parties you soon learn that boldness is the key to survival. Patience is a virtue too, of course \u2013 peeking through keyholes to plot guards' patrols is as essential a tool of the trade as the crossbow and dagger. But timidity is an occupational hazard. Corvo is a character fuelled by bold measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397370984\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701415316/Dishonored-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's also the proverb of the successful game developer working in 2012, who understands that, in time, familiarity usually breeds contempt in the modern audience. The phrase sits at the top of Dishonored's title screen, a statement of intent from first-time developer Arkane that, to make a mark in a medium saturated with identikit sequels and stagnant genres (in a year when some of the world's best known studios have closed), audacity is possibly the safest option. Make no mistake: Dishonored is a video game fuelled by bold measures.</p> <p>That boldness comes through focus primarily, the mad choice to eschew current trends. This a game without the bloat of the modern blockbuster \u2013 no co-op mode to allow two friends to assassinate hand-in-hand; no lip-service multiplayer to distract the development team and divert their budget; no upgradable hub to grow or furnish; no open world to impress and weary. Rather you're given a series of handcrafted missions, each with its own optional twists and turns, each with a start, a middle and an end, the plot written by a designer, the script penned by a scriptwriter and the narrative transcribed by you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397370985\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701879989/Dishonored-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Player responsibility is a key way the game pushes against the crowd, especially the ongoing fashion for tightly scripted shooting games and their Hollywood set-pieces. Rather, Dunwall's spaces are wide and awkward, a jumble of walkways and underpasses that give rise to emergent scenarios and press the responsibility for the journey's details firmly into the player's hands. Clamber up chains and teeter along pipes, or use a paranormal upgrade to possess a rat and whisk in through a drain: these streets are yours to use how you will.</p> <p>Likewise, the objectives may be set by the story, but the way in which they are accomplished is up to you and the interactive vocabulary you have chosen for your Corvo. You're free to charge into a scenario, guns blazing, or take a more considered approach, skulking in the shadows, taking down guards under a cloak and with dagger. Where games usually compel us to kill, limiting progress till we murder our way through a checkpoint, Dishonored actively encourages restraint. As the kill count rises so the city deteriorates, the rat population increasing with the influx of corpses. As such, it's almost always preferable to smother a target and stuff their sleeping body into a dustbin, rather than break their neck and add to the rot and plague. Bold measures.</p> <p>Moreover, while Dishonored can be played as a straight shooter \u2013 blasting enemies with a pistol in one hand while controlling a rat swarm with a sorcerer's sweep of another, it's best played as a game of hide and seek, with its richest gains to be found in finding a way to eliminate your targets in non-lethal ways: the pacifist assassin. Eavesdropping on conversations can open up new routes to your objective, another way in which boldness pays off, as you kneel beneath a dresser, gathering high-risk clues.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397370986\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701038773/Dishonored-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, it's not enough for a game to merely grant players freedom of choice. It must also encourage the player to exercise that choice in interesting ways, and in this respect Dishonored mostly excels. The game operates on a rune-based economy \u2013 the whalebone artefacts can be spent on unlocking and upgrading various skills and abilities that broaden Corvo's interactive vocabulary in interesting ways. Some upgrades are passive \u2013 returning assassinated bodies to ash \u2013 others, such as the ability to slow time for a few seconds, or to teleport a few metres up onto a ledge, or behind a guard are actively invaluable to secrecy. Upgrade the right places and you can even possess a target and throw them from a rooftop in what looks like a tragic cobblestone suicide.</p> <p>And what cobblestones these are. Half-Life 2 architect Viktor Antonov and his team have serviced a meticulous fiction, marrying Edinburgh streets with 1800s American whaling community spirit and smart Gestapo uniforms for its ruling soldiers. At times the world is reminiscent of the designer's pervious work but not because they necessarily look or feel similar so much as because precious few games build their worlds with such cohesive character, history and detail as Antonov. Dunwall is a depressing place \u2013 but it is vivid and memorable in all of its beautiful desecration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397370987\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701764857/Dishonored-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dishonored</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also vivid and memorable in play. The strength of video games is in their capacity to allow us to express ourselves within a fiction, impossible to do in the novel or on film. In this way Dishonored betters the Uncharteds and Modern Warfares of the medium by playing to this fundamental strength. After all, a story identical to that experienced by every other player of a game is far less powerful than one that is unique to the individual, and, crucially, is more likely to be passed on to others and shared. Dishonored is a playpen for expression, perhaps not as wide or diverse as it aspires to be, but wide enough. A bold measure on the developer's part then, and a safe bet for the creative player.</p>",
  "<p>Vandana Shiva, one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/top-100-women\" title=\"\">Guardian's Top 100 most inspiring women</a>, is currently leading a campaign to create a global citizens' response on the issue of seed freedom.</p> <p>In 1991, Shiva founded <a href=\"http://www.navdanyainternational.it/\" title=\"\">Navadanya</a>, a movement which aims to protect nature and people's rights to knowledge, biodiversity, water and food. It does this by setting up community seed banks that generate livelihoods for local people and provide for basic needs.</p> <p>Shiva, a scientist, philosopher, feminist, author, environmentalist and activist, explains why the two week campaign on seed freedom against major corporations, which culminates on <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/\" title=\"\">World Food Day</a> later this month, is so important and the consequences of failure.</p> <p>Shiva calls for civil disobedience, quoting Gandhi who said that \"as long as the superstition that unjust laws must be obeyed exists, so will slavery exist\".</p> <p><strong>Why do you refer to the term seed slavery?</strong></p> <p>In another time, some people thought it was alright to own other people as slaves. In our times some corporations think it is alright to own life on earth through patents and intellectual property rights (IPR). Patents are granted for inventions, and life is not an invention. These IPR monopolies on seeds are also creating a new bondage and dependency for farmers who are getting trapped in debt to pay royalties. This is why 270,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide.</p> <p><strong>Why is it such an important issue?</strong></p> <p>Seed slavery is ethically important to address because it transforms the Earth family into corporate property. It is ecologically important because with seeds in the hands of five corporations, biodiversity disappears, and is replaced by monocultures of GMOs (genetically modified organisms). It is socially important because without seed sovereignty, there is no food sovereignty. After all, seeds are the first link in the food chain.</p> <p><strong>What is the role of big business in restricting seed supply?</strong></p> <p>The chemical warfare industry transformed itself into the agri-chemical industry. Now the chemical industry has taken over the seed supply through genetic engineering and patents. They want every farmer in every season everywhere in the world to buy their seeds so they can collect royalties and super profits. The corporations, like Monsanto, wrote the Intellectual Property Rights Treaty of the World Trade Organisation. As a Monsanto representative said: \"In writing this treaty, we were the patient, the diagnostician, the physician all in one.\" They defined seed saving as a crime to establish seed slavery and force farmers to buy their seed and pay them royalties.</p> <p><strong>You refer to the toxicity and uniformity of the seeds from major corporations. What impact are their actions having on farmers and communities?</strong></p> <p>Last year we wrote a report, <a href=\"http://www.navdanyainternational.it/index.php/pubblicazioni/the-gmo-emperor-has-no-clothes\" title=\"\">The GMO Emperor has no Clothes</a>, which pulled together the impact of GMO patented seeds across the world. The first impact is a seed monopoly and the disappearance of diversity. The second impact is increasing costs. The third impact is higher use of chemicals. The fourth impact is the denial to consumers of the right to know what they are eating.</p> <p><strong>Which companies do you feel are most responsible?</strong></p> <p>Monsanto, Dupont, Syngenta, Basf, Dow.</p> <p><strong>What is the motivation for these companies to act in this way?</strong></p> <p>Super profits and the urge to control nature and society.</p> <p><strong>Do these companies have too much influence on the political system and what are their tactics and their effect?</strong></p> <p>They have too much power and are a threat to our democracy and freedom. They control governments, they control the media, they control research. Look at how they hounded out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_Pusztai\">Dr Arpad Putzai</a> from his job.</p> <p><strong>Most large corporations talk about the need for sustainability, so what would your advice be to these businesses if they were to take corporate responsibility seriously?</strong></p> <p>In the area of seeds and biodiversity my advice to the corporations is simple. You are good at the technologies of warfare. Leave the seeds in the hands of women and small farmers. They have done a far better job.</p> <p><strong>What can be done to prevent these companies from dominating the global seed supply?</strong></p> <p>Build a movement for seed freedom, to save seeds, to protect biodiversity, to reclaim farmers rights, to make patents on seed illegal, to roll back laws like the EU Seed Legislation that are criminalising farmers who use their own seeds.</p> <p><strong>You are planning a fortnight of action on seed freedom from 2-16 October, can two weeks of action actually make any difference against the power of big business?</strong></p> <p>The fortnight of action is to intensify solidarity, synergy and awareness. Our movement for <a href=\"http://seedfreedom.in/\">seed freedom</a> will not stop on 16 October. We will continue until the last farmer and last seed is liberated.</p> <p><strong>If this issue is not addressed, what does the future hold?</strong></p> <p>We will witness in our lifetimes the total disappearance of biodiversity from our farms, the disappearance of small farmers, and the end of real food and our food freedom.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When I got the date for my sex reassignment surgery, I wasn't so worried about the operation itself (I'd be asleep, right?) as its aftermath: how I was going to look after myself during the two months it would take to recover? I called my parents and immediately my mother offered to take care of me at the family home. I'd never felt so glad or relieved: the <a href=\"http://www.wlmht.nhs.uk/gi/gender-identity-clinic/\">Gender Identity Clinic</a> suggest full-time care for at least the first two weeks, and getting it from my parents (especially my mother, a former district nurse) meant that they would be reassured that I was fine, while I would benefit from rest, relaxation and plenty of home cooking.</p> <p>The day after my discharge from Charing Cross Hospital, my father drives me back to Horley, Surrey, where I will convalesce in my old bedroom. As he does so, the post-surgical pain increases dramatically. I try to be stoic: it isn't going away for some time, so I decide to get through the journey, sleep and see how I feel in the morning. Much worse, is the answer: the sight and smell of the neovagina instantly confirms that I've contracted an infection. </p> <p>My father takes me to the nearest Urgent Treatment Centre. The nurse has never encountered my circumstances before, and warns that as the Accident &amp; Emergency unit at East Surrey Hospital may not be able to treat me, I might need to return to Charing Cross. This would mean a long drive back to London in searing heat, two days before the Olympics. I hold back tears as we contact the GIC's nurse specialist, who says that this is not uncommon and can be handled with antibiotics. After inspection by a senior doctor, who says that the bruising above the wound has become infected, I am sent home with new medication.</p> <p>The following Monday, the addition of new drugs to my painkiller regime completely floors me - and my energy was already low as my body strived to heal itself. I spend the entire afternoon in bed, having slept little at night due to the pain and the pills, which warp my dreams into vivid nightmares for weeks after the operation. My mother and I decide to stop the antibiotics slightly early; from there, my recovery is slow, but steady. </p> <p>My movement is limited, as lying down hurts far less than sitting, but it does at least provide quiet time to read and watch films. My mother encourages me to go outside, but 10 days after surgery I can barely reach the top of our road. There are sharp pains as nerve endings reconnect; a dull, throbbing ache and an unbearable pushing sensation at the base of the affected area, which stay constant for weeks; and plenty of discharge for the first month. This is alleviated by regular baths, which are pleasant but boring. </p> <p>To pass the time, I listen to the radio: one afternoon, the DJ plays <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHYOXyy1ToI\">Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart</a>, which was constantly on my stereo during my alienated youth. As I hear its opening bars, the entire transition, from my childhood <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gender-dysphoria/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">gender dysphoria</a> to this pain-filled moment in the house where I grew up, 20 years later, replays itself in my mind, and suddenly I'm in waves of cathartic tears. </p> <p><em>\"And yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives \u2026\"</em></p> <p>This feels like a watershed: gradually things improve. Being with my parents changes my relationship not just with them, but my home town. One day a friend visits and I take her on a tour: with just an afternoon and almost incapacitated, I still manage to show her the entire centre twice. My favourite feature is the sign in the bookshop: \"Look! Fifty Shades of Grey in stock now.\" I dread to imagine the letters to the <a href=\"http://www.thisissurreytoday.co.uk/Horley-residents-angry-monstrous-fence/story-13504089-detail/story.html\">local paper</a>. </p> <p>Three and a half weeks post-surgery, I take another friend to watch Horley Town play Holmesdale in the FA Cup. We stand behind the goal and when Horley's winger shanks a cross into touch, I'm nearest the ball. Instinctively I run to throw it back. I soon wish I hadn't, remembering that the pain will take weeks if not months to disappear completely.</p> <p>Mentally, it's a strange time too. At first the discomfort and discharge stop me from forming a positive relationship with my altered body, and my constant urge to be active sits badly with my inability to walk more than a few hundred metres. Further constrained by the need to dilate three times daily, watching the world pass by on Twitter and television, I remind myself that this is temporary: soon, I can put it all behind me.</p> <p>Coming back to London, I slowly step up my activity, meeting friends in local cafes and testing my pain barrier in going to watch Norwich City start the season at Fulham. Despite City's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/18/fulham-norwich-city-premier-league\">abject hammering</a>, it feels wonderful to return to one of the mainstays of my social life. </p> <p>Just as importantly, I start to familiarise myself with my changed body, getting used to the sight of it in the mirror. Then, after several weeks, the dilation stops being painful and becomes pleasurable, at least at times \u2013 the discovery of sexual sensation is another huge landmark, and finally I'm excited not just about returning to my pre-surgical normality but about discovering a post-surgical one.</p> <p>Two months after surgery, I make a final, brief visit to the surgical team at the Clinic, who check my health and administer some silver nitrate to deal with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granulation_tissue\">granulation tissue</a> that has developed during the healing process. Before I leave, I schedule my last appointment with the psychiatric team, where we can address the final question: how do I feel?</p>",
  "<p>How should the public be involved in deciding the funding of scientific research? Directly, is the answer offered by a new campaign that hopes to harness the power of social media to develop a treatment for cancer.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://icancer.org.uk\">iCancer campaign</a>, brainchild of author Alexander Masters, aims to raise funds from the public for research into a new treatment for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) \u2014 cancers of glands in the body that release hormones under the control of the nervous system.&#xa0;NETs are difficult to treat because patients typically present with symptoms only after the cancer has reached a relatively late stage and started to spread to other parts of the body. This type of cancer took the life of Steve Jobs, the charismatic and visionary founder of Apple just a year ago.</p> <p>The campaign is not starting from scratch since a new type of therapy for NETs is currently in development in the laboratory of&#xa0;Prof Magnus Essand. iCancer's&#xa0;<a href=\"http://icancer.org.uk/about/\">specific goal</a> is to help the Swedish scientists get past what has so far been an insurmountable obstacle:&#xa0;raising the \u00a32m needed for clinical trials in human patients.</p> <p>In a multi-pronged approach that would surely win the admiration of Apple's design chief Jonathan Ive, Essand's research group have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22378183\">cleverly re-engineered</a> an adenovirus to turn an agent of disease into one of therapy. Their modified virus, which&#xa0;normally causes the common cold, instead targets NET cells for destruction. </p> <p>The litany of design tricks is impressive. The Swedish researchers modified&#xa0;the surface of the virus particle to help it to slip past the patient's immune system and to enhance its ability to find and infect tumour cells. Other genetic modifications suppressed virus reproduction in non-tumour cells and augmented its reproduction in tumour cells. The adenovirus infection ruptures the tumour cells, a killing strategy with a double whammy since the contents released from the dead cell stimulate the immune system to attach to other tumour cells.&#xa0;</p> <p>Essand's modified virus has worked well in mice but now lies dormant in his laboratory freezer for want of funds to start clinical trials.</p> <p>That is where author Alexander Masters <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9508895/A-virus-that-kills-cancer-the-cure-thats-waiting-in-the-coldc.html\">discovered it</a>. When he learned that his friend and editor&#xa0;Dido Davies had been diagnosed with the condition, Masters trawled the internet for information on NETs and eventually found his way to Prof Essand's laboratory. Appalled that a promising therapy was stymied for lack of a relatively modest amount of funding, he has joined together with friends and another NET patient, Dominic Nutt, to launch an internet campaign, hosted at iCancer.org.uk, to provide Essand with the money needed to complete initial clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of the viral therapy.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is a bold and laudable ambition. But the journey from a successful experiment in a university lab to a practical therapy is a long and expensive one. As economist Mariana Mazzucato points out in <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/theentrepreneurialstate\"><em>The Entrepreneurial State</em></a>, private companies and venture capitalists are often reluctant to invest in technologies that do not have a clear path to a profitable product, preferring the public sector to carry the risks of early stage development. Most countries, the UK among them, do not have wholly effective mechanisms for providing the bridging finance needed to get lab science a foothold with investors. A particular problem for Essand's adenovirus is that the Swedish government <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/9508895/A-virus-that-kills-cancer-the-cure-thats-waiting-in-the-coldc.html\">does not fund clinical trials</a> in humans.&#xa0;</p> <p>The campaign's approach to solving this problem raises interesting questions at the interface between the public and scientific research. There is little doubt it will stir an interest in the mechanisms of cancer research, and perhaps even stimulate dialogue, since the public is paying directly and may be more motivated to track the&#xa0;outcomes.&#xa0;</p> <p>But how does the campaign sit with existing mechanisms for funding this type of research? Should it be a free-for-all, with the loudest and most organised campaigns winning funding? In Britain cancer research is largely funded by the <a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\">research councils</a> and the charity <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/home/\">Cancer Research UK</a>. Their funding mechanisms have the advantage that multiple applications are considered in detail by scientific experts before decisions are made on how to allocate grants. In this way, a broader view can be taken and priorities determined with some degree of dispassion. But of course the public are excluded.&#xa0;</p> <p>iCancer's approach has public appeal but, though the <a href=\"http://icancer.org.uk/faq/\">scientific case</a> is laid out clearly and without hyperbole on the campaign website, it necessarily lacks the detail that a grand funding committee would demand.&#xa0;</p> <p>Where does the balance lie? From email exchanges and my reading of the literature, it is clear that Prof Essand is no maverick; he has turned to this unusual funding mechanism for want of an alternative mechanism for raising money on this scale for clinical trials. The organisers' evident passion and the plight of NET patients appeal to basic human sympathy. Who could not want the campaign to succeed?</p> <p>Some of my more conservative scientific colleagues may be shaking their heads at the departure from \"protocol\" but the experimentalist in me is keen for the campaign to achieve its aims, curious to see how it might perturb the funding landscape and the relationship between scientists and the public. The organisers are experimenting and discovering too. The campaign is realistic about the prospects for success of the experimental therapy \u2014 it is by no means a done deal \u2014 but also has a charming innocence. </p> <p>Though the tag-line is \"People before profit\", the organisers acknowledge that they will ultimately have to entice a large pharmaceutical company with the lure of future profits to complete the clinical trials if the initial testing is positive.</p> <p>What would Steve Jobs have made of it? Perhaps he is smiling down on the innovative and disruptive approach adopted by the campaign, all the while wincing at the iCancer moniker that cheekily mimics the names of many Apple products. We will never know and for now Apple has declined to comment or contribute.</p>",
  "<p>Another \"up\" weekend in North America saw independent releases drive box office to more than 35% ahead of the comparable weekend in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/film/movie/149515/taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2</a> was in the thick of it. Audiences worldwide clearly still want to see Neeson and his very particular set of skills and the movie opened at No 1 on approximately $50m (\u00a331m) and grossed a further $55m outside North America. Your heart may go out to his on-screen character Bryan Mills every time the family travels overseas \u2013 but the result is big moolah for the cinemas.</p> <p>How Hollywood must wish it had an action hero like Neeson. Deemed too old for such a role in the eyes of unimaginative, risk-averse US studio executives, the gravel-voiced Ballymena man has carved out a terrific second act for himself through the support of gutsier independents. Like its predecessor, Taken 2 is the product of French powerhouse EuropaCorp, who hired Fox to distribute the movie in North America and the bulk of international territories.</p> <p>Neeson is about to start shooting <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/liam-neeson-takes-a-walk-among-the-tombstones-in-production-deal-with-exclusive-media-and-cross-creek-pictures/\" title=\"\">A Walk Among the Tombstones</a>, backed by Exclusive Media and Cross Creek Pictures, the producer-financiers behind George Clooney's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142808/ides-of-march\" title=\"\">The Ides of March</a>, among others. He'll play a private eye and Universal will distribute in North America for a fee, like the Fox-EuropaCorp arrangement on Taken 2. To be fair to Universal, they are on board the Neeson air-marshall thriller Non-Stop, but these examples are few and far between.</p> <p>Half of the top 10 movies originate from the independent sector. The next highest-ranking example is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/02/looper-uk-box-office\" title=\"\">Looper</a>, financed by money man James Stern's Los Angeles-based Endgame Entertainment and released by the independent distributor FilmDistrict in association with Sony's TriStar label. Looper dropped to number 4 in its second weekend and stands at a respectable $40.3m. The big question is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/04/looper-chinese-box-office-error\" title=\"\">how much has it taken in China</a>, where the movie's co-financier DMG Entertainment is yet to release official figures from the first two weekends. We expect to hear this week.</p> <p>Cop thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/08/end-of-watch-review\" title=\"\">End of Watch</a> from the aforementioned Exclusive Media is doing well and has racked up $32.8m after three weekends in release through independent distributor Open Road. House at the End of the Street from Relativity Media is at $27.5m after three and PT Anderson's mesmerising <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/02/the-master-review\" title=\"\">The Master</a> has taken $12.3m after three. The Weinstein Company is distributing the movie worldwide and financier Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, reportedly invested $25m and will want to see the box office climb. It's a muscular awards contender (certainly for the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman) in the hands of Harvey Weinstein and thus seems likely to appear more lucrative by the end of its run.</p> <p>Disney released Tim Burton's animation Frankenweenie, on a rather insipid $11.5m, is in fifth place. Disney's other offering, Finding Nemo 3D \u2013 a cynical 3D retrofit of Pixar's much-loved global smash \u2013 has not quite electrified audiences as much as the studio will have wanted. It ranks number 10 and has grossed just under $40m after four weekends in release and around $10m outside North America. The original opened in 2003 and took more than $865m worldwide.

The chancellor did the media rounds this morning to preview his speech, and welfare will dominate. Follow all the day's events with Andrew Sparrow's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/osborne-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog\">politics live blog</a>. <br>The chancellor has outlined plans for a fresh round of \u00a310bn of welfare cuts in 2015-16, and said the government will be proposing new policies on housing benefit soon. On the New Statesman's Staggers blog, George Eaton says the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/lib-dems-cave-osborne-over-%C2%A310bn-welfare-cuts\">have caved in to the chancellor</a> over welfare policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nick Clegg previously insisted that the Lib Dems would not sign up to further welfare cuts without the introduction of some form of wealth or property tax. But with the Chancellor having already ruled out a \"mansion tax\" or higher council tax bands, it remains unclear what Clegg's party will receive in return for consenting to another attack on the poorest. One possibility is that the coalition will again increase the top rate of capital gains tax and raise stamp duty on multi-million properties.<br>The move will also put further pressure on Labour to say whether, if elected, it would stick to Osborne's spending plans for 2015-16 or adopt its own alternative proposals.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the TUC's Touchstone blog, Richard Exell says Osbourne has <a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2012/10/telling-the-truth-about-who-gets-housing-benefit/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">conflated two mistakes about housing benefit</a> \u2013 that it is only for people on the dole, and it is easy for young unemployed people to get housing benefit to pay their rent. He adds: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The assumption that Housing Benefit is a special perk for unemployed people is wrong. So is the notion that young people getting HB are ne'er do wells. I'm worried that we're gearing up for a repeat of what happened in the 1980s, when the Fowler reforms took away 16 and 17 year olds' independent rights to benefit. It's a quarter of a century ago, so some readers may not realise that, before those reforms, you almost never saw young people begging or sleeping in the streets.<br>Those of us who campaigned against the 1986 Social Security Act repeatedly warned that it would force 16 and 17 year-olds into destitution. This was simply ignored by the government of the day, backed up by the same sort of media campaign that we're seeing now. The Act came into effect in 1988, and within a year there were young people sleeping in shop doorways.<br>I fear we're on the verge of repeating that mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on his blog, Camden councillor Theo Blackwell looks at the projected impact of the proposals <a href=\"http://theoblackwell.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/updated-impact-on-under-25s-in-camden.html?spref=tw\">on young people in his borough</a>. The proposals, he writes, will disproportionately hit young people in the social housing sector \u2013 that they seem to impact young people in social housing three times more than young people in private rented accommodation. And he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For young people who have lost parents, but remain in the area, the changes may well uproot them from their neighbourhood, for vulnerable people getting settled after trauma, this is another unwelcome change.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jules_birch\">Jules Birch</a> for the link)<br>See also three archive pieces on housing benefit cuts for under-25s. On the Guardian's Reality check blog earlier in the year, Patrick Butler asked whether <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check/2012/jun/25/is-scrapping-housing-benefit-for-under-25-s-a-good-idea\">scrapping housing benefit for under-25s was a good idea</a>, Kate Webb wrote on the Shelter blog that <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2012/04/when-family-isnt-there-the-state-must-step-in/\">the state must step in when family isn't there</a>, and for Comment is free, Penny Anderson described it as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/07/housing-benefit-under-25s\">a policy with more holes than a sieve</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tory health policy</strong>. Looking ahead to later in the week, former Labour adviser Paul Corrigan asks <a href=\"http://www.pauldcorrigan.com/Blog/health-policy/what-might-the-conservatives-say-about-nhs-policy-at-their-conference/\">what might the Conservatives say about NHS policy at their conference</a>? He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron's long term strategy for the Conservatives and the NHS was, in the words of some, to 'detoxify' the Conservative brand. Up until the 2010 election this went very well and he must wake up some mornings and wonder what happened to that strategy.<br>Of course we know that Andrew Lansley is what happened to it\u2026<br>\u2026and for reasons that I will never ever understand the Prime Minister agreed to completely undermine his own careful 3 year-long strategy to quieten down the NHS by agreeing, in the summer of 2010, to Andrew Lansley's plans to shake it all up.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he predicts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They will say they are proud of the NHS. They will point to all of the good stories about the NHS that Andrew Lansley had to be ambivalent about. (He couldn't celebrate too many good stories about the NHS as good stories undermined the case for having to reform it.).<br>They will point out how they have frequently given preferential funding to the NHS when compared to all other services.<br>This will only be a sub subtext at the Conference.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Fascinating figure of the day, from affordable housing campaign group <a href=\"http://www.pricedout.org.uk/\">PricedOut</a>: more than a quarter of Tory MPs are <strong>private landlords</strong>. The FT [\u00a3] reports that the group is <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad1a739c-0f1c-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28hhkuO8b\">calling for tougher tax treatment for buy-to-let landlords</a>. If found that 83 of the Conservative party's 305 elected representatives are making money from private tenants living in properties they own \u2013 one owns 26 \u2013 while a quarter of Labour MPs and 15% of Lib Dems do. </p> <p>\u2022 Charity the <a href=\"http://www.nya.org.uk/\">National Youth Agency</a>, which is calling for a \"<strong>youth premium</strong>\". The charity was at the Conservative conference today to explain its campaign, which calls for the premium to ensure all young people from disadvantaged backgrounds get access to free, high quality youth work. It warns that the Government risks costly damage to future generations if young people aren't given the resources and attention they need.</p> <p>\u2022 A post looking back over the <strong>Labour party conference</strong> on the Community Links blog. Will Horwitz says <a href=\"http://www.community-links.org/linksuk/?p=3576\">he noticed throughout the conference</a> \"increasingly encouraging references to prevention, to the long term consequences of decisions made today, to the calamity of cutting now to spend more later\". He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There seemed to be an awareness not just of the benefits of early action but also the barriers to it, as we have been urging. But weary experience has taught us that rhetoric does not necessarily lead to change \u2013 witness Tony Blair's stirring 1997 speech on the importance of prevention, calling for \"departments to draw up plans for shifting energy and resources from cure to prevention, from clearing problems up to anticipating them.\" Guess which other phrase crops up in the speech: \"one nation Britain.\" Can Labour, this time round, make it One Early Action Nation?</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19826770\">RPI changes 'may hit pensioners'</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13431/breast_cancer_care_falls_short_of_fundraising_targets\">Breast Cancer Care falls short of fundraising targets</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/health-lottery-raises-only-half-of-its-50m-charitable-fund-target-8201327.html\">Health Lottery raises only half of its \u00a350m charitable fund target</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/under-25s-face-further-cuts-to-housing-benefit/6524086.article\">Under 25s face further cuts to housing benefit</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107231\">Pickles' troubled family programme on target</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/10/private-firms-should-take-over-roads-says-cbi/\">Private firms should take over roads, says CBI</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/9590523/Maternity-leave-should-be-scrapped-as-it-holds-back-women.html\">Maternity leave should be scrapped as it 'holds back women'</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Greenhouse gas emissions rise when economies expand but don't fall as quickly when recession strikes, according to new research that emphasises the risks of relying on economic downturns to keep future emissions in check. </p> <p>The most likely reason is that carbon-emitting vehicles and infrastructure created as the economy grows continue to be used in harder times, even as the economy contracts.</p> <p>Based on a review of World Bank statistics of more than 150 nations from 1960 to 2008, the research \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate1699.html\">published in Nature Climate Change on Sunday</a> \u2013 found that emissions of carbon dioxide rose by an average of 0.7% for every 1% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

  "<h2><strong>Exasperation</strong> <strong>has set in whenever it rains</strong></h2> <p>Dry days are often followed by wet evenings \u2013 in Colombo especially \u2013 and there has only been half an hour of leeway to get a game in. So the players and spectators mooch around all day and then are frustrated as the rain descends. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>TV schedules are sacrosanct</strong></h2> <p>But there is an absurdity here best exemplified by the West Indies and Ireland game. There was a way for them to play that match (start earlier, for example) but instead the Irish were denied the chance of producing an epic performance. Moreover this is an odd time to have a tournament in Sri Lanka. There is the suspicion that the ICC is more interested in a convenient, lucrative tournament than a dry one. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>There has been a dearth of close games</strong></h2> <p>The usual truism (I've used it myself) is that the shorter the game the more likely the upset. Yet that has not been the case. The analysts of the big teams have set to work. Not much is left to chance. Zimbabwe were thrashed twice, Bangladesh twice, Ireland once, Afghanistan once.</p> <p>There were too many empty seats at the start (it costs between 14p and 50p to get in) but the crowds are starting to turn up \u2014 and they have seen some fine batting, though not by England against India. That was easily the most inept batting by a major side in the tournament so far. It was a macabre performance by England's youthful middle order. They are exciting; they are not reliable. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>Flash interviews in between innings</strong></h2> <p>What a banal intrusion into what are supposed to be life and death struggles. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>One final grumble</strong></h2> <p>It is a pain to have to keep an eye and an ear on the punditry of ESPN's Cricket Extra. In fact KP has been rather good \u2013 he's starting to enjoy it \u2013 but we could do without having to constantly check whether he has committed an indiscretion or not. They say he should not have accepted the ESPN invitation. Have you heard how many 000s there are at the end of his contract? It might be a while before he appears on TMS. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>There were fine moments too</strong></h2> <p>Afghanistan's performance against India was uplifting, thanks to Shapoor Zadran, the left-arm opening bowler, who prowled around like Goran Ivanisevic. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUOVpRA_rO8\" title=\"\">And that helicopter shot from Mohammad Shahzad</a>.</p> <p>The pitches have been excellent, with sufficient bounce to encourage six-hitting. Yet the good spinners have prospered, especially those with a bit of mystery. Watch out for Sunil Narine, so bland in England for the West Indies, and any of the Indians as well as Saeed Ajmal and Ajantha Mendis. And I have a sneaking feeling the West Indies might pick Samuel Badree, a wrist-spinner from Trinidad, against England (the analysts will have to earn their corn to find much footage of him).</p> <p>Chris Gayle still adds a frisson whenever he takes guard and check out his training shoes. The heels match his socks so it looks as if he is wearing sandals. Virat Kohli looks in wonderful form, so too Imran Nazir and Nasir Jamshed of Pakistan and New Zealand's Brendon McCullum. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jos Buttler's fielding</strong> \u2026 <strong>Jonny Bairstow's fielding</strong></h2> <p>But we want to applaud their batting. And there was a nice moment at about 12.30am at the Irish hotel after the washed-out game against the West Indies. The supporters and families were milling around the bar when the team returned to the hotel. They broke into a round of spontaneous and constant applause. The Irish had not played particularly well but they loved 'em anyway. <strong>VM</strong></p> <h2><strong>Audacity with the bat</strong></h2> <p>How to separate so many sixes? Arguably the most audacious batting moment of the tournament came in the semi final from Umar Gul, who had been Akmal's big-hitting partner in that thrilling finish against South Africa. He came to the crease against Sri Lanka in the 18th over, with Pakistan needing more than two runs per ball \u2013 and extravagantly allowed his first delivery from Ajantha Mendis to pass outside off stump. <strong>AW</strong></p> <h2><strong>Best innings</strong></h2> <p>Marlon Samuels in the final is a bit too obvious. I preferred Umar Akmal's unbeaten 43 from 41 balls to steer Pakistan to an unlikely Super Eights victory over South Africa, after they had apparently been down and out at 76 for seven. <strong>AW</strong></p> <h2><strong>Penalty shoot-out here to stay</strong></h2> <p>Both the Super Over deciders in the Super Eights were good fun (unless you're a New Zealander), confirming beyond doubt that cricket's more satisfying version of a penalty shoot-out is here to stay. The West Indies win against them, sealed by a Samuels six after Tim Southee had opened up with a no-ball from which Chris Gayle also cleared the ropes, was a first indication that their name might be on the trophy. <strong>AW</strong></p> <h2><strong>And how to improve the tournament?</strong></h2> <p>I'd go for two groups of six, with the top two from each qualifying for the semi finals. This would allow the tournament to start with a bang, as opposed to the damp squib in the current system, make every game meaningful, and give the less-fancied countries \u2013 Ireland, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe \u2013 more of a crack. <strong>AW</strong></p>",
  "<p>Karl Popper died in 1994. As I remarked in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/karl-popper-enemy-uncertainty?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">initial article in this series</a>, his thought is, in many ways, too close for us to be able to evaluate with the full benefit of hindsight. But what would Popper make of the new(ish) millennium? It is hard not to believe that he would be cast into despair. Knowledge claims (and, more than that, certainty claims) are being made not only throughout political and religious ideologies, but also within alternative therapies, 2012 cults, revisionist approaches to history and a host of other fields.</p> <p>Let's remind ourselves of Popper's actual take on this: he does not suggest that we reject these sorts of claims wholesale, but he does insist that we do not refer to them either in terms of epistemological certainty or in terms of science. They may, one day, achieve full falsifiable rigour, or they may not; they may be useful in other respects, or they may not, but we must be clear about their epistemological status.</p> <p>So let us now take a step back and consider whether Popper has been successful in establishing <a href=\"http://www.philosophyofscience.info/falsificationism.html\" title=\"\">falsificationism</a> as the methodology du jour. Here, I think, we must acknowledge that he has not. Probabilistic induction remains the methodology of choice, not only among scientific practitioners, but also among those philosophers of science who take more moderate stances of other philosophers of science. Falsificationism also comes under fire from the scientific establishment itself, for instance, in the work of physicists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sokal\" title=\"\">Alan Sokal</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bricmont\" title=\"\">Jean Bricmont</a>, who state:</p> <blockquote> \"When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability\u2026 But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability' \u2026 [yet] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes.\" (Sokal and Bricmont, 1997) </blockquote> <p>Both astrology and astronomy make incorrect predictions, Sokal and Bricmont argue, and falsificationism does not differentiate between them. But this claim is disputed by writers such as David Miller, who bring us full circle by pointing out that astronomy contains the parameters for its own falsifiability, whereas astrology does not.</p> <p>What of Popper's political thought \u2013 that body of work so closely intertwined in Popper's writings with epistemology and scientific enquiry? His views on tolerance and anti-totalitarianism do now look like common sense to many. Political and social tolerance clearly leads to a paradox: summed up in the issue of where one person's fist ends and another's nose begins. Popper was a champion of liberalism throughout his life. He argues that tolerance means that we may eventually fail to tolerate intolerance. We can contain intolerant political philosophies, he says,</p> <blockquote> \"\u2026 as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion.\" </blockquote> <p>However:</p> <blockquote> \"We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal.\" </blockquote> <p>These are opinions which are highly relevant to today's relativistic, pluralistic societies, in which political and cultural boundary settings are still of necessity emergent, imprecise and fluid. Here, epistemological claims of certainty cannot be applied and Popper's early and tragic encounters with the results of those claims \u2013 on both sides of the political spectrum \u2013 surely informed his commitment to as great a degree of mutual tolerance as possible. Nor is this incompatible with his commitment to falsifiability as a standard for scientific rigour: fallibilism underlies both the knowledge claims of science and those of politics.</p> <blockquote> \"The old scientific ideal of episteme \u2013 of absolutely certain, demonstrable knowledge \u2013 has proved to be an idol. The demand for scientific objectivity makes it inevitable that every scientific statement must remain tentative for ever. It may be corroborated, but every corroboration is relative to other statements which, again, are tentative. Only in our subjective experiences of conviction, in our subjective faith can we be 'absolutely certain'.\" </blockquote> <p>The \"craving to be right\", that hostility to tolerance which is found throughout all human inquiry, is in Popper's eyes the basis for totalitarian thought; only once that is rejected can we get down to the business of testing truth claims, and only then can we be honest about what we do and do not know.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/deal-central/column-post/david-o-russell-draws-all-star-cast-next-film-59421\" title=\"\">Christian Bale has returned</a> to the role of a shyster hired by the FBI to take down corrupt politicians in David O Russell's forthcoming conman drama.</p> <p>Bale, who won the best supporting actor Oscar for his turn as boxer Dicky Eklund in Russell's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140166/fighter\" title=\"\">The Fighter</a>, was reported to have left the project earlier this year, but has now signed on. The as-yet-untitled film is also due to star The Fighter's Amy Adams, along with Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner.</p> <p>Like The Fighter, Russell's new film is based on a true story, though there appear to be significant differences between real-life events and the version playing out on screen. Eric Warren Singer's screenplay for the movie, which was once titled American Bullshit, is described as being \"based on the true story of a financial con artist (Bale) and his mistress/partner in crime (Adams), who were forced to work with an out-of-control federal agent (Cooper) to turn the tables on other con artists, mobsters, and politicians. At the epicenter of the tale is the volatile leader of the New Jersey state assembly (Renner) who is also the local hero and mayor of impoverished Camden\".</p> <p>The plot bears a resemblance to \u2013 and was previously reported to be based on \u2013 the famous Abscam stings in the late 1970s and 80s, which saw a US senator and five congressman convicted as part of a public corruption investigation. Several saw jail time. The stings were overseen by Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con artist who had been hired by the FBI to target others. They involved a \"fake sheikh\" apparently trying to buy his way into the US by involving public officials in an investment scheme, which often involved the politicians steering public contracts in the sheikh's direction or helping him to bypass regulations.</p> <p>Weinberg himself avoided a three-year jail sentence for his previous activities and was paid $150,000 for his part in the operations. The \"sheikh\" was known as Kambir Abdul Rahman \u2013 hence the Abscam tag. The New Jersey state assembly leader to be played by Renner would appear to be an amalgam of the various politicians convicted in the stings.</p> <p>\"David has put together an incredible ensemble of actors for what is going to be a powerful and emotional drama about one of the most memorable cast of characters in recent history,\" producer Charles Roven told the Wrap. The film is due to shoot in mid-February on the US east coast.</p>",
  "<p>Google's unilateral change to its privacy policy in March will come under fire from European data protection commissioners within days, sources say.</p> <p>The controversial changes, in which Google tied together the previously separate data collected under services including its search engine, YouTube and Google+ were announced in January and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/01/google-privacy-policy-changes-eu\" title=\"\">implemented two months later</a>. While creating a unified privacy policy across all the services, it also in effect amassed the data into a single location.</p> <p>That attracted widespread criticism \u2013 and now the group of 30 data protection commissioners from across the European Union are believed to have determined that Google has breached EU privacy laws.</p> <p>Now Google might be required to undo the changes \u2013 although Auke Haagsma, a lawyer advising the lobby group <a href=\"http://www.i-comp.org/\" title=\"\">Icomp</a>, which is critical of Google's policies, said that would be like trying to \"unscramble the egg\".</p> <p>Data protection commissioners in a number of countries have varying powers.

  "<p>At the end of the second world war, the western allies shared an understandable desire to cement lasting international peace after a conflict that had cost so many lives. One of the most effective ways of achieving this, it was believed, was to ensure the economic growth of all countries. The ideas of US economic historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/17/guardianobituaries.usa\" title=\"\">Walt W Rostow</a>, particularly those in his 1960 book, <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm\" title=\"\">The Stages of Economic Growth</a>, represented one of the most influential attempts to systematise these thoughts.</p> <p>The product of a decade's work, the book gives us post-second world war development economics in a nutshell \u2013 or rather in the silver sweep of a DC-8 airliner cabin, since Rostow's primary analogy was that of \"take off\": an aeronautical rendering of the moment when, with sufficient capital and other preconditions in place, \"the old blocks and resistances to steady growth are finally overcome\".</p> <p>For Rostow, encouraging this process meant promoting new \"enclaves of modern activity\" that could be economically fused together to become the nation's \"normal condition \u2026 built, as it were, into its habits and institutional structure\".</p> <p>Like other modernisation theories, The Stages of Economic Growth was both a diffusionist and technocratic doctrine, since it sought to replicate within more traditional societies the benefits of rationality and progress already experienced in the wealthier parts of the world. It was an approach to development in which a group of experts sitting in their government offices would call forth the machinery of industrialisation and urbanisation to remake social relations on the ground.</p> <p>If this paternalist rendering of the economic trajectory of nations had a clear moral compass, it had a clear political compass too \u2013 just look at the book's subtitle: An Anti-Communist Manifesto. This brings home an important point about development: its inherently political nature. Development policy from the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/marshall_plan/\" title=\"\">Marshall plan</a> onwards was a form of cold war ideological arm-wrestling. It allowed Soviets and Americans to test who had the better theories for social and economic progress in the Petri dish of the \"third world\", as it was then known, while allowing them to lay claim to the world's political space without wading into wholesale colonialism in the process.</p> <p>A graduate of Yale at the precocious age of 19, a contributor to the Marshall plan, and a speechwriter for President Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 in addition to being a tenured economist \u2013 Rostow was one of the brightest minds to challenge the USSR. When, in 1960, after reading The Stages of Economic Growth, John F Kennedy recruited the hawkish young Rostow to his election team, he would have his chance.</p> <p>Kennedy bought wholesale into what became known as the \"Rostow doctrine\", and the decade that followed \u2013 the first <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/1960s.htm\" title=\"\">decade of development</a> in UN parlance \u2013 ensured that Rostow's ideas about modernisation spread far and wide.</p> <p>In the early 1960s the two-year-old Cuban revolution switched first its sugar quota and then its political allegiance from the US to the Soviet Union, helping Rostow's cause by reminding the US what was at stake in its dealings with the developing world. It helped him to promote Kennedy's flagship <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Alliance-for-Progress.aspx\" title=\"\">Alliance for Progress in Latin America</a>, and then, under Lyndon Johnson, to justify US military policy in Vietnam.</p> <p>For Rostow, aid was always a weapon: something to be targeted rather than delivered. But for all his hawkishness over Vietnam he was adamant, too, that America's political ambitions were ultimately best pursued \"crabwise\", as he put it, through specific policies and programmes.</p> <p>However, within a year of Rostow's book being published, some of those developing nations, tired of being scrapped over in a struggle not of their own making, clubbed together to form the <a href=\"http://www.nam.gov.za/background/background.htm\" title=\"\">Non-Aligned Movement</a>: the first attempt to create a political bloc in the developing world.</p> <p>Even at its point of greatest influence, then, there was resistance to the politically laden and overdetermining visions of utopia in which modernisation theorists like Rostow traded. And by the end of the 1960s, Rostow was unceremoniously put out to grass: felled in the end by his unflinching commitment to the war in Vietnam. But there is no doubting that, until then, Rostow stood firmly at the helm of the burgeoning field of international development.</p> <p>Today the ideas, practice and perhaps especially the politics of development have moved on. Rostow's brash optimism (though maybe not his hawkishness) seems somehow out of place in our post-millennial world of \"poverty reduction\" and \"complex humanitarian emergencies\". Certainly most practitioners today, though not all, are more wary of assuming European and American history to be the norm, or of reading development as a linear or cumulative process.</p> <p>But Rostow's view that a dynamic private sector was to be supported by a strong but market-friendly state can still be found in many of today's public-private partnership models. And anyone even slightly informed on World Bank and IMF policies over the past 20 years will see the persistence of his belief that political influence is best delivered under the radar of economic investments. In these and other ways, the Rostovian crab keeps clambering on, a full half century later.</p>",
  "<p>Surviving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2012/oct/01/mccartney-launches-paris-collection\" title=\"\">fashion week</a> as a feminist and a model is no small task. Often the only thing potentially lower than your self-esteem is your blood sugar, as you literally run around London, or Paris, or whatever city you are in.</p> <p>It is physically and mentally draining, politically confusing and incestuous. With a myriad of stereotypes populating the media as to what models do and therefore are; maintaining an identity as a recent graduate who models to pay the rent, rather than just \"a model\", is a fine line to tread.</p> <p>Everyone has their own impression as what fashion week might be like for the models and it tends to fall into two main categories: the cocaine-riddled, fur-clad, sunglasses-wearing (even when its raining) deities who float from car to show; or the starving Latvian teenager who fights her way through the cattle market with minimal English. There is definitely sufficient fuel for the stereotype fire, but fashion week for most models is a particularly subjective experience. It changes from city to city, season to season, and from girl to girl, so this is a riot grrrl's attempt at explaining fashion weeks and tentatively suggesting that fashion and feminism are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week\" title=\"\">London fashion week</a> actually starts in August for those of us women with hips who \"need\"' to start exercising. This brings us to the huge and complicated issue of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/real-women-skinny-models-brigitte-no-contest\" title=\"\">weight</a>. Damn. Years of modelling has led to years of being accused of sustaining myself with cocaine and apples, which is both boring and untrue. Why and how models are thin and who makes them so is far too big an issue to deal with here. Body prescriptivism aside, I exercised a bit more in the run-up to fashion week because it made me feel more confident about being examined like a bit of meat. In general I seem to spend a lot of time justifying my existence as a \"real\" woman, (thanks to Dove and \"Colleen's real women\") so the next person who tells me that there are no \"real\" people/feminists on the runways, I will shout at. I am a real person, I eat real food, read real books and play real (bad) guitar. <em>Cogito ergo sum</em>, bitch.</p> <p>So, after I've pinched myself repeatedly to check that I exist, it's September and the castings have started and with them much running around like a crazy woman and singing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZxxhxjgnC0\" title=\"\">Bikini Kill</a> on the tube to keep up morale, because this is where it gets a bit more mentally tough.</p> <p>There is a lot of rejection. Obviously, no one is defined by how they look, nor should they be, but after a few days of brutality, subject to the whims of some body fascist or sour-faced woman, it can be hard to separate how you look from who you are. However, I am going to take this opportunity to smash my tiny violin: there are some really awesome casting directors and stylists in London who treat you as a person and give you chocolate and/or coconut water when you go to their castings.</p> <p>One important thing to me as a feminist in fashion week was how I chose to dress. Virginia Woolf wrote about sartorial signifiers of rank for women in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Guineas\" title=\"\">Three Guineas</a>, and there is definitely a hierarchy for models during the shows. The basic uniform is tight back jeans, vest/tank top, leather jacket and enormous bag. Cue the tedious military metaphor: your basic privates can be seen changing their shoes from flats to heels on the street in Hackney; while the lieutenants (the girls with drivers) only have to walk in and out, barely scuffing the soles of the designer shoes they were probably given rather than bought. You might not even see a general or major until the shows actually start, as they are probably walking Calvin Klein and London is pretty small fry comparatively. Besides, no one has ever seen an <a href=\"http://uk.hermes.com/leather/bags/for-day/configurable-product-c-victoriaii-12h-27133.html?color_leather=BLACK\" title=\"\">Herm\u00e8s bag</a> in real life (NB: can a handbag that costs more than a deposit on a house actually exist?).</p> <p>I chose DMs and a kilt from Camden, not only because I have an overdeveloped love of the 1990s and an underdeveloped adult dress sense, but because in a sea of photographers and bloggers, the way you dress communicates immediately. If your job is based on how you look, I'd like to make my exterior an accurate representation of my interior.</p> <p>On and off the catwalk, models are slaves to the gaze and while I can't control what I'm paid to wear, I can try off-duty to convey a sense of myself, (which is probably why I'm never in those street-style blogs.) Reiterating how bad fashion can be doesn't help the positive voices within who have gone behind enemy lines. There are some intelligent, creative and kind feminists working their way up the fashion ladder (promise!) who should be lauded and encouraged. While they climb, I suggest drinking as much free champagne as possible and talking very loudly about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Cixous\" title=\"\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler\" title=\"\">Judith Butler</a> in front of Anna Wintour. If this doesn't make fashion more feminist-friendly, at least you could be sick on her shoes.</p>",

However, he was not content to reside in an ivory tower and his leadership of the independent thinktank the Study Commission on the Family (1978-82), and of its successor body the Family Policy Studies Centre (1983-92) was concerned with informing public debate and shaping policy reform.</p> <p>Both organisations produced highly respected analytical and non-partisan research on family trends and considered their implications for public policy.</p> <p>For his former colleagues \u2013 myself included \u2013 in those days before the internet and email, Friday afternoons spent stuffing press releases into envelopes, typically aided by Wicks providing a bottle of wine to encourage staff participation, and then physically dropping them around Fleet Street news desks were a regular feature.</p> <p>When he entered the Commons in 1992, Malcolm had already established a reputation for rigour in his analysis and for knowing his facts and figures, and this was a distinguishing feature of his style throughout his political career, somewhat to the early consternation of his ministerial speech writers.</p> <p>Malcolm's work in the early 1970s on the problems of the \"old and cold\", and the plight of older people who face fuel poverty and struggle to heat their homes every winter remained a central preoccupation, and one that he was able to address when he served as energy minister between 2005-8.</p> <p>He will be remembered for many things, but his achievement in taking a private member's bill through the house and seeing it become legislation in the 1995 Carers (Recognition and Services) Act stands out.</p> <p>For the first time, the act was concerned with people caring for relatives and friends and providing them with the daily support they needed to continue to remain in the community. It was an important first step in ensuring that the rights and needs of carers were recognised in legislation and it created a significant foundation for subsequent policy and practice.</p> <p>Four years later a national strategy for carers was introduced for the first time ever, and would never have happened without the Wicks Act. On a copy of the act that he gave me when it received Royal Assent on 28 June 1995 he had written in the margin \"no longer forgotten?\"</p> <p>Support for carers is still far from perfect, but the fact that it is now virtually unthinkable for social care policy not to include carers in any developments, and that people are far more carer-aware when looking at policy impact, owes much to the legacy of the Wicks Bill.</p> <p>Speaking at a seminar at the House of Commons organised by the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) on 24 April this year, Malcolm set out a vision for a 21st century social welfare system in a lecture on rights, wrongs and responsibilities.</p> <p>He began, as he often did, by looking back at the lessons of history (something that relatively few of his parliamentary colleagues appear to have much awareness of), and citing once again the giant evils of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness that remained to be vanquished.</p> <p>He pointed out that a modern Beveridge would surely have also recognised long-term care as one of the important risks to be covered by social insurance through a sharing of costs between the individual and the state.</p> <p>His argument that a future model for social security and a new social contract should restore \"the importance of the contributory principle as a key building block\" was timely and prescient, and the core concept of citizenship finds reinforcement in Ed Miliband's speech to the Labour Conference seeking to position Labour as the new \"one-nation party\".</p> <p>Sadly, Malcolm's illness and his shockingly early death aged only 65 have prevented him from playing a fuller role in developing his vision for a new system of welfare.</p> <p>However, the central themes of citizenship, rights and responsibilities, grounded on a clear foundation of values and principles seeking greater equality, empowering individuals rather than reinforcing dependency and promoting social cohesion, provide a powerful and informed analysis for others to inherit \"to carry the fire and light the spark\".</p> <p>Malcolm Hunt Wicks 1 July 1947 \u2013 29 September 2012.

  "<p>Cornwall may be most famous for its beautiful coast, but there is more to the south-west corner of the UK than tourism and hospitality.</p> <p>Those considering starting a business in Cornwall would be welcomed by a vibrant community of small businesses and plenty of resources to help them get started.</p> <p>\"The small business network here is very close and tight. Everybody is always willing to help each other,\" says Charlotte Parker, the founder of cleaning business Charlie's Angels. \"There's a great community spirit. I work alongside lots of other small businesses and we support each other.\"</p> <p>From a population of 500,000 there are currently 22,000 VAT-registered businesses. Nearly all of them are small and medium-sized. \"All but 60 of these businesses are SMEs,\" says Kim Conchie, the chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce. \"We estimate that there are at least as many small businesses below the VAT threshold, but there is no way of knowing exactly how many smaller businesses there are throughout the region.\"</p> <p>Conchie says the business community in Cornwall is very broad. \"Businesses range from the bedrock industries you'd expect to see in Cornwall, such as food and tourism, as well as those with mining heritage,\" he explains. \"But we also have vibrant groups of more modern industries including knowledge-based businesses as well as those in marine renewables.\"</p> <h2>Plenty of talent</h2> <p>A growing graduate population means there is a rich talent pool and Cornwall is well above the national average in terms of qualifications held by its residents. Many graduates choose to stay in the region after completing their degrees.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Cornwall is an attractive place to live and work in, which, in turn, means there's no shortage of skills and talent in the county \u2013 particularly in growth sectors like IT, renewable energy and aerospace,\" says Alison Elvey de Rios, a manager at Invest in Cornwall. \"The launch of the south west marine energy park earlier this year will consolidate much of the expertise we have in marine energy, helping Cornish businesses in the sector grow and expand into international markets. In the aerospace sector, the new Aerohub enterprise zone at Newquay Airport is set to create up to 2,500 jobs by attracting businesses that will benefit from a simplified planning system and business rate discounts.\"</p> <p>One entrepreneur who has successfully taken advantage of Cornwall's hospitality heritage is Ben Hawkins, who launched bakery Da Bara with his brother last year. They have since scooped big clients including Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant in Watergate Bay.</p> <p>\"My brother and I both have a background in the hotel and catering trade and we started our business specifically targeting that sector,\" he says. \"We started out on a part-time basis baking at the weekend and test-traded that way. We set up a little industrial unit in our spare time and launched full-time six weeks after. It has gone really well.\"</p> <h2>Happier days</h2> <p>Cornwall has come through some bleak periods of high unemployment after the decline of traditional mining and fishing industries. Identified as an Objective One region by the European Union in 1999, the county received \u00a3350m in funding to revive its fortunes. Eight years later, in 2007, still deemed to have an economy below the EU average, the region was awarded Convergence status and received a further \u00a3415m to develop the local economy through investment in people and infrastructure.</p> <p>This funding means that there is now a solid business-ready infrastructure in place. Already there is 97% broadband coverage and by 2014, the \u00a3132m <a href=\"http://www.convergencecornwall.com/convergence-investments/next-generation-broadband-for-cornwall-and-the-isles-of-scilly-.php\" title=\"\">Next Generation Broadband</a> project will bring Europe's fastest broadband connectivity to Cornwall.</p> <p>There are plenty of encouragements for prospective startups, with an array of organisations offering practical and financial support. \"In the current economic climate, the financial help available to businesses locating in Cornwall is particularly compelling,\" says Elvey de Rios. \"The county provides some of the highest levels of business support and grants in the UK, such as the Grant for Business Investment, which offers up to 50% matched funding.\"</p> <h2>Startup support</h2> <p>When launching Da Bara, Hawkins received startup support from Outset Cornwall, a free programme for people who have a business idea and need help to get it off the ground. \"While we were doing the part-time baking, I went along to Outset Cornwall every week to attend their intensive startup course. It helped so much, especially with pricing our products. I think we'd have struggled without their help,\" he says.</p> <p>He has enjoyed being part of the vibrant group of small businesses in the county. \"It is very active. Our business is on a small estate and there are lots of very small businesses. There are no empty units here.\"</p> <p>However, it is a competitive environment, he explains. \"With a smaller population you have to try that little bit harder to bring in enough money.\"</p> <p>On the upside, the smaller population also means that things move at a slower pace, which can be helpful for startups, says Parker. \"If you are in a bigger place like London and Bristol it may be harder to get all the support you need because people don't have the time, they are so busy. But in Cornwall it is a lot more laid back and there is time for people to sit back and listen and give each other great tips,\" she explains.</p> <p>Of course, it's impossible to talk about starting a business in Cornwall without mentioning the quality-of-life factor. Whether starting a new business or relocating an existing venture, Cornwall is bound to delight you with its 300 miles of stunning coastline and beautiful inland moors, combined with low rates of crime and more daylight hours than any other part of the UK.</p> <p>Hawkins says the quality of life is a highlight of running his own business in the area. \"The cost of living is fairly high, but Cornwall is a lovely place to be. It is nice and quiet and being able to go to the beach when you are not working is great,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Labour activists will have left Manchester with a warm glow as far as the NHS is concerned. The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, was cheered to the rafters in meeting after meeting as he committed to repealing the reviled 2012 Health and Social Care Act, and prolonged applause greeted leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband as he pledged \"an end to the free market experiment\" with the NHS</a>.</p> <p>So far so good, and it would doubtless be tricky at this stage of the political cycle for Labour to set out a detailed strategy on exactly what this involves and how it will be achieved. However, it is important to be hard-headed about all of this. There is a world of difference between Burnham's emphatic tweet (\"I'll repeal the act. Full stop\") and the reality of unpicking fiendishly complex legislation.</p> <p>The first caveat is that the pledge is to repeal only those sections of the act concerned with the promotion of markets and competition \u2013 part 3. This is certainly the right place to start, for this is where the act is pernicious and why Lansley wanted to cement his reforms in legislation. <a href=\"http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Monitor</a>, the misnamed <a href=\"http://www.ccpanel.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Co-operation and Competition Panel</a>, Any Qualified Provider (AQP) and the 49% private patient cap would all presumably be swept away.</p> <p>This leaves a lot of things still in place \u2013 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), commissioning support units, joint strategic needs assessments, health and wellbeing boards, health and wellbeing strategies and the transfer of some public health functions to local government. Interestingly, these are largely the concessions Lansley made to the Liberal Democrats to keep them on board with his part 3 reforms. Keeping all of these is consistent with Burnham's parallel pledge at the conference \u2013 no more structural change. \"I don't need new organisations,\" he said. \"I will simply ask those I inherit to work differently.\"</p> <p>This is where it starts to get tricky. The new buzz word is \"integration\", which is currently (at best) the junior ideology in the NHS act. Burnham would put this centre stage. He talks enthusiastically of the need to holistically combine \"the social, the mental and the physical\" and says all options must be considered \u2013 \"full integration of health and social care\", \"one budget, one system\".</p> <p>How this can be achieved without substantial structural change is unclear. Burnham seems to be saying that local authorities will take the commissioning lead for integrated care, but where does this leave the new kids on the commissioning block, CCGs? Putting local authorities into the NHS driving seat is a radical notion, especially at a time when they have little purpose other than to implement central government cuts. There could be an attractive case made for elevating health and wellbeing boards into local whole-system bodies with real powers and budgets, but not without structural upheaval.</p> <p>There is a further problem strewed across the path of repeal. By 2016, once the election dust has settled, private companies will be well embedded in the NHS. As research for the Labour Party is showing, the AQP strategy is already resulting in private companies winning large long-term contracts, especially for community health services. In four years time the private sector will be strongly embedded in the NHS and Labour will need to think how the situation can be retrieved. Refusing to renew contracts will take time and be messy, while uncompensated sequestration would presumably be a goldmine for lawyers. And what of NHS assets already sequestered and sold by the new government property company, PropCo?</p> <p>Finally there is the whole issue of exposure of the NHS to UK and EU competition law. Labour's plan is to remove the NHS from the edicts of competition law, but this might be harder than expected. In his book,Never Again, Nick Timmins reveals even back in 2006, as Labour was creating an NHS price list, re-introducing choice, commissioning independent sector treatment centres and encouraging competition between NHS and private hospitals, Norman Warner, the health minister of state in the Lords, had asked for a legal opinion. While heavily qualified, it said the combination of these changes certainly opened up the possibility that the courts would decide that EU law applied.</p> <p>This suggests that getting rid of Monitor would not be sufficient. The European Court has already ruled that the Spanish NHS is not subject to EU competition rules because it \"operates according to the principle of solidarity\". Indeed this is why neither Wales nor Scotland will be encumbered by EU law. This sounds exactly what Labour would want for the NHS, but it might mean having to go even further by abolishing Foundation Trust status, reintegrating the NHS family and eradicating the purchaser-provider split introduced in the Thatcher years.

  "<p>The largest investor in BAE Systems has thrown the defence contractor's proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger with EADS into doubt by raising \"significant reservations\" in a detailed critique that questions the logic, financial benefit and security implications of the deal.</p> <p>Invesco Perpetual, which owns 13.3% of the company, took the unusual step of going public with its concerns on Monday morning, ahead of Wednesday's UK takeover panel deadline to thrash out an agreement between BAE and EADS.</p> <p>Invesco said it could not see the rationale for the merger between a British defence business and the owner of Airbus. \"Other than diversification \u2013 which investors can achieve for themselves more cheaply and simply \u2013 Invesco does not understand the strategic logic for the proposed combination,\" the fund management firm said.</p> <p>Invesco's intervention, which echoes concerns raised by the EADS shareholder Lagard\u00e8re and Conservative MPs, makes it likely that there will be an extension to the Wednesday deadline. In a point-by-point critique, Invesco added that the deal would \"materially jeopardise\" BAE's position in the US defence market; the proposed holding of stakes by the French and German governments would result in a business driven by politics and not shareholder value; and there would be lower dividends for BAE shareholders in the future.</p> <p>\"Invesco has, on and off, owned shares in BAE for over 20 years. Invesco believes BAE is a strong business with distinctive positions in the global defence market (especially in the US and UK) and good standalone prospects. We look forward to discussions with the board of BAE and other BAE shareholders in the coming days.\"</p> <p>Invesco's intervention comes as the British, French and German governments hold further talks on Monday in an attempt to break the impasse over the merger. Sources close to the proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus admitted that both companies are likely to seek an extension to the deadline. One source said it was \"less likely than more likely\" that a deal will be reached by Wednesday, although the granting of more time by the panel is considered a formality given the complexities of the merger. \"The betting is on an extension being applied for,\" said the source.</p> <p>EADS's and BAE's advisers have made preparations for an extension, while playing down reports from Germany last week that intergovernmental talks over the deal are on the verge of collapse. The French and German governments each control 22.35% of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings, while the British government can block the transaction through a golden share in BAE that allows it to prevent foreign ownership of the business.</p> <p>Talks to protect those national interests have hit difficulties after a conference call between government representatives on Friday saw Germany stun France and the UK with a request that the headquarters of the combined business be based in Munich. Germany is also seeking a guarantee from Paris that its stake in the new company will not be larger than 9%, the same size as Berlin's proposed stakeholding.</p> <p>The three governments will make a further attempt to settle their differences in a conference call on Monday. The British representatives on the call will include Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, with France represented by Emmanuel Macron, an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Germany by Lars Hendrik-R\u00f6ller, chief economic adviser to the chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p> <p>The UK defence secretary, Philip Hammond, warned on Sunday that the government will block the deal if there is excessive French and German control of the business. Such a scenario is also expected to trigger a US veto of the deal, with the Pentagon's approval still needed because it is BAE's biggest single customer.</p> <p>\"We want to see this company \u2026 prospering as a commercial business, focused on doing things that are right for the business, not beholden to or controlled by any one government,\" Hammond told BBC Radio 4.</p> <p>Indicating that the government would allow some French and German ownership, he added: \"It is not necessary to have no French or German government interest in the company. It is necessary to reduce that stake below the level at which it can control or direct the way the company acts.\"</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, told Sky News that the deal must protect UK jobs, with EADS and BAE employing more than 50,000 staff in Britain and representing the country's biggest manufacturing employer. \"Our priorities are of course the national security of the United Kingdom. Second: jobs and investment in the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p>I didn't always see myself as a lawyer at an international law firm, but that's the path my career has taken. Here are the lessons I learned while at university about securing my future in the legal profession.</p> <p><strong>First year \u2013 do your research and remember your first year grades count</strong></p> <p>Some of my colleagues always wanted to be lawyers. Others, like me, were not so sure. When I started my law degree I knew it would open up lots of opportunities and potential career paths but I didn't really know much about law firms or what life as a lawyer would entail.</p> <p>While researching, I discovered lots of events to help students gain an insight into the legal profession. A friend told me about one that works with students from a variety of different backgrounds who are interested in a legal career. I applied for one and a fantastic opportunity followed where I spent time meeting people from City law firms, visiting their offices and finding out first-hand what it takes to follow in their footsteps.</p> <p>My advice would be to do as much research as possible into the opportunities to learn more about careers in law. Many firms run early insight programmes and open days; attend as many of those as possible. They crystallised my decision to become a lawyer, and gave me a really good insight into what to do next. They also gave me the confidence to apply for vacation schemes. I looked objectively at the criteria \u2013 a strong academic profile and a genuine interest in the law and commerce \u2013 and realised that there is a level playing field if you put yourself forward.</p> <p>It may seem premature to start visiting careers fairs in your first year, but they are a great place to begin your research. Talking to law firm representatives and listening to their presentations will give you a really good insight into whether a career in the law is for you and how to go about getting one; their websites will list when they are planning to visit your campus. If you make a good impression, ask the right questions and build a rapport with the law firm graduate recruitment team members, it can really stand you in good stead (they have great memories).</p> <p>With all the other distractions that university life offers, it's easy to succumb to the perception that your first year exam results don't matter, especially if they don't count towards your overall degree grade. This couldn't be further from the truth if you are thinking about a career in the law. When I came to apply for vacation schemes, I quickly discovered that your first year exam results are very important; they are the most recent academic profile that firms have to go on. If you apply yourself, it should pay off.</p> <p><strong>Second year \u2013 get some experience and a foot in the door</strong></p> <p>If you are serious about a career in law, the best thing you can do is apply for a vacation scheme in your second year at university.</p> <p>Don't be fooled into thinking you have all the time in the world. The sooner you start applying the better. Not only will it give you more time to tailor your application to the firm you are applying to (beyond substituting one law firm name for another), but it's a huge relief to hear that you've secured a place on a vacation scheme before some of your friends have even applied.</p> <p>With so many students boasting a strong academic record, securing a vacation scheme is about more than just exam results. It's important to do something beyond academics to talk about at interview and to prove that you're a well-rounded candidate. I mentored young people through a London School of Economics scheme to help raise young people's aspirations and encourage them to apply to university. It equipped me with useful skills such as problem solving, which I use everyday as a lawyer, and gave me lots of examples to use during the interview process.</p> <p>If you are successful in securing a vacation scheme placement, prepare for the work to be quite different to your degree. I found that my degree mainly focused on theoretical concepts, whereas in practice how to apply the law matters.</p> <p>Also make the most of the opportunities that firms create during this time to talk to lawyers and find out which firm is the place you want to forge your long-term career. My vacation scheme at Freshfields was a good mix of seminars and on-the-job experience. I was given real work to do and had regular contact with a range of lawyers, from trainees to partners. It's not all work though, a lot of effort is put into organising social events. They are a great way to network informally with people who could become colleagues in a few years.</p> <p>Usefully, many law firms give you the opportunity to interview for a training contract place during or shortly after your vacation scheme so treat the whole scheme like an extended interview. Show enthusiasm and the ability to work well in a team and you could turn work experience into a training contract.</p> <p><strong>Third year. Focus on exams and prepare for law school</strong></p> <p>All being well, by the time you get to your third year, you've already got a training contract in the bag. But don't despair if that's not the case. Law firms do take on graduates who have not done a vacation scheme, (there are usually more training contracts available than places on vacation schemes) but obviously the more experience you have to talk about at interview the better.</p> <p><em>Sayo Ogundele is a newly qualified solicitor at </em><a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com/en/global/\" title=\"\"><em>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>1) Is Mark Hughes bulletproof?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/wba-qpr-premier-league-match-report\">Despite presiding over a dreadful start to the season,</a> Mark Hughes has received the strongest possible support from his employers. Tony Fernandes, the QPR chairman, has suggested Hughes is safe come what may. These are, of course, early days but there is a wider picture that makes for uncomfortable reading at QPR: Hughes's record since his appointment at Loftus Road back in January reads P25 W6 D4 L15. That, quite simply, is relegation form. Hughes has been heavily backed in the transfer market since he took over and, although it takes time for players to gel, QPR fans are entitled to expect much better than two points from the opening seven matches this season. The fans have yet to turn on him \u2013 the absence of any vocal criticism from the hardcore support behind the goal at The Hawthorns is a better gauge of the mood than any messages sent to Fernandes's twitter account \u2013 but the chairman would be na\u00efve to think the faithful will continue to buy into his theory that \"stability\" is key should results fail to improve. Hughes badly needs a first league victory of the season, although that seems unlikely to happen until he sorts out a shambolic defence that has conceded 19 goals in nine games this season. <strong>Stuart James</strong></p> <h2>2) Is James Milner better as a holding midfielder?</h2> <p>Against a disappointing Sunderland side, James Milner proved effective as a defensive midfielder in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/manchester-city-sunderland-premier-league\">Manchester City's 3-0 win</a>. Rarely a starter for any big game under Roberto Mancini, Milner played the best football of his career operating centrally for his former club, Aston Villa. Lacking the artistry of David Silva or Samir Nasri, City's prime wide operators, Milner has the energy and tenacity to prosper as a midfield shield though whether he gets a chance before Gareth Barry, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Javi Garc\u00eda and Jack Rodwell may be unlikely. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <h2>3) Chelsea need to be convinced and convincing </h2> <p>Unless some new information or interpretation comes to light over the coming weeks, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/chelsea-norwich-city-premier-league\">the game against Norwich</a> should represent John Terry's and Ashley Cole's last ever appearance for Chelsea. No decent club can employ a captain who racially abuses an opponent, nor anyone who conspires with him to compound that offence by misleading investigation into it. <strong>Paul Doyle</strong></p> <h2>4) Is Arouna Kon\u00e9 one of the bargains of the year?</h2> <p>Swansea's Michu scored 15 goals in La Liga last season, cost \u00a32m and his arrival has been widely described as one of the coups of the summer. But what about Arouna Kon\u00e9? The Ivorian striker was twice as expensive, at \u00a34m, after striking 15 times for Levante last year and his brief Wigan career has already produced three goals as well as an assist for Franco di Santo <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/wigna-everton-report-premier-league\">on Saturday</a>. A criticism of Roberto Mart\u00ednez's record in the transfer market is that he has struggled to sign fine strikers but, equipped with pace, power and a predatory instinct, Kon\u00e9 seems the class act Wigan have long lacked. <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <h2>5) Why must players be booked for celebrating?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/arsenal-santi-carzola-glen-hoddle\">Mohamed Diam\u00e9 scored one of the best goals of his career at Upton Park on Saturday</a>, the Senegalese's flashed finish thrusting a side recently promoted from the Championship into the lead against one of the division's Champions League participants. It prompted a predictably raucous reaction in the stands. Yet within seconds Diam\u00e9 had been booked for venturing to the advertising hoardings to celebrate with the home support \u2013 the same would later apply to Theo Walcott \u2013 thereby flirting with dismissal at every subsequent challenge. Indeed, he might have been dismissed within seven minutes after crunching Mikel Arteta. \"It put him on the edge,\" said Sam Allardyce of the original booking. \"We had to tell him at half-time not to make another tackle. I don't think referees should be booking players for things like that but they're doing what they're told by the police. But nobody can control himself when he scores a goal, so why punish him? Players running to fans doesn't cause a problem these days because everybody's reasonably well behaved.\" Even in an occasionally fractious London derby, it was hard not to agree. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> <h2>6) James Morrison is very good</h2> <p>As if James Morrison did not have trouble enough, what with redeeming his name from pop music abomination, the faddish nature of football formations is to his significant disadvantage. But, though the box-to-box midfielder is almost extinct, he is arguing the case for its conservation with increasing eloquence, illustrating his value <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/wba-qpr-premier-league-match-report\">with another goal and assist on Saturday</a>. Yet he is far more than a Fantasy League player and his former club manager, Roy Hodgson, probably wishes he could pick him for England. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <h2>7) Christian Benteke does Paul Lambert no favours at White Hart Lane <br></h2> <p>Paul Lambert's reasoning for once again omitting Darren Bent from the starting Aston Villa line-up and persisting with Benteke was sound. The manager wanted cover in wide areas in a new-look 4-2-3-1 formation against opponents that attack in numbers on the flanks; Benteke is the better lone target man as he is capable of hold-up work while Bent likes to play alongside a No9 and thrives on balls in behind. It should be noted that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/tottenham-hotspur-aston-villa-match-report\">Villa restricted Tottenham in the first half</a>. But when two opportunities knocked for Benteke early in the second period, the second a gilt-edged header, his failures to convert put Lambert in a tight spot. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <h2>8) Saints should play to the whistle</h2> <p>Southampton players fell like ninepins <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/southampton-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">in the first half against Fulham</a> but, on most occasions, Mark Clattenburg, the referee, deemed that the injuries were not serious and tried to keep the play moving, regardless of which team had possession \u2013 as he is instructed to. But the home players constantly pleaded with him to stop the game, which destroyed the natural ebb and flow. Play to the whistle, guys. <strong>Russell Kempson</strong></p> <h2>9) Manchester United still have the quality</h2> <p>Manchester United impressed and also reminded everyone of the quality in their ranks <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/newcastle-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">against Newcastle</a>. The club lives within its means but we sometimes forget that they have the budget both to sign outstanding, costly players such as Robin van Persie, whose wages must be large indeed. Newcastle United are skilled in buying wisely but those sums do not buy men of quite their opponents' calibre. <strong>Kevin McCarra</strong></p> <h2>10) Brendan Rodgers' principles are admirable \u2026 up to a point</h2> <p>The name of Andy Carroll will always arise when Liverpool fail to score and several dangerous crosses into the penalty area go begging in the process, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/07/liverpool-stoke-city-premier-league\">as was the case against Stoke City</a>. This does not render the argument worthless. \"I'm not one who will go down the desperation route,\" was Brendan Rodgers' direct response to the Carroll question on Sunday. It was not a sign the Liverpool manager will be turning on the charm offensive to get the centre-forward back in January, yet Rodgers deployed Martin Skrtel up front in the final 10 minutes of the defeat by Manchester United and the defender almost won the game against Stoke in the 90th minute. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Monday<br></h2> <h2>Wonderland: I Was Once a Beauty Queen<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>The Miss Great Britain beauty pageants of the 1970s and 80s may look unspeakable nowadays (or at least \"a bit naff\"), but in their heyday they pulled in millions. This fine, reflective documentary finds out what happened to the winners, now older and wiser; former beauty queens such as Madeleine Stringer (Miss UK 1977) who in reply to the question \"And what are you going to be when you grow up?\" told a leering, diminutive host: \"I don't know \u2026 what are you going to be when you grow up?\" <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>8 Out Of 10 Cats<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Season 14 of the shouty 8 Out Of 10 Cats, which in the panel show stakes sits somewhere between the enjoyable Would I Lie To You and the creaky Mock the Week. Jimmy Carr \u2013 still in the quizmaster's seat \u2013 has a newly installed target on his back marked \"tax avoider\", and team captains Sean Lock and Jon Richardson will likely be the ones taking aim. Nothing in the way of info about this opening episode, but even money says that an Olympian will be present. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>The Great Train Robbery<br>10:35pm, ITV1</h2> <p>To use historian Dominic Sandbrook's phrase: how did the Great Train Robbery take on the aura of an \"Ealing Comedy enterprise\" so that violent career criminals became folk heroes? In a documentary presumably made to accompany recent ITV1 drama Mrs Biggs, robbers and their families are among those recalling the events of 1963, when Bruce Reynolds led a team that stole \u00a32.6m from the Glasgow-London mail train. Telling details here linger longest: it was a townie's mistake for the gang to assume they could hide out unnoticed in a remote farmhouse, and the men's wives looked like \"gangsters' molls from central casting\" at the trial. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Magnificent Machines: The Golden Age of the British Sports Car<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>We have Americans to thank for the postwar boom in the British sports car industry. Resourceful GIs liked the look of the MG cars they saw here so much that after the war they shipped them home, breeding an unthought-of demand. MG quickly developed its influential T-series, the first of many classics. This doc captures the allure of those British vehicles (the beautiful Jag; the fun-to-drive MG; the best-of-both-worlds Austin Healey) and makes it engaging. Motoring journalists supply the context and say \"trousers\" a lot. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Hunderby<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Last in the exquisitely funny series. Helene is confined to the attic until her pelvic explosion cometh, while Doctor Foggarty, wretched with drink, tries to make another go of it with Crippled Hester. Julia Davis and co-writer Barunka O'Shaughnessy must take several bows to deafening applause for this comic masterpiece. The hoot-per-minute rate has remained high throughout and among an exemplary cast, Alex MacQueen (as Edmund) did a full Sheryl Crow, moving from comedy backing singer to lead vocals with aplomb. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397250846\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/5/1349437237535/Jewish-Mum-of-the-Year----010.jpg\" alt=\"Jewish Mum of the Year \u2026 hugely enjoyable.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jewish Mum of the Year \u2026 hugely enjoyable.

In 2011, Camille Strachan announced that she would be selling tickets for a package of IVF treatment worth \u00a325,000 (her plan was to offer 1m tickets at \u00a320 each). Cue a media storm and claims that Camille was preying on desperate people. Director Joseph Martin follows Camille as she launches the project, and \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 sees it lose its charity status and face scrutiny from the Gambling Commission. But, with IVF on the NHS considered a \"postcode lottery\" and couples priced out of private care, does a lotto actually offer hope? <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <h2>Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>This \"emotional history of Britain\" is as much fun as it sounds, exploring the gap that exists between the emoting \"new man\" of today and the steely, remote, army officer type of the Victorian era. Tonight's episode finds Hislop in part investigating the role of the English public school, specifically, the mid-19th century boom in founding schools such as Hislop's own alma mater Ardingly College. Pupils here were not the sons of gentry but of the middle classes, and showed themselves full of the same stout qualities as their betters. Are you blubbing, boy? <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Jewish Mum of the Year<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>What do Caprice, Uri Geller and Ed Miliband have in common? The answer: Jewish mothers, those most archetypal of mums, with, as Vanessa Feltz puts it, \"an umbilical cord made of steel, concrete and chicken soup\". In this hugely enjoyable, Apprentice-style reality show, a dozen compete for the distinction of being Jewish Mum of the Year. Which, as Yiddish scholar and competition judge Dovid Katz points out, won't be easy to adjudicate: \"All Jewish mothers think that they're the Jewish mother of the year.\" <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>It's term two and the housemates need to find a newbie now that Paul Lamb, the Invisible Man has moved out. Kingsley is experimenting with facial hair, Shales and Oregon are over \u2013 which is awkward in lectures - and Josie has a new best friend. But what of her and the Pussy Man? Vod is on the scrounge again and Howard's got a new job at the abattoir, while JP is struggling with his best friend's latest revelation. No timid fresher, this: Fresh Meat established itself so quickly as part of the TV landscape, it's like they've never been away. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Lilyhammer<br>10pm, BBC4</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397250847\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/5/1349440656737/DCI-Banks---superior-dete-010.jpg\" alt=\"DCI Banks \u2026 superior detective drama.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DCI Banks \u2026 superior detective drama.

He is perturbed, however, to find that her midwife is a man. After kicking off about this, they are transferred to a less desirable hospital, setting Frank up for some rather convoluted back and forth which involves back-scratching, poker and the Norwegian equivalent of the Guardian Angels in order to get their maternity slot back. It's still awash with dramatic misfire and tonally, it's a complete and utter mess, but Van Zandt is still lovely to be around. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Jews at Ten<br>10pm, More4</h2> <p>Four-part series examining and celebrating Jewish culture, and specifically Jewish humour. There's an obvious debt owed here to such similar self-mocking laugh-ins as Old Jews Telling Jokes, but - such is the astonishing influence on television, music, film and literature of Jewish wit - it's not like there's a shortage of material to go around. This first episode considers Jewish holidays and their observance. Among those recalling Barmitzvahs, yom kippurs and hanukkahs they have attended are David Baddiel, Stacey Solomon, Elliot Gould and Uri Geller. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Nurse Jackie<br>10.35pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Season four opens with a bang. Several bangs, actually, as everything that's threatened to come tumbling down on Jackie's troubled head over the years finally hits her. She's left with a random dead body on her hands when she picks up a heroin addict (Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong) in a church, but O'Hara bails her out one last time. Eddie's simmering lust boils over into a confession which provides one of the darkest, funniest Nurse Jackie moments ever. And it's all change for O'Hara, who has big news, and Akalitus, who's facing the chop. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p>Wednesday</p> <h2>Great British Food Revival<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>The series celebrating the best British produce returns with an A-list roster of chefs hoping to raise awareness of our food heritage by championing their favourite ingredients. In the first episode, Michel Roux Jr looks at the past, present and future of that summer institution, the strawberry. It's almost a given that he'll rope in tennis pundits Sue Barker et al for a blind tasting; more interesting is how a charity is reviving the ancient practice of harvesting strawberries by gleaning. Meanwhile, James Martin crusades for the humble watercress by working as a street salesman in London's Covent Garden. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>DCI Banks<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>With DS Annie Cabbot (Andrea Lowe) about to head off on maternity leave, change is in the air for DCI Alan Banks (Stephen Tompkinson) and his plods. In particular, the frighteningly efficient DI Helen Morton (Caroline Catz) is drafted in as Banks's deputy, with her first job being to investigate her own boss, who goes missing just as his address is found in a murder victim's car. A superior detective drama ensues, despite a showdown scene between two of the main characters that doesn't quite ring true. Part one of two. <em>JW</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397250848\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348671791670/Hunted-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hunted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Rayner and Melissa George in Hunted.

There's more superstition as Lillian has a vision of doom that she must solve. No need, really, as doom's never too far away from the Chatsworth estate; best to just wait and see. Meanwhile, Karen has a more down-to-earth problem when she suspects Jamie of cheating. Unfortunately, she turns to exactly the wrong person for help. <em>Phelim O'Neil</em></p> <h2>Be Your Own Boss<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Richard Reed is the floppy-haired gent behind the Innocent smoothie empire, and this show sees him position himself somewhere between Dragons' Den and The Secret Millionaire. He has big cash to invest in a business that piques his interest, but wants to persuade his proteges to think big. This week he offers some seed capital to two relaunching family businesses and to one bright young spark. They're all quirky and promising but as Richard is at pains to point out: if they don't take it seriously it's not business; it's a hobby that loses money. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Fight Club: A History of Violence<br>9pm, Yesterday</h2> <p>A four-part series, this, about the story of organised fighting, narrated by Sean Bean. We start in 1810, when London was cruelly riven with social inequality and a lust for bloodsports, among them female bare-knuckle \"catfighting\". Hugely popular with both upper and lower classes alike, it made a star of one Elizabeth Stokes, who assured patrons of her no-holds-barred brawls that she \"dressed modestly\" when doing so. Re-enactments of these fisticuffs \u2013 conducted before a baying mob \u2013 add an uncomfortably salacious air to proceedings. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>How to Survive a Disaster Movie<br>10pm, 5*</h2> <p>Presenters Eric Lampaert and Joel Dommett look into real-life ways in which we might survive the life-threatening trials of the average disaster movie, from disabling an alligator using electrical tape to stopping yourself getting savaged alive by pirahna fish (distract them with a steak). The whimsy wanes almost instantaneously, leaving nowt but a procession of gamely patient \"experts\" answering some bloody silly questions. At an hour long, How to Survive a Disaster Movie is too much to ask of anyone, even the relatives of those involved. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397250849\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/5/1349440251083/Servants-The-True-Story-o-010.jpg\" alt=\"Servants: The True Story of Life Below Stairs with Pamelz Cox.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Servants: The True Story of Life Below Stairs with Pamela Cox. Photograph: Brendan Easton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Easton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Even with a handy recap of last week's episode in the pre-credits, Hunted isn't the kind of show you can just jump into. Still, it's worth the work, as there's plenty of fun to be had. The whole thing is so fast-paced that there's little time to consider the logic of it all: Melissa George's Sam/Alex continually gets herself into situations where she's about two seconds from having her cover blown. Not a good week for Hasan either: he's put through the wringer when captured and both sides want him dead. <em>PO'N</em></p> <h2>The Plane Crash<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>While auto companies routinely smash vehicles into walls in the name of \"safety\", the approach has never been taken with aircraft. Until now, that is. A team of scientists, experts and test pilots take a Boeing 727 and slam it into the Mexican desert in a meticulously co-ordinated experiment to measure the effectiveness of modern safety features. With analysis of the aftermath and interviews with survivors of real crashes, this makes for compelling viewing and might just result in you clamouring for the statistically safer seats next time you book an overseas trip. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Corfu: A Tale Of Two Islands<br>10.35pm, ITV1</h2> <p>With roughly 500,000 British tourists visiting each year, Corfu is the most visited of the Ionian islands. Indeed, more British people tread on Greek soil in Corfu than Greeks, a peculiar stat whichever way you slice it. But things are changing. Economic troubles in that part of the world have hammered tourism, and expats are feeling the pain. Once a draw to the European jetset, a split between the haves and struggling-to-haves is becoming more stark by the day, as this new series, which follows the fortunes of both tourists and expats, attests. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9pm, Dave</h2> <p>Second outing this series for the Jupiter Mining Corp's least adept crew. With Lister busy trying to become a better father (to his near-future self), the remaining Dwarfers install a new computer, the beautiful if ruthlessly precognitive Pree (Rebecca Blackstone). A clear improvement on the haphazard pantomime that opened the series, and several genuine belly laughs are on offer here, though you can't help but feel the need to dial down the staginess and laboured gags if the show is to get anywhere near the quality of imperial phase Dwarf. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Battle Castles With Dan Snow<br>9pm, Discovery</h2> <p>It sounds like a role-playing game and has been edited to look like Game Of Thrones. Serious historical discovery, however, is what Battle Castle is all about. Tonight Dan Snow introduces this new series in his customary fashion: charging towards camera and gesticulating like he is in a hip-hop video. He is actually explaining the significant features of Crac Des Chevaliers \u2013 a crusader castle in modern-day Syria. There's a decent ratio of historical context to fast edits of arrows piercing flesh, but the story of the castle is at least as interesting an engineering tale as it is a military one. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The British <br>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Sky's breakneck history of these Isles continues to rattle along, heavy on visuals and dramatisations, light on narrative. This week, we thunder through Captain Cook's discovery of Australia, taken by the expedient of shooting over the heads of the understandably querulous Aborigines they encountered on the beach, the acquisition of cotton from India, the Luddite revolt and the industrial age \u2013 in which Britain drew on enterprise, the resources of Empire and cheap Irish labour to build great cities and power the world. <em>DS</em></p> <p>Friday</p> <h2>Have I Got News For You <br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>HIGNFY will likely never rediscover the bite of the Deayton era, yet it does seem to be recovering from the stupor of the last few years, where the panel seemed to favour giggling at YouTube clips over tearing into the establishment (simply pointing at the portliness of Prescott and Pickles doesn't count as political satire). Luckily, due to the tempting target of incapable politicos on both sides of the Atlantic and Paul Merton remembering how funny he can still be, the show is back on the rise. Clare Balding is on hosting duties for this series opener. <em>MJ</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In the final part of her history of British servants, Dr Pamela Cox examines how the 20th century brought the established system of domestic service to an end. While the first world war drained the great houses of manpower, women either stepped in to fill the male roles or worked in factories; and many were reluctant to return to service in cap and apron. The advent of the suburban housewife in the 1930s heralded the \"daily servant\", while the servant class was destroyed after 1945 as women took on jobs in offices and shops. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Me and Mrs Jones<br>9.30pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Starring Sarah Alexander as Gemma, a divorced mum, and Neil Morrissey as her ex-husband, now shacked up with a stern eastern European woman, it may be too early to judge this new sitcom made by an all-female team of writers and producers. Yet the lack of a laugh track is ominously matched by a lack of laughs in this opener, with script and set pieces feeling contrived, as Gemma is caught between dating a leery dad from the school run and experiencing a frisson of desire for her son's best friend. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Live International Football<br>7pm, Sky Sports 1</h2> <p>Wales host this World Cup 2014 qualifier, having made a disastrous start in their group, losing at home to Belgium and then facing a 6-1 shellacking in Serbia. Chris Coleman, who took over the job of Welsh manager following the tragic death of his friend Gary Speed, will be desperate to post some points on the board. Tonight's opponents Scotland \u2013 two points accrued thus far \u2013 haven't exactly been tearing up the table, though. So, Spain-Brazil this won't be, but an intriguing and evenly matched contest seems likely nonetheless. <em>DS</em></p> <h2>Squeeze: Take Me I'm Yours<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>It's an unenviable title to live up to \u2013 \"the best English songwriting duo since Lennon &amp; McCartney\" \u2013 but people have been calling Squeeze's Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook that for so long now, they might just have got away with it; Up The Junction alone is probably the best London song since Waterloo Sunset. This is a welcome profile of their much-loved band, and it is followed by a classic gig, and Paul Carrack: The Man With the Golden Voice, a documentary about the Sheffield-born singer, whose mighty lungs filled out Difford and Tilbrook's classic Tempted. <em>AJC</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>The last nugget of nostalgia sees little Martin Moone gearing up for his final week in primary education. Can he and Sean leave their mark on the school as they bring the \"mediocre era\" to a close and prepare to become men? Mum and Dad Moone regret their empty promise to let Sinead go to Girl Guide Jamboree if she comes top of the class, so will stop at nothing to scupper her studies. But there's a big bombshell to come as Fidelma, who's been cavorting with Dessie and his Daniel O'Donnell hair, makes a parent-shattering announcement. <em>HV</em></p>",
  "<p>The transfer war chest is one of football's most elusive objects. Everybody manager wants one, many are promised one, yet very few ever get their hands on one. They are jealously guarded by the shadowy forces that control them and as far as the Mill knows, no one outside a club's inner sanctum has ever seen one. That is, until now.</p> <p>Yes, the Mill has been granted exclusive access to one Premier League war chest. It's surprisingly large, about the size of a fridge freezer or two front-loading washing machines. It appears to be made of reclaimed teak stained the colour of conkers, but in each corner sits an exquisite sapphire. Along one side there is a carving of \u2026 yes, I'm pretty sure that's the face of Herbert Chapman. This can only mean one thing \u2013 it's a war chest for <strong>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger</strong>. Now before security catches up with us let's take a peep inside \u2026</p> <p>Holy moly, there must be a least \u00a335m in there. And look, there's also a scrap of paper. This must be Wenger's shopping list. Oh, disappointingly there's only one name on it, that of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker <strong>Radamel Falcao</strong> and the word \"Falcao\" is underlined in red pen with \"SPLASH IT ALL\" scrawled in huge letters next to it. Not sure what that could all mean.</p> <p>Also in January, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will, depending on which source you believe, get a \u00a325m war chest all of his very own to splash on <strong>Dortmund defender Mats Hummels and Milan midfielder Riccardo Montolivo</strong>, or a tupperware box containing \u00a34.58 in loose change with which to tempt Fulham to part with <strong>Brede Hangeland</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong>, like Bowser, wants rid of Mario, but unlike the pixelated king of the Koopas, he's not going to use a variety of turtles, fish and maniacal fruit in order to get the job done. Instead, he'll simply mention Balotelli's availability to Serie A's big boys and let them fight amongst themselves for his signature.</p> <p>Juventus won't be among their number though, as the Old Lady of Turin want the Old Man of the Ivory Coast instead. <strong>Didier Drogba's contractual situation</strong> in China is still about as clear as the washing up water after a couple of sinkfuls of pots, but Juve are at the front of the queue should the former Chelsea man break free of Shenhua's shackles.</p> <p>The Benfica striker <strong>Oscar Cardozo</strong> is on David Moyes's January shopping list. Much like Everton he's occasionally lumbering, occasionally majestic and available to buy for the right price. Unlike Everton he's won something recently \u2013 the Paraguayan player of the year award in 2009.</p> <p>Sunderland are going to let dangerously-close-to-uber-flop <strong>Connor Wickham</strong> head back to the Championship on loan to whoever can afford his wages.</p> <p>Also in the Championship, it's <strong>Tim Sherwood v Alan Shearer for the Blackburn job</strong>, while <strong>Mick McCarthy will take over at Bolton</strong> if Wanderers decide to ditch Owen Coyle. And after scoring twice again at the weekend Crystal Palace's <strong>Wilfried Zaha</strong> is a target for Tottenham, Fulham, Wigan, Sunderland, Uncle Tom Cobleigh, Uncle Tom Cobleigh's wife, all Uncle Tom Cobleigh's wife's friends, their families, their families' servants, their families' servants' tennis partners, and some chap I bumped into the other day called Bernard.</p>",
  "<p>A senior monk at Kagyu Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist centre near Dijon in France, has become the first ordained lama in the developed world to be imprisoned. Lama Tempa Dargye is being held in provisional detention, following allegations of rape and sexual violence by four women. One woman alleged that she was aged nine when she was raped. French police have also launched an investigation into financial irregularities at the centre.</p> <p>Kagyu Ling was founded in 1976 by the late Kalu Rinpoche, in response to a surge of interest in Tibetan Buddhism among western spiritual seekers. Kalu Rinpoche died in 1989. Within the last two years his reincarnation, the present Kalu Rinpoche, has assumed responsibility for the institutions set up by his predecessor. But during Kalu's childhood the situation at Kagyu Ling allegedly deteriorated to the point where it no longer functioned as a Buddhist centre. The young Kalu sacked Lama Tempa and five other resident Bhutanese monks, replacing them with westerners and a \"collegiate\" system of control and responsibility.</p> <p>Controversy over Kagyu Ling might then have died down \u2013 except for the fact that a woman known as Sandrine decided to tell her story of rape and sexual violence to the gendarmerie. At first she was a lone voice, but recently three more women decided to testify; Lama Tempa was arrested and the <a href=\"http://www.bienpublic.com/cote-d-or/2012/09/04/temple-des-mille-bouddhas-des-lamas-accuses-de-viols\" title=\"\">police investigation is ongoing</a>.</p> <p>The events at Kagyu Ling are currently making headlines in France, but Tibet-watchers worldwide are aware that many more scandals have surfaced since the lamas fled their homeland in the late 1950s, following the Chinese takeover of Tibet. Some examples: in America followers of the late Trungpa Rinpoche were horrified to learn that his appointed successor, the late Thomas Rich appeared to have infected several people with HIV.</p> <p>In 1994 the high-profile lama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jul/01/lama-sex-abuse-sogyal-rinpoche-buddhist\" title=\"\">Sogyal Rinpoche</a> was sued in California for sexual assault by a woman known as Janice Doe. The suit was settled out of court with substantial damages paid to the plaintiff. Rumours about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/jul/01/lama-sex-abuse-sogyal-rinpoche-buddhist?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Sogyal's sexual exploits</a> have circulated on the internet ever since. In Canberra, Australia, a respected Tibetan guru called <a href=\"http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=49,10104,0,0,1,0\" title=\"\">Lama Choedak</a> was forced to make a public apology after multiple affairs with his female students came to light.</p> <p>In the UK Michael Lyons, aka Mohan Singh, is serving 10 years in prison <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10770395\" title=\"\">after being convicted of rape</a>. He posed as a Tibetan lama, but had no authentic qualifications. The followers of an American, Geshe Michael Roach, ordained as a Tibetan monk, attracted media attention when <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-rose/stanford-grad-dies-in-cav_b_1536868.html\" title=\"\">one of them died in bizarre circumstances</a> after being ejected from a three-year retreat at a remote mountain centre in Arizona. \"Michael Roach teaches an extremely exaggerated, and from a Buddhist perspective somewhat dubious, form of tantrism,\" says Lama Jampa Thaye, an Englishman from Manchester who has been teaching Tibetan Buddhism for more than 30 years.</p> <p>The Shangri La factor is undoubtedly significant in the explosion of interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the world. The Dalai Lama's Nobel prize and his saintly reputation is another. His Holiness has an impressive track record in favour of nonviolence and as a champion of human rights \u2013 and he has warned against being seduced into Tibetan Buddhism by its exotic tantric aura, with hints of arcane sexual practices. Although he has never named and shamed any individual lama, he has recently publicly acknowledged that \"some tulkus have behaved badly\". He also cautions against rushing into commitment to a lama. \"In Tibet\", he says, \"it could take 12 years before a lama-disciple relationship was established.\" He points out that it is a big responsibility and should not be undertaken lightly by either party.</p> <p>So if you are attracted to Tibetan Buddhism, have read some books and learned some meditation techniques and now want to delve in deeper \u2013 how do you guard against being fooled by a charismatic charlatan? What criteria do you apply to your search for an authentic teacher? Lama Jampa Thaye's advice reflects a commonsense approach:</p> <p>\"Although one may come across examples of authentic Buddhist masters who dress or speak unconventionally, there is no licence in Buddhism for unethical behaviour. Thus oriental or occidental masters who claim their selfish and abusive behaviour is a display of 'skilful means' or 'crazy wisdom' are to be given a wide berth \u2013 unless we want to jump over a cliff hand in hand with them.\"</p>",
  "<p>An opposition victory, said Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, was as likely as snow in Maracaibo, a furnace of a city in western Venezuela. When hail subsequently fell on the city last month \u2013 reportedly the first in half a century \u2013 his opponents took heart. It was not snow, but maybe icy rain would suffice?</p> <p>It did not. Venezuela's president has vanquished his challenger and enraptured supporters to win a fourth term, extending his 14-year rule, health permitting, until 2019.</p> <p>Most opinion polls had given the 58-year-old a wide lead but a few showed him trailing, suggesting his cancer and the country's economic and social problems might end voters' faith in his revolution.</p> <p>Instead his electoral \"red machine\", a formidable combination of petro-state power and grassroots activism, mobilised the chavista base and floating voters to renew the mandate for \"21st-century socialism\" and the \"Bolivarian process\".</p> <p>His illness, along with Venezuela's high crime rate and crumbling infrastructure, risked swinging history's pendulum against him. But the victory showed enduring charisma and political mastery. A question mark, however, hovers over how long he will live to rule. Ch\u00e1vez claims to be cured but some palace insiders say the cancer is terminal.</p> <p>As results were announced some opponents cried foul, saying the president had abused state resources and illegally tilted the playing field against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/henrique-capriles-topple-hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles, 40, a state governor who had barnstormed the country, whipping up ecstatic support</a>.</p> <p>It was a familiar lament but Ch\u00e1vez, a shrewd strategist behind the clownish stunts, has for 14 years made a consistent, triumphant assertion: \"<em>Somos la mayor\u00eda</em>.\" We are the majority.</p> <p>It is the pillar of legitimacy that props up his socialist experiment and protects it from critics at home and abroad who claim Venezuela is veering towards autocracy and tyranny.</p> <p>After each election landslide, Ch\u00e1vez has emerged on to the \"people's balcony\" in Miraflores, the presidential palace in downtown Caracas, to savour acclaim from the crowds below.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary journey dating back to 1982. Ch\u00e1vez, a poor boy from the plains who adored folk tales and stories of Simon Bol\u00edvar, the 19th-century liberator, was a young army officer with a dream: revolt.</p> <p>Petrodollars and peaceful alternations of power between two parties had made this corner of South America a supposedly prosperous democracy but beneath the sheen festered oil dependence, corruption, poverty and social exclusion.</p> <p>The then Lieutenant Hugo Ch\u00e1vez recruited fellow officers into a conspiracy to overthrow the establishment and usher in a new, better democracy. After a decade of plotting, in February 1992, they attempted a coup. It was a military fiasco, letting the unpopular president, Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, survive, but Ch\u00e1vez, by now a lieutenant colonel, turned his televised surrender address into a political triumph. Eloquent and dashing in his red beret, he introduced himself to a startled nation \u2013 \"listen to Comandante Ch\u00e1vez\" \u2013 and said his objectives had not been met \"<em>por ahora</em>\" (for now). He deserved 30 years in jail, went the joke: one for the coup, 29 for failing.</p> <p>Pardoned and released after two years, he was adopted as a figurehead by a coalition of grassroots movements and small leftwing parties and stormed to victory in the 1998 election, cheered not only by the poor but a middle class fed up with an ossified establishment. With a barrel of oil just $8, the petro-state was near broke.</p> <p>Few outside Venezuela, until then best known for beauty queens and oil, knew what to make of this mercurial figure who praised Fidel Castro and promised revolution but said he was neither left nor right but seeker of a Blairesque \"third way\".</p> <p>It was often forgotten later but Ch\u00e1vez's early economic policies were moderate, in some ways even conservative. He retained the previous government's finance minister, toyed with privatising telecommunications and spoke of fiscal rectitude.</p> <p>Politically, however, he steamed ahead with a referendum and elections for a new constitution and system of government. It was in many ways progressive and addressed social exclusion but also greatly enhanced executive powers and permitted two consecutive terms.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's vehement rhetoric against the wealthy as \"squealing pigs\" and \"vampires\" who looted the oil wealth endeared him to the barrios but alienated the middle class and traditional elites. The country divided into a third who adored Ch\u00e1vez, a third who despised him and a third who floated in the middle.</p> <p>Opponents called him a monkey and worse. In April 2002 the elites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/12/venezuela\" title=\"\">briefly ousted him in a Bush-administration-backed coup</a>, tried again with an oil strike, then a recall referendum, dramas which stained the opposition and burnished Ch\u00e1vez's legend.</p> <p>Even so he would have lost the 2004 referendum, he admitted, were it not for the recovery in oil prices and help from Castro who sent thousands of Cuban doctors, nurses and teachers to staff social programmes in the slums known as <em>misiones</em> (missions). They multiplied and consummated Ch\u00e1vez's bond with the poor. Poverty decreased, health indicators improved and thousands got jobs in the expanding state sector. The moribund opposition boycotted the 2005 national assembly election.</p> <p>Emboldened, the president became more radical, declared himself a socialist and started nationalising \"strategic industries\" and expropriating millions of hectares of \"unproductive\" land. He stormed to a second term in 2006 with 63% of the vote. He declined to take part in a debate with his challenger, a gruff, opposition governor named Manuel Rosales, on the grounds that \"an eagle does not hunt flies\".</p> <p>It was his apogee: the economy roaring, the people on-side, globally feted for condemning the US invasion of Iraq. He called George W Bush a donkey, Mr Danger, an asshole and, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/sep/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">during a memorable UN speech, the devil</a>. Supporters such as the former London mayor, Ken Livingstone, the actors Sean Penn and Danny Glover and the polymath Noam Chomsky paid homage in Caracas. The president dominated airwaves, commandeering radio and television for folksy, freewheeling speeches which lasted hours.</p> <p>But problems began to mount. Pulling the plug on RCTV, an opposition TV station which had backed the 2002 coup, triggered student protests which climaxed with Ch\u00e1vez <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/03/venezuela.usa\" title=\"\">losing a 2007 referendum to abolish political term limits</a>.</p> <p>The web of currency and price controls and harassment of the private sector produced inflation and sporadic shortages. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/venezuela-caracas-gang-warfare-murder\" title=\"\">Violent crime spiralled</a>. The opposition revived and made inroads in 2008 regional elections, wresting back Caracas and even slums such as Petare, previously chavista bastions.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez tightened control over his own movement, as well as the armed forces and judiciary, and won a second attempt to abolish term limits in a 2009 referendum. Some opponents were jailed, purportedly for corruption, and others fled to exile. Ch\u00e1vez spoke of ruling until 2030, an ambition echoed by a growing state media empire which promoted a personality cult.</p> <p>Rolling power cuts and crumbling infrastructure cost his PSUV party the popular vote in 2010 national assembly elections \u2013 \"we are the majority\", crowed the opposition \u2013 but gerrymandering gave it most seats.</p> <p>Few doubted Ch\u00e1vez would win a third term \u2013 a third of the population still revered him and petrodollars and institutional control would woo the <em>ninis</em> \u2013 until last year when he was struck down by cancer, a disaster for a system of government and political campaigning built around his personal energy and charisma.</p> <p>While Capriles campaigned vigorously, Ch\u00e1vez remained largely confined to the palace and a few, relatively fleeting public appearances. But petrodollars funded an emergency house-building programme and a reboot of decaying missions, a fiscal splurge which boosted economic growth to 5%. Ch\u00e1vez also warned of civil war if he lost, casting himself as the unlikely friend of the wealthy because he represented stability.</p> <p>Even with the chief partially incapacitated, and some rallies cancelled or poorly attended, the formidable electoral \"red machine\" cranked into high gear. Billboards, posters and murals sprouted across the country. Ch\u00e1vez dominated television, if not always in person then through surrogates. His voice filled the radio dial. Civil servants were bussed to events in huge convoys, a mobile army. Workers from the <em>misiones</em> roved the barrios handing out campaign leaflets and signing up people to expanded social programmes. A frenetic house-building programme gave thousands of families new homes and put hundreds of thousands more on a waiting list, saying they would be housed after the election if Ch\u00e1vez won.</p> <p>Patronage may have helped turn out the vote, but Ch\u00e1vez could also count on a powerful affinity with Venezuela's poor, said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue thinktank.</p> <p>\"Despite his illness, I still think he retains a large emotional connection with a lot of Venezuelans that I think were not prepared to vote against him,\" he told the Associated Press.</p> <p>State media depicted Capriles as an agent of the oligarchy and US imperialism who would introduce savage neoliberal austerity. Chavista activists disrupted his events \u2013 blocking motorways, throwing bottles and, in one case, shooting dead three people. The consulate in Miami was closed, disenfranchising much of the pro-Capriles diaspora.</p> <p>Even cancer, in some ways, helped Ch\u00e1vez's campaign. After disappearing from view for treatment, stoking mystery and alarm, he would reappear, Lazarus-like, and proclaim triumphant resurrection. Speculation about his health and squabbling between rival courtiers \u2013 there is no obvious successor to keep the movement's factions together should he die \u2013 could roil his fourth term. All that matters for now is that the campaign successfully brushed over the issue.</p> <p>Opponents complained about dirty tricks and abuse of state resources but to supporters the comandante's victory proved yet again the veracity of his venerable campaign slogan: \"<em>Ch\u00e1vez es el pueblo</em>\". Ch\u00e1vez is the people.</p>",
  "<p>There was a lot riding on Einstein winning a Nobel prize. Beyond his academic reputation, and that of the Nobel Institute for recognising greatness, the wellbeing of his former wife and their two sons depended upon it.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the first world war, defeated Germany was being consumed by hyper-inflation. The government was printing more money to pay the war reparations and, as a result, the mark went into freefall against foreign currencies. Living in Berlin, Einstein was naturally affected by the crisis.</p> <p>He had divorced Mileva in 1919, several years after she had returned to Switzerland with the boys, Hans-Albert and Eduard. As part of the settlement, Einstein pledged any eventual Nobel prize money to her for their upkeep. As the hyper-inflation bit ever deeper, so he needed that cash.</p> <p>By this time, Einstein had a decade's worth of Nobel nominations behind him. Yet each year, to mounting criticism, the committee decided against his work on the grounds that relativity was unproven. In 1919, that changed. Cambridge astrophysicist Arthur Eddington famously used a total eclipse to measure the <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/05/dayintech_0529/\">deflection of stars' positions</a> near the Sun. The size of the deflection was exactly as Einstein had predicted from relativity in 1915. The prize should have been his, but the committee snubbed him again.</p> <p>Why? Because now dark forces were at work.</p> <p>Antisemitism was on the rise in Germany; Jews were being scapegoated for the country's defeat in the war. As both Jew and pacifist, Einstein was an obvious target. The complexity of relativity did not help either. Opponents such as Ernst Gehrcke and Philipp Lenard found it easy to cast doubt upon its labyrinthine mathematics.</p> <p>The situation reached crisis point in 1921 when, paralysed by indecision, the Nobel Committee decided it was better not to award a prize at all than to give it to relativity. The arguments raged for another year until a compromise was reached.</p> <p>At the suggestion of Carl Wilhelm Oseen, Einstein would receive the deferred 1921 prize, but not for relativity. He would be given it for his explanation of the <a href=\"http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae24.cfm\">photoelectric effect</a>, a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal sheet only under certain illuminations. The work had been published back in 1905.</p> <p>It has been <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-nobel-prize-and-einstein-s-ghost\">argued</a> that this work, which introduced the concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\">photons</a>, has had more impact than relativity. I'm not sure. With relativity, Einstein gave us a way to understand the Universe as a whole. It was a staggering leap forward in our intellectual capability.</p> <p>The Nobel citation reads that Einstein is honoured for \"services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". At first glance, the reference to theoretical physics could have been a back door through which the committee acknowledged relativity. However, there was a caveat stating that the award was presented \"without taking into account the value that will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these are confirmed in the future\".</p> <p>To many, and to Einstein himself, this felt like a slap in the face. Hadn't Eddington proved the theory? Yes, but the trouble was Eddington's observations had not been perfect and he had discarded data he considered poor from his final analysis. To some, as related in Jeffrey Crelinsten's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Einsteins-Jury-Race-Test-Relativity/dp/0691123101\">Einstein's Jury</a>, this smacked of cooking the books in Einstein's favour. In reality it was just good scientific practice.</p> <p>There is also another way to read the Nobel caveat. Could it have been that the committee was leaving the door open for a second Nobel prize in the future, once relativity had been more rigorously tested? We will never know. As Einstein's fame spread, so he alienated himself from the physics community by refusing to accept quantum theory. A Nobel prize for relativity was never awarded.</p> <p>The final twist in this story is that Einstein did not attend his prize giving. Despite being informed that he was about to receive the prize, he chose to continue with a lecture tour of Japan. Partly, this was because he no longer valued the prize and partly it was because he needed to disappear.</p> <p>German foreign minister Walther Rathenau had been murdered by anti-Semites. In the subsequent investigation, the police had found Einstein's name on a list of targets. In the face of such a death treat, leaving Germany to spend months in the Far East, rather than a few days in Stockholm, must have seemed prudent.</p> <p>In the end, perhaps the best thing that came out of Einstein's Nobel prize was the money. It went towards keeping Mileva and the boys secure, and became essential when Eduard developed schizophrenia as a young adult and needed to be hospitalised.</p> <p>The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics is awarded on Tuesday.

  "<p>Rose Molokoane, who helps allocate millions of dollars to urban improvement projects around the world, lives in a South African informal settlement. She has spent more than 20 years organising urban poor communities, helping them to pool savings and obtain land and housing. Molokoane is also a prominent member of <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/upfi/\" title=\"\">Urban Poor Fund International</a>, the first global fund to give poor people direct control over development spending in cities.</p> <p>\"We are sick and tired of becoming the objects of development,\" she told an audience at a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/22393343\" title=\"\">conference in Brazil</a> last year. \"We want to build our own destiny.\"</p> <p>The fund was launched in 2007 by <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/\" title=\"\">Shack/Slum Dwellers International</a> (SDI), a network of community-based federations in 33 countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Since then, it has channelled more than $17.8m (\u00a311m) in capital and technical assistance to more than 150 community-run projects in cities.</p> <p>The innovative fund lets poor communities define development strategies and manage capital from neighbourhood to global level. Urban poor federations and supporting NGOs in the network submit proposals for community projects, which are evaluated by a council of long-time federation leaders, including Molokoane. Money allocated is accompanied by strategic advice from a board of government ministers.</p> <p>Resources flow through national funds to local savings collectives, mostly made up of women, that contribute their share and implement projects. Recouped money feeds back to a national revolving account. Ultimately, the goal is to create a robust network of national funds that can independently attract government and private-sector investment and help shape urban development agendas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/media/upload/documents/UPFIAnnualReport2011.pdf\" title=\"\">The fund has financed</a> (pdf) the construction of 50,000 homes, secured tenure for 20,000 families, and supported projects in 18 countries. Without high overheads or fancy consultants, it has directly benefited poor families.</p> <p>While the tangible outputs are impressive, the greatest gains don't fit neatly into a spreadsheet. Unlike most development financing, the fund invests as much in social processes as physical projects. By supporting strategies like learning exchanges and community-based surveys, it helps urban poor groups build skills and connections across cities, regions and continents.</p> <p>The fund also allows poor communities to attract external resources and make a political impact. Capital helps federations leverage finance from governments, banks and donors, while demonstration projects encourage broader investment or policy shifts. For example, projects have produced pro-poor changes in building regulations and attracted state housing subsidies. The fund also helps give poor groups a voice in municipalities and international circles. The bottom line is not full cost-recovery for atomised projects on three-year timetables; it is long-term political transformation.</p> <p>The benefits of this financing model were evident in Mukuru Sinai, an informal settlement hugging an oil pipeline in Nairobi's industrial zone. In 2009, the fund awarded $315,000 to a savings collective of 2,000 families who, renting homes on private land there, suffered constant threats of eviction and gas explosions. Armed with capital, they got a bank loan to buy 23 acres of nearby land for just over $1m, and a government pledge to provide infrastructure. Tenants are now drawing up plans to build homes, partly subsidised by developing for-sale housing on the plot. Leaders are hopeful not only that the project becomes a pilot for other informal settlements on private land in Nairobi, but also that locals will share lessons with communities in Kenya and beyond.</p> <p>The cost-effectiveness and broad impact of this financing model points to the need for placing urban poor communities at the helm of development spending in cities. \"All successful urban initiatives have been ones that have placed people's knowledge and people's action at the centre of the process,\" says Diana Mitlin, a researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> who has worked with SDI for more than a decade. \"That doesn't mean professionals are not needed, but it means professionals acknowledge the limitations of their role.\"</p> <p>Despite its success, the model faces challenges. The international fund needs to attract money, because it does not recover investments. But many donors either lack understanding of the fund's innovative strategy or consider it too risky.</p> <p>\"It's much easier to cushion yourself behind different agencies and make sure you get your money back,\" says SDI co-ordinator Celine D'Cruz. \"It's much more risky to give the money straight to the mouth of the tiger. But that is exactly where the real change is meant to happen.\"</p> <p>Leveraging external resources and getting cities to partner with urban poor groups is also a challenge. Success stories abound, but in many places there is a long path from occasional compromises to lasting partnerships and policy changes.</p> <p>The fund's success also depends on strong community organisations. Many SDI affiliates have mobilised for decades, but newer members require time to ensure that individual projects yield stable federations and political gains. The organisation's network extends to 388 cities and expands constantly, but the fund remains limited if only member groups have access.</p> <p>To make a bigger impact, D'Cruz believes urban poor funds must be established on a city scale, governed by community leaders, civil society groups and city officials, and implemented with a strong community base.</p> <p>\"That would be a dream,\" D'Cruz says. \"And actually, it's such a simple solution. It cuts through all the red tape.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney will call for an escalation of the conflict in Syria by arming rebels with the heavy weapons needed to confront president Bashar al-Assad's tanks, helicopters and fighter jets.</p> <p>Romney is to make the proposal on Monday in what his campaign team has billed as a major foreign policy speech in Lexington, Virginia.</p> <p>In extracts published in advance, he opened up the prospect, if he becomes president, of a US-Iranian proxy war being fought in Syria. </p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran \u2013 rather than sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. </p> <p>The proposal would mark a significant shift from Barack Obama's administration's policy of trying to keep the conflict a low-intensity one amid fears it might turn into a regional war. Obama is putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of the rebels, to restrict the supply of weapons to small arms.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate has made several attempts at establishing his credentials to be commander-in-chief but those speeches made little impact. Against the background of his win over Obama in last week's debate, the Romney campaign team is hoping this speech will be better received.</p> <p>The speech is aimed at countering critics who say he has not had much to say so far about foreign policy and given little indication of the lines he would pursue as president. </p> <p>He has a large team of foreign policy advisers \u2013 more than 30 \u2013 a mixture of realists and neo-conservatives. The aggressive language in the extracts of his speech released indicate he is leaning towards the neo-conservatives. </p> <p>Romney's comments that will have the most bearing on the election campaign are his return to criticism of the Obama adminstration over its handling of the killings of the US ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other Americans at the consultate in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>\"The attack on our consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of the same forces that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long,\" Romney said.</p> <p>\"No, as the administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the west.\"</p> <p>Romney, after mishandling his initial response to the killings, is seeking to tap into widespread resentment and anger in the US, especially among conservatives, at what they regard as lack of gratitude among Libyans for American help during the Arab spring.</p> <p>He accused Obama of failing to provide unequivocal support for the rebels in Syria. \"I will work with our partners to identify and organise those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets.\"</p> <p>He anticipated that the rebels will one day lead the country and the US should align itself with them, given the country's position at the heart of the Middle East.</p> <p>He said he and Obama share a desire for a safer, freer and more prosperous Middle East. </p> <p>\"I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds,\" he said.</p> <p>He warned Iran not to pursue a nuclear weapon capability and said the US had to back this up \"through actions, not just words\", and urged an expansion of the aircraft carrier presence in the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, over which Romney faced a lot of criticism for failing to mention during his Republican convention speech, he said he would not be tied to the deadline set by Obama for withdrawal by the end of 2014 and hinted he might delay it.</p> <p>\"The route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11,\" he said.</p> <p>He expressed support for the US-proclaimed objective of creation of a Palestinian state.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's attempt to reach out to the \"strivers\" in society, with a series of measures to be unveiled at the Conservative conference this week, received a cautious welcome in the party on Sunday.</p> <p>The prime minister is reported to be planning to use his conference speech on Wednesday to appeal to people who \"work hard and want to get on\", regardless of their social background, he told the Sunday Times.</p> <p>Cameron's choice of language has echoes of previous politicians from across the political spectrum. Last year the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, used his speech to stand up for society's \"grafters\".</p> <p>But while \"strivers\" became an instant buzzword around the party conference in Birmingham, Cameron's aides said the word itself might not be used in his speech, though they insisted \"it's not one we'll run away from\".</p> <p>The change of tone, away from an emphasis on the \"squeezed middle\", was reflected in the first two policies briefed for the conference start: a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/07/rail-fares-capped-lower-david-cameron\" title=\"\">cap on regulated rail fares for commuters</a>, and a freeze on next year's council tax bills.</p> <p>They were the first sign of what appears to be part of the Conservative response to Miliband's audacious move into Tory territory last week, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">rebranded his party as One Nation Labour</a>.</p> <p>The potential weaknesses of Cameron's argument were highlighted by Labour's immediate response, mocking any attempt by him to shed the party's \"posh boy\" image, which polls increasingly identify as a key bar to more popularity.</p> <p>\"[David Cameron] says one thing, but time and again does another,\" said Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office. \"He says those at the top will need to pay more but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over \u00a31m a tax break of \u00a340,000 this April.\"</p> <p>Pressure for the shift from within the party, however, was reaffirmed on Sunday by a YouGov poll for the news and opinion website ConservativeHome.</p> <p>The poll found that only 1-8% of people did not vote Tory because of issues such as its strong views on crime and immigration, or because of attitudes to women and minority groups. However, 28% of those polled agreed that Conservatives did not \"care enough about the very poor and vulnerable\", and 28% said Tories did not \"care enough about the NHS and other public services\".</p> <p>The main problem, said 41%, was that the Tories were \"the party of the rich\".</p> <p>Boris Johnson, in an article in the Daily Telegraph, called for more help for the \"struggling middle\" \u2013 working families with incomes ranging from \u00a330,000 to \u00a364,000 \u2013 particularly regarding issues like housing. \"They are not being helped,\" he wrote. \"They are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. It is time to help them.\"</p> <p>ConservativeHome's founder and editor, Tim Montgomerie, has set up an internal campaign group under the banner \"strong and compassionate\", arguing that to win its first majority for 20 years the party had to have \"a radical overhaul of \u2026 message, manifesto and machine\".</p> <p>Based on its polling, the party should be on the side of aspiration or \"strivers\", said Montgomerie, but it must not be to the exclusion of those who cannot strive, in the economic sense at least.</p> <p>\"Once we have got a more focused welfare state we should be proud of looking after people who can't look after themselves,\" added Montgomerie.</p> <p>The shift was welcomed by Mark Reckless, an MP who is not afraid to criticise the government. He said that the idea of strivers was an improvement on the \"infinitely elastic term, squeezed middle\".</p> <p>However, Reckless acknowledged that the new approach would be judged by policies, not by the language. The cap on commuter fares to only 1% over inflation was particularly useful for his constituency in Kent, said Reckless.</p>"
