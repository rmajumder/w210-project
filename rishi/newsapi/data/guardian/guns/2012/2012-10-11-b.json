  "<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/News/martha-raddatz-abc-news-official-biography/story?id=127431#.UHcFAL_KpJM\">On Martha Raddatz's resum\u00e9 alone</a>, the veteran ABC News correspondent could be just as well qualified as one of the vice-presidential candidates, rather than merely the moderator of tonight's debate between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden.</p> <p>Raddatz's list of international assignments and reporting achievements makes some secretaries of state seem like work-shy stay-at-homes. Raddatz's role for ABC News and other employers such as NPR has seen her criss-cross the globe in the wake of American foreign policy.</p> <p>For all that, Thursday night's VP debate may be Raddatz's toughest assignment yet. The bullets may not fly in Danville, Kentucky as they did in Mosul and Sadr City during Raddatz's 21 trips to Iraq. But the metaphorical flak surrounding such debates can be wounding to a distinguished career, as Jim Lehrer was reminded after he moderated last week's meeting of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</p> <p>Raddatz has no experience running the kind of high-stakes national contest that Biden and Ryan will engage in tonight, although she once moderated a Massachusetts US senate debate. Then again, Lehrer had already hosted 11 presidential debates and his experience didn't help him much after he appeared to cede control of the format to an aggressive Romney. The narrow focus of Lehrer's questions also came in for criticism from Democrats \u2013 although a stronger performance by Obama would have muted much of it in retrospect.</p> <p>Raddatz, 59, shouldn't be easily intimidated, given her track record. She began working for WCVB in Boston, before becoming NPR's Pentagon correspondent in 1993. In 1999 she shifted to ABC News as state department correspondent and then became senior national security correspondent in 2003, a post that required extensive reporting from war-torn Iraq.</p> <p>The posting in Baghdad <a href=\" http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Road-Home-Family/dp/0399153829\">led Raddatz to write a book, The Long Road Home</a>, a detailed account of a platoon of American soldiers trapped and besieged by Shia militia in Sadr City, in a two-day battle that saw eight US soldiers killed including Casey Sheehan, the son of the anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan.</p> <p>Raddatz became ABC's White House correspondent during the second term of the Bush administration. By the end of 2008 she was named to the prestigious role of senior foreign affairs correspondent.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2012/10/11/moderators/\">Raddatz is only the sixth woman</a> to moderate or co-moderate a presidential or vice-presidential debate. Her selection caused a minor controversy earlier this week when a conservative website, the Daily Caller, <a href=\" http://www.dailycaller.com/2012/10/10/abc-news-scrambles-to-cover-up-barack-obamas-attendance-at-vp-debate-moderators-wedding/\">highlighted the fact that Barack Obama had attended her wedding</a> in 1991 to one of his Harvard Law School classmates, Julius Genachowski \u2013 who Obama later appointed as head of the Federal Communications Commission.</p> <p>Genachowski and Raddatz divorced 15 years ago, and ABC News and figures across the political spectrum and media came to Raddatz's defence. More importantly, Paul Ryan's campaign said it had \"no concerns\" about the connection.</p> <p>That brief squib having passed, Raddatz will join Judy Woodruff and Gwen Ifill of PBS as women who have moderated a VP debate. Later this month Candy Crowley of CNN will moderate another meeting between Romney and Obama, joining Pauline Frederick of NPR and Barbara Walters (twice) and Carole Simpson of ABC News as presidential-debate moderators.</p>",
  "<p>I never liked the guy in seat 7A anyway. That's probably business class, isn't it? So he was the one all stretched out smugly with his shoes off already and his complementary Bloody Mary and copy of Newsweek magazine as you were herded past towards the back. Or, if the plane was white and orange, he was the one who pushed past earlier in the queue, holding his printout boarding card in the air, shouting: \"Speedy boarding, yes.\" Paid an extra \u00a315 just so he can get on a couple of minutes earlier and sit near the front. Loser.</p> <p>Well, you're not so smug or speedy now, are you, now that your seat has been catapulted 153 metres away from the main chunk of fuselage, and lies broken in the dirt. To be honest, I didn't dislike him <em>that</em> much, not for this to happen. \"I think it's clear that this wouldn't have been a survivable area in the aircraft,\" says Anne, one of the air-crash investigators.</p> <p>They crash a plane, an old Boeing 727, into a dry lakebed in northern Mexico. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-plane-crash\" title=\"\"><strong>The Plane Crash</strong> </a>(Channel 4) it's called, unequivocally. And it's extraordinary television \u2013 mesmerising and terrifying, Strangely exciting too; that may have something to do with the soundtrack of urgent, sawing strings, not unlike the Spooks music.</p> <p>A plane crash is rarely caught on camera, and when it is it's usually all juddery, hand-held and amateur. Because this is done on purpose, with four years of meticulous planning behind it; it's filmed expertly, from many different angles (including from inside the cabin), and can be slowed down, frozen and shown over and over again. Nor is it morbid, because no one dies in this one.</p> <p>The men flying the plane jump out and parachute to safety. Last one out is a hero pilot named Jimbob (of course). From then on, another hero pilot called Chip (ditto) flies the plane by remote control from a little tiny plane that follows the big one. Like one of those little fish that swims under sharks, what are they called \u2026 oh yeah, pilot fish.</p> <p>Remaining on board are just a few crash test dummies, because they're not doing this just for a laugh; it's a serious experiment, with lessons to be learned and implications for aircraft design in the future. The plane hits the ground, not massively hard, but too hard, front wheels first. It crumples immediately. The front section breaks off and the rest carries on, thundering across the dry lake, a massive ball of momentum and dust and terror. When it comes to rest, headless, the engines are still running. Like those chickens that go on running after their heads are cut off \u2026 seeing as we seem to be in the business of searching the animal kingdom for analogies.</p> <p><em>Andale, Andale!</em> cry the Mexican firefighters, speeding to extinguish the engines with their big long hoses. Or <em>Jos\u00e9s</em> as they're called around these parts. When it's calmed down, Anne and her team can get involved, check the dummies and the black box recorder (which is red, as it happens).</p> <p>The front sections have taken the brunt of the impact, and no one ahead of the break, including our friend in 7A, would have survived. (Actually, I don't think there was even a dummy in 7A, it just happens to be the seat that's been thrown furthest). It's like some weird kind of reverse natural selection, where the more successful you are \u2013 first- and business-class passengers, even the speedy bloody boarders \u2013 the less likely you are to survive. Whereas we plebs in the back may well be OK.</p> <p>Crashes aren't always like this, of course, but we are told this is the commonest sort. It does make sense, given that planes tend to go forwards. Anyway, it's good enough for me. I'll be heading towards the back from now on, sitting right by an emergency exit, away from any fat people who may block my passage out of there. I will also be wearing my seatbelt at all times, in order to avoid \"submarining\" (disappearing under the seats in front). And when the call comes to brace I shall do just that, as I would rather have a broken foot than a broken head.</p> <p>Trouble is, the speedy boarders may well have seen this too. And by the time I get on, it will be full back there. Only 7A will be left, there will be a human elephant seal in 7B \u2026</p> <p>You know what I'm thinking after watching this? I'm thinking Cornwall. Greycation next year. They must be loving this, the folks at the Cornish tourist board. And the B&amp;B ladies. And the birds of the Thames estuary that Boris has it in for. And George Monbiot.</p>",
  "<p>Lance Armstrong could end up in court facing allegations of perjury and an attempt to reclaim millions of dollars of bonus money if a Texas-based insurance company decides to try to win back a payment to the disgraced cyclist that was made for winning the 2004 Tour de France.</p> <p>SCA Promotions had promised to pay Armstrong $5m in bonus money if he managed five consecutive Tour de France wins, but refused to do so amid widespread media rumours of doping. Armstrong took the company to arbitration, where he received a settlement of $7.5m, made up of the original bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees.</p> <p>In the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/10/lance-armstrong-team-doping\">a damning report accusing Armstrong of being at the centre of \"sport's most sophisticated, professionalised and successful\" doping programme</a>, there is every prospect that the issue will be legally revisited, perhaps including charges of perjury if Armstrong can be shown to have lied during testimony first time around.</p> <p>Jeff Dorough, a lawyer for SCA, told the Guardian that the firm would await a reaction to the report \u2013 which was published by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) \u2013 from the world cycling governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI). The UCI has not yet officially responded to the Usada investigation.</p> <p>\"We will readdress the issue when we see if there is inaction or action from UCI,\" Dorough said. </p> <p>However, it is believed that it is likely that SCA will eventually take legal action, given the exhaustive nature of the Usada report. In more than 1,000 pages Usada detailed the alleged doping using testimony from 26 people, including 15 riders with knowledge of Armstrong's US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams between 1998 and 2005. The study accused Armstrong, who has always protested his innocence, of effectively running a systemic blood-doping ring.</p> <p>The SCA case is not the only potential legal threat to Armstrong. An investigation into allegations that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs was dropped earlier this year by Andre Birotte, the US attorney for the central district of California. Birotte's office offered little explanation for the move, which came as a surprise to many in the global cycling community. </p> <p>A spokesman for Birotte's office, Bruce Riordan, said: \"Our office declines to comment on the matter in question.\"</p> <p>Some experts, however, believe that the investigation may be reopened as widespread outrage over the allegations in the Usada report creates political pressure to explain why it was dropped in the first place. </p> <p>\"The US attorney's office is always subject to political pressures. The criticism now will hit home and there is a good chance that the government will indict and charge Armstrong,\" said Peter Keane, a law professor at the Golden Gate University.</p> <p>Mike Straubel, from Valparaiso University, agreed. \"It is more of a political question than a legal one, but I would say there is a 70% chance of the case being reopened,\" he said.</p> <p>But others suspect there is little appetite for a re-opening a prosecution against Armstrong. They argue that the likelihood is that government lawyers had already amassed the same evidence as Usada, but had been put off by the high burdens of proof associated with putting a criminal case in front of a jury.</p> <p>The Guardian also understands that this aspect is a serious concern to government lawyers as they digest the reaction to the Usada report. </p> <p>\"I think everything in the Usada report, the government already saw. I don't think it is new information to them. Are they going to prosecute Lance Armstrong? I think the answer is no,\" said top California criminal attorney Paula Canny.</p> <p>Canny said Birotte and his team were likely mindful of the political implications of taking on the Armstrong case again, as the alleged crimes took place several years ago and involve a man who is still deeply involved in the fight against cancer. They would also likely base a case on issues like fraud, rather than steroid abuse in a sporting competition. </p> <p>\"They have a different and very high standard of proof that they would have to get,\" she said.</p> <p>Any decision by Birotte to re-open the Armstrong investigation would come after two other high-profile sports cases that ran into trouble. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/barry-bonds-guilty-obstructing-steroid-investigation?INTCMP=SRCH\">In December 2011, prosecutors were able to convict the baseball star Barry Bonds of obstructing justice</a>, but not of steroid abuse. In June this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10295456\">another baseball icon, Roger Clemens, was acquitted of all charges in a perjury trial over steroids</a>. </p> <p>\"If I were a betting man I would say they are absolutely, positively not going to re-open the investigation,\" said Professor Jordan Kobritz, chair of the Sports Management Department at SUNY Cortland.</p> <p>Kobritz said that any criminal prosecution would be tough to prove to a jury and would cost millions of dollars. </p> <p>\"It is a giant leap. But even if you took [that leap], there are better ways of spending taxpayers' money than prosecuting Lance Armstrong,\" he said.</p> <p>For the moment Armstrong is holding firm to his line that he has been the victim of a witch hunt. His lawyer, Tim Herman, has called the Usada report a \"hatchet job\" put together by people with grudges to settle or personal interests to look out for. That argument seems to have won through \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 with sponsors and the cyclist's charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which is renowned for the Livestrong yellow bracelets that have become a world symbol of the fight against cancer. </p> <p>The LAF president, Doug Ulman, backed Armstrong and slammed Usada. \"Usada appears motivated more by publicity rather than fulfilling its mission. Lance Armstrong's legacy as a cancer fighter is literally second to none,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>Armstrong's cancer work may also provide a cover for his many sponsors to stand by him, betting that the general public will still see his work in fighting the illness that nearly killed him as being far more important than his sporting behaviour. The sports giant Nike has issued a supportive statement and a host of other sponsors \u2013 representing everything from bikes to energy products \u2013 have simply declined to comment.</p> <p>For Kobritz, that silence speaks volumes. Even the Post Office \u2013 which sponsored his racing team \u2013 has declined to address the allegations. </p> <p>\"A lot of people who think he's guilty are going to say: 'So what? Maybe he did dope but look at what else he's done,'\" Kobritz said. However, he added: \"If anyone still believes he was not doping, then they believe in Santa Claus.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Sheriff Lee Baca of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department (LASD) announced that he agrees with and plans to implement all of the 63 <a href=\"http://ccjv.lacounty.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CCJV-Executive-Summary.pdf\">recommended reforms (pdf)</a> issued by the Citizen's Commission on Jail Violence (CCJV). Baca's <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/03/local/la-me-sheriff-jails-20121004\">decision to embrace</a> the reforms \u2013 he said, \"I couldn't have written them better myself\" \u2013 was met with cautious optimism by the CCJV, which was formed last year in the wake of scathing reports to investigate widespread and systemic abuses in the county jails. The questions remain, however, why it has taken the sheriff so long to actually acknowledge that the jail system he oversees is rife with abuse; and why, considering his failure to do so until now, he still has a job.</p> <p>Baca <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/08/local/me-51887\">was sworn in</a> as sheriff of Los Angeles in 1998 and has been responsible for supervising the county's jails since that time. The rampant violence inflicted on inmates in the jails preceded his tenure, and Baca actually pledged to put an end to it when he came into office. Yet, there are volumes of evidence to show that a culture that encourages excessive use of force and brutality by deputies continued to thrive, unchecked, during his period in office.</p> <p>Until very recently, though, Baca has insisted on downplaying, or denying, the problem. Only after overwhelming pressure from the combined forces of an FBI investigation, an <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jails-sg,0,4834651.storygallery\">LA Times investigation</a>, a multitude of lawsuits, <a href=\"http://www.aclu-sc.org/issues/prisoners-rights/jails-project/cruel-and-unusual-punishment/\">several scathing reports highlighting abuse by the ACLU</a> and other agencies, and finally, the damning report by the CCJV, has Baca moved on to embrace reforms.</p> <p>Last January, the ACLU of southern California <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/prisoners-rights/rosas-et-al-v-baca-et-al\">filed a class action lawsuit</a> on behalf of all prisoners in the jail system, naming Baca himself as the defendant and suing him in his official capacity as sheriff. The complaint, filed in federal court, details a litany of sadistic attacks by deputies, most of them unprovoked and far exceeding any force that may have been necessary to control a situation. Bashing inmates' heads against the wall, or punching or kicking inmates in the head, are favorite tactics. So are the repeated use of tasers on inmates, kicking them in the back, groin or stomach, and the enabling or encouraging of sexual assaults and anal rape. Here are a couple of examples that typify the kind of unnecessary force used by deputies in the jails:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In June 2009, a group of deputies assaulted Darrell Garrett in Men's Central jail while he was restrained in waist chains. Deputies then kicked Mr Garrett in the face and head, while another deputy held him down. As the beating continued, they hit him in the head with a plastic milk crate, ground his face into the concrete floor, and emptied two cans of mace into Mr Garrett's mouth, ears, nose and eyes.\"</p> <p>\"In March, 2011, in Men's Central jail, Deputy Smith knocked a tray of food from Alberto Carreras's hands and twisted his arms behind his back. Deputy Johnson then slammed Mr Carrera's face against a wall. Deputies punched Mr Carreras on his face, head and legs, while yelling 'Shut up ,you fucking faggot' at him. Mr Carreras had a catheter and the blows to his legs caused tremendous pain and led him to bleed from his penis.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There are undoubtedly some inmates with their own propensity for violence among the approximately 19,000 held in the LA county jail system. But the vast majority of these prisoners are pre-trial detainees, most of whom have not been charged with violent offenses; many more are held on relatively minor charges like public intoxication or traffic violations. No person should be subject to deputy brutality and excessive force when they are wards of the state. Yet in LA County \u2013 regardless of however little threat a prisoner presents\u2013 a force-first, rather than force-last, approach has long been the accepted policy.</p> <p>The irony, of course, is that if these rogue deputies inflicted beatings remotely as severe to anyone on the street, they would almost certainly be awarded a jail sentence. But when the beatings occur inside the jails, the perpetrators can rely on not being sanctioned by the LASD. This failure by senior deputies and, ultimately, by Baca himself to hold any deputy accountable in the LASD was one of the key findings of the CCJV report. It was also noted by Thomas Parker, a former FBI agent who oversaw the FBI's investigation into the force. Parker reportedly said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is at least a two-decade history of corruption within the ranks of the LASD \u2026 no one at the command level appears to have been held accountable and appropriately punished for failure to properly supervise and manage their subordinate personnel and resources.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>All this considered, you can understand why Baca's stated willingness to embrace and implement all the recommended reforms has been met with only \"cautious optimism\" by all concerned. The fact that he made clear that he has no immediate plans to discipline any senior managers who have been implicated in the previous practice and cover-up of abuse is also not encouraging. Baca appears to be standing by his Under Sheriff Paul Tanaka, who is under investigation for allegations in the CCJV report that he \"not only failed to identify and correct problems in the jails, he exacerbated them.\"</p> <p>Still, there is reason to hope that better times are ahead for the Los Angeles County jail system \u2013 if, now that Baca's hand has been forced, he actually does ensure that the reforms are implemented. If he does not, then he, too, must be held accountable.</p>",
  "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is for those watching Hunted on BBC1. Please do not read on if you haven't seen episode two.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/04/hunted-series-one-episode-one\" title=\"\">Julia Raeside's episode one blog</a></p> <p>We are right back where we left things last week. Sam Hunter, spy for hire (I imagine it says this on her business cards) has started work as nanny to criminal mastermind Jack Turner's grandson at the behest of said criminal's rather nicer son, Steven. Except, really, she is a plant there to spy on Turner and something something blah blah Pakistani dam. I never properly take it in when they explain that bit. When we return to Sam this week she is standing in Turner's hallway, unknowingly shaking hands with the man who has been sent to kill her. Well, one of them anyway. They're multiplying faster than John Travolta's \"chills\".</p> <p>I'm fond of this simplistic style of narrative linking because I like to think the cast have been standing there, Police Squad-style, for the entire week, just waiting to start the acting again.</p> <p>Blank-faced Man (sinister would-be-assassin) poses as the Dutch doctor he murdered by jabbing a syringe in his eyeball in episode one. (I love typing that.) Unbeknown to Sam, he's got that very syringe behind his back and he's popping the lid off while he talks to her. One assumes it's the same syringe as there's really no issue with needle-sharing when you're using it to murder people.</p> <p>How Blank-faced Man proposed killing Sam then getting rid of her body and then, carrying on his other secret mission with the mysterious suitcase is unclear. But you have to admire his multitasking. Anyway, someone interrupts him, so Sam lives to fight another day, and I do mean fight.</p> <h2>Violence</h2> <p>Other shows with a gorgeous female star might chuck in gratuitous bed scenes, but Hunted has Sam \u2013 at least twice an episode \u2013 knocking 10 bells out of burly interlopers.</p> <p>This week, she is accosted by a mysterious grey-haired man. He's the one who shoots her blonde friend. Once he has kicked the gun out of her hand, the two of them have a full-on scrap for, like, a week or something. It goes on and on until she turns to pick up her dropped gun and he runs away. The big girl.</p> <p>Then she goes to free her captured colleague, Hassan, from his basement prison back at Turner's house and he has a go at her too. So she stabs him with a tyre iron. Fair enough. Earlier in the episode Turner's men were torturing him by hitting him a lot in the face. After several goings-over, he looks like a half-eaten eccles cake. I particularly enjoyed the additional squelching sound effects to indicate that they'd bashed him so hard some brains came out.</p> <h2>Getting to know Sam</h2> <p>What more do we know about Sam at the end of this episode? She had a blonde friend (now a dead blonde friend) and she used to work in special forces. That's the same special forces that new spy on the block Faulks keeps going on about, presumably. He's the one who complained about the milk last week. That had better have been a clue or it will go down as the single worst piece of dialogue in a British drama. He doesn't drink pasteurised milk. Come on, if this was House that would definitely mean something.</p> <p>Sam goes upstairs to her room at one point to have a quick flashback before bed. And we see again her memory of being ambushed while in the car with her mother, and her mother being murdered. I didn't notice it last week but little Sam is wearing a saggy grey beanie hat too. I told you they'd try to make it a \"thing\".</p> <p>Other than that, she remains a pouting, sulking enigma. The pout is so pronounced that, at one point in this episode, when she was close to a window, I thought she might actually stick to it.</p> <h2>Memorable moments</h2> <p>\u2022 When Mrs Sidwell offers to cook Sam some eggs for breakfast, she looks at her, doesn't answer then starts a conversation with somebody else. Only people on TV conduct themselves in this unspeakably rude manner. If someone asks you a question, you ANSWER IT.</p> <p>\u2022 When Turner goes to interrogate a battered Hassan, he asks him who sent him. Hassan looks up and spits in his face. This has happened in every interrogation scene of this kind since the beginning of time. Why?</p> <p>\u2022 After his distraught reaction on hearing Hassan would be terminated, the next time we see Faulks he is cheerfully drinking crisps straight from the bag.</p> <p>\u2022 Every time someone mentions the mole to Aiden, they pause to see what his reaction is. Wow, there's some pretty covert spy-type stuff going on right there.</p> <p>\u2022 The secret organisation Sam works for is apparently called Byzantium, which Zoe mentions in passing like it's something we should already know. Did we? And what might it mean?</p> <h2>Plot holes</h2> <p>\u2022 The ongoing issue of hidden identities and unwitting dupes continues to cause doubt. How have the baddies not worked out that \"Alex Kent\" is a big faker yet? They ran a fingerprint check on her colleague, Hassan. Surely they'd do the same for Sam.</p> <p>\u2022 Once again, Sam sneaks into the secret room in her flat so she can stand in full view of anyone looking into the window, pinning things to her big evidence wall.</p> <p>\u2022 Faulks, who seems, by all accounts, to be a bit of a tool, is unaware that the company he's working for has a policy of killing its employees if they are captured. You'd think that would have come up at the interview stage.</p> <p>\u2022 When Mysterious Grey-haired Man asks Sam's blonde friend if she has seen her, she replies that it has been years. But she has a chummy photo of the pair of them larking around in Basra or some such stuck to her fridge.</p> <h2>Line of the week</h2> <p>Sam says her back full of bruises is from \"falling down some steps\". Aiden: \"Watch yourself, Sam. There's a lot of steps in this city.\"</p> <h2>Next week</h2> <p>Punch, kick, thwack, kerpow! Bit of pouting. Something about dams again. Then we see Sam shoved up against a wall with a gun to her head and her saying: \"If you're going to shoot me, then just get it over with.\"</p> <p>And miss another six weeks of this glorious tosh? Don't be silly.</p>",
  "<h2>The drugs mastermind: Michele Ferrari </h2> <p>Usada said it \"has found overwhelming proof that Dr Michele Ferrari facilitated doping for numerous members of the US Postal Service and Discovery.\" The report showed that Armstrong had paid more than $1m to a company controlled by the Italian and said that Armstrong had conceded he met Ferrari on a monthly basis. Riders testified that he supervised blood transfusions, EPO injections and the use of testosterone. Ferrari was quoted as saying: \"If I were a rider, I would use the products which elude doping controls if they helped to improve my performances.\"</p> <h2>The team director: Johan Bruyneel</h2> <p>The report says: \"Lance Armstrong was instrumental in bringing Johan Bruyneel to the US Postal Service.\" It adds: \"One of the first things the riders noticed was how focused he was on their blood values. He became displeased when he learned a rider was doping without his knowledge. Levi Leipheimer realised this was because doping unsupervised by the team doctor put the team at a higher risk of a positive drug test. The overwhelming evidence is that Bruyneel was intimately involved in all details of the doping programme.\"</p> <h2>The team doctors: Luis Garc\u00eda del Moral and Pedro Celaya</h2> <p>\"Moral and Bruyneel worked hand-in-hand in implementing the team-wide doping programme on US Postal from 1999 through 2003,\" says the report. Christian Vande Velde said he \"would run into the room and you would quickly find a needle in your arm\".</p> <p>\"Celaya's affable nature was an asset in helping to convince some young riders to try new drugs,\" says the report. Panicked over a possible drug bust and helped flush \"'tens of thousands of dollars of doping products down the toilet of the team camper\".</p> <h2>The witnesses: Floyd Landis and Tyler Hamilton</h2> <p>Landis was Armstrong's protege: \"He gave Floyd the keys to his apartment; Floyd watched over their blood bags while Armstrong was out of town. They shared doping advice from Ferrari and when Floyd needed EPO, Lance shared that too,\" says the report. \"Armstrong explained how blood doping had become necessary due to the EPO test. He made his apartment available for the first extraction of Floyd's blood [by] Ferrari.\"</p> <p>After testifying to law officials, \"Hamilton was physically accosted by Armstrong in a Colorado restaurant. Hamilton has testified that Armstrong said: 'When you're on the witness stand, we are going to fucking tear you apart. You are going to look like a fucking idiot.\" Hamilton testified that Armstrong also said: 'I'm going to make your life a living \u2026 fucking \u2026 hell.' [They] plainly constitute an act of attempted witness intimidation.\"</p> <h2>The victims: Filippo Simeone and Christophe Bassons</h2> <p>The report says Armstrong attempted to intimidate Filippo Simeoni, who had testified against Ferrari in Italy. It says that during a stage of the 2004 Tour de France, Armstrong told Simeoni: \"You made a mistake when you testified against Ferrari \u2026 I can destroy you.\" As the pair returned to the peloton from a breakway, Armstrong made what Usada describes as a \"taunting 'zip the lips' gesture.\" Simeoni found himself ostracised from the sport.</p> <p>Christophe Bassons wrote newspaper columns discussing doping during the 1999 Tour, including one in which he said the peloton had been \"shocked\" by Armstrong's performance the previous day. The report says that on the stage to Alpe d'Huez, Armstrong \"rode up to Bassons and berated him, calling him a disgrace and telling him he should get out of cycling.\" Bassons found himself shunned and ostracised, and eventually quit the sport.</p>",
  "<p>What first occurred to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2012/oct/08/british-nobel-prize-john-gurdon-video\" title=\"\">Sir John Gurdon</a>, scientist, on hearing this week that he had won the Nobel prize for medicine, was presumably the joy of recognition.

Any ambition to be a scientist was \"a waste of time \u2026 quite ridiculous\".</p> <p>That was more than half a century back, but the wound clearly festered. Gurdon can shift a mean molecule, but he is not a man to forgive and forget. He passed his old report card to the press.</p> <p>My own Gurdon moment still burns in the memory. Set a 5th-form essay on \"sounds of town and country,\" I found the topic so boring I simply wrote down all the sounds I could think of, one after another. The teacher did not see the joke. He read out the essay, heavy with sarcasm, as I reddened and squirmed in miserable humiliation. \"I predict,\" he intoned, \"that this boy will never earn a living from the English language. He will be a grocer.\" The teacher's name was Stone. So was his heart.</p> <p>We can all list the successes whom school had \"failed\" \u2013 from Winston Churchill to Richard Branson. Less easy to list are those to whom school promised much that life did not honour: the prefects who ended in jail, the teacher's pets who took to booze. Some pupils, like Gurdon, might be galvanised by failure. Most are stripped of ambition and self-esteem at an age when bodies and minds are still forming. Such cruel unfairness is the single, overwhelming charge against selection at 11 \u2013 which the grammar school lobby has never answered and cannot.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/11/45000-resit-gcse-english-exams\" title=\"\">45,000 English pupils are now resitting their GCSE exams</a> after the latest fiasco in Britain's descent from education into testing. Reactionaries may cry that children should be taught that \"life is full of reverses\", but they have elevated the exam to make it the be-all and end-all of secondary education. It is they who treat academic measurement as an exact science, as they once did \"selection by intelligence\". It is they who have made the core curriculum the ark of the covenant of wisdom. They are the dunces of illiberalism.</p> <p>The GCSE curriculum, with its cores, foundations, inspectors and examiners, is a Victorian archaism on a par with the House of Lords and the Church of England. Education remains the most conservative of professions, because nobody quite knows what it means. A fixed curriculum is accepted because it exists. Like military discipline, past generations suffered it and the present one had better do so, too. It has become a useful tool of state dirigisme. While exams are restlessly reformulated, their subject matter is stuck back in days when \"maths and science\" were totems of economic fortune. Any other vocational or life skill was for \"secondary moderns\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Strachey\" title=\"\">Lytton Strachey</a>, in his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_Victorians\" title=\"\">Eminent Victorians</a>, assailed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Arnold\" title=\"\">Thomas Arnold</a> of Rugby for making the English public school an engine of middle-class upbringing but for doing nothing about its content. Having upset his teachers making them teach, Arnold dared not upset them again by saying what should be taught. \"Hence the monastic and literary conceptions of education which had their roots in the middle ages,\" wrote Strachey, \"Arnold adopted almost without hesitation \u2026 the teaching of Latin and Greek grammar.\" The classics were beaten into&#xa0;children \"to train the mind\", just&#xa0;when the French and Germans were teaching science and technology, history and geography \u2013 and&#xa0;duly beating us commercially.</p> <p>Arnold still lives, with maths and science in place of Latin and Greek. Pundits are wheeled out to \"prove\" them either vital to the economy or, if not, then \"mind-training\". For millions of children, maths has replaced corporal punishment as subject of the phrase, \"It never did me any harm.\" Algebra and geometry are a liturgical creed, to be recited without question. History and geography, like literature, ethics or civics, are subjects for the devil.</p> <p>Britain's economy is in a mess not for&#xa0;lack of maths but for lack of ethics and common sense. Being top of the world in science did not save the Soviet&#xa0;Union from collapse. Young people need to understand computing, economics, law, the culture of the body, the history of community and the state of the environment. Schools send them out unable to write clearly or grapple with abstract concepts, yet chanting the periodic table like zombies.</p> <p>The collapse of educational progressivism in the 1980s and its replacement by \"teaching to the test\" was a real tragedy, caused largely by a sloppy overlay of political correctness and the reduced status of teachers. While the ideas of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey\" title=\"\">John Dewey</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi\" title=\"\">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner\" title=\"\">Rudolf Steiner</a> took hold in America, infusing much of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school\" title=\"\">charter school movement</a>, in Britain a \"good education\" is still identified with a juggernaut curriculum, nationally dictated, measured and moderated under stern ministerial audit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>'s mechanistic centralism is not so much socialist as Soviet.</p> <p>If any benefit could emerge from the new \"free\" (meaning expensive) state school movement, it should be liberation and experiment. Yet most are promising a \"traditional curriculum\". British schools are still in Arnoldian mode. They teach what they think will train a mind, not educate a citizen. They observe medieval holidays. \"Lessons\" are so structured as to ensure most of what is learned in 50 minutes is forgotten and must be recapped a day or a week later. Language schools know that total immersion is far more efficient.</p> <p>Schools seem terrified of experimenting with new teaching methods or radical subjects. The academic terrorism of tests and league tables has made Gradgrind's rote-learning seem almost liberal. The British are adept reformers of institutions, in health, education, the law, even banking. They are dreadful at reforming what institutions do. Good for Gurdon for calling their bluff.</p>",

The laws of the game are clear: flagposts are compulsory, but the actual flags are not. So yes, a game can be started with flag-less flagposts. All you need to be sure of is that whatever is taped to the posts does not represent a danger, and, clearly, toilet rolls are safe enough. But after the game, include the details in your post-match report. This clearly isn't good for the image of the competition. <em>Roger Lantern wins the shirt</em>. <br><strong>3)</strong> It's a valid complaint. The law was recently changed on this issue and now stipulates that \"any tape or similar material must be the same colour\" as the part of the sock to which it is applied.

  "<p>'Did you cry at the end?\" It's the day after her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2012/may/19/cannes-2012-day-four\" title=\"\">first ever premiere</a> at the Cannes film festival, which ended in a standing ovation, and New Orleans schoolgirl Quvenzhan\u00e9 \"Nazie\" Wallis \u2013 eight years old, going on 30 \u2013 is taking the whole circus in her stride. Calm and unruffled, she is a force of nature, one minute sitting quietly, the next skipping round her endlessly patient parents. \"She really is an old soul in a little body, and always has been,\" says her director, 29-year-old first timer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/sep/30/benh-zeitlin-why-we-are-watching\" title=\"\">Benh Zeitlin</a>. \"It's funny, because it seems she really gets it \u2013 she knows what she's doing, she knows how to be a little star. But at the same time it doesn't faze her.\"</p> <p>This \"it\" is Zeitlin's debut movie, Beasts of the Southern Wild, which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/26/sundance-2012-beasts-southern-wild-review\" title=\"\">premiered</a> at Sundance in January and has since swept across the planet, today hitting Cannes just as a violent storm sweeps in from the sea. Which is an odd coincidence, since Zeitlin's film, loosely inspired by the events of Hurricane Katrina, is a rites-of-passage story that depicts a bizarre, primitive swampland flooded by rain. At the centre of it are Hushpuppy (Wallis) and her father Wink (Dwight Henry), two local residents transformed by Zeitlin's production team into grimy, shock-haired rebels who must fight for their hometown and resist attempts by the mainland to assimilate them.</p> <p>Henry and Wallis, in their everyday lives, are unrecognisable. Henry, 49, is the <a href=\"http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2012/06/profile-of-beasts-of-the-southern-wild-star-dwight-henry.html\" title=\"\">refined, sharp-suited and very charismatic</a> manager of successful New Orleans eaterie <a href=\"http://www.buttermilkdrop.com\" title=\"\">the Buttermilk Drop Cafe and Bakery</a>; Wallis's only previous brush with acting was playing at being Selina Gomez and Nicki Minaj with her friends. Onscreen, their chemistry is total, as Wink, suffering from a fatal illness, tries to school his daughter in the ways of the world.</p> <p>And this is no world that we know, a world of rust and nails, sumps and driftwood, feral animals and insects \u2013 an anarchic paradise. \"The first scene we shot was my most difficult scene,\" drawls Henry, \"and we shot it in the Mississippi river \u2026\"</p> <p>\"It wasn't no pool!\" Wallis interrupts brightly.</p> <p>\"\u2026 In 40, 50-degree water, all day. Because Benh wanted everything to be as real as it possibly could be, even with the animals that we had. The pigs, the chickens \u2026\"</p> <p>\"A horse!\" chirps Wallis.</p> <p>\"\u2026 the birds, the dawg \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Everything was real!\" insists Wallis.\"They were untrained before we started, and they were only trained to do what we needed them to do. So everything you see is real. Benh could have gone to California, to New York, maybe gone and got an actor to play my part. But what he wanted was somebody who actually, in real life, went through what we go through in the movie, with storms and the like. I'm <em>from</em> New Orleans, and this is something we go through <em>every year</em>. We have to deal with the possibility of a storm coming in, evacuating \u2013 family goin' all different places \u2013 so having someone that has gone through this brings a realness. I was caught in hurricane Katrina. I was in \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Neck-high water!\" interjects Wallis.</p> <p>\"Because I had two businesses,\" continues Henry. \"And when things like that happen, vandals come to your business, they loot it. And I refused to let that happen. So when Katrina came, I stayed down there, and I had to get out of neck-high water to save my life! That was a real thing that I brought to the movie. Versus getting someone from Hollywood who's never been through these things.\"</p> <p>Such realism is what Zeitlin calls making this film \"humble to the elements that you're using\" in order to tell the story. He says that the script was rewritten several times around Wallis and Henry, that the production design was \"organic\", and that, set-wise, almost nothing was used that wasn't already there. \"You want to tell a big story, so you write a big story,\" he continues. \"But then you allow the elements that define and speak to that story to change and alter it. You don't come in with this precious script and a perfect plan.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397593040\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/11/1349970862866/Benh-Zeitlin-director-of--010.jpg\" alt=\"Benh Zeitlin, director of Beasts of the Southern Wild.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benh Zeitlin, director of Beasts of the Southern Wild.

Born in New York, then a film student at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and now a Louisiana resident, he expresses surprise that he is still on the road with it. \"I'm not a very nervous person,\" he says, \"but I really didn't expect people to like it. I'd heard that if you're 'the Sundance movie' you sort of have the cards stacked against you at Cannes. So the end of that screening was totally shocking. It was a real moment where I thought: Wow, this is not just gonna be a US thing.\"</p> <p>Now, of course, the Oscar circuit is beckoning, and, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/02/beasts-southern-wild-screen-actors-guild-awards\" title=\"\">despite an altercation with the Screen Actors Guild</a> \u2013 who say the film's (at the time of shooting) non-union cast are ineligible for <em>their</em> awards \u2013 Zeitlin's film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/21/oscars-watch-2013-academy-award-nominees\" title=\"\">looks certain to secure a few nominations</a>. \"It's all one crazy ride,\" shrugs Zeitlin. \"It's been totally surreal, for a long time. It's so far beyond our expectations already that if 15 incredible movies come out this fall and we don't get nominated for anything we'll still be thrilled.\"</p> <p>Especially since Beasts was conceived as a film far outside the system. \"I've always loved movies, since I was a little kid,\" he says, \"but I never wanted to be part of that industry. It always seemed horrifying, the way films were made.\" The turning point came when, while working as a projectionist, there was a week when Zeitlin had an epiphany: Terrence Malick's Badlands, followed by Werner Herzog's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/82250/aguirre.wrath.of.god\" title=\"\">Aguirre: Wrath of God</a>, followed by Jim Jarmusch's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78366/down-by-law\" title=\"\">Down By Law</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114787/\" title=\"\">Underground</a>, by Emir Kusturica. \"Four films in a row,\" he marvels, \"that showed me that \u2013 woah \u2013 there <em>is</em> a totally other way to approach this. Seeing people that went and made a film in the jungle, or went and made a film in the badlands, those kind of things were what I was interested in doing with my time. Being on boats, going to far-off places and telling stories about them. That's when I started to think it was something I actually wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Zeitlin denies that Beasts, though it looks it, was ever unsafe. \"But maybe that's relatively speaking,\" he smiles, \"because the short film I made beforehand was <em>unbelievably</em> unsafe. It's about a group of people that are building a boat out of trash from a post-storm New Orleans to try to rescue a purgatory of people that have drowned but are alive underneath the water. We took the same approach \u2013 live the story! \u2013 so we built a boat, not knowing how to, out of garbage and sailed it with 15 actors into the gulf. It was literally falling apart as we were at sea. Interns got marooned 20 miles out to sea on a floating scrap of metal. It was a real Herzogian adventure! But Beasts was not. We got a little better at simulating danger.\"</p> <p>The stark contrast between that and the glamour of the awards season so soon after is not lost on him. \"Look,\" he says, \"I can't emphasise enough that we never expected anything like this to happen, but I really believe there's a way to make films that are populist in a different way. The same way that Nirvana stripped down hair metal and turned into something populist, without glitz and glamour. That's what we wanted \u2013 to try to find a way to tear this thing down and distil what we love about epic film-making into a different context.\"</p> <p>Work on a followup has slowed, he says, \"because I've been promoting the film since you saw me last\", but Zeitlin's production company, Court 13, is busily developing a project that is going to be shot in Louisiana, with the same system, same crew and same cast. \"It's about ageing,\" he says.</p> <p>Why there? \"Local casting is just something I love doing,\" he explains. \"It's that education you get from working with people that are actually from the place where you're shooting that gives it this whole other texture. And also, just south of Louisiana is just such an incredibly talented place, with very vibrant people that, if they were born in New York or Los Angeles, some talent scout <em>would</em> say, 'You should be an actor.' But because they're in south Louisiana, and there's no film industry there, they're just hanging out. So for us it's an endless source of story and talent.\"</p> <p>And if he hadn't become a filmmaker, would he be out there having these adventures? \"I would have done that regardless,\" he says, \"but then, film is the best enabler for that. It's amazing. Someone once told me that movies are a universal passport. And it's true, wherever you go.\"</p>",

He has now stepped down from the board after resigning his chief executive role last week.</p> <p>With his departure, the future of the company looks uncertain. It also illustrates the difficulty electric vehicle companies have faced in recent years, as the initial wave of optimism of five years ago petered out amid technical problems and the inertia of the automotive industry.

But without a big fleet of electric cars, installing such infrastructure is expensive, requiring large upfront investments with tiny returns for years until the vehicle market catches up.</p> <p>This has meant Agassi's deals to open battery stations \u2013 such as those with the Israeli and Danish governments \u2013 have been slow to come to fruition.</p> <p>Evan Thornley, formerly head of Better Place's Australian operations, has replaced Agassi as chief executive.

  "<p>A plan to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in the Scottish independence referendum has been praised by reform campaigners, but significant questions have emerged about how it might work.</p> <p>The proposal to extend the franchise to under-18s for the first time in a major vote in the UK will be a key part of the deal being signed on Monday by David Cameron and Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, to give legal authority to the autumn 2014 referendum.</p> <p>After months of talks between the UK and Scottish governments, the deal gives the Scottish parliament powers to stage the referendum, but only for a single \"yes or no\" question on independence, with the power lapsing at the end of 2014.</p> <p>In one of Cameron's concessions, he has agreed to Salmond's demands for the vote to be extended to those aged 16 and 17 \u2013 a compromise welcomed by electoral campaigners, MPs and the Scottish Youth Parliament.</p> <p>Constitutional experts and lawyers have warned, however, there are still significant issues on extending the franchise, including the lack of an electoral register, which are far from solved.</p> <p>Cameron and his advisers know about these issues, but have told Scottish ministers it is now their problem. \"Be careful what you wish for,\" one UK government source said.</p> <p>Holyrood will have to decide whether and how to compile a register of 16- and 17-year-olds. Scotland has previously allowed under-18s to vote in some health board elections and recent crofting elections.</p> <p>It will also have to pay for a big registration drive to encourage children now 14 and 15 to register for a vote in 2014.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission has warned that the current system excludes nearly all 16-year-olds. They can only put themselves on the voters' roll one year in advance if their 18th birthday falls in the year after 1 December. Because registration ends each October, that means only teenagers who are older than 16 years and 10 months can do so.</p> <p>Most teenagers eligible to register in advance \u2013 a group known as \"attainers\" \u2013 are already missing. The Guardian has established that only about a third (44,000) of Scotland's 123,000 16- and 17-year-olds are included in the current local council roll.</p> <p>Niall McCluskey, a Scottish advocate expert in human rights, said failing to include every 16-year-old would leave Holyrood open to legal challenge: \"It's potentially discriminatory. If your general principle is that 16- and 17-year-olds ought to be able to vote, these rights have to be practical and effective. If they're not, you can fall foul of human rights law.\"</p> <p>Grant Costello, chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said: \"It's a slap in the face by Westminster. The Scottish government should've seen this coming. But it's not just the Scottish government's problem; it's the UK government's problem.</p> <p>\"David Cameron has conceded this right, so the argument is now won, so that means the two governments should get their act together.\"</p> <p>Another complication which is only just grabbing attention surrounds the UK government's biggest reforms of the British voting in modern times.</p> <p>In the summer of 2014, only a few months before more than 4m voters in Scotland will be asked to decide their constitutional future, a new UK-wide individual electoral registration system comes into force.</p> <p>This will make it a legal requirement for every adult to register to vote, replacing the historic system where the head of each household submitted names of all eligible voters in the property. But the Electoral Reform Society and others fear that millions of voters will fail to register, particularly in poor areas.</p> <p>Introducing this system within only a few months or weeks of the referendum could present significant difficulties for electoral returning officers and the referendum campaigners: they will be left wrestling with a totally new list of voters to target and contact.</p> <p>The new system will still exclude under-18s as it uses the current practice of only allowing \"attainers\" aged over 16 years and 10 months to sign up in advance.</p> <p>The Scottish parliament may be forced to ignore that new electoral roll and run their own based on the current system.</p> <p>Willie Sullivan, Scottish director of the Electoral Reform Society, said he feared the new system would be badly resourced and poorly implemented across the UK.</p> <p>\"If they are not careful, millions of voters stand to disappear from the registers across the UK and, with this change due to come in just before the Scottish independence referendum in autumn 2014, this could obviously have devastating consequences for those wanting to have their say on Scotland's future.\"</p>",
  "<p>British film-maker Mary Kerr has given us a shrewd insight into the sentimentality and superstition of the film business, and the brittle world of movie status and prestige. The subject is a gentle New York vagrant named Craig Castaldo, bearded and wild-haired, with matted and dirty clothes but intelligent and articulate. He is nicknamed \"Radioman\" on account of the radio he keeps on a string around his neck. Over the past 20 years, Radioman has become a cult figure in the New York film industry for always hanging around Manhattan film sets, and since striking up a boozy conversation with Bruce Willis on the set of The Bonfire of the Vanities, he keeps getting cast in tiny non-speaking parts, almost as a talisman. Scorsese used him quite prominently in Shutter Island, and everyone knows who he is: there are tributes from George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Robin Williams (whom Radioman rather resembles). But Kerr shows that the tolerant, affectionate indulgence of these A-listers is not infinite. James Gandolfini and Ricky Gervais are not especially enamoured of the liberties taken by this guy, and when he goes to LA and tries to get into Oscar parties, poor, dishevelled Radioman is given a brutal reality check about where he actually is on the food chain. A&#xa0;bittersweet vignette.</p>",

At the Conservative party conference he kept repeating it, baffling the leaders of the <a href=\"http://bma.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Medical Association</a>, the royal colleges and patient groups assembled at fringes and breakfasts trying to discover what to expect next.</p> <p>Integration? \"The entire reform is designed for disintegration. That's what competition from AQP [any qualified provider] does,\" said one leader, echoed by others. But the word signals no new direction as <a href=\"http://www.gponline.com/News/article/1153950/jeremy-hunt-says-nhs-reforms-brave-right/\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt called the reforms \"brave\"</a>, \"right\", and bound to \"make our NHS stronger\". Integration is just a useful word, like David Cameron's iteration of \"compassion\".</p> <p>Second only to the economy, the NHS will be the next election's hot potato: on this, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2012/oct/10/are-david-cameron-claims-nhs-true\" title=\"\">Labour scores 30 points ahead</a>. Public satisfaction, at its highest in 2010, plummeted last year due to the unpopularity of the act. Cameron and Hunt were somewhat selective in boasting their NHS results \u2013 where did Hunt find the fantasy fact that <a href=\"http://eoin-clarke.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/the-3-greatest-flaws-in-jeremy-hunts.html\" title=\"\">NHS spending is rising by \u00a312bn</a>? So far, the trouble is still only brewing beneath the surface. Patients may not feel the effect of the worst ever spending squeeze for another year or so, but they will read about galloping outsourcing: more than 400 services already compulsorily put out to any qualified provider, another 39 shortly. Many primary care trusts had no wish to outsource services they were happy with. They will never know what goes on inside private services, as \"commercial confidentiality\" shields these state-funded companies from the Freedom of Information Act. Check out <a href=\"https://www.supply2health.nhs.uk/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Supply2Health</a>, the government website that \"advertises opportunities\", if you fancy bidding for something.</p> <p>In April, 210 clinical commissioning groups take over from the 152 primary care trusts. Cameron boasted of cuts in NHS managers \u2013 but there is a lack of finance directors, many good managers have quit \u2013 some retired in disgust, some do their old jobs for private bidders or join the new army of consultants that Cameron didn't mention. Andrew Lansley claimed GPs would run commissioning for the whole NHS, but the <a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of GPs</a> says that, despite a few enthusiasts, most groups are not led by GPs. Doctors are not eager to be managers, even less to be the fig leaves for rationing that their leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/03/royal-college-gps-health-bill\" title=\"\">Dr Clare Gerada</a>, says \"should be the responsibility of democratically elected politicians\". She is shocked that each commissioning group must decide whether to offer a new cystic fibrosis drug at \u00a3150,000 per patient per year.</p> <p>Health leaders assembled in Birmingham were chewing over news that the government has back-pedalled on a key promise made to calm Lib Dem anxieties during the passage of the Act. Fearing private companies would cherry-pick lucrative and easy surgery, draining the NHS of cash while leaving it with costly complex cases, the government promised that those who just take simple cases would be paid less. But that has been quietly dropped.</p> <p>The conference gathered just as the go button was pressed, allowing NHS trusts to sell up to 49% of their services privately. Labour lists many trusts that have put big increases in private practice into their financial plans for years ahead. As waiting lists rise, both NHS trusts and the private sector expect patients to shift from public to private: read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-intrays-new-ministers\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt's co-authored 2005 book</a>; that was implicit in his plan for a \"denationalised\" insurance system.</p> <p>Where will the public feel the pinch first? Already local rationing means many are denied hip and knee surgery. Hardly trivial. Many are offered removal of only one cataract: one eye is enough. A winter flu crisis would tip hospitals over the edge and send waiting times soaring. The loss of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/nhs-figures-reveal-fewer-nurses\" title=\"\">more than 5000 nurses </a>makes Hunt's pledge to improve quality of nursing care for oldest patients improbable.</p> <p>Take just one condition to illustrate the disorder: there are a soaring 140,000 new diabetic cases a year, but among the nursing posts lost are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/22/diabetics-at-risk-nhs-cuts\" title=\"\">218 diabetic specialists</a> who train and support diabetics \u2013 on call, on the phone \u2013 to prevent them descending into crises and hospitalisation. As fewer patients get this help, a fortune is wasted in needless admissions. Barbara Young, former NHS senior manager, now head of Diabetes UK, says outsourcing their many different services is breaking the diabetic care pathway. Take podiatry: diabetics risk amputated feet if inexperienced high street commercial clinics treat them, with no knowledge of their history and give no feedback to their doctors. \"They need their feet checked by experts, looking for vascular problems.\" But she is told new contracts can't oblige providers to share data and communicate with diabetic care networks. \"Everything is fragmenting.\"</p> <p>A crescendo of noise comes from hospitals due for merger, and A&amp;E and maternity units closing. Even the Daily Mail is on the rampage, joining <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2213984/You-stop-A-E-cuts-140-doctors-sign-damning-letter-David-Cameron.html\" title=\"\">save-our-hospital campaigns</a>. North West London may close four of nine A&amp;Es, to huge outcry. Remember Cameron brazenly joining picket lines to halt all closures? That's the opportunism of opposition.</p> <p>Andy Burnham swears he will resist the temptation: that shows Labour expects power soon. Some closures are essential, and he will back those closing due to bad results, lacking 24-hour specialists. But he will oppose mergers for the wrong reasons. That takes tricky navigation: research by Bristol University's <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmpo/\" title=\"\">centre for market and public organisation</a> finds most mergers lead to higher debts, longer waits and poorer results.</p> <p>In his warmly received speech in Manchester, Burnham promised to repeal the act. The easy part is abolishing the compulsion for commissioning groups to outsource and stopping Monitor enforcing market competition. NHS leaders heaved a sigh of relief. But they also want his cast-iron promise not to reorganise everything again. More than 90,000 staff moved jobs in Lansley's upheaval, with \u00a33bn wasted and productivity lost. Burnham swears not, but all health secretaries get that gleam in their eye. Small shudders ran down a few spines at his plans to put commissioning under the wing of local authorities, to merge social care, and for hospitals to run community services. These are good ideas \u2013 but only if his policy review proves they can be done with no mass re-disorganisation, when money will even tighter than now. But he was dead right to say the NHS faces two options \u2013 fragmentation or integration. That will be the turf war at the next election.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 October 2012. The original incorrectly stated that the majority of clinical commissioning groups did not have a GP on their boards.</p>",
  "<p>The little orphaned badgers Bessie and Baz, one-time pets of the new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, are enjoying a surprising posthumous fame thanks to his new role overseeing the imminent cull in England, which could result in a third of the population being shot dead. \"I was perhaps about 10 years old when a local farmer rang us up to say he had found a young badger and would we take it in,\" Paterson reminisced in 2004. \"So we did; it was a female called Bessy and she lived in the boiler room. She was extremely intelligent, had a very low opinion of cats but loved the dogs. She was pretty well trained, she went in the car. Then we had another badger and as soon as they got together they dug their way out and ran away. It is terribly hard when welfare people see me as anti-badger, having known a badger very well.\"</p> <p>Yet Paterson is standing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">resolutely behind the cull</a>, dismissing opposition as \"sad sentimentality\" at this week's Conservative party conference. It is an issue he knows well having tabled a record 600 parliamentary questions on the problem of TB in cattle while shadow environment minister. That barrage is typical of the man, say those who know him, pointing to similar deep dives by Paterson into fisheries, roads and Northern Ireland. \"He is very committed, very diligent, thorough and good on detail and he is incredibly energetic,\" said Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP and a fellow member of the rightwing <a href=\"http://cornerstone-group.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cornerstone group</a>.</p> <p>Paterson is Shropshire born-and-bred. The arrival of a true countryman \u2013 who derides \"metropolitan smartypants\" and says \"<a href=\"http://www.whitchurchherald.co.uk/news/115969/owen-paterson-new-defra-boss.aspx\" title=\"\">we have to manage the countryside</a>\" \u2013 at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) might have been expected to please many of those who care about the environment. In what some may call a display of his \"<a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/politics/2012/09/05/the-rise-and-rise-of-owen-paterson/\" title=\"\">good, old-fashioned, Shropshire common sense</a>\", he is said to have forbidden Defra officials from using the phrase \"ecosystem services\", a jargon phrase for the benefits bestowed by the natural world.</p> <p>But the overwhelming reaction from environmentalists \u2013 farmers and landowners excepted \u2013 was of horror. Instead of a countryman, they saw an apparent climate change sceptic, confirmed Eurosceptic and avowed slasher of red tape. His appointment to the ministry entrusted with enforcing the regulation \u2013 much of it from Brussels \u2013 that protects the environment was seen as the final confirmation that David Cameron's pledge to be the \"greenest government ever\" had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/reshuffle-owen-paterson-war-environment\" title=\"\">gone up in smoke</a>, as the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/05/reshuffle-coalition-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">shifted to the right</a>.</p> <p>Paterson is certainly a true-blue Tory, railing, for example, against red tape in a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2011/12/extended-version-our-interview-with-owen-paterson/\" title=\"\">recent Spectator interview</a>: \"Government can wreck a business by confiscating its money by taxation. But confiscating its time is absolutely critical too.\" When officials in his new department were highlighting the difficulty of ignoring European environmental regulation, he is said to have told them: \"The French get away with it.\"</p> <p>Paterson voted for John Redwood, Iain Duncan Smith and Liam Fox in successive Tory leadership contests, and was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/22/tory-minister-opposes-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">first member of this cabinet to oppose gay marriage</a>. In short, he is the opposite of a Tory moderniser.</p> <p>But, given his new post, the most damaging charge is that he is a climate change sceptic. The suggestion is based on his opposition to \"ridiculous\", \"useless\" windfarms, \"intensely unpopular\" subsidies for renewable energy and his support for new runways and shale gas development, known as fracking. His performances at conference only hardened this view, with rabid denunciations of \"Soviet\" subsidies and threats to cut them, alongside enthusiasm for the fast tracking of fracking. However, Richard Betts, a meteorologist at the Met Office who heard Paterson's inaugural speech to staff at Defra, concluded he<a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardabetts/status/245446095386329088\" title=\"\"> was no climate change denier</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paterson has perplexingly chosen not to scotch the charge. \"Climate change is obviously happening and there is obviously a man-made contribution,\" he has said more than once. Failing to state that the burning of fossil fuels is by far the greatest contribution is a fudge frequently used by so-called sceptics: hence the greens' fears.</p> <p>For them, it gets worse. For a man frequently lauded for his intelligence and grip of detail, he can still peddle myths, stating in September: \"My concern is that some measures we take to [reduce carbon emissions] may be doing more damage. I am not convinced that building windfarms is the right way because you have more problems. You have to have gas backup \u2013 and that is operating inefficiently. So you have the problems that it's not reducing carbon emissions and it depends on very heavy public subsidy which is intensely unpopular with the people and businesses it damages.\"</p> <p>The facts are that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">windfarms unequivocally cut carbon</a> and that poll after poll reveals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/19/wind-power-poll-uk-public-favour\" title=\"\">overwhelming public support for renewable energy</a>. \"The notion that wind doesn't save carbon because of the need for back-up is simply incorrect,\" said Professor Robert Gross at Imperial College London.</p> <p>Paterson's loathing of windfarms may be out of kilter with national opinion, but it is firmly in step with his North Shropshire constituents. He is well-thought of there, according to Keith Harrison, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/farming/farming-news/2012/09/14/environment-secretary-owen-paterson-is-backing-badger-cull/\" title=\"\">Shropshire Star</a>, and has increased his majority at four successive general elections, perhaps because he is the very model of a shires Tory MP.</p> <p>Brought up on a family farm and described as \"county set\" rather than grand, he went to Radley College, a public school, and studied history at Cambridge. Two decades followed in the family tannery business, supplying leather to luxury goods makers, and a time as president of the European Tanners Confederation, where he deployed his fluent French and German. \"He is no stupid little Englander,\" said <a href=\"http://www.respublica.org.uk/author/phillip_blond\" title=\"\">Phillip Blond</a>, director of the ResPublica thinktank and influential Tory moderniser.</p> <p>Paterson now lives in a large, 160-year-old, Grade II listed house a stone's throw from the Welsh border, where he keeps horses, sheep and chickens. He is married to the daughter of Viscount Matthew Ridley, linking him both to eight generations of Tory MPs and the prominent climate change sceptic Matt Ridley, his brother-in-law.</p> <p>His passion is horses \u2013 Betfair gave him and his wife <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/120903/120903.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a31,000 of hospitality at Ascot in June</a> \u2013 and as with his other interests, Paterson leaps in, having completed a gruelling <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/outdoors/outdoor-activities/8912480/The-Mongol-Derby-the-worlds-most-gruelling-horse-race.html\" title=\"\">620-mile (1,000km) horse race across the deserts of Mongolia</a> this summer. But critics suggest that sometimes his self-confidence, energy and enthusiasm tips him into naivety, perhaps blinded by his own brilliance.</p> <p>Paterson's plan for protecting the UK's seas from overfishing was widely praised by environmentalists as \"having its heart in the right place\", but was founded on an impossible unilateral withdrawal from the European Union's fisheries policy. His first appearance on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk8vc\" title=\"\">BBC's Farming Today</a> programme as environment secretary revealed an unexpected zeal for closing the UK's \"dessert deficit\". He said: \"One thing I have been banging on about, we have a dessert deficit in the UK. We still import a very large proportion of our desserts. I would ask everyone to go out and buy a British dessert.\"</p> <p>His energy showed as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, when he is said to have spent more time in the province than the secretary of state. Yet, despite being seen as a low-profile success when he served as Northern Ireland secretary after the 2010 election, he did propose that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1310342/Coalition-wants-Sinn-Fein-MPs-seats-Parliament.html\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in MPs should be allowed to swear a pledge of allegiance</a> not involving the Queen, an \"undoubtedly naive\" idea, according to seasoned observers.</p> <p>Coming out of the Northern Ireland post relatively unscathed is an achievement, according to Rees-Mogg: \"It is a very difficult brief to have and requires people to be pragmatic and get on with people with different opinions. Going in as a headbanging ideologue would be a very bad idea.\"</p> <p>Blond also defends Paterson: \"There has been a rush to judgment on Owen that has not been merited. I know Owen is very keen on community energy, for example.\" The official transcript of his conference speech demonstrates the limit of that keeness for renewables though: \"We must ensure that the right measures are deployed in the right places\" \u2013 ie not wind in Shropshire.</p> <p>Jonathan Porritt, one of the UK's most prominent environmentalists, <a href=\"http://www.jonathonporritt.com/blog/cabinet-reshuffle\" title=\"\">greeted his appointment by saying</a>: \"Sit back and enjoy the spectacle of Owen Paterson as secretary of state at Defra, who is as close to a latter-day reincarnation of [the Thatcherite environment secretary] Nicholas Ridley as we're likely to get. It really is astonishing to contemplate what was once a progressive and intelligent [Conservative] party so comprehensively engineering its own destruction.\"</p> <p>Paterson has so far simply ignored such criticism, instead focusing on his government's central obsession: reviving economic growth. \"My absolute priority, with clear instruction from the prime minister, is to do everything I can to improve and help conditions under which people can run businesses and generate wealth and jobs in the rural economy,\" said Paterson. \"The role of Defra is to make things easier for [rural] people and then to get out of people's hair.\"</p> <p>David Nussbaum, the head of WWF, whom Paterson phoned within days of taking office, warned: \"He has to engage in rural affairs, but his department has national responsibilities and international responsibilities too.\"</p> <p>For greens, this is the key. Improving the daily business of the countryside appears suited to Paterson. But on the broader issues of environment, energy and climate change, both as environment secretary and as a member of a government left distinctly less green after the reshuffle, the more he says, the more sceptical he appears. Greens fear that just as Paterson, an avowed badger-lover, has backed the widespread slaughter of the animals, the avowed lover of the countryside will fail to back the measures most experts say are needed to protect the world from global warming.</p> <h2>Pocket profile<br></h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 24 June 1956</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 56</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Paterson is a countryman raised on a farm who, after public school and Cambridge, spent 20 years in the family leather firm before becoming the very model of a true-blue Conservative MP in the shires.</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> Promotion to secretary of state for the environment, where he can apply his fierce Euroscepticism and loathing of red tape to getting Defra \"out of people's hair\".</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> Probably yet to come with the hugely controversial badger cull about to start and flooding on the rise at a time when Defra has cut the spending on flood defences.</p> <p><strong>What he says:</strong> \"We always had very well-intentioned Labour ministers at Defra who were completely urban and completely clueless. That's not going to happen with me. And I eat meat.\"</p> <p><strong>What they say:</strong> \"He listens and is bright, so he's easy to brief, but is more gung-ho than his predecessor. The badger cull is his first huge test: when political dogma is confronted by scientific fact and public opinion, that means tough times ahead.\" <em>Defra source</em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Syrian government</strong><br></h2> <p>Russia has retained its historical role as the key weapons supplier to Bashar al-Assad's regime over the past 18 months. It is believed to have sent at least three shipments of heavy ammunition to the jointly run port of Tartous in northern Syria. Other Russian supplies are thought to have been flown in.</p> <p>In late September, Russian envoys around the world were summoned to Moscow for an annual gathering. One ambassador present said the unexpected presence of Soviet hardliners, including Yevgeny Primakok, meant no imminent change in Russia's support, or let-up in weapons supplies.</p> <p>Moscow has refurbished Syrian attack helicopters, but has been unable to deliver some of them after interference from western Europe.</p> <p>Iran is widely thought to have sent at least two shipments of weapons and sent several flights carrying arms into Damascus airport. Iran's neighbour, Iraq, a foe of the Assad family until six months before the uprising, is understood to be supplying oil to keep the Syrian military moving, but not weapons.</p> <h2><strong>Secular, or moderate, groups</strong><br></h2> <p>Saudi Arabia was initially enthusiastic about supplying the so-called moderates, but has backed away partly as a result of US pressure, which stems from the increasingly splintered nature of the uprising, and because of its own disenchantment with the Syrian National Council, which is perceived to have done little with the largesse thrown its way earlier this year.</p> <p>The moderates received two large cross-border supplies of weapons in May and June, but have had to scrimp and save ever since. They received a shipment of ammunition in mid-September and are believed to have been given more in recent days. Turkish intelligence still prefers to deal with the moderates.</p> <h2><strong>Syrian Islamist groups</strong><br></h2> <p>The prime beneficiaries of cash and weapons from Qatar are increasingly the best armed and most organised of the myriad opposition units trying to oust the Assad regime. But they are increasingly at loggerheads with other elements of the opposition, especially those who brand themselves as moderate or secular nationalists.</p> <p>The Farouq Brigade, a fighting force that emerged from Homs, is the best armed in the country, thanks in part to the supply of weapons it has received through Lebanese MP Orkab Sakr, who is aligned to Lebanese opposition leader, Saad Hariri, and worked on behalf of the Saudis until recently.</p> <p>The Liwa al-Tawheed Brigade, one of the first into Aleppo city in late July, has also received Saudi help, but has recently looked more towards Qatar.</p> <p>Syria's Muslim Brotherhood movement is also backing several Islamist groups.</p> <h2><strong>Foreign jihadists</strong><br></h2> <p>With the exception of those arriving from Iraq, the foreigners are almost all turning up without weapons or ammunition. Many of those who have travelled to Syria since July have extensive experience from fighting US and government forces during the Iraq insurgency.</p> <p>They are increasingly being deployed to frontline areas in Aleppo and linking up with hardline elements among the Syrian Islamists. There is evidence of some of the new arrivals joining forces with the main Salafist jihadist group, Jabhat al-Nusraf. There is speculation that the time for the foreigners to start conducting their own operations is near.</p> <h2><strong>Military Council</strong></h2> <p>The group of senior military defectors who have largely remained in exile in Turkey has received little in the way of weapons from any foreign patron. They have, however, been the main contact point for western intelligence agencies, including the CIA and Turkish intelligence, who have supplied communications equipment and tactical advice.</p> <p>They have received cash from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which they are then allocating to regional councils to buy weapons from arms traders.</p> <p>The council is struggling to establish a chain of command and control within the Free Syrian Army, which is heavily fragmented and unable to function as a standing military in all but a few areas. As a result, council leaders have crossed into northern Syria to establish bases. They have no shortage of funds, but resentment over the limited role they have played so far means they are struggling to win the respect of the units and villages they are visiting.</p>",
  "<p>Zoe Kazan, a granddaughter of Eliaa, has had supporting roles in Hollywood movies; now she's made an impressive debut as producer, star and screenwriter of this absorbing and adroit relationship comedy, Ruby Sparks, directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/perfect-couple-for-ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris</a>. It's a fantasy romance about a lonely, blocked novelist who channels his yearning into the typewriter keyboard and magics a gorgeous female character into real life. The film coolly absorbs the influences of Woody Allen and Charlie Kaufman, with a little of The Stepford Wives, while avoiding the self-consciousness (and unfunniness) of Marc Forster's comparable film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/115237/stranger.than.fiction\" title=\"\">Stranger than Fiction</a>. It does not have the vinegary-ironic taste of Allen or Kaufman; Kazan prefers to emphasise the sadness, gender politics and downbeat reality of a relationship turning sour. A male writer might ask: what might it be like to create an ideal woman? This female writer asks: what is it like, having to be some man's idea of an ideal woman?</p> <p>The tormented creator is Calvin, played by Paul Dano, a young novelist who had a Salingeresque cult hit with his first book, making him rich enough to live in a huge house in Los Angeles, where he now stares at a blank sheet of paper in his old-fashioned typewriter. Depressed by the imagined lifetime of loneliness and career disappointment stretching ahead, Calvin starts having vivid dreams about a beautiful young woman called Ruby Sparks (played by Kazan): vivacious, artistic, but not a writer, not a success, and therefore not a threat. The dreams become more vivid as Calvin starts writing about this fantasy-woman, and then the fantasy becomes a reality.</p> <p>Kazan brings to the role a sweet and dignified vulnerability, keeping rigorously to plausible human behaviour. Calvin can control everything except her depression, which rises inexorably to the surface when he experiments with letting Ruby be herself. Is Kazan's screenplay autobiographical? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/20/paul-dano-like-idea-consequence\" title=\"\">Dano is Kazan's partner in real life</a>, and as so often with movies like these, there is an additional pleasure in wondering how and where reality has been modified \u2013 how Kazan, the writer, has reconfigured the roles of \"boyfriend\", \"girlfriend\" and \"author\" in her fiction. Maybe you could call this a fantromcom. Anyway, it's thoroughly&#xa0;enjoyable.</p>",
  "<p>In October 1997, Nicolas Winding Refn sat watching old sci-fi movies in an attic room in a small hotel off Oxford Street. A few days past his 27th birthday, the fledgling Danish director had been brought to Britain to promote his first film, a low-budget crime drama called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/66726/pusher\" title=\"\">Pusher</a>. \"It was a glorious moment,\" he recalls. \"The film had done more than I ever thought it could \u2013 it had left Copenhagen. For me that was like making Star Wars.\"</p> <p>Fifteen years on, he sits in another, larger Soho hotel \u2013 a sleek and genial figure whose last film, the neon-lit thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142036/drive\" title=\"\">Drive</a>, carried him into Hollywood's upper levels. A London-set remake of his debut is about to be released, on which his credit is executive producer. He is here to reminisce. To walk between the two hotels would take minutes, yet the journey from one to the other has been outlandish \u2013 an odyssey through the film industries of Britain, the US and Scandinavia with a detour to India and a baroque cast of real-life characters. The new Pusher is, in fact, a second remake, joining a pair of sequels Refn made himself in what must surely be modern cinema's most unlikely franchise.</p> <p>The original plot was classically simple, a seven-day countdown as a Copenhagen heroin dealer tries to settle a debt to a louche but vicious Serbian gangster. Refn's gift for casting was clear \u2013 the burly Kim Bodnia gave anti-hero Frank a glowering magnetism, the much-admired Mads Mikkelsen took a first screen role as his sidekick. The result hummed with promise \u2013 the son of Danish film-makers who spent his youth in 80s New York, Refn instinctively fused the swagger of American crime movies with handheld European v\u00e9rit\u00e9.</p> <p>In Denmark, the film was a huge and unexpected hit. The rest of the world failed to notice. It took British distributor Metrodome to brave a first international release. In the last moments before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/67567/trainspotting\" title=\"\">Trainspotting</a> became old news, company founder Rupert Preston cannily sold Refn as \"the Danish Danny Boyle\" and the film won an audience big enough to stir interest elsewhere. \"Britain is where it all started,\" Refn says. \"This place got me out of my cage.\"</p> <p>For its director, Pusher had served its purpose: he came to see the movie as a film student might regard their final coursework, with fond memories of a riotous shoot, a supporting cast of club kids and local heavies, and a snotty commitment to authenticity that meant \"all the cocaine on set being real\". Assuming all that was now behind him, Refn got on with the rest of his career. Eventually, inevitably, he headed to the US. In 2003 came a wilfully opaque thriller called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96278/fear.x\" title=\"\">Fear X</a>, starring John Turturro. It baffled almost all who saw it. All, essentially, was no one. Its director was left financially ruined. \"I was down and out,\" Refn says. \"I owed the bank a million dollars. I was depressed, humiliated, I had just had my first child. I felt like a rock'n'roll suicide.\"</p> <p>If the scale of his debt outdid Frank in Pusher, there was a mordant irony to the solution \u2013 the \"despicable sell-out\" of making not one but two belated sequels. He had few other offers. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/107127/with.blood.on.my.hands\" title=\"\">Pusher II </a>\u2013 Refn now calls it \"the girly Pusher\" \u2013 Mikkelsen's goonish sadsack attempted fatherhood. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113001/pusher-3\" title=\"\">Pusher III</a> focused on Milo, the ageing gangster again played by Zlatko Buric, a crazy-haired 6ft 5in Croatian steeped in avant-garde theatre who had stolen much of the first movie. Yet there would be a twist. Born as desperate cash-ins, the sequels won Refn new levels of critical acclaim. They also made just enough money to pay off the bank. An unhappy spell <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/sep/08/nicolas-winding-refn-interview\" title=\"\">making Miss Marple TV movies</a> still lay ahead. But old friendships endured. Preston had by now left Metrodome for Vertigo Films, a hard-nosed outfit whose movies were keenly attuned to the market. Having produced Refn's Pusher sequels, he now suggested a remake.</p> <p>Given the original's strong characters and ticking-clock conceit, he wasn't the first. A script appeared from an American producer. Fox discussed making a network TV show. Given the nature of Refn's career, it was therefore predictable that the first remake of Pusher would be developed in Leicester and shot in Hindi.</p> <p>A cheerful Anglo-Indian actor from the east Midlands, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/assadfilm\" title=\"\">Assad Raja</a> had nursed a passion for the film since 1997. Finally, after years telling friends he wanted to make a film \"a bit like Pusher\" to escape the weary chase for roles on The Bill, he approached Refn for the rights to direct a fully fledged remake \u2013 a showcase for his talents aimed at the Indian film business. Refn, says Raja, was \"amused\" by the thought of his debut going Bollywood. Casting himself in the lead and shooting in London, his production was almost as chaotic as the original: unable to find an Asian actor to play a henchman, Raja narrowly avoided having to \"brown up\" a white bodybuilder. In the end, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082075/\" title=\"\">his film came out in 2010</a> sharing the same scruffy, adrenal energy as its inspiration while adding a&#xa0;sub-plot about the cricket world cup.</p> <p>India, to Raja's disappointment, was unmoved. At home, too, while the film found a fanbase on DVD, not everyone saw the commercial potential.</p> <p>In the meantime, Refn had agreed to Preston's idea of their own remake, set in London. It would be a mistake to see him as an innocent among moneymen. By his own account, his career began at 21, when his uncle \u2013 then owner of Denmark's biggest arthouse distributor \u2013 recruited him to scout for films at Cannes. \"That was my education,\" he says. \"I never approached film-making as an art. I saw it as what sells.\"</p> <p>For most of the remake's production, he was in Bangkok making his next film, cop thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/01/best-film-directors-world-2012\" title=\"\">Only God Forgives</a>. But his involvement went much further than the executive producer's typical role of turning up for the premiere. The choice of writer \u2013 former TV producer Matthew Read \u2013 was his. He and Preston together picked director Luis Prieto, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11860629\" title=\"\">a Spanish maker of Italian romantic comedies</a>. The budget was set at $1m (\u00a3623,000) \u2013 a sum Preston says ensured fidelity to the tone of the original, but which must also have relaxed the accountants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397580665\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349964430536/Kim-Bodnia-in-the-origina-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Bodnia in the original Pusher\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Bodnia as Frank in Nicolas Winding Refn's original Pusher. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fighting jetlag in an east London bar, Prieto describes Refn's role in the new Pusher as \"like God \u2013 usually invisible, but always there\". Casting decisions, he says, were collaborative \u2013 hiring ex-model <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/feb/26/agyness-deyn-supermodel-stage\" title=\"\">Agyness Deyn</a> as Frank's stripper girlfriend Flo was an idea put to him by the producers, but one he gladly accepted. Once he did, he insisted neither she nor co-star Richard Coyle should watch the original film, ensuring the only principal actor who had seen it had also starred in it \u2013 Buric, returning as Milo after coaxing from Refn.</p> <p>Prieto says he made his movie with two goals \u2013 to create something more stylised than the original and to foreground the character of Flo. On those terms, he succeeds. Deyn is a vivid presence, while $1m buys you a lot of slickness in 2012. And if the remake does sometimes make you pine for the Pusher you saw back in 1997, the truth \u2013 expressed politely but without apology by all concerned \u2013 is that it's not really for you: \"Luis's version is for a new audience,\" Preston says. \"So many people won't have seen the original. If you're 20 now, you were five when it came out.\"</p> <p>Similarly, if there were fears that setting Pusher in London might taint the film with geezerism, in fact the remake feels strikingly little like London. Shot in Stoke Newington, the standard-issue urban backdrops could often be anywhere. For Preston, hiring a director with no connection to the capital was deliberate \u2013 the result of a desire not to make \"one of those British crime movies we see too often\". But in a global film market there may be other benefits \u2013 giving an international audience the hint of local flavour without enough of it to scare them off.</p> <p>This way, it seems, lies the future. Because rather than their remake ending the Pusher story, Refn and Preston see it as the start of a new chapter \u2013 or chapters. A working model is ready to go \u2013 Refn matching up a character, a city and a skeletal story, before the two men then find writers and directors to make the movie. So next will be a sequel to the remake \u2013 not, to be clear, a remake of the sequel \u2013 following Deyn as Flo to a new life in Las Vegas. Then it will once more be the turn of the tireless Buric, though Refn is unsure where to put him: \"Zlatko could go anywhere. Maybe Tokyo.\"</p> <p>Asked how many Pushers he might ultimately father, he pauses. \"At one point I wanted to do 10,\" he says. \"I'll keep going until the ideas run out.\" He sips his cappuccino. \"So far they never have.\"</p>",

  "<p>The most senior civil servant at the Department for Transport has issued an apology to former transport secretary Justine Greening over his officials' handling of the west coast mainline franchise.</p> <p>In a sign of the depth of contrition among senior civil servants, Philip Rutnam made a point of reaching out to Greening, who is said to be livid at the conduct of officials in her former department.</p> <p>Greening, moved from the transport department in last month's reshuffle to become the new international development secretary, is understood to have let her displeasure be known in Whitehall. She is particularly angry because she summoned officials to give an explanation after Virgin's complaint over the decision to strip it of the west coast mainline and award the franchise instead to FirstGroup. Officials initially told Greening they were confident the assessment process was reliable. However, when she asked them to double-check, civil servants reported they had identified one error, but said they were confident it would not have changed the outcome.</p> <p>This alarmed Greening to such an extent that, at the same meeting on 3 September, one day before the reshuffle, she ordered a full-scale review which was designed to run a fine-tooth comb through the franchise process.</p> <p>The findings of this review prompted Patrick McLoughlin, who replaced Greening as transport secretary, to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/west-coast-rail-contract\" title=\"\">abandon the process last week</a>. He said the fault lay \"only and squarely within the Department for Transport\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/03/transport-secretary-west-coast-mainline\" title=\"\">Three officials from his department were later suspended</a>.</p> <p>In his note to Greening, Rutnam reiterated that the problem was \"clearly the responsibility of officials and not ministers\" and acknowledged that during the franchise process \"both you and Theresa Villiers [then a transport minister] were assured by officials in this department that the process was robust and sound\". That was \"manifestly not the case\", added Rutnam.</p> <p>No 10 said on Thursday that the first the prime minister knew of the severity of the problems with the west coast bid was when McLoughlin made his announcement, a month after the reshuffle on 4 September, in which Villiers was promoted to Northern Ireland secretary.</p> <p>The apology and Greening's anger is another example of the often poor relations between ministers in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition and civil servants. The Public and Commercial Services union, which represents one of the three suspended officials, has described the decision as \"deplorable, but sadly not out of character\" for the government.</p> <p>The episode has also highlighted questions over the Department for Transport's practice of only showing ministers anonymised details of franchise bids to ensure they cannot be open to charges of favouritism. Some ministers are concerned that this gives too much power to officials and makes it more difficult for ministers, who are accountable to parliament for the work of their entire department, to maintain proper oversight.</p> <p>McLoughlin is due to decide on Monday who will run the line while investigations are held before the franchise process begins again.</p> <p>This will follow two separate investigations also announced by the transport secretary, one into the west coast bid process and the second into the overall franchise system.</p> <p>The transport department has said that the problems found with the Virgin and First Group bids were focused on assessment of the train companies' forecasts of passenger numbers and the calculation of inflation. Officials told the Guardian the same mistakes were made in assessing all four original bids for the contract, including two which were dropped at the first stage. However, the decision to suspend the original award suggests that the same error applied to different bid numbers would have differing levels of impact on the assessment.The second reviewwill be led by the chairman of Eurostar, Richard Brown. He is likely to put more focus on ministers since the current franchise system was introduced by the coalition government following a review commissioned by the first coalition transport secretary, Philip Hammond, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/oct/14/liam-fox-resignation-adam-werritty\" title=\"\">replaced by Greening when he became defence secretary</a> in October 2011.</p>",
  "<p>The huge logistical challenge of delivering millions of new iPhone&#xa0;5s all over the world has led to a spike in the cost of air freight.</p> <p>Transport experts said the launches of Apple products have become such big business for the air cargo industry that delivery firms and airlines have chartered dozens of extra planes, cancelled scheduled routes and ditched staff training during \"Operation iPhone Drop\".</p> <p>In the latest quarterly health check on the US economy, published on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook/beigebook201210.htm\" title=\"\">the Federal Reserve said</a>: \"Air cargo companies saw an increase in cargo volume tied to the launch of various smartphones and computer tablets, which favour shipment by air over other modalities.\"</p> <p>Martin Dixon of freight research firm Drewry said the delivery of the iPhone had helped the air freight industry bounce back from a collapse in prices \u2013 July were the lowest since July 2009, when most of the developed world was gripped by recession.</p> <p>Dixon said the indicative average cost of air freight from China to the west had risen 7% to $3.56 (\u00a32.20) per kg between August and September, and he expected it to rise even higher this month in the wake of the iPhone&#xa0;5 launch.</p> <p>He said Apple has had a \"huge impact\" on the air freight industry, which is experiencing a deep contraction as many companies cut spending by transporting more goods by sea.</p> <p>\"Only a few years ago smartphones weren't around, now they make up a huge part of air freight goods,\" he said. \"Apple is very clever at how it manages its supply chain, and its ability to secure air freight capacity to launch new models is a key part of that strategy.\"</p> <p>John Manners-Bell, chief executive of research firm Transport Intelligence, said Apple's demand for air cargo capacity was so large that it was \"able to skew rates across a large proportion of the global air cargo market\".</p> <p>He said it was too early to say how much rates had risen as result of the iPhone&#xa0;5, launched on 21 September, but said prices spiked by 20% when Apple launched the latest iPad version in March.</p> <p>Manners-Bell said Apple was now \"by far the biggest air cargo shipper in the world by some margin\", and the industry was awash with rumours about measures taken by logistics companies and airlines to meet the US company's demands. \"There is talk of airlines pulling scheduled routes to [have more planes free] to serve the Apple account,\" he said.</p> <p>Kevin Sterling, a freight transport analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, said he had heard that Apple had chartered up to 70 jets in the runup to the launch of the iPhone. He predicted thatthe air freight rate could reach as high as $5 per kg in the days surrounding the launch.</p> <p>US delivery giant FedEx postponed training classes for staff during the first few days of the iPhone launch as it prepared for a \"surge event\", according to an internal memo leaked to MacRumours.</p> <p>The analysts said none of the big delivery companies would divulge the impact of the iPhone, but Chinese delivery firm THI Group, which provides freight services for a company that assembles the iPhone 5, reported a 50% rise in profits from Hong Kong and China on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/24/iphone5-apple-sales-first-weekend\" title=\"\">Apple sold 5m iPhone&#xa0;5s in the first three days after the product launched</a>, but a withdrawal of scratched phones before delivery has led to sales forecasts for the iPhone&#xa0;5 in the last three months of this year being cut from 57m units to 49m.</p>",
  "<p>Author Mo Yan has become the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel prize for literature, a decision that sparked rejoicing but some criticism in his homeland.</p> <p>State media celebrated Mo's win and the Nobel website rapidly filled with comments from Chinese users expressing pride at his triumph.</p> <p>The Swedish Academy, which decides on the award, said the novelist's \"hallucinatory realism\" merged folk tales, history and the contemporary, and created a world reminiscent of those forged by William Faulkner and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.</p> <p>\"He writes about the peasantry, about life in the countryside, about people struggling to survive, struggling for their dignity, sometimes winning but most of the time losing,\" said the academy's secretary, Peter Englund.</p> <p>Mo could not be reached for comment, but he told the judges he was \"overjoyed and scared\", Englund said.</p> <p>The 57-year-old author's real name is Guan Moye but he took his pen name, which translates as \"don't speak\", to remind him of the dangers of saying too much.</p> <p>\"His work is always unique \u2026 Since Red Sorghum, he has for the past 30 years consistently been at a peak of creativity. That is not easy. Many writers have ups and downs, but he keeps himself at his writing peak,\" Yan Lianke, another highly regarded novelist, said.</p> <p>He added that the award was a recognition of Chinese literature. This was a widespread feeling in China, where, according to Beijing-based literary translator Brendan O'Kane, writers feel Chinese literature is not comprehensible to the rest of the world. \"This will be a huge confidence boost,\" he said.</p> <p>The only other Chinese winner was Gao Xingjian, who took the 2000 prize, but he lives in exile as a French citizen and his works are banned on the mainland. The Chinese foreign ministry complained at the time that the prize had \"been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/970184.stm\" title=\"\">used for ulterior political motives</a>\" \u2013 though Mo praised Gao's \"enormous contribution\" to Chinese literature.</p> <p>This time, the national broadcaster broke into the evening news to announce the decision and news sites ran Mo's photograph on their front pages. While many saw Mo's triumph as epitomising the country's advance, others complained he had been too cosy with the authorities.</p> <p>When Nobel judges gave the peace prize to another writer \u2013 jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo \u2013 two years ago, Mo said he did not know much about the case and did not want to discuss it. He also withdrew from the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2009 because dissident writers were attending.</p> <p>Most recently, he was one of 100 Chinese literary figures who copied by hand landmark speeches by Mao Zedong on how art should serve communism, <a href=\"http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/chairman-mao-in-their-own-hand/\" title=\"\">prompting accusations that they had sold their souls</a>.</p> <p>Ai Weiwei, the outspoken artist detained last year, said Mo might have literary achievements, but noted: \"As an intellectual, I think he's not a conscious one. He has been very clearly pursuing the party's line and in several cases he has shown no respect for the independence of intellectuals.\"</p> <p>Others think that Mo has been tarred unfairly as a government stooge.</p> <p>\"He's not a political risk taker, but he's nobody's lackey,\" said Eric Abrahamsen, a literary translator who has interpreted for Mo at several events.</p> <p>\"He is very politically astute\u2026 [but] he doesn't write what he is told.\"</p> <p>Supporters argue that he has frequently addressed difficult issues, although staying within the government's red lines; his last novel, Frog, tackled population control and forced abortions.</p> <p>\"He was instrumental in reviving Chinese literary language after the Cultural Revolution,\" said Abrahamsen.</p> <p>\"He has also done the best job of tackling the big social and historical issues, I think more successfully than anyone else has, taking historical facts and turned them into convincing art. That's enough, right there, to win the Nobel.\"</p> <p>Mo published his first book in 1981 and has said he was thrilled when he earned 800 yuan (around \u00a380) by selling the movie rights for Red Sorghum, which became a hugely successful film. The Nobel literature prize is worth 8m Swedish kronor, or about \u00a3744,000.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>EPO and blood transfusions: Injected</strong></h2> <p>Until 2000 there was no viable test for EPO, which boosts red blood cell production, thus improving endurance, and was taken by Armstrong and his team-mates under programmes devised by Dr Michele Ferrari, according to Usada. Saline solution was used to lower hematocrit levels and evade detection, while Ferrari instructed George Hincapie to inject it directly into the vein, so reducing the window of detection to 12 hours. At one stage, makeup was applied to Armstrong's upper arm to hide bruising from an injection, the report says. After the EPO test came in, blood transfusions became more popular. Half-litres of blood were extracted, stored in fridges, then rigged up as drips on coat hangers and reinfused into riders, so replicating the effect of EPO.</p> <h2><strong>Andriol: Taken orally/through patches</strong></h2> <p>Tyler Hamilton describes how he saw Armstrong using a mixture of Andriol, commonly referred to as liquid testosterone, and olive oil developed by Dr Ferrari, which was to be taken orally. On at least one occasion during the 1999 Tour Armstrong squirted the \"oil\" into Hamilton's mouth after a stage. The testosterone, which boosts power, could also be dispensed through patches, which were to be worn overnight. Because testosterone is naturally produced by the human body, it is difficult to detect in low doses.</p> <h2><strong>Cortisone: Injected or swallowed</strong></h2> <p>A steroid that reduces pain and inflammation, Cortisone is only prohibited if there is no medical need. So US Postal Service and Discovery Channel team doctors would simply provide false declarations of medical need. The Usada report claims Armstrong and his team-mates received Cortisone injections or took it in pill form. During the 1999 Tour, Armstrong tested positive for Cortisone but had no medical exemption \u2013 so the team provide a backdated prescription for Cortisone cream for saddle soreness.</p> <h2><strong>Human growth hormone: Injected</strong></h2> <p>Several of Armstrong's team-mates, and officials, testify to witnessing Dr Luis Garc\u00eda del Moral injecting human growth hormone, which as an anabolic agent increases size and power. There was no satisfactory test for HGH between 1998 and 2005 and Wada is only now close to having one.</p> <h2><strong>Actovegin: Injected night before race</strong></h2> <p>During the 2000 Tour, a discarded box of the anti-diabetes drug Actovegin was found in a skip. US Postal said at the time that it was used to treat road rash and Armstrong claimed never to have heard of it.

  "<p>New rules to force oil, gas and mining companies to publish payments to any government of more than \u20ac80,000 (\u00a364,525) will be supported by the UK, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said on Thursday.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader said the coalition would urge European leaders to support the changes, similar to those introduced this summer by the US, in a bid to expose governments that keep large payments while their populations suffer.</p> <p>Bono, the rock star and campaigner who helped found the pressure group <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/\" title=\"\">ONE</a>, welcomed the move. \"Sometimes great things happen when nobody's looking,\" said the U2 singer.</p> <p>\"That's what happened today.

  "<p>The Metropolitan police has said that the man chairing an inquiry into a fatal shooting acted irrationally by ordering the force to hand over secret footage of the incident to the lawyers of the dead man's family.</p> <p>The footage was taken by a helicopter tracking a car containing Azelle Rodney, who was shot six times by a police marksman and died in April 2005 in north London.</p> <p>An inquiry into the shooting began in September, chaired by Sir Christopher Holland. He ruled that the aerial footage should be given to lawyers representing Rodney's family, but that decision is opposed by the Met which went to London's high court on Thursday to block the order.</p> <p>Papers lodged with the court show the Met originally claimed there was no aerial footage of the incident, but later said this statement was wrong.</p> <p>Anne Studd QC, appearing for the Met, said Holland had reached a conclusion that was so irrational it should be quashed.</p> <p>Holland's decision under rule 12(4) of the 2006 Inquiry Rules was \"insufficiently reasoned\" and there was no basis for concluding that such disclosure was necessary within the meaning of the rules, Studd argued.</p> <p>Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquiry, said disclosure to the family's lawyers was necessary to achieve a fair and well-informed public interest immunity process that respected the family's right to as open an inquiry as possible.</p> <p>Lord Justice Pitchford, Mr Justice Foskett and Judge Peter Thornton QC reserved their judgment, which they are expected to give next week.</p> <p>A police helicopter filmed Rodney and two other men in a car for several hours in the Harlesden and Edgware areas before police forced the car to stop and opened fire in Hale Lane, Mill Hill.</p> <p>Rodney was suspected of being part of a plot to rip off a Colombian drugs gang at gunpoint when he was killed by an armed police officer who, the inquiry has heard, shot him six times without issuing an oral warning.</p> <p>The officer, known only as E7, opened fire less than one second after pulling alongside the car carrying Rodney, who was in a rear seat.</p> <p>Rodney's family have fought a seven-year battle for a public and full inquiry into his death. The authorities previously said this would not be possible because the intelligence used by law enforcement came from intercepts and argued that the disclosure to lawyers and the family would be unlawful.</p> <p>The sensitive intelligence in this case was one of the reasons that the last Labour government and the coalition considered introducing so-called \"secret inquests\".</p>",
  "<p>Luxury fashion brand Burberry has blamed slowing sales on the spending squeeze faced by middle-class designer label lovers who can no longer afford to satisfy their lust for \u00a31,000 handbags or \u00a3500 dresses.</p> <p>Finance director Stacey Cartwright said that while its wealthiest customers were spending more than ever, so-called \"aspirational\" shoppers \u2013 a term used to describe consumers who spend a large chunk of their disposable income on designer labels but cannot stretch to the most expensive items \u2013 were staying away from the shops.</p> <p>\"The reason traffic [in stores] is down is because aspirational luxury shoppers are more impacted by the macro economic environment,\" she said. \"Higher spending luxury consumers are more resilient and have carried on spending.\"</p> <p>She also complained that the Olympics had hurt sales in London.</p> <p>Analysts said the divide between wealthy and middle-class customers was reflected in the fortunes of Burberry's various brands. Its most expensive ranges, such as \"Prorsum\", which it shows on the catwalk, and \"London\", were doing well while sales of cheaper casualwear line \"Brit\" slumped.</p> <p>Last month the 156-year-old British company, famous for its raincoats lined with a distinctive camel, red and black check pattern, spooked investors with a profit warning that knocked \u00a31bn off its stock market value. At that time it said growth had stalled in July and August, particularly in China, which has been the driving force of a near three-year boom in demand for luxury goods, sparking fears that the luxury sector could face a fresh downturn.</p> <p>On Thursday, Burberry was able to soothe nerves after demand picked up during September, enabling it to eke out underlying retail sales growth of 1% for the second quarter as a whole \u2013 albeit a marked slowdown on the 6% seen in the previous quarter. It also said that profit margins at its retail and wholesale divisions would be the same as last year for the first six months of the year, rather than lower as it had previously warned. The signs of improvement sent the shares rocketing to the top of the FTSE 100 risers' list, closing up more than 13% at \u00a311.36.</p> <p>\"While there is still uncertainty over the impact the global economic slowdown will have on luxury spending, we are reassured that demand has not fallen off a cliff and so believe the shares have been oversold,\" said Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert.</p> <p>The Olympics also proved to be a major headache for the British brand as the tourists who ventured to London during the summer came to watch sport rather than shop. \"London was a lot quieter than usual when it came to shopping,\" said Cartwright. \"We have a much greater exposure to London than many of our peers because it is our home market.\"</p> <p>The number of foreign visitors to the UK actually fell 5% to 3m in August compared with a year ago according to official figures while airports operator BAA said 9.5m passengers passed through its airports in August, down 2% on 2011. Asian tourists, predominantly from China, are among Burberry's biggest customers in major tourist cities such as London and some analysts think they may have either delayed travel plans, fearing transport chaos, or cancelled them altogether as confidence in their powerhouse economy falters.</p> <p>In the wake of the profit alert analysts have questioned the sales outlook faced by luxury goods companies although the picture was confused by upbeat figures from Italian fashion brand Prada which said it had not experienced a slowdown.</p> <p>China is the big prize for the luxury goods industry with the country expected to become the biggest single market by 2015 but, along with the UK, it is currently Burberry's weakest market.</p> <p>Cartwright said sales had been affected by a decline in gift-giving ahead of next month's leadership change. She denied there was a problem with the Burberry brand, arguing its experience reflected the global economic backdrop and would be echoed in the results of peers such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and PPR, which owns Gucci, which will update investors in the coming weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, has accused Russia of directly supplying munitions to the Syrian government, after Turkish jets intercepted a plane en route from Moscow to Damascus.</p> <p>Russia had earlier flatly denied that the Syrian plane, which was forced to land in Ankara, was carrying any military equipment. But Erdogan told reporters: \"These were equipment and ammunition that were being sent from a Russian agency&#xa0;\u2026 to the Syrian defence ministry,\" the Associated Press reported. \"Their examination is continuing and the necessary [action] will follow.\"</p> <p>Erdogan's comments clearly implied that he was accusing Moscow of lying.</p> <p>Earlier, in angry exchanges, Russia had accused the Turkish authorities of endangering Russian lives when the Syrian Air Airbus was intercepted by Turkish F16 fighter jets on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Turkish media reports said cargo confiscated from the plane before it was allowed to leave Ankara included radios, antennae and equipment \"thought to be missile parts\". Syria immediately condemned the Turkish action as piracy.</p> <p>Turkey said previously that it had received an intelligence tip-off that the plane had illegal cargo on board. Erdogan warned last year that Turkey would be willing to take measures to \"stop and confiscate\" any shipment of military supplies, by air or sea, to Syria in contravention of its own unilateral embargo.</p> <p>The incident underlines sharp and growing disagreements over the crisis \u2013 the bloodiest of the Arab spring \u2013 which Syrian opposition activists say has cost 30,000 lives in the last 19 months. On a new and alarming front, Turkey and Syria have traded artillery fire several times over their border in the past week.</p> <p>Diplomats said Turkey was flexing its muscles after Russia refused to condemn Syria at the United Nations last week when mortar shells fired by the Syrian army killed five civilians in a Turkish border village.</p> <p>Birol Akg\u00fcn, of Ankara's Institute of Strategic Thinking, told Zaman newspaper: \"This is a signal to both Syria and third parties, such as Russia and Iran.\"</p> <p>Russia is Syria's closest ally and has supplied it with weapons as well as providing diplomatic and political cover in the UN security council. Turkey has called for President Bashar al-Assad to step down and has allowed limited supplies of weapons to be delivered across the border to the Syrian rebels.</p> <p>Syria protested that the Airbus passengers were in a \"very bad psychological state\". One of them, a Syrian aviation official, alleged that Turkish officials pointed guns at crew and handcuffed passengers.</p> <p>\"We had no cargo on that aeroplane,\" Vyacheslav Davidenko, spokesman for Russia's state arms export company Rosoboronexport, told Reuters. \"We always deliver our weapons in full compliance with international norms. Sending weapons on a passenger aeroplane breaks about every law there is,\" he said.</p> <p>Russian and Chinese objections mean there are no international arms sanctions in force against Syria. Moscow has balked at western pressure to cut co-operation with or pressure the Syrian regime and has made several unsuccessful attempts to deliver renovated helicopters. One shipment was sent back as it rounded the coast of Scotland in the summer.</p> <p>\"Russia is not interested in escalating the conflict in Syria,\" said Ruslan Aliyev, an analyst at the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based consultancy with links to Russia's defence community. \"Secretly delivering weapons to Syria would put at risk Russia's image and reputation and [Vladimir] Putin's personal reputation. No Russian leader would go on such a risky venture.\"</p> <p>Assad sought to calm tensions with Ankara, describing Syria and Turkey as brothers in an interview published on Thursday. He insisted Turkey had \"no reason to go to war\" over the cross-border clashes. \"We should work on this issue together,\" he told the left-leaning Turkish newspaper Aydinlik. \"In times like this, countries should correct their mistakes by talking to each other.\"</p> <p>Inside Syria, meanwhile, battles continued in Idlib province, near the Turkish border, as rebels sought to consolidate control of a strategic town on the main north-south highway. Rebels said they captured Maaret al-Numan on Wednesday. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said clashes continued after rebels attacked a military convoy and nearby checkpoints. The Syrian Revolution General Commission reported 47 deaths in Idlib, Deraa, Damascus and Homs.</p>",
  "<p>In the final year of the Iran-Iraq war, Ayatollah Khomeini faced a dilemma: whether to bend to domestic and international pressure and accept a ceasefire or continue with the increasingly futile \"holy defence\" that was bringing heavy casualties.</p> <p>By that stage, in 1988, most of the regime favoured peace but almost no one dared to admit it publicly. Opting for a ceasefire remained a \"red line\" in official discussions, and only one man could change that \u2013 the founder of the Islamic republic.</p> <p>In the end, Khomeini decided \u2013 in his own words \u2013 to \"drink from a poisoned chalice\" and face up to the unpalatable reality. By agreeing a UN-brokered truce, he put an end to the longest conventional war of the 20th century, which had left half a million dead on both sides.</p> <p>In today's Iran, the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is caught in a similar situation. With the standoff over Tehran's nuclear programme causing discontent at home and fears of a major confrontation with the west, will Khamenei be prepared to compromise?</p> <p>Until recently, talk of western sanctions having an impact on the Iranian economy has been a \"red line\" for Khamenei. During his 23-year rule, he has remained adamant that sanctions have made his regime stronger and self-sufficient in many areas. Those officials who suggested, however quietly, that sanctions were making life more difficult were immediately attacked. Just last year, when the head of Iran's central bank, Mahmoud Bahmani, referred to the extent of the financial crisis the country faced, Khamenei reacted by describing him, though implicitly, as a \"bad decision-maker\".</p> <p>Now, as sanctions compound the country's economic woes, that red line appears to be disappearing, with many officials, finding their leader's old rhetoric untenable, publicly expressing concerns about the country's crumbling economy.</p> <p>This week, Khamenei was still confident that sanctions would not bring his regime to its knees. \"Are we worse off or you [the west]? In the streets of major European countries there are demonstrations day and night \u2026 The problems of the west are much more complicated than ours,\" he told crowds gathering in the north-eastern city of Bojnourd. \"The west's economy is frozen. You are worse off and you are moving towards collapse and recession.\"</p> <p>Just as during the bad old years of war, although Iranian officials are currently wary of speaking against Khamenei's nuclear policy, there are increasing signs of frustration among top officials and regime supporters. Talk of sanctions is seen as an indirect criticism of Khamenei for his reluctance to compromise over Tehran's nuclear dossier.</p> <p>Faced with unprecedented economic and political pressure, Khamenei might find it increasingly difficult to refuse to compromise. Last week, his official website ran an article that referred to Imam Hassan, a revered Shia figure famous for peace-making and compromise, triggering speculation that Khamenei might be ready to finally engage in serious negotiations.</p> <p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking at a press conference last week after Iran's currency hit an all-time low, made clear that sanctions were taking their toll but at the same time claimed his government had done nothing wrong, implying that the current situation was the consequence of a policy out of the control of his government.</p> <p>Although Ahmadinejad is the public face of Tehran's regime, sensitive domestic and foreign policies, including that of the nuclear programme, are under the direct control of the supreme leader and his elite Revolutionary Guards. In his talks with the world's major powers, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, has also made clear that he is the representative of the supreme leader.</p> <p>Unlike Khamenei, Ahmadinejad appears to be in mood for compromise. During his visit to New York for UN general assembly last month, the president signalled at least five times that his country was willing to resume relations with the US, a suggestion roundly rebuffed by Khamenei's top aide in Tehran.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad is not alone in talking about sanctions. Last month, Mohammadreza Bahonar, the deputy head of the Iranian parliament, said Iran was only selling 800 barrels of oil per day mid-summer, in comparison to 2.3m bpd last year. The dollar is now worth three times the rial compared with early last year. Even the conservative media, sympathetic to the regime, devote significant coverage to the impact of sanctions on the country's economy.</p> <p>In the wake of the economic hardship, Iranian officials are engaging in a blame game. In the meantime, Ahmadinejad risks becoming the scapegoat for the country's economic woes. In response to the internal rivalry, Khamenei called for unity and asked officials in parliament, the judiciary and other senior institutions, not to blame each other.</p> <p>Despite all this noise, any decision over Iran's nuclear programme rests with Khamenei who finds himself caught between two factions inside the regime, a small hawkish group pushing for more nuclear \"advances\" and a majority shy to show opposition. It emerged recently that an internal report by the Revolutionary Guards suggested that Iran needed only to resist \"three more years\" under sanctions to achieve its nuclear goals.</p> <p>In 2005, Khamenei resorted to issuing a fatwa to reassure the international community, without success, that his country was not making a nuclear bomb. Now he needs to make a far tougher decision.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said on Thursday that he believes the next 10 years will produce a racing industry in Britain with fewer racecourses and a \"significantly smaller\" fixture list, but stronger in financial terms as a result of long-term commercial agreements with betting operators \"which are beneficial to both parties\".</p> <p>Bittar, who addressed the annual Leaders In Racing conference in London, said a reduction in the number of racecourses will be a result of \"natural evolution\" and that he expects a number of small-scale owners and trainers to disappear too.</p> <p>\"There will be certain racecourses where continuing to be in the business of racing is far outweighed by other opportunities,\" Bittar said, \"and people that are genuine hobby breeders and trainers won't be able to maintain the parcels of land and the investment in terms of money and time. Without doubt, the fixture list will be significantly smaller, due to a natural consolidation of the industry.</p> <p>\"On the fringes of urban areas, over the next 10 years, there are going to be racecourses that are on pretty valuable pieces of land. But I think the important thing is that a smaller fixture list doesn't necessarily mean a less profitable fixture list.</p> <p>\"Managing that consolidation of the industry doesn't necessarily mean that a huge amount of the income that is generated within the sport will have to disappear. If you have a genuinely customer-centric fixture list, it can be smaller but still be as profitable as a bigger one.\"</p> <p>Bittar is confident that the next round of levy negotiations, which must be completed by the end of October to avoid a referral of the scheme to the government, will be concluded before the deadline. Negotiations will then continue on a possible commercial replacement for the levy system, under which bookmakers, many of whom have moved their internet businesses offshore and so beyond the reach of levy payments, would contribute on the basis of their entire racing business.</p> <p>There is still hope that it will not be necessary to involve the government in legislation to underpin a new system, with the threat of a ban on sponsorship and racecourse advertising one possible weapon that racing could bring to bear on bookies who refuse to pay their fair share.</p> <p>\"I think there's a real willingness from within racing to look at commercial agreements with wagering operators and reward only those commercial operators by way of advertising and sponsorship,\" Bittar said. \"We're never going to get the government to legislate to get [television] advertising bans, but there's a will to look at options for doing arrangements with certain operators. If there are operators who are not prepared to enter into commercial arrangements, maybe racing shouldn't be prepared to take advertising or sponsorship from them.</p> <p>\"Those are the sort of things that racing can get organised to do and [they] will have an impact. It's not just about giving some certainty [to a betting operator], it's can also be a competitive advantage and racing can help deliver that.\"</p> <p>Kieren Fallon, the six-times champion, told the audience that his riding career may be drawing to a close. \"I feel great and as fit as ever,\" Fallon said, \"and I enjoy it, but I'm not getting the same rides that I used to. That's a little bit down, so I think, if it continues downhill, I wouldn't stay around. I've had a great career and I've really enjoyed my riding. I wouldn't like to go out without riding in big races.\"</p> <p>Fallon added that, despite saying in the past that he would not become a trainer, it remains an option, although he is realistic about the challenge. \"It's hard,\" Fallon said. \"Trainers starting out need to start with lesser races and build their way up. They start with castoffs and rejects, and try and rejuvenate them and build way up. The way prize money is during the week, I think they are on the way out.\"</p> <p>Fallon was critical of the recent introduction of televised stewards' inquiries after major races.</p> <p>\"I think it's a bad idea,\" he said. \"It doesn't just involve the stewards or the jockeys, it's going to then involve the owners, too. A lot of people like me weren't educated that well and in the stewards' room it's difficult to speak. What you want to say and how it comes out can be different. If you've got an owner who thinks you're saying the wrong thing, it's going to go well beyond the stewards' room.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the saxophonist John Tchicai, who has died aged 76, performed with local musicians at the Red Rose in Finsbury Park, north London, in 2005, the show was sold out long before the start \u2013 though disappointed disciples stayed on within earshot of the premises, hoping to catch a stray sound. He was a beanpole of a man in a baseball cap who combined an amiable gravitas with an unassuming creative openness to his surroundings, and to the night's largely unfamiliar playing partners.</p> <p>Plenty of people on the bandstand and in that crowd knew of Tchicai's remarkable history, however. He had the rare distinction of having played with both John Lennon and John Coltrane. He had worked with such American free-jazz stars as the saxophonists Archie Shepp and Albert Ayler, and the pianist Cecil Taylor, and was a member of both the New York Contemporary Five and the New York Art Quartet, two of the most focused and creative bands in the sometimes sprawling \"new thing\" jazz movement of the 1960s.</p> <p>Initially influenced by the unfettered bluesy cry of Ornette Coleman and the sparing, soft-toned and enigmatic sound of Lee Konitz, Tchicai's sound grew tougher during the 1980s, when he increasingly played the tenor saxophone as well as the bass clarinet.</p> <p>He always sounded patiently composed, wise and lyrical even in the most abstract circumstances. From the 1990s and into the 21st century, dividing his time between California (where he had family) and Europe, Tchicai became the first jazz musician to be awarded a lifetime grant from the Danish ministry of culture. In later years he broadened his palette to include lyrics, poetry and electronics, as well as making one of his finest recordings, John Tchicai with Strings (2005), a saxophone-and-electronics adventure steered by the British duo Spring Heel Jack \u2013 John Coxon and Ashley Wales, former drum and bass producers who had become fascinated by free-improvisation.</p> <p>Tchicai was born in Copenhagen to a Congolese father and a Danish mother. He grew up in Aarhus, where he first learned the violin, then, as a teenager, the clarinet and alto saxophone after hearing American jazz musicians on tour. He studied the alto saxophone at the Royal Danish Music Conservatory, and in 1962 met Shepp and the trumpeter Bill Dixon at a festival in Helsinki. Following them to New York the next year, Tchicai was soon playing with Shepp and the trumpeter Don Cherry in the New York Contemporary Five.</p> <p>In 1964-65 he was a member of the New York Art Quartet alongside the pioneering free-jazz trombonist Roswell Rudd, played with Ayler (on New York Eye and Ear Control) and in 1965 appeared on Coltrane's influential large-ensemble Ascension session alongside Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/may/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Elvin Jones </a>and others.</p> <p>Tchicai returned to Denmark and led the Cadentia Nova Danica free-jazz big band from 1967. With the British drummer John Stevens, he unexpectedly joined Lennon's abstract guitar feedback sounds and Yoko Ono's screamed vocals on the pair's 1969 \"noise-music\" performance in Cambridge, featured on their album Unfinished Music No 2: Life with the Lions.</p> <p>Tchicai withdrew into teaching and yoga studies for much of the 1970s but worked with the Swiss piano virtuoso Ir\u00e8ne Schweizer (1975), in the saxophonist Simon Spang-Hanssen's Strange Brothers ensemble (1977), and with the expat South African bassist Johnny Dyani. The next decade saw him work with the Dutch saxophone sextet De Zes Winden, the iconoclastic pianist Taylor's Two Continents Ensemble and the guitarist Pierre D\u00f8rge's extraordinary New Jungle Orchestra, an anarchic brew of Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, African and Middle Eastern sounds, and blasting free-jazz.</p> <p>From 1991, living in both California and Perpignan, southern France, Tchicai became very productive, on sessions including Grandpa's Spells (1992, a mix of traditional jazz, fusion and electronics), on religious music and larger-scale works for instruments and voices, and in a continuing partnership with D\u00f8rge. In 2010 he participated in a two-day residency at Cafe OTO, in Dalston, east London, with John Edwards on bass and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/23/tony-marsh\" title=\"\">Tony Marsh</a> on drums.</p> <p>Tchicai was married and divorced four times. He is survived by his daughter, Julie, and son, Yolo.</p> <p><strong>Val Wilmer writes: </strong>John Tchicai's father was brought to Europe as a teenager in 1906 by the German ethnologist Leo Frobenius. Joseph Lucianus Tschcaya (later spelt Tschakai) was born at Pointe Noire, a village near the Congo estuary, and met Frobenius during the latter's first African expedition.</p> <p>The youngster had learned French and German at a Belgian mission school and lived with Frobenius as a servant. He was a useful contact whom the ethnologist educated further, and moved with him to Berlin. He travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium in search of work, and eventually to Scandinavia, where he worked in restaurants and nightclubs as a doorman and cigarette-seller.</p> <p>He had eight children with two partners before meeting Tchicai's mother. The eldest of them was the drummer Kaj Timmermann, who in 1940 formed the Harlem Kiddies, the first black Danish band. Tchicai's parents met at the Aarhus pleasure-gardens, where both were working as waiters. Tchicai told me that his father's first words to his mother were: \"I love you!\" They were married soon afterwards.</p> <p>\u2022 John Martin Tchicai, saxophonist, born 28 April 1936; died 8 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>Greek authorities have launched an investigation into allegations that riot police used a female protester as a human shield during angry demonstrations over a visit to Athens by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, this week.</p> <p>Witnesses told the Guardian the young woman, who has yet to be identified, was frogmarched in handcuffs ahead of riot police as protesters threw stones at officers.</p> <p>News of the investigation came as magistrates launched a separate inquiry into a Guardian report that anti-fascist protesters, arrested after clashing with extremists from the neo-nazi Golden Dawn party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/greek-antifascist-protesters-torture-police\" title=\"\">were subjected to torture by officers at the Attica General Police Directorate</a>. Human Rights Watch said accountability for police abuse was urgently needed.</p> <p>The group said: \"The scenes described by the victims to reporters are deeply shocking. No one should be treated that way by police. Greece needs to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation of their allegations.\"</p> <p>The inquiry into the human shield allegations was opened after photographs of the incident began to circulate on the internet, triggering condemnation of the tactics law enforcement officials stand increasingly accused of employing in Greece. \"It is being investigated,\" said Lieutenant Colonel Christos Manouras, Greece's police spokesman. \"We want to find out what these pictures hide.\"</p> <p>In the pictures, a young woman, her faced daubed in white anti-teargas solution, with a pink rucksack on her back, is seen being escorted by riot police before being placed in front of the unit when it encounters stone-throwing protesters. Witnesses said the woman appeared to be disoriented and terrified as she was marched through Athens in handcuffs.</p> <p>Foula Pharmacides, a shipping company employee, had participated in the demonstration outside parliament, but fled down a side street off Syntagma Square when police fired teargas to disperse the crowds. She described terror on the woman's face. \"As the squad moved down Xenofontos Street with the girl, the protesters appeared,\" she said. \"Then when the protesters started throwing things, the cop holding the girl takes her from the front of the unit to the back to face them and he starts moving her like a shield from left to right.</p> <p>\"The girl was falling down and he was picking her up. She was crying and clearly terrified. I couldn't believe it. You only ever see this sort of thing in the movies. Everyone started screaming 'Shame on you! Shame on you!' I remember there were two women next to me and they were crying, too, and screaming for the police to stop.\"</p> <p>Sokratis Michalopoulos, another witness, said the episode ended when the \"booing got so loud\" and the riot squad decided to move on. \"I don't think I will ever forget her face,\" said the 36-year-old television technician. \"It was as if she were an object not a human being and I think she was in shock. She was definitely being used as a shield. Thank God photographers were there and we now have cameras on phones otherwise people would think we were mad. No one would believe us.\"</p> <p>Veteran photographer Spyros Tsakiris, who also witnessed the incident, said the riot policeman who had been holding the woman had written \"killer\" in English on one of his bag straps.</p> <p>As Greece descends into further chaos amid mounting social and political tensions, accusations of police brutality are growing. In recent months, reports have multiplied of codes of conduct being flouted by law enforcement officers.</p> <p>The heavy-handedness has been attributed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/greek-police-victims-neo-nazi\" title=\"\">links between the police force and the far-right Golden Dawn</a>, whose popularity has surged on the back of soaring crime and anti-immigrant hysteria.</p> <p>\"The police are angry.

There, on the set of the similarly styled American Idol, <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2012/10/02/nicki-minaj-mariah-carey-fight-american-idol-audition/\" title=\"\">a fairly impressive spat</a> has apparently broken out between rapper Nicki Minaj and fellow judge Mariah Carey, after the latter apparently interrupted the former. Perhaps taking the matter of being interrupted a little too much to heart, Minaj subsequently called Carey \"boring as fuck\", after threatening to knock her out and chop&#xa0;her head off. \"Think this shit is a&#xa0;fucking joke?\" she said. \"If you got a fucking problem then handle it \u2026 I'm not fucking putting up with her fucking highness over there. Figure it the fuck out.\" \"If I had a gun,\" it's claimed she concluded, \"I would shoot her.\"</p> <p>Clearly keen to use the wisdom won through many years in the music business to calm the situation, Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks helpfully suggested that Carey should have responded <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/stevie-nicks/66585\" title=\"\">by murdering Minaj on screen</a>. \"If I had been Mariah I would have walked over to Nicki and strangled her to death right there,\" she said. \"I&#xa0;would have killed her in front of all those people and had to go to jail for it.\"</p> <p>While not wishing in any way to condone the making of demented public intimations of violence, LiS feels impelled to note that over here, The X&#xa0;Factor's notion of a ratings-generating controversy is Louis Walsh claiming he can't make his mind up between Rylan Clark and Carolynne Poole. With the best will in the world, this now feels a trifle wan. They get actual threats of decapitation; we're still stuck with \"You really made that song your own.\" No wonder ratings are down.</p> <p>Lost In Showbiz can't help but feel that it would certainly be more inclined to tune in if it thought it was going to see Louis Walsh embarking on a mad-eyed, expletive-ridden tirade that culminated in him making repeated threats to stab Gary Barlow while, say, Phil Collins egged them on from the sidelines. Perhaps we could go one better than the Americans and actually arm the judges before the competition. Come on, Louis! Get yourself a shiv! Let's give Tulisa a billiard ball in a sock! Are you going to let a trifling matter such as your fear of permanent injury or an arrest for grievous bodily harm stop you winning the ratings war with Strictly?

  "<p>It would be better for everybody \u2013 shareholders, the battered Nat Rothschild, the embarrassed non-executive directors and the London Stock Exchange \u2013 if Bumi had never been created. This ridiculous adventure into Indonesian coal mining via a partnership with the unpredictable Bakries has been a disaster. Is the best thing now to turn what's left into cash and end the miserable tale?</p> <p>That's what the Bakries are suggesting in a proposal that, as ever with Bumi, is less than straightforward. In three stages, the Indonesians would buy the assets for $1.2bn (\u00a3750m) in cash plus cancellation of their 23.8% stake in the London-listed company.</p> <p>They also suggest that Rothschild and his co-founders should surrender their 6.6% holding on the grounds that the stock was a reward for doing a deal that would now be unwound. That's a neat touch \u2013 shoving an extra helping of financial pain on to Rothschild.</p> <p>The net result, according to calculations by Barclays analysts, is that Bumi would be left with 483p a share of cash. So shareholders who piled into Rothschild's cash shell at \u00a310-a-pop two years ago, in the hope of a quick profit, would lose slightly more than half their investment. That's not great, but it's better than the 185p at which Bumi shares were trading until Thursday, dragged down by last month's revelation of \"potential financial and other irregularities\" in the Indonesian operations. The response to the Bakries' proposal was a jump in the price of Bumi shares to 260p.</p> <p>The gap from the theoretical 483p says the proposal is sketchy. Indeed it is: the Bakries don't say how they would finance the deal. And are all parts of the transaction conditional on each other? Bumi shareholders would probably welcome a parting of the ways with the Bakries, which a disposal of the 29% holding in Jakarta-listed Bumi Resources would achieve. But they might wish to persevere with Berau, whose 83% holding implies control, the quality that has been in shortest supply all along.</p> <p>The best policy for the independent directors on the Bumi board led by worthies Sir Julian Horn-Smith, Lord Renwick and Sir Graham Hearne is to treat the proposal seriously. If there is a realistic prospect of getting 483p \u2013 and that's a big \"if\" \u2013 most original investors would probably be happy to take the loss. And Rothschild, one hopes, would do the decent thing and give up his bonus shares.</p>",

The Boston-based investment manager is a Mitt Romney donor who has met the candidate on several occasions, both as the Massachusetts governor and as the would-be president. </p> <p>Despite a global financial meltdown that has finished off nearly every other world leader, Romney didn't seem to have the momentum to unseat President Barack Obama. But all that changed after Romney trounced Obama in their first debate.</p> <p>With opinion polls showing Romney gaining support since then, Sotell, the founder of investment adviser Kraematon Group, says this is finally Romney's opportunity to spotlight his real talent. \"Obama has one terrific skill set, and that's campaigning. But we don't need the most popular guy in the room; we don't need the guy who is best on Letterman. We need a man with an economic plan,\" he says. \"Mitt Romney is that man.\"</p> <p>The Guardian came to Boston, the capital of Romney's home state, to examine his economic plan as the year-long election battle enters its final stage. With growth, jobs and the deficit likely to be crucial in deciding the election, our series will move on to West Virginia to look at poverty and inequality \u2013 one of the biggest issues facing the US and yet barely mentioned directly by the candidates \u2013 and then to North Carolina to investigate the relationship between Barack Obama's stewardship of the economy and his struggle to rekindle the hope of 2008.</p> <p>Obama inherited the deepest economic slump since the great depression when he was elected in 2008. He has presided over the weakest recovery since the second world war. The slow, unsteady pace of recovery has allowed Romney to lambast Obama for his lack of a growth strategy. \"The president doesn't have a plan. I do,\" Romney said on the stump in Virginia this week.</p> <p>Romney's blueprint has five major themes: a $4.8tn tax cut spread over the next 10 years; a proposal to cut government spending to less than 20% of national output; energy self-sufficiency; better schools; and a tougher approach to America's trade relations with China.</p> <p>Many economists are sceptical about the plan. They doubt the sincerity of anti-Beijing rhetoric, given that China owns one third of the bonds sold by the US to finance its debts. Many believe that Romney's energy self-sufficiency means ripping up environmental safeguards in favour of big oil.</p> <p>But most significantly, few but the most avid supply-siders think that big tax cuts aimed primarily at the better-off is the answer to America's growing debt problem. Most in fact think the combination of tax breaks for the wealthy combined with austerity for everybody else will make the problem worse.</p> <p>Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the IMF and now a professor at MIT in Cambridge, said the tax-cutting approach was tried by the previous Republican president, George Bush. \"It didn't work then and it won't work now,\" he said. Robert Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, said Romney's approach defied every textbook ever written, and if the lion's share of tax cuts went to the better-off, they would tend to save rather than spend the windfall.</p> <p>Sotell disagrees. He says the debate on taxes is a sideshow, and the president has declared \"class war\" on high earners for political gain. America is paralyzed, says Sotell. Business leaders hold billions on the sidelines fearing what Obama will do to taxes, regulation and the cost of his landmark \"Obamacare\" legislation. Further down the road the US faces a demographic time-bomb: baby-boomers are retiring and expect benefits that the US can no longer afford.</p> <p>\"And what's Obama talking about? Millionaires and billionaires not paying enough tax. That's not going to solve the problem,\" he says. \"We owe $16tn; we added another trillion this year. If you tax the top group another $100bn, how does that offset anything?\"</p> <p>For Sotell, Romney showed an ability to compromise with a largely Democratic legislature when he was governor of Massachusetts. Obama has sown nothing but discord, he argues. Romney is a man with a proven track record in finance and a man who, like Sotell, believes economic growth is driven by private enterprise and not government spending.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that Romney's message may now be reaching more ears. But Bruce Stokes of the Pew Research Center says the outlook for either candidate is far from certain. \"If Obama is going to win, it's despite all the economic numbers. Despite the fact that some of the swing states voters think Romney would do a better job,\" he says.</p> <p>And philosophy aside, Romney's plan is \"wafer thin\", according to Kevin Gallagher, director of the global development programme at Boston University. \"He doesn't have a sophisticated plan to put to the Office of Management and Budget to be costed. Even Bush did that.</p> <p>\"An independent thinktank has tried a simulation, and it found that the plan doesn't add up. It would increase the deficit by $400bn a year. Romney says that would be filled by closing tax loopholes \u2013 but without specifying exactly how.\"</p> <p>What both sides do agree upon is the scale of the problem ahead. Whoever wins the election will face immediate and tough decisions to take on the deficit. Under the compromise reached between the White House and Congress in the summer of 2011, tax breaks will expire and spending will be cut in January 2013. These will be worth 4% of US GDP \u2013 enough to tip not just the US but the entire global economy back into recession, according to the IMF this week.</p> <p>Gallagher says Romney's experiment with the sort of austerity policies being pursued in Europe risks leading to lower growth, higher unemployment and rising national debt. Romney's supporters say that cutting spending will pave the way for lower taxes. Entrepreneurs will respond by growing their businesses and hiring more workers.</p> <p>In the warehouses of south Boston's burgeoning innovation district, there's a different take on the economic battle. Tom Pincince, president of Digital Lumens, a hi-tech Boston business making energy-efficient lighting, says the political bickering is among the biggest problems his business faces. Growth is already great for the firm \u2013 not least because they promise to slash lighting bills to the bone. But customers are nervous.</p> <p>He dismisses the idea that tax cuts add jobs. \"I am not going to hire more people because my taxes are cut,\" Pincince said. \"I will hire more people if my business is doing well.\" What annoys him is all the political infighting. He says government's first job should be to create an environment where customers feel confident enough to spend more money. Romney has just two more weeks to convince America that he is the man for that job.</p>",
  "<p>I'm often troubled by Paul Dacre's grasp on reality. On Thursday, reading his paper's leader while flying to Finland, I was exasperated by not being able to write this response to his rant sooner.</p> <p>But even in the cold light of day here in my Helsinki hotel, I am amazed at the illogicality of the Daily Mail's leading article: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2215946/Jimmy-Savile-BBC-inquiry-Lord-Leveson-look-cesspit.html\" title=\"\">\"Lord Leveson must reopen his inquiry to look into the cesspit at the BBC (but don't hold your breath)\"</a>.</p> <p>This nonsense unites two of Dacre's pet hates (and he has plenty of those) \u2013 the Leveson inquiry and the BBC.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/video/2012/feb/09/dacre-leveson-inquiry-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">His dislike for Lord Justice Leveson was evident in the manner of his two appearances before the inquiry</a> and his contribution at the seminar before it. He cannot bear to be questioned about his paper's content and its news-gathering techniques.</p> <p>He finds it unacceptable to have to justify stories as being in the public interest, despite his being the chairman of the committee that oversees the editors' code in which that very concept is enshrined.</p> <p>His long-held contempt for the BBC is down to his lack of regard for the concept of public service broadcasting. He finds it elitist, middle class and patronising.</p> <p>He also detests the way in which the corporation's journalists and interviewers occasionally hold the Mail up to scrutiny.</p> <p>As if that twin agenda isn't enough, he also happens to loathe celebrities, the very people his paper lives off. And he reserves a special disgust for celebs who dare to answer back.</p> <p>In the light of all that, what should we make of that tirade? Firstly, there is no obvious similarity between the behaviour of tabloid newspapers over their content and methodology and the fact that Jimmy Savile happened to work at the BBC while being guilty of abusing children.</p> <p>To suggest that the BBC \"condoned\" it \u2013 which is the implication of the Mail's intemperate editorial \u2013 is utterly disgraceful. There isn't a shred of evidence to show that to be the case. An inquiry might prove otherwise but let's wait for the results before making accusations.</p> <p>Secondly, it's a bit rich for any newspaper, when considering the Savile affair, to blame others for failing to bring it to public attention. That is as true of the Mail as everyone else. Where was the Mail when the rumours were flying around? Didn't their intrepid journalists come up short too?</p> <p>I don't blame them if they did. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/oct/10/jimmy-savile-bbc\" title=\"\">As I said on Wednesday</a>, we all must share some of the guilt for failing to expose Savile. He was cunning enough to keep the BBC and newspapers at bay.</p> <p>No-one can really believe that the BBC hierarchy knew about Savile's activities and turned a blind eye. Even the people with BBC connections who spoke on the ITV Exposure documentary admitted to not having made formal complaints.</p> <p>I do agree with the Mail that the BBC director general, George Entwistle, was slow to act once the story came to light. I also agree that the reason for the dropping of the Newsnight segment is less than acceptable.</p> <p>But the Mail goes way beyond that in different territory. For example, it wants us to believe that the News of the World closure ends the phone-hacking drama, ignoring the weight of evidence to Leveson about serial misdemeanours by other newspapers (not least the hiring of private investigators to obtain confidential information).</p> <p>Similarly, it appears to downplay the seriousness of the allegations against every journalist arrested in relation to phone hacking and other potentially illegal activity in advance of hearing the evidence against them, describing it as \"a footling matter\". They may well be innocent, but does law 'n' order Mail think it right to ignore illegality as long as journalists are the offenders?</p> <p>Sure, there was a mistake in the original story about the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone. The Guardian accepts it was very unlikely that the News of the World were responsible for deleting the messages.</p> <p>But the incident itself \u2013 the interception of her voicemail messages \u2013 was a crime. And are we supposed to ignore the hundreds of other examples of hacking, some settled while others proceed through the courts?</p> <p>The Leveson inquiry was valuable because it showed that hacking was not the only example of journalistic misbehaviour. It exposed a wealth of detail about the way in which newspapers had become far too high-handed.</p> <p>Thursday's Mail editorial shows that Dacre has not taken that lesson on board. Indeed, it's an example of his own high-handedness, which also happens to inform the way his journalists go about their business.</p> <p>Finally, of course, it is becoming obvious that this leading article forms part of a campaign against Leveson. <a href=\"http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2012/no3_greenslade\" title=\"\">In my latest British Journalism Review article</a>, \"Report in danger of gathering dust\", I forecast that Leveson would find himself amidst a media freezing frenzy once he released his report. I was wrong. It has started in advance of publication.</p> <p>The aim is to ensure that the status quo, self-regulation in the style of the Press Complaints Commission, survives with a few knobs on. PCC-Plus was always the aim of the tabloid end of the industry. This is but one blow in what looks set to be a bloody campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) believes it is important to carry out regular and focused legal training for its editorial staff. Historically, the editorial legal department has provided regular training sessions for editorial staff on all aspects of media law and the multifarious legal and ethical issues arising from the obtaining and publishing of information. </p> <p>It has become even more important, following the revelations about phone hacking, that journalists are fully aware of their obligations under codes such as the Guardian's editorial policy and the PCC's Editors' Code of Practice, as well as the requirements of the civil and criminal law. &#xa0;</p> <p>In July 2011, the prime minister announced a two-part inquiry led by Lord Justice Leveson, the first part of which is to inquire into the culture, practices, and ethics of the press, with a view to making recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance consistent with maintaining freedom of the press and ensuring the highest ethical and professional standards. </p> <p>Leveson opened the hearings on 14 November 2011, saying: \"The press provides an essential check on all aspects of public life. That is why any failure within the media affects all of us. At the heart of this inquiry, therefore, may be one simple question: who guards the guardians?\" </p> <p>The inquiry has already exposed some bad journalistic practices. It is even more vital now that we do our best to make sure that all our editorial staff are committed to acting ethically and within the law, while also ensuring that they have the confidence to undertake genuine investigative journalism. </p> <p>In the past year, members of the editorial legal department, in conjunction with GNM editorial staff, have run training sessions for editorial staff&#xa0;on topics ranging from the Bribery Act to using the Freedom of Information Act.</p> <p>There have also been workshops on the use of sources \u2013 on, for example, protecting them and the use of anonymous sources \u2013 and substantiation, looking at issues around verification and accuracy.</p> <p>Given our move to become a digital first company, the department has also run sessions on user-generated content, including what is meant by \"publication\", s.1 of the Defamation Act and the E-commerce Regulations.</p> <p>There have been regular refresher sessions on libel and privacy, and contempt and court reporting. We have also had an external speaker in to talk about crime and the media, looking at some of the criminal offences affecting media, in particular terrorism and phone tapping.&#xa0; </p> <p>Beyond workshops, the editorial legal department circulates legal warning notices whenever we receive them; for example, where reporting restrictions are brought to our attention, or when the PCC send out a warning notice. </p> <p>Since 2009, we have emailed a weekly newsletter to all GNM editorial staff, summarising the main legal issues of interest to have arisen in the week. It also lists significant legal cases and summarises any complaints that we have received.</p>",
  "<p>A remote-controlled baby grand piano, suspended like the fob watch of some giant hypnotist, swings in the gloom. Richard D James, crouched under a bank of digital equipment, performs unseen midi manipulations, and the piano-pendulum responds with mutating variations on a melody that hangs over the muffled creaking of this hallucinatory metronome. The effect is one of remarkable grace and beauty.</p> <p>An early version of James's \"remote control orchestra\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dph-bkJL_wM\" title=\"\">premiered last September in Poland</a>, but this is its first visit to the UK. The concept is simple: a giant screen displays a mixing board, with coloured sliders that correspond to different orchestra sections. Other bars represent tone and pitch \u2013 and all of it is under James's control. A 28-piece string section and 12-strong choir face the screen and respond to the moving sliders, while also receiving instructions via headphones.</p> <p>James toys with the musicians, modifying the pitch or volume in ominous washes that recall Ligeti or Jonny Greenwood's soundtrack to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HjWIr80ln4\" title=\"\">There Will Be Blood</a>, only to throw the sliders violently, producing spasms of music that whoop like a troupe of monkeys, or resolve into harmonies of disturbing zeal. James has invented a new instrument on which to improvise \u2013 a live orchestra.</p> <p>A third invention is just as breathtaking. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVMEeKHZ88E\" title=\"\">Interactive Tuned Feedback Pendulum Array</a> is a riff on a Steve Reich \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_music\" title=\"\">process music</a>\" piece, in which pendulums oscillate over speakers to create phased feedback. A dozen pendulums, massive versions of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle\" title=\"\">Newton's cradle toy</a> that sat on so many executive desks in the 80s, swing in choreographed motion, and glittering green laser beams shatter off them. James \"jams\" against the bass patterns, generating moans and squeals like frightened cranes. As the pendulums slow, the laser filaments bob like webs of breathing electronic silk, and the music becomes an eerie moan. James doesn't use a single drumbeat, but somewhere, humpback whales are throwing shapes on the dancefloor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\"class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){ varjs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Never have the principles of self regulation practised by the Guardian readers' editor's office been tested so robustly as in this past year, both practically and theoretically.</p> <p>There were 2,570 more emails call and letters than the year before \u2013 a total of 28,464 between April 2011 and March 2012. Following the Guardian's Milly Dowler story on 4 July relating to phone hacking, and the appointment of Lord Justice Leveson to conduct an inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, pressure intensified on our work. This also led to a new public prominence and focus on the role.</p> <p>After the updating of the Guardian's editorial guidelines in August 2011, the new Accuracy and Standards page was launched in October \u2013 later than we had hoped at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>In all, seven of the eight recommended changes endorsed by <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/\">the Scott Trust</a> in early 2011 have been put in place, including an online rolling corrections column. This enables corrections and clarifications to be posted in the kind of time frame the web now demands \u2013 during the hours the office is open. It does not resolve the issue of increasing pressure to post corrections at any time, seven days a week.</p> <p>The one initiative planned for 2011 that hasn't been fully implemented is a wider distribution of the deletions policy. There are a number of reasons. Among them was the broader pressure of work that slowed all the changes to the readers' editor's office. </p> <p>In addition, the European Data Protection Framework was due to be published, and there was some concern in the draft regulations leaked in December that there would be no journalistic exemptions for \"the right to be forgotten\". In early 2012, journalists were assured that this is not the case, but the Guardian's deletions procedure will need to be reviewed against the broad principles of the new policy. The numbers of requests for deletion just keep growing.</p> <p>Of the 31 complaints to the PCC about the Guardian in 2011, 10 were from those dissatisfied by the responses of the readers' editor's office; of these, nine were either rejected or resolved without adjudication.</p> <p>One of the most serious was the case of Mark Duggan, the young man whose shooting triggered the English riots in August. The Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Metropolitan Police complained to the PCC about a headline and subheading on a Guardian front-page story on Friday 18 November 2011. The headline and subheading were misleading and it took too long \u2013 21 hours \u2013 before these headings were amended on the website on the Saturday. </p> <p>The IPCC agreed to suspend its PCC complaint to enable me to investigate. We apologised \u2013 both for the misleading headlines and the length of time it took to change the headline \u2013 in print, in the usual corrections and clarifications position on the leaders page, and online. In addition, I wrote an Open Door column explaining how the errors were made and apologised once more. </p> <p>The IPCC, along with the Met, felt that didn't go far enough and pursued complaints to the PCC. The PCC found that the paper's headline and subheading were misleading, but its apology and corrections were sufficient. </p> <p>In what was an important test of the work of the readers' editor's office in a year when I was called to give evidence before the Leveson Inquiry, the PCC said in it its adjudication:</p> <p>\"The Commission considered the adequacy of the remedy the newspaper had provided.</p> <p>\"The newspaper's initial delay in recognising the problem was a matter of regret: had it taken full account of the IPCC's concerns on the evening of 18 November, it would evidently have been in a position to revise the main headline online and in at least some print editions of the newspaper.<br>Nonetheless, once the newspaper had recognised its error, it reacted quickly to put it right, in accordance with the terms of Clause 1 (ii) of the Code. Given the sensitivity of the issue, its apology was also appropriate.</p> <p>\"In dealing with the complaint, it was the role of the PCC to give external scrutiny to the newspaper's internal processes, including on this occasion the work of its Readers' Editor. It established that the newspaper had initially breached the Editors' Code but had properly fulfilled its obligations under Clause 1 (ii) of the Code to provide a remedy...\"</p>",

The challenges of global warming and energy and water shortages mean that carrying on with business as usual, with the same predominantly male leaders, is not an option.</p> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business held a live discussion, in association with <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco</a>, to explore the role of women leaders in sustainability by focusing on the barriers facing women in business, why female leadership is vital to sustainability and the role all stakeholders have in enhancing gender equality in business.</p> <p>The panel assembled to tackle these issues included: Dianne Dillon-Ridgley, environmentalist and human rights activist on the board of directors at carpet manufacturer Interface; Anna Lapp\u00e9, co-founder of the Small Planet Fund and director of the Real Food Media Project; Judi Marshall, professor of leadership and learning at Lancaster University Management School; Karen Flanders, sustainability practice leader at Wisdom Works Group; Dr Kathy Dhanda, associate professor in the department of management at Dreihaus College of Business at DePaul University.</p> <p>Over two hours, the debate covered the following topics:</p> <p><strong>The need to do things differently</strong></p> <p>Kicking off the debate was the need for female leaders to be at the forefront of innovation within sustainability. Erin Meezan, vice president of Interface, explained that: \"I think women will play an increasingly important role in making the organisational change needed to guide at least the corporate world, if not the world in general\".</p> <p>She explained that this could herald a move towards a new way of doing business that is more collaborative, more community centred and more partnership focused. This, said Meezan, would be a truly stakeholder approach to business.</p> <p>Marshall agreed that this should be the way forward, saying \"I think sustainability has to be a society-level notion \u2013 and practice \u2013 and so people who can think of the wider setting and its needs have much to offer.\"</p> <p><strong>Why do men have all the positions of power?</strong></p> <p>The debate really hotted up with a question from Carmen Alvarez, a Spanish reader, asking why we allow so many men into top jobs in top companies when they \"make decisions without including, listening to and, most importantly, respecting women\". Why, in essence, do we still put up with this macho culture, asked Alvarez.</p> <p>Anna Lapp\u00e9, writing from Boulder, Colorado, responded by saying: \"I wouldn't say that we *allow* men to have so much power, I think that the power imbalance in so many workplaces has to do with a policy culture that makes it very hard for women to gain power, especially in corporations.\"</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 outlined the need for workplace policies that allow people, including men, to balance work and home life. \"Here, you're considered VERY fortunate if you can get even three months maternity\", she wrote.</p> <p>The current risk-averse context of business was also raised by Marshall. The radical change needed is considered too scary and so people look to those with mainstream credentials as leaders, she suggested \u2013 \"and this has traditionally not been many women.\" She name-checked Ray Anderson, the leader of Interface and early sustainability pioneer, as the type of leader that industry still seems more comfortable with.</p> <p>However, Marshall admitted to being perplexed by the ongoing issue of gender imbalance in leadership positions, calling it a \"thorny issue\" that has persisted in several areas since the 1970s without any great strides being made.</p> <p><strong>Women are more affected by sustainability issues</strong></p> <p>While the panellists largely agreed that stressing the differences between genders was often an unproductive part of the debate, there was also a recognition that sustainability issues can have a greater impact on women than men, especially among the world's poor.</p> <p>Dhanda asked fellow contributors: \"Can the case be made that climate change and poor environmental management impacts the world's poor more and in these cases, the burden falls more heavily on women?\" She quoted the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva as saying that most farmers in India are women and that more women are responsible for feeding families than men.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 added that women, especially south of the equator, disproportionately bore the brunt of environmental devastation. Small-scale farmers produced 70% of what the world eats and most of those farmers were women, said Lapp\u00e9. A contributor from the University of Nottingham, genderCSR, also pointed out that women were more likely to be poor and therefore experience inequalities of opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Making the business case for change</strong></p> <p>It can seem striking that a business case still needs to be made for female leaders, but the glacial pace of change in the make-up of board rooms suggests that it does. Meezan stated that this was a business issue, not a diversity issue: \"I think filling sustainability positions has driven some of this for businesses \u2013 it often requires finding a 'different' person and that requires looking at what they can do \u2013 not what their role will be.\" The hiring process was increasingly recognising the need to collaborate and communicate across a wide geography of stakeholders, in some cases over and above technical background, said Meezan.</p> <p>The need for corporate role models and trend setters is clear, and Flanders pointed to action taking place at The Coca-Cola Company where the chairman and CEO \"has made the rise of women's economic and social empowerment in the coming decade and its impact on the global economy, business strategy and sustainability efforts a top priority\".</p> <p>Dhanda added that Joe Folkman, president of Zenger Folkman, noted that \"while men excel in the technical and strategic arenas, women clearly have the advantage in the extremely important areas of people relationships and communication\". This, his research concluded, \"suggests that by adding more women the overall effectiveness of the leadership team would go up\".</p> <p>Meanwhile some parts of the world, namely Scandinavia, were much further ahead when it came to female business leaders, said Dillon-Ridgley. Norway, she said, now requires a 60/40 ratio minimum of board directors. At first there was resistance, but eventually it had become the norm, she said.</p> <p>\"There was much 'hue and cry' but ... they [now] lead the world in gender 'balance' on government legislative bodies as well as heads of government.\"</p> <p>Dillon-Ridgley added: \"From all our comments ... there is clearly not a lack of women's talent.\"</p> <p><em>To read the full discussion, please click </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/women-leaders-sustainability-csr-live-discussion?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Tim Smedley is a freelance features writer for national newspapers and magazines, specialising in work, sustainability and social issues</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Home Office ministers tried to persuade the Jordanian government to grant the terrorist suspect Abu Qatada a pardon so that he could be deported from the UK, an immigration tribunal has heard.</p> <p>The act of clemency would have cleared the way for him to be retried for two bomb attacks in Jordan without relying on evidence extracted under torture from alleged co-conspirators.</p> <p>After the then security minister, James Brokenshire, was told this was not possible, UK officials continued research into when the King of Jordan could issue a pardon. Details of the government's increasingly inventive attempts to remove Abu Qatada, 52, emerged on the second day of his appeal against deportation at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) in London.</p> <p>Other UK requests \u2013 for the Jordanian courts to rule on the admissibility of the evidence and to give an undertaking not to bring evidence obtained through torture \u2013 were also refused, Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, revealed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/10/abu-qatada-extradition\" title=\"\">Siac is hearing Abu Qatada's appeal</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/abu-qatada-deportation-blocked-european\" title=\"\">Europe's human rights judges ruled</a> that he could not be deported while there was a \"real risk that evidence obtained by torture will be used against him\".</p> <p>The government has been seeking assurances from Jordan that Abu Qatada, who a judge once described as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, will not be tried on the basis of evidence obtained through torture.</p> <p>Layden revealed details of the talks which took place in a meeting in Jordan on 14 February. Under cross-examination by Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Abu Qatada, he said: \"I think the question of a pardon had been asked earlier and Brokenshire was asking for an answer.\"</p> <p>The pardon was being sought because the evidence used in convicting Abu Qatada in his absence was \"granted by torture\", Layden agreed, saying he had not referred to government assurances because it was a matter for the prosecutors and the courts. Asked whether torture was widespread and routine in Jordan, Layden replied: \"Matters have improved. It's still my view that torture may take place in Jordan and we have to proceed on the basis that it does.\"</p> <p>\"Political pressure\" was put on Home Office and Foreign Office lawyers to secure assurances that Abu Qatada could be deported, he said. Ministerial advisers asked UK officials to ensure that \"minimum requirements\" were met to enable his removal.</p> <p>Layden recalled a meeting in Whitehall last spring attended by Whitehall lawyers. \"There was an atmosphere of a certain amount of political pressure at the time,\" he said. The term \"minimum requirements\" had come from one of three special advisers who were present, he explained.</p> <p>Fitzgerald asked about a meeting between the home secretary, Theresa May, and the King of Jordan, at which she said the \"perception that Jordan used torture\" put about by the European court of human rights needed to be corrected.</p> <p>Layden said he had not been present but added that \"it was being put to us [that torture] was no longer representative\" of what was being done.</p> <p>Layden dismissed suggestions that Abu Qatada could, if acquitted, be subsequently arrested under a Jordanian law permitting administrative detention. But he did agree that as many as 13,000 people are believed to be in custody because they had been detained under the orders of regional governors.</p> <p>He hoped Abu Qatada would be given a trial \"sufficiently fair to discharge our responsibilities\". The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>Wendell Berry doesn't come to New York very often. The 78-year-old lives in Kentucky, where his family has farmed for five generations.</p> <p>When he flies to the city next week, it's to collect a <a href=\"http://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/jbf-names-2012-leadership-award-recipients\">Leadership Award from the James Beard Foundation</a> for over half a century of campaigning for better methods of food production. During his career, Berry has <a href=\"http://wfpl.org/post/wendell-berry-stresses-relationship-land-national-lecture\">demonstrated against</a> everything from Vietnam to nuclear power, from mountain-top coal mining to the death penalty. Most famously, he has campaigned against what he sees as bad farming methods, particularly industrialized farming.</p> <p>\"I'm a writer more than I am a talker,\" he says when I call him prior to his trip. In a life of extraordinary productivity, as well as his campaigning, Berry has authored <a href=\"http://www.wendellberrybooks.com/\">more than 40 books</a> of fiction, poetry and essays \u2013 he is most frequently compared to William Faulkner. And, in 2010, he <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110302/NEWS01/303020109/Wendell-Berry-receives-humanities-medal-from-Obama\">received</a> the National Humanities Medal.</p> <p>Berry is still a committed activist, arguing these days for a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05berry.html\">50-Year Farm Bill</a> to address such deeply unfashionable issues as soil degradation and sustainable agriculture. Here are some of his thoughts on the state of the environment, and how the US, at any given moment, is nearer to a food crisis than most people imagine.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Did you see Roger Cohen's very hostile <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/opinion/roger-cohen-the-organic-fable.html\">New York Times op-ed </a>piece about organic food last month?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> He called it the \"the romantic back-to-nature obsession of an upper middle class able to afford it.\" I'd love to know your response to that.</p> <p><strong>WB</strong>: All right. Well, organic has never been a word I have willingly used. My label is just \"good farming\", which isn't something you can put on a t-shirt. My objection to organic is that it has always been defined negatively. That is, in terms of things that you don't do. And I think good agriculture is always going to be defined in terms of things you do do: you make the farm provide as much of its own fertility and operating energy as you can.</p> <p>If you have an organic monoculture of several thousand acres, as I think some California vineyards have, and you're importing all of the fertility, then that's not good farming. I don't care how organic it is.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> And the accusation of elitism?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> That calls for a lot of careful criticism. If we can't afford to take good care of the land that feeds us, we're in an insurmountable mess. And at present, we're not affording it. Cheap food is a great accomplishment of industrialization, but I think <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=K9ea3Ebv7LkC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Michael+Pollan+While+it+is+true+that+many+people+simply+can%27t+afford+to+pay+more+for+food,+either+in+money+or+time+or+both,+many+more+of+us+can&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wjs-wKBr9s&amp;sig=ebStrQ6o73NozuxpaW0-F4KJaM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YDh0UPPrJqmJ0AXulYGYCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%20Pollan%20While%20it%20is%20true%20that%20many%20people%20simply%20can%27t%20afford%20to%20pay%20more%20for%20food%2C%20either%20in%20money%20or%20time%20or%20both%2C%20many%20more%20of%20us%20can&amp;f=false\">Michael Pollan</a> makes a very good point: that if people eat healthy food, they will save enough to compensate for the food price being healthier and spending less on healthcare, so-called. For people just to wave good agriculture away as something only an elite can afford \u2013 as if it were some kind of a prissy fashion \u2013 is just missing the whole point.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> That's how the organic movement came to be regarded by its critics: as a lifestyle choice.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Industrialization advances on the same theme. If you don't have the latest technology, you're out of it. It's largely fashion. The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> How do you get consumers to give more thought to what they're buying in the supermarket? At the end of a long day, that can be a tough sell.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> They think the way they breathe: they just take in whatever's handiest. Well, this effort I've been involved in all these years has a couple of questions hanging over it. So, you know there's not a mountainous pile of food anywhere that people can draw on if production fails for some reason? Food has to be kept coming; it's more analogous to the flow of blood in our body than to a large bank account that can be drawn upon in an emergency, or an insurance policy. It has to be kept coming. We know how quickly famine could happen in the cities, where people are helpless to do anything for themselves.</p> <p>Look at Phoenix, for instance; a large city in the desert where all the things they need are going to have to be trucked to them. Suppose that became difficult or impossible? People can be persuaded very quickly if there are shortages. Hunger is a powerful persuader if it happens, and it's conceivable that it could happen. Country people have always known this.</p> <p>I'm not exactly dodging your question on how do you persuade consumers: I'm saying that people are persuadable. Persuasion works. Whether it's working fast enough, we don't know. We have to do it because we know it's right.</p> <p>I tell the young: you can't get into this on the assumption that you're going to win, even in your lifetime. You have to get into it because you know it's right and have all the fun you can while you work.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> You can actually envisage severe food shortages occurring in this country? Because farming methods are exhausting the resources?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Yes. People sit around out here in the country and say, what are people going to eat? There's a letter in my local newspaper this morning from a dairy farmer's wife, writing in to say what do people think is going to happen to us? We're buying stuff on an inflated market, and selling our milk for what we sold it four years ago. People like that find it very easy to ask: what are people going to do when we're all gone?</p> <p>We don't know what's going to happen in the future. I'm only saying that we have finite supplies from a finite acreage that we are abusing by erosion, toxicity and so on. And a finite number of producers we are abusing, and there are fewer of them all the time \u2013 fewer than 1% in this country. Their vote doesn't matter to anybody.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> What would you like the role of government to be in all of this?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> I'd like to see the subsidies to big industrial agriculture stop. The government could make soil conservation a priority, which would act as a kind of permission-giver to people to take it seriously. No one is talking about the land economy at all. The economists I read in the newspapers and magazines: it never occurs to them to speak of it.</p> <p>Paul Krugman, for instance, thinks that the economy is the same thing as the financial system. And he couldn't be more wrong. So, the first thing people have to do is examine their own economies and see how little control they have over it in terms of quantity and quality.</p> <p>The next thing is, you've got to change the standard. The industrial standards are productivity and profitability. And people like <a href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/research/polly_walker_fund/\">Sir Albert Howard</a> [English botanist and organic farming pioneer], J Russell Smith and Liberty Hyde Bailey said, on good scientific grounds, that the standard has to be ecological. The standard has to be health. To put it in more practical terms: you have to use the land in a way that doesn't do more permanent damage to the local ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>EB: </strong>I think that, for many, the assumption is that the only way to provide enough food for a country this size is through industrial methods.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> But that's exploiting ignorance. Plus, you have the reluctance of the genetic engineers to label food. They need people to be ignorant.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> How would you change labeling laws in the US?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> If a manufactured food or even a singular food product has genetic engineering involved in its production, then there ought to be a label that says so. That's not too hard. There's a terrific fight in this country to keep that from happening. And this is simply an acknowledgement that we want the consumer to be ignorant.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Has Obama had a sympathetic ear to these arguments?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Well, in the political climate that we now have, nobody is going to put soil conservation or the land economy at the top of their list. If Obama did that now, he'd go down as a kook. He could do it if he gets elected again. But what we need is politicians who are willing to educate the public, even at the cost of losing an election.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Has Michelle Obama's White House garden had some symbolic value?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Oh, yes, I think that has some symbolic value and some force. She's given that conversation a public status that it didn't have before. She's helped. There's no question of that. That little old garden up there on the White House lawn has some authentic historical significance, probably. She's come out for physical health. She can do that because she's not running for office. I imagine her husband has to distance himself from that.</p> <p>We wrap up the conversation and I ask Berry for his email address, to which he replies, \"I don't have a computer. I have a solar collector; three panels,\" and laughs loudly.</p> <p>He is honoured to be receiving the James Beard Foundation award, he says, but the city can be a chore. He really does prefer to go his own way.</p> <p>\"I can't hear,\" he says, \"in the midst of a crowd.\"</p>",
  "<p>Discovery of oil off the southwest cost of Ireland has prompted talk of it being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/irish-oil-find-bigger-providence-resources\" title=\"\">great news for the Irish economy</a>. It could certainly do with some. But the announcement that known oil reserves are commercially recoverable is unlikely to offer any great boon to the economy as a whole. There may be a bonanza, but it will be only for a small coterie of Irish banking, property and oil tycoons who continue to benefit from the state's largesse while most of the population struggles in the fifth consecutive year of economic slump.</p> <p>There is a long history of pillage of Ireland's natural resources, beginning with England's deforestation of the country for its navy. More recently, domestic politicians have continued that trend. The disgraced former energy minister <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0124/burker.html\" title=\"\">Ray Burke</a> was in office when Fianna F\u00e1il granted extraordinarily favourable oil exploration licences to oil companies. The former head of Enterprise Energy Ireland, Brian O'Cathain, is reported to have said that some oil developers, such as Shell, will pay no royalties at all for the lucrative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrib_gas_project\" title=\"\">Corrib field</a>, worth up to \u20ac10bn, and elected representatives have called on the current Fine Gael/Labour party coalition government to <a href=\"http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/38146/opposition-tds-demand-reversal-of-corrib-gas-pipeline-consents\" title=\"\">reverse the deal</a>, so far without success.</p> <p>The troika of EU, IMF and European Central Bank have insisted that Irish taxpayers bail out bondholders in failed Irish banks even while the domestic economy continues to contract. The domestic troika, Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour, continue to insist there is no alternative.</p> <p>Providence Resources, which made the recent announcement about the oil reserves, also benefits from exceptionally low tax rates and the facility to write any exploration costs against tax. It is like being reimbursed for buying lottery tickets until one or more is a winner. Except that finding oil in Ireland's offshore has long been a certainty, and the elevated price of oil now makes <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443749204578047842645557974.html\" title=\"\">exploration highly profitable</a>.</p> <p>The chief executive of Providence, Tony O'Reilly Jr, explicitly hopes to emulate the British experience. This seems unlikely for two reasons. The tax rates for North Sea oil at the time of commercial exploitation ranged from 50% to 75%, and the major oil companies in Britain, such as BP, also owned \"downstream\" businesses of refining and selling oil commercially, which protected them against fluctuations in the oil price. In contrast, without the necessary investment in refineries, the virtually untaxed developers in Irish waters <a href=\"http://irishoilandgas.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/oreilly/#more-521\" title=\"\">may not even bring the oil onshore to Ireland</a>.</p> <p>But the North Sea oil boom under Thatcher is hardly a model of sustainable growth. Then, government oil revenues allowed an earlier version of austerity (then labelled \"monetarism\") to be followed by tax cuts and the profligacy of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_Boom\" title=\"\">Lawson boom</a>\". Now that Britain is once more an oil importer, latter-day Thatcherites who imagine the Tory triumphs of the 1980s can be repeated are living in a fantasy. There is no positive legacy for Britain of the North Sea oil boom.</p> <p>This week's events show another model is possible. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/hugo-chavez-election-press-conference\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's victory</a> marks him as one of the few leaders anywhere to be re-elected since the global economic crisis began. Venezuela has had very large oil revenues for decades, but only since his government took control of the industry, away from foreign multinationals and local oligarchs, has the wealth it creates been distributed among the population. Unlike Ireland, and all the countries implementing \"austerity\", poverty in Venezuela is declining, healthcare and education improving and the economy is growing. If Ireland is to benefit from an oil boom it needs to look to Ch\u00e1vez, not to Thatcher.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of poor Indian farmers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/02/india-landless-march-justice-in-pictures\" title=\"\">marching on Delhi to press their right to land</a> have called off their protest after the government bowed to some of their demands.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/rural-india-march-delhi-landless-poor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">60,000 marchers, mainly socially marginalised dalits and tribal people, began the 350km march from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh to Delhi last week</a>, on the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth, inspired by the independence leader's own tactics. They were due to reach the capital this month.</p> <p>The mass protest was called off on Thursday after Jairam Ramesh, the rural development minister, signed a 10-point plan in front of marchers at Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Marchers had been demanding legislation to deal with the speedy resolution of land disputes, which involves fast-tracking such cases through courts. In what marchers considered a key concession, the government has agreed to establish a taskforce to review existing programmes and \"take concrete action\".</p> <p>The taskforce is due to meet next week to prepare a roadmap for land reform in India. PV Rajagopal, the veteran activist who organised the <em>yatra</em> (pilgrimage), warned that if there was no draft legislation in six months to meet the demands, the marchers would resume their protest from where they left off but, instead of 60,000, there would be 100,000.</p> <p>The march was organised by <a href=\"http://www.ektaparishad.com/\" title=\"\">Ekta Parishad</a>, a social movement working on land rights, which mobilised 2,000 civil society groups around the country to provide marchers. \"This year's march built on the successes of one held previously [in 2007] when the national land reform committee was established, but they never met to put an agenda in place,\" said Anand Kumar, country manager in India for Christian Aid, which works with Ekta Parishad.</p> <p>\"This time these negotiations must continue between the government and organisations working with the landless poor. Institutional arrangements must be put in place, and sufficient time and resources allocated to put this agreement into action. Access to land is critical for the eradication of poverty. We hope that today's success will give hope and inspire other land struggles in other parts of the world.\"</p> <p>Before the march Rajagopal had told the Guardian that his intention was not to \"pressurise\" the government. \"The government have gone out of track and need to be brought back. The government should intervene as a referee between poor people and industrialists [who want their land]. Currently I have a problem with the way the government behaves,\" he said.</p> <p>Marchers had said they would \"go to Delhi\" and remain there until their demands had been met. The demonstration was a serious concern for the ruling Congress party, which has long drawn support from the rural poor. Their votes will be crucial in elections due in 2014. Ramesh travelled to Gwalior in a bid to persuade the marchers to abandon their plans.</p> <p>One issue for the Congress party is that the vast flagship subsidy programmes designed to ensure basic levels of nutrition and employment among India's very poor \u2013 and to gain their votes \u2013 are riddled with graft and inefficiency. Hugely expensive, these programmes often fail to reach the most needy.</p> <p>A key problem is documentation. \"We want proper deeds. We have cleared the land, we have worked it. It should be ours,\" said Amini Narayan, an activist from the southern state of Kerala. New legislation aiming to simplify the complex and archaic land laws in India, and ensure fairer compensation for those displaced by new infrastructure projects or industry, has been stuck in parliament and is unlikely to be passed soon.</p>",

Gulati extended Bradley's deal. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-wEuk85OV8\">a second consecutive Gold Cup final flop against Mexico</a> was the death knell. Suddenly, the dude who was too good for us re-entered the picture. So did hurt feelings. This time <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/sports/soccer/klinsmann-expresses-cautious-optimism-about-us-soccers-future.html?_r=1&amp;\">Klinsmann accepted the job</a>. Still, fans' self-doubt and anger lingered. Sometimes emotions cloud the view.</p> <p>The biggest practical question, as always, was about players and tactics. Every USMNT fans knew that Landon Donovan, the USA's all-time leading goalscorer, and Clint Dempsey, perhaps our best ever European export, were too close to 30 for comfort. A once steady stream of nasty and physically imposing defenders had narrowed to a trickle. The US had (and has) more quality central midfielders than roster spots, but even a team of 10 Genaro Gattusos has to score to win. </p> <p>Bradley knew the US player pool in North America quite well and built a 4-4-2 counterattacking machine. He favored two holding midfielders, pushed Dempsey and Donovan to the flanks and normally didn't ask them to play too much defense. The result was up-and-down games with the feel of a yo-yo: pulled in one direction for a second, then another. The US scored goals against teams big and small, but six dedicated ball-winners left us exposed to counterattacks and counter-counterattacks.</p> <p>Enter Klinsmann. Many feared he would copy his German national-team formula, a suspiciously familiar counterattacking 4-4-2. More worrisome, he had botched the job at Bayern Munich. Skeptics believe that his failure there <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2009/04/28/bayern-show-ruthless-streak-with-klinsmann-sacking/\">exposed his tactical limitations</a>, but another take is that Bayern's ego-laden locker-room, of Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry, would be difficult for anyone. </p> <p>On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/overview.html\">Klinsmann excelled with Germany</a>, where he found a team in transition, the iconic Michael Ballack in decline, and managed to inject some confidence. If you look beyond your anger at being spurned in 2006, you'll realize he was never the coach to make that game-changing 60th-minute substitution. But he never fielded dysfunctional starting XIs. If you look past your self-doubt, you'll realize that the US, like Germany in 2005-06, offers a promising player pool which is in a bit of a divot.</p> <p>Early on, Klinsi discarded the run-and-gun 4-4-2 in favor of a tilted 4-3-1-2, although on the field, players take up spots in a 4-4-2. However, Klinsi normally selects a third holding midfielder, either Francisco Torres or Kyle Beckerman. When the team plays defense, this player shields the back line alongside Maurice Edu and Jermaine Jones. On the other flank, either Dempsey or Donovan will have light defensive duties and will be expected to move center on offense. </p> <p>Defending with seven has made the US hard to score against. The opposition creates fewer clear chances, thanks to a clogged middle. Even in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpsXXKLAZeU\">the 2-1 loss to Jamaica</a>, both Jamaican goals came from free-kicks. However, what about offense? </p> <p>Some cry for the old days of bursting down the flanks. We remember the youthful Dempsey dribbling fearlessly at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.match2\">Italy in the 2006 World Cup</a> and Donovan's bursts against Brazil in the 2009 Confederations Cup final. <a href=\"http://www.ussoccer.com/news/mens-national-team/2011/06/us-men-fall-4-2-in-2011-gold-cup-final.aspx\">The 4-2 Gold Cup loss to Mexico in 2011</a> was a hell of a game, high on entertainment, even if we lost.</p> <p>And that is why Klinsmann's tenure with the US has been successful but easily derided: if he made the overly cautious Germans fun, he has made the fun-loving Americans boring. Defenders no longer overlap with abandon or hoof the ball 60 yards \u2013 they try to pass horizontally. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxemyyWlOTI\">the second game against Jamaica</a>, the US held over 70% possession in the first half, a Barcelona-esque stat. In the forthcoming games against Antigua &amp; Barbuda (away on Friday) and Guatemala (in Kansas City on Tuesday), expect more of the same: few chances. Midfield passing. Decisive free-kicks. Possession. </p> <p>It's not the stuff dreams are made of \u2013 aside from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek0ppCL5y7M\">the Mexico away win</a>&#xa0;\u2013 but the US remains on course to qualify for Brazil 2014.</p> <p>Of course, you have the right to criticize <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/09/jozy-altidore-usmnt-roster-dropped-usa\">Klinsmann's more curious roster picks</a> and occasional substitution gaffes. Just try to do so with a level head. Remember that <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/grant_wahl/10/08/jozy-altidore-usa-world-cup/index.html\">Jozy Altidore has handled his recent selection snub better than you</a>. Klinsmann led us along in 2006, but this time he's really serious about coaching the USMNT. He's bound to start treating us right. I just know it.</p> <p><em>Elliott Turner blogs about soccer at <a href=\"http://www.futfanatico.com/\">Futfanatico.com</a><br></em></p>",

Although named after a region in the Himalayas, Jimmy Page has cited southern Morocco as the lyrical influence for the song.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>...would have to be Kashmir.

  "<p>Whatever else you make of it, you'd be&#xa0;hard-pushed to call <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/47233-check-out-bat-for-lashes-nsfw-album-cover-plus-new-video-and-new-track-laura/\" title=\"\">the cover of Natasha Khan's third album</a> anything other than striking. Shot in black and white, Khan faces the camera naked, her modesty covered by the trailing limbs of the equally naked man she's carrying over her shoulders. The most&#xa0;intriguing thing might be the expression on her face, which carries a distinct hint of FFS about it: don't you just hate it when you end up with a naked man draped over your shoulder?</p> <p>It all makes for an intriguing contrast with the way Khan presented herself on the previous<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/batforlashes\" title=\"\"> Bat for Lashes</a> albums. Gone are the horses, head-dresses, candles and hippy accessories, the stuff that could cause a passer-by to label her kooky, one of the most dispiriting adjectives in the English language. The dictionary definition is eccentric, which fits Khan just fine: if you encourage audiences at your gigs to howl in order to \"shed their humanity\" and are given to telling journalists that wearing a head-dress can \"draw the&#xa0;attention of the gods to your consciousness\", you're clearly not targeting that corner of the market that voted Aiden Grimshaw off The X Factor because they thought he was a bit too weird. But kooky has somehow ended up redolent of a ghastly, grating, self-conscious zaniness. That doesn't really fit at all with Khan's music, which is inventive and dark and sensual. The Haunted Man's predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/03/two-suns-bat-for-lashes\" title=\"\">Two Suns</a>, managed to entice a rare guest vocal out of Scott Walker, not a man you imagine has much truck with self-conscious zaniness. There's a sneaking suspicion that the way Bat for Lashes is perceived might have put people off, either because the very idea of buying an album by a kooky female singer-songwriter makes them feel a bit poorly, or because that area of their record collection is already full to bursting point: there are a lot of artists out there making with the watch-out-I'm-a-loony faces and crazy outfits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://assets.emi.com/batforlashes/guardian-player/images/\"> <iframe src=\"https://assets.emi.com/batforlashes/guardian-player/images/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"577\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> <a href=\"http://assets.emi.com/batforlashes/guardian-player/iframe/\"><strong>Reading on mobile? Listen here</strong></a>.</p> <p>Anyway, the cover matches the contents. For one thing, the peeved look and wilting companion fit with at&#xa0;least some of the words on The Haunted Man, which deal with hopeless men of varying shades of horridness: nice but pathetic amid the tick-tocking guitars of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXK0Ejzin4c\" title=\"\">All Your Gold</a>, violent and angry against the electronics of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcIv9y2xlpA\" title=\"\">A Wall</a>. For another, The Haunted Man sounds like a bold, confident album that strips away a lot of the sonic embellishments from Khan's sound. Apparently nothing could be further from the truth: it's the product of some tortuous sessions, during which Khan was beset by fears that she'd never make another album, but you'd struggle to work that out from listening to it.</p> <p>In fairness, you'd never call The Haunted Man a triumph of unadorned simplicity. The episodic title track features a strident male chorus and martial snare drums; it falls away into a&#xa0;lengthy coda of hushed burbling electronics. Among its indelible choruses, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHvqn4H9aRM\" title=\"\">Marilyn</a> contains what can only be described as an interlude comprised entirely of people shouting \"yoo-hoo!\". <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVUl9J_E7vU\" title=\"\">Oh Yeah</a> opens with a mass of sampled voices singing the title over and over again, before resolving into more straightforward synth-pop. Elsewhere, timpani is in evidence on more than one occasion. Nevertheless, it certainly feels more streamlined and sleek, more&#xa0;obviously pop-oriented than its predecessor. The studio hasn't always been Khan's friend: her 2006 debut album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/sep/08/popandrock.shopping1\" title=\"\">Fur and Gold</a>, was hobbled by an&#xa0;over-glossy production, which left&#xa0;songs that sounded visceral and gripping on stage buckling under the weight of their own varnish. But here the uncluttered approach seems to fit Khan's voice \u2013 you notice her affecting ability to suddenly switch from strident to bruised in the middle of a phrase better when it's not fighting for&#xa0;sonic space \u2013 and the material. Opener Lillies has one of those effortless melodies that sounds immediately familiar. The piano ballad Laura doesn't need colouring with anything more than a gentle shading of woodwind because it's a fantastic song, with a simple, naggingly effective piano line and a chorus irresistible enough to make its lowly placing on the singles chart seem a bit baffling.</p> <p>There are a couple of moments where you can just about make out the&#xa0;album's difficult gestation: Horses of the Sun and Rest Your Head aren't bad songs as such, but they feel slightly laboured, where the rest of The Haunted Man feels unforced. Perhaps it's the sound of someone who's worked out that less can sometimes be&#xa0;more, that not trying too hard isn't&#xa0;the same as not trying.</p>",

The president is, more generally, a declutterer. \"I tend to be a spare guy anyway,\" he has said</p> <p>Romney: Also spartan. In tune with Romney's famously neat appearance, a reporter who visited his presidential-transition office found it \"hyper-organised\" with \"no piece of paper visible on any desk\"</p> <h2>Telling detail illustrating fiercely competitive spirit</h2> <p>Obama: For his regular basketball game, often played at the court inside the FBI's offices in Washington, Obama chooses former professional players or college stars. \"If you take it easy on him, you're not invited back,\" one player, a former Florida State point-guard, was quoted as saying</p> <p>Romney: Romney family vacations are organised around the 'Romney Olympics', a structured, mandatory and highly competitive sequence of sporting events, including biking, swimming and running</p> <h2>Telling detail illustrating the limits of his fiercely competitive spirit</h2> <p>Obama: In 2010, Rey Decerega, a Washington non-profit employee, accidentally elbowed Obama in the mouth during a basketball game, causing an injury that required at least 12 stitches. He was not invited back</p> <p>Romney: Concerned that he wasn't winning sufficiently often, Romney reportedly added new contests in which he was better placed to excel \u2013 including \"who can hammer the most nails into a board in two minutes\"</p> <h2>Parenting style</h2> <p>Obama: Famously strict. Sasha and Malia are compelled to write reports about their trips, even if their teachers don't require it; Malia can only use a mobile phone on weekends, and neither girl is allowed to watch TV, except for homework purposes, during the week</p> <p>Romney: The one unbreakable rule, Romney's son Tagg recalls, is that \"we were not allowed to say anything negative about my mother\". Each night, the family held a \"freewheeling discussion\" while sitting together in a room with the lights turned out. In darkness, Tagg says, the Romneys felt they could open up</p> <h2>Height</h2> <p>Obama: 1.85m</p> <p>Romney: 1.88m. (Of the 13 presidential elections since the first televised debate, the taller candidate has won eight. Of the other five, one involved candidates of the same height, and one was Bush v Gore in 2000, in which Gore won the most votes)</p> <h2>Most damaging quote picked up by a 'hot mic'</h2> <p>Obama: \"After my election, I have more flexibility\" \u2013 to Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev, on the subject of missile defence negotiations, in South Korea in March</p> <p>Romney: \"[Ann] has Austrian Warmbloods\u2026 Me, I have a Missouri Fox Trotter. So mine is like a quarter horse, but just a much better gait. It moves very fast, and doesn't tire, and it's easy to ride, meaning it's not boom-boom-boom, it's just smooth. Very smooth\" \u2013 to Sean Hannity, before an interview on Fox News in April</p> <h2>Opinion on the \"special relationship\" with the United Kingdom<br></h2> <p>Obama: \"We don't have a stronger friend and stronger ally than Nicolas Sarkozy, and the French people.\" (In 2009, the reported assessment of a state department official was more direct: \"There's nothing special about Britain. You're just the same as the other 190 countries in the world. You shouldn't expect special treatment.\" </p> <p>Romney: \"England is just a small island. Its roads and houses are small. With few exceptions, it doesn't make things that people in the rest of the world want to buy. And if it hadn't been separated from the continent by water, it almost certainly would have been lost to Hitler's ambitions\" \u2013 from Romney's book, No Apology</p> <h2>Dog-related outrage</h2> <p>Obama: Ate dog (along with snake and grasshopper) during his childhood in Indonesia, according to Dreams From My Father. \"Say what you want about Romney, but at least he only put a dog on the roof of his car, not the roof of his mouth,\" one pro-Romney blogger wrote</p> <p>Romney: Tied a crate containing the family dog, Seamus, to the roofrack of his car for the duration of a drive from Boston to Canada. The dog \"loved\" this form of travel, Ann Romney claims</p> <h2>Healthy-eating trick</h2> <p>Obama: Spurns mayonnaise</p> <p>Romney: Eats only the tops of muffins, because, he argues, the butter sinks downwards. May also be an attempt to connect with Seinfeld fans</p> <h2>Homes owned</h2> <p>Obama: A six-bedroom mansion in Hyde Park, Chicago</p> <p>Romney: A beachfront house in La Jolla, California, described as his \"main home\"; a two-bedroom townhouse in Belmont, Massachusetts; a six-bedroom house on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire</p> <h2>Favourite TV shows, as claimed in interviews</h2> <p>Obama: The Wire, Boardwalk Empire, Homeland, Modern Family</p> <p>Romney: Modern Family, 30 Rock</p> <h2>Killer productivity tactic</h2> <p>Obama: Limits mundane choices, for example about food, to limit \"decision fatigue\" \u2013 the psychological phenomenon whereby making some decisions depletes resources for making more important ones</p> <p>Romney: At Bain Capital, fined colleagues $20 if they showed up late to meetings. He looked \"physically pained\", one remembered, when he once had to pay up himself</p> <h2>Clothing philosophy</h2> <p>Obama: Limits his choices to blue and grey suits to forestall decision fatigue (see above)</p> <p>Romney: Smart to the point that campaign advisers reportedly worry it's a problem. Harvard classmates recall him dressing more formally than most even then. (Though when asked in a TV interview what he wore to bed, Romney said: \"As little as possible.\") In some photos, his Temple garment \u2013 \"Mormon underwear\" \u2013 has been clearly visible under his well-ironed white shirt</p> <p><strong>Principal sources</strong><br></p> <ul> <li>Michael Lewis, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">Obama's Way</a>, Vanity Fair</li> <li>Barack Obama, Dreams From My Father</li> <li>Michael Kranish and Scott Helman, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/02/mitt-romney-201202\">The Dark Side of Mitt Romney</a>, Vanity Fair</li> <li>David Maraniss, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/06/young-barack-obama-in-love-david-maraniss\">Young Barack Obama in Love</a>, Vanity Fair</li> <li>Robert Draper, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/mitt-romney.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">The Mitt Romney Who Might Have Been</a>, New York Times</li> <li>Nicholas Lemann, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/01/121001fa_fact_lemann\">Transaction Man</a>, The New Yorker</li> <li>John Miller, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/216252/matinee-mitt/john-j-miller\">Matinee Mitt</a>, National Review</li> <li>Jon Keller, <a href=\"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/2006/05/my-dinner-with-mitt/\">My Dinner With Mitt</a>, Boston Magazine</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/romney/\">The Making of Mitt Romney</a>, Boston Globe series</li> </ul>",

Click here to listen</a></p> <p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Leo Dobson (vocals, guitar), Ben Romans-Hopcraft (vocals, guitar), Daniel Salamons (bass) and Chris O'Driscoll (drums).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> There have been a couple of attempts to launch a new \"classic\" indie rock band over the last few years, most notably when Brother, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/05/new-band-brother\" title=\"\">two years ago this week</a>, came straight outta Slough with the promise that the sun would shine out of their behinds, and more recently with Palma Violets, who last week appeared on the front cover of NME beside the heading, \"High times with the best new band in Britain\".<br>We were a bit iffy when we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/17/new-band-palma-violets\" title=\"\">wrote about Palma Violets</a> in this column back in May, but ironically it's their tourmates \u2013 the new London four-piece Childhood \u2013 who better suit that strapline. They evoke a feeling of heady joy if not drug-induced euphoria (\"high times\") and they are probably the best new British band in that very specific, narrow sense of a cocky young bunch of lads come to shake things up with a heap of hyperbole and casual arrogance. Lord knows the music press could do with some of that mouth almighty action, some gobshites, to shift copies of their magazines and give poor Liam and <a href=\"http://www.themagazinerack.co.uk/ekmps/shops/misseypootles/images/uk-q-magazine-november-2012-noel-gallagher-green-day-lady-gaga-adam-ant-12403-p.jpg\" title=\"\">Noel</a> \u2013 whom we notice have both been given magazine covers of late with nothing as far as we know to promote \u2013 a bit of a rest.</p> <p>That said, Childhood actually look more cute than cool, pretty enough but lacking the simian charisma of Ian Brown or the rough appeal of the Gallaghers, and minus the working-class Last Gang in Town presence of their northern forebears, despite the fact that their debut single <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kBMqK-hVvck/UG7F_L2Zc8I/AAAAAAAABj0/bXbs4UVlOAs/s640/childhood+-+blue+velvet.jpeg\" title=\"\">sleeve features what appear to be renegades from an Odd Future video shoot</a> \u2013 even their press release, rather than fake some bad lad credentials, refers to them as \"fresh-faced\". They formed not on a council estate, but at Nottingham University in early 2011, when co-frontboys Dobson and Romans-Hopcraft, then 20, first got together. From the two tracks we've heard, they are clearly influenced by the usual 60s stuff (Beatles, psych) and even though they pay lip service to 70s funkadelia (Sly, Clinton), the latter is only slightly borne out by the music \u2013 more evident is a shoegaze haze that would, were this the 90s, have seen Childhood signed to Creation quicker than you can answer the question: \"Alan McGee: seer or buffoon?\"</p> <p>That debut single really is a classic of its kind, even if by \"classic\" we're really just confirming that it resurrects rather than revolutionises. Hearing lead track Blue Velvet, though, is a real what-the-world-is-waiting-for moment, with its luminous guitar pattern and playful percussion. It's the singer's performance that raises it beyond the realms of the, well, Palma Violets \u2013 the band do well to keep up as he soars over every note, his wanna-be-adored routine infused with a real sense that good times are here again, and not just for himself and the band. Childhood, like all great groups, carry with them the idea that they will be bringing the party with them, and everyone's invited. Of course, when Ian Brown sang I Am the Resurrection he had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/wall/\" title=\"\">1989 and All That</a> to help with the positive vibes, and in 1994 Liam had on his side Labour's Swinging London revisited. Things ain't quite so cheery in 2012, so it's going to be hard for Childhood to singlehandedly make the culture smiley, but it's to their credit that, for the blissfully conventional four minutes and eight seconds of Blue Velvet, you actually believe it's possible. So much for their She Bangs the Drums. We can't wait for their Fool's Gold.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"At the core of the track sits a feeling of youth and excitement, when your outlook is bright, and your time spent with friends makes it even brighter\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.weallwantsomeone.org/2012/10/04/childhood-blue-velvet/\" title=\"\">We All Want Someone to Shout for</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Brother?

  "<p>David Cameron was forced into counter-attacking mode this week as he wrapped up his party conference with a speech in Birmingham. Trailing Labour in the polls, less popular than his rival Boris Johnson and being urged by his party to move right, the prime minister's speech was intended to silence his critics and spell out his agenda for the remainder of the parliament.</p> <p>Elsewhere at the conference, more tabloid-friendly announcements were made on law and order, removing workers' rights and hammering benefits claimants. </p> <p><strong>Michael White</strong> hears from conference delegates (including journalists from the right-wing press) on what they made of it all. </p> <p>Joining <strong>Tom Clark</strong> in the studio to discuss the week's events are Guardian columnist <strong>Martin Kettle</strong>, political commentator <strong>Gaby Hinsliff</strong> and Boris Johnson biographer <strong>Andrew Gimson</strong>.</p> <p>Also this week: David Cameron is to meet Alex Salmond to discuss the terms of a Scottish independence referendum.

  "<p>This week's announcement that at least <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-eurozone-idUSBRE8980UC20121009\" title=\"\">11 European countries</a> will press ahead with a financial transaction tax has barely registered with the UK media, whose gaze was fixed firmly on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/boris-johnson-unfit-to-be-prime-minister\" title=\"\">BoJo show</a> in Birmingham. But it could prove a significant milestone in the quest for a <a href=\"http://robinhoodtax.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Robin Hood tax</a> to ensure that banks pay their fair share to repair the damage done by the economic crisis both here and in poor countries.</p> <p>At a time when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19865692\" title=\"\">George Osborne was insisting on a further \u00a310bn</a> in cuts to the safety nets of the UK poor, the European 11 \u2013 which includes the big economies of Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 were lining up to give a clear message that it is time finance worked in the interests of society rather than the other way around.</p> <p>Despite increasingly negative rhetoric, the official position of the prime minister and his chancellor remains that they favour a global FTT but that introducing such a tax without the US would mean the City of London and therefore the UK economy would lose out. This is wrong on a number of counts.</p> <p>First, a number of the world's leading financial centres already have FTTs. Indeed our very own \"stamp duty\" on share transactions raises about \u00a33bn a year for the Treasury. Hong Kong \u2013 to take another example \u2013 already taxes derivative transactions. Neither has forfeited its star status.</p> <p>More prosaically, the likely design of the European tax means it will be paid by City institutions despite the UK's refusal to sign up. The tax will apply to any transactions on shares, bonds and derivatives where one of the parties to the transaction is based in a country where the tax is introduced. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young estimate that, depending on the final number of countries that sign up, <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-20596-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">City institutions will still be liable for up to \u00a321bn in tax</a>. But rather than this being paid into our Treasury, it will go instead to governments on the continent.</p> <p>In an age when austerity is failing to bring the public finances under control it is hard to imagine a more spectacular own goal than imperfectly protecting City fat cats at vast expense to the public purse.</p> <p>This is a policy that would not only raise billions, but help curb casino capitalism and particularly the computer-driven high-frequency trading that is contributing to worrying instability in world markets. That's why <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8448862/Robin-Hood-tax-backed-by-more-than-1000-economists.html\" title=\"\">a thousand economists</a> and <a href=\"http://robinhoodtax.org.uk/latest/more-50-financiers-back-robin-hood-tax\" title=\"\">50 leading financiers</a> wrote to David Cameron and other world leaders calling for an FTT, and why it is supported by Bill Gates, George Soros and Warren Buffet.</p> <p>Certainly it offers an opportunity you would expect Labour to enthusiastically seize. There is enormous grassroots support for the Robin Hood tax among the Labour party rank and file, as well as Labour MPs. It is hugely popular with the British public. Yet despite some warm words and a mention in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-uk-infrastructure\" title=\"\">Ed Balls's conference speech</a>, the party's leadership remains little more than a fairweather fan, unwilling to shift its position that an FTT would not work without the US.</p> <p>For now, the new \"one nation\" party remains disproportionately wary of a single square mile. But real progress in Europe could be a game changer. Can you imagine the Labour party going into the next election vowing to remain outside a European Robin Hood tax that has elsewhere reined in the markets and raised billions to kickstart economic progress? The two Eds need to live up to their admirable rhetoric on responsible capitalism and back a Robin Hood tax.</p> <p>And never mind Labour, if Europe gets its FTT right, this government will find it increasingly difficult to justify why it insists on transferring billions of pounds in tax revenue to Paris and Berlin. This is a tax whose time has come.</p>",
  "<p>A man who wore a homemade T-shirt containing an offensive anti-police sentiment in the immediate aftermath of the deaths of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes has been jailed for a total of eight months.</p> <p>Barry Thew, 39, of Radcliffe, Manchester, was sentenced at Minshull Street crown court in Manchester to four months in prison, after admitting a section 4a public order offence \u2013 displaying writing or other visible representation with intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress. Thew also admitted breaching a suspended sentence imposed for a previous offence of cannabis production for which he was ordered to serve another four months concurrently.</p> <p>The court heard that at 2.15pm on 18 September, less than three-and-a-half hours after the officers were killed, he was seen in Radcliffe town centre wearing a white T-shirt with the handwritten message on the front and back. He was arrested and taken into custody after complaints from outraged members of the public.</p> <p>The T-shirt said on its front: \"One Less PiG Perfect Justice.\" On the back: \"KiLL A COP 4 Fun.co.uk HA, haaa?\"</p> <p>Inspector Bryn Williams, of the Radcliffe neighbourhood policing team, said: \"While officers on the ground were just learning of and trying to come to terms with the devastating news that two colleagues had been murdered, Thew thought nothing of going out in public with a T-shirt daubed with appalling handwritten comments on.\"</p> <p>He said thankfully the overwhelming response from the public \u2013 who have inundated the force with messages of support and condolence \u2013 prove that Thew is an exception, not the rule \"and our communities were right behind us at our darkest hour\".</p> <p>Williams said to mock the tragic events of that morning was morally reprehensible and Thew had rightly been convicted and sentenced for his actions.</p> <p>Sentencing him, Judge Peter Lakin said: \"This, on any view, is a shocking case. Your response to the shocking events was to parade around in a T-shirt in the centre of Radcliffe which had on it the most disgusting of slogans. In my judgment, it is utterly depressing that you felt able to stoop so low as to behave in that way. Your mindless behaviour has added to the pain of everyone touched by the deaths of these young officers. You have shown no remorse.\"</p> <p>When arrested, Thew replied: \"Not bothered.\" The court heard that he was arrested after police received reports from outraged members of the public.</p> <p>Stuart Duke, defending, said Thew had been an inpatient at a mental health unit and was still on anti-psychotic medicine, but the judge replied mental health was \"not a factor\".</p> <p>He said Thew had a longstanding dispute with Greater Manchester police over the death of his son three years ago and repeated stop-and-search procedures. He said the wearing of the T-shirt was not in response to the deaths of the two police officers, but was related to another case. He said he was already wearing the T-shirt when he heard the news.</p> <p>PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, were killed on duty in a gun and grenade attack when they responded to a routine call about a burglary at an address in Abbey Gardens, on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, Tameside on 18 September.</p> <p>Dale Cregan, 29, has been charged with their murders and those of David Short and his son, Mark, and four other attempted murders.

On that date, Usada's chief executive, Travis Tygart, called the UCI's president, Pat McQuaid, to inform him that proceedings were being initiated against Armstrong and also delivered a letter to that effect.</p> <p>Usada further argues that the UCI is \"conflicted\" out of any role \"because it has publicly pre-judged the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence\".</p> <p>When Armstrong's former team-mate Floyd Landis first accused the seven-times Tour de France winner in 2010, McQuaid said the allegations were \"nothing new\" and sued Landis over his claims of a UCI cover-up.</p> <p>The UCI won its case against Landis last month, with the former rider forced to pay McQuaid and the governing body's honorary president, Hein Verbruggen, damages and promise not to repeat allegations against them.</p> <p>And when another former team-mate, Tyler Hamilton, publicly accused Armstrong of doping in a long-form interview for 60 Minutes in the US in 2011, Verbruggen said: \"That's impossible, because there is nothing. I repeat again: Lance Armstrong has never used doping. Never, never, never.\"</p> <p>Usada said that amounted to evidence that even before its investigation was complete, the UCI had \"pre-judged and rejected\" the argument that Armstrong was involved in doping.</p> <p>The 200-page summary of Usada's verdict makes a series of claims against the governing body, including repeating allegations from Tyler Hamilton and Landis that Armstrong told both he had tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug, Erythropoietin (EPO), at the 2001 Tour of Switzerland and \"stated or implied he had been able to make the EPO test result go away\".</p> <p>Hamilton said in his sworn affidavit that in 2001 Armstrong told him \"his people had been in touch with [the] UCI and they were going to have a meeting and everything was going to be OK\".</p> <p>Landis said that in 2002 he recalled Armstrong saying that \"he and Mr [US Postal team director, Johan] Bruyneel flew to the UCI headquarters and made a financial agreement to keep the positive test hidden.\"</p> <p>McQuaid has acknowledged that during 2002, Armstrong and Bruyneel flew to its headquarters in May and made donations totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a362,000) to the UCI to help the development of cycling. But the UCI \"vehemently denies\" that the meeting or payment was in any way tied to a cover-up of a positive test.</p> <p>The Usada report goes on to state that the testimony of Landis and Hamilton is corroborated by the evidence of Dr Martial Saugy, the director of a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accredited laboratory in Lausanne, that he was advised by the UCI that \"at least one\" of several samples detected as suspicious for the presence of EPO during the Tour of Switzerland belonged to Armstrong.</p> <p>It also says that six Armstrong samples that formed the basis of allegations in a 2005 L'Equipe article about the 1999 Tour de France contained \"resoundingly positive values\", according to a chart of the results recently obtained by Usada. The samples were retrospectively tested for EPO by the French Anti-Doping Laboratory in 2005, because a reliable test was not available until 2000.</p> <p>Wada and Usada argue that a subsequent UCI investigation inappropriately focused on whether the lab had followed established protocol, ignoring the fact that such results can be used to corroborate other evidence.</p> <p>\"While the French Anti-Doping Laboratory's analysis of the 1999 samples may not stand alone to establish a positive test under the code, the analysis is consistent with and corroborates the numerous witness statements recently obtained by Usada.\"</p> <p>The report also alleges that Armstong and his team-mates benefited from anonymous tip-offs about when testers would be present.</p> <p>According to another former team-mate, David Zabriskie, Bruyneel \"always seemed to know\" when drug testers would be coming, while another, Jonathan Vaughters, testified that Postal Service team members always appeared to have an hour's advance warning of tests \u2013 enough time to use saline to mask the effects of using EPO.</p> <p>During the 2009 Tour de France, the French anti-doping agency \u2013 jointly responsible for testing with the UCI \u2013 claimed that Armstrong benefited from \"privileged information or timing advantages during doping control tests\". On one occasion, testers were delayed for 30 minutes by UCI officials, it is claimed in the report.</p> <p>Armstrong's lawyer, Sean Breen, has called the Usada report a \"one-sided hatchet job\".</p> <p>\"Usada has continued its government-funded witch hunt of only Mr Armstrong, a retired cyclist, in violation of its own rules and due process, in spite of Usada's lack of jurisdiction, in blatant violation of the statute of limitations,\" he said.</p> <p>Tygart has now called on the UCI to \"act on its own suggestion for a meaningful truth and reconciliation programme\". He added: \"From day one, we always hoped this investigation would bring to a close this troubling chapter in cycling's history and we hope the sport will use this tragedy to prevent it from ever happening again.\".</p>",

Pop's very own Dorothy Parker (responsible for bon mots such as \"I do maintain that if your hair is wrong, your entire life is wrong\" and \"I don't even know if I exist offstage\"), is reduced to a wobbling jelly of confusion.</p> <p>Morrissey starts out in typical form. Colbert describes him as a living legend known for his melancholy lyrics. Mozza looks at him, tight-lipped and fabulously disapproving. You know he's going to lecture him. He asks Colbert if he knows what the word legend means.</p> <p>\"It means you're dead\" Colbert says.</p> <p>\"No, it means it might be true and it might be false so it doesn't really apply.\" One nil to Morrissey. Or so he thought. It's at this point that Colbert goes to town on Manchester's greatest misanthrope. The technique is simple. Find out what somebody passionately believes in, and pretend you think they believe the opposite. So in this case Colbert takes the titles of two great Smiths albums as his starting point; The Queen Is Dead and Meat Is Murder, and stands them on their head.</p> <p>\"Did you enjoy the Queen's jubilee, such a glorious celebration?\"</p> <p>\"A celebration of what?\" the existential crooner replies, sardonically.</p> <p>\"Sixty years of majesty,\" Colbert says.</p> <p>Morrissey: \"Sixty years of dictatorship.\"</p> <p>Colbert: \"Sixty years of dictatorship, what are you talking about?</p> <p>Didn't you like the pageantry?\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"No, no, sorry, no, no, no, no.\"</p> <p>\"But she's your queen!\" Colbert protests, whining like a young if better dressed Woody Allen. (The whole interview could be re-imagined as classic Woody Allen circa Annie Hall; Morrissey is the girl Woody loves but can't stop picking fights with.)</p> <p>Every time Colbert changes subject, it inflames the situation. \"You had to love the royal wedding,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I hated the royal wedding,\" Morrissey replies. \"They are absolutely horrible people. Arrogant horrible dictators.\" So by pressing the buttons, Colbert has already got a great quote out of the man still famous for singing with a tree poking out of his backside.</p> <p>And on it goes.</p> <p>Colbert: \"You're not going to say Pippa didn't look lovely?\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"She's \u2026 horrendous\" Colbert: \"What are you talking about? You couldn't have pulled off that dress.\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"Of course a few weeks later she's in a gun scandal in Paris and the press hide it completely.\" So Colbert has egged him on to another controversy with a conspiracy theory chucked in for good measure.</p> <p>Having milked the royals, Colbert gently leads him to the butcher's.</p> <p>\"You are a militant vegetarian.\"</p> <p>Morrissey nods proudly.</p> <p>\"You requested, no demanded, this be a meat-free environment for the day you are here.\" Again wonderful interviewing. Colbert exposes Morrissey's ridiculous rider, and brings a conversation that started with Morrissey protesting about dictatorship to a lovely circular close.</p> <p>But not before he comes over all Salvador Dal\u00ed on Morrissey.</p> <p>Do you really believe we can never eat animals, he asks. Exactly, Morrissey says. \"What about a cow that's been sentenced to death for murder or a pig that commits suicide from listening to too many of your songs?\"</p> <p>All Morrissey can do is chide the audience for laughing, and throw fey mock punches at the interviewer. Priceless.</p>",
  "<p>A \"legal high\" sold as a \"head-blowing herbal incense\" is set to be banned after leaving nine people in hospital in the past three months.</p> <p>\"Annihilation\" is among hundreds of new synthetic \"designer\" compound drugs, many of which imitate the effects of controlled drugs such as cannabis or ecstasy, that the government's drugs advisers are to recommend be banned next week.</p> <p>The warning came as the government's chief drugs adviser also voiced concerns about dangerous new recreational uses being made of laughing gas (nitrous oxide) and helium \u2013 but made clear there was no intention to ban the gases.</p> <p>Professor Les Iversen, the chairman of the government's advisory committee on the misuse of drugs (ACMD), said that annihilation was a particularly potent compound that had left young people hospitalised in Glasgow and Blackburn. He said youngsters had become severely agitated and over-stimulated after taking it.</p> <p>Strathclyde police have said that three people were hospitalised in Glasgow after taking it at the same time last Wednesday. \"Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's safe. No one can predict the risks involved,\" said DI Jim Bradley. \"Those who have taken the drug have experienced adverse health effects, including increased heart rate, unconsciousness, numbness in legs causing collapse, paranoia, aggression and self-harming. The symptoms appear, in some cases, to last for several hours.\"</p> <p>Iversen said annihilation was a potent synthetic cannabinoid compound that replicated the active ingredients in cannabis and was among hundreds of compounds that the ACMD will recommend next week be banned by the home secretary, Theresa May.</p> <p>He said that three years ago, the government's drugs advisers had recommended banning the first generation of legal highs \u2013 which included similar drugs such as Spice \u2013 and hoped they had dealt with the problem. Iversen added: \"This is a catch-up exercise. It is an example of how fast-moving this field is. In three years' time we shall need to do something similar again.\" He said the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction had so far this year spotted one new legal high or previously unknown synthetic compound each week, on average.</p> <p>The drugs advisers will also next week confirm a ban on the first legal high to be controlled under the government's new \"temporary banning legislation\". It is expected to tell the home secretary that the evidence exists to retain the ban on methoxetamine, which was placed on a temporary class drug order in April.</p> <p>Iversen said the ACMD had received an approach from the British Compressed Gases Association highlighting its concerns over the misuse of laughing gas and helium, and their wrongful portrayal as \"fun\". He noted that at the Glastonbury festival in recent years, it had become popular to sell balloons filled with nitrous oxide, which was then inhaled. However, the gas is potentially lethal.</p>",

  "<p>Marie Stopes, the sexual health charity, predicts women will travel to Belfast from the Republic to have terminations when it opens the first private clinic to offer abortions on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the Abortion Act 1967 does not apply, owing to opposition from the churches and almost all parties at the Stormont assembly, and abortion is legal only in exceptional circumstances. Like their counterparts in the Republic, where abortions are illegal, Northern Irish women travel to other parts of Britain for terminations.</p> <p>The centre's programme director, Dawn Purvis, said: \"We believe this is great news for the people of Northern Ireland because we will be able to meet their family planning and sexual health needs in a way that has not been seen here before. We have a new, purpose-built, centrally located specialist centre. Our team are highly trained and dedicated healthcare professionals. And our services will be delivered in a confidential, sensitive and non-judgmental way.\"</p> <p>Purvis is a former leader of the Progressive Unionist party.</p> <p>Abortions will only be offered in the first nine weeks of pregnancy at a cost of \u00a3450. The clinic, which opens next Thursday, also provides sexual and reproductive services including short- and long-term contraceptive options, emergency contraception and HIV testing.</p> <p>Dr Paula Franklin, medical director with Marie Stopes, said the abortions, which involve taking tablets, would be carried out only after two doctors agreed women met set criteria.</p> <p>\"In cases where we feel the woman's case meets medical requirements, we will carry out medical abortions. That's where two doctors independently review the woman's history and current physical and mental health,\" she said.</p> <p>Sin\u00e9ad Ahern, a spokeswoman for Choice Ireland, a pro-choice organisation in the Republic, said it would reduce the \"psychological and financial burden\" on women south of the border seeking a termination.</p> <p>Anti-abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland say they will campaign to close down the clinic offering abortion services. Bernie Smith from the organisation Precious Life said: \"I am absolutely outraged. An organisation which is making profits from the death of unborn children is not welcome in Northern Ireland. There will be an outcry from the people, from government and from the churches.\"</p> <p>A group of Irish nationals who had abortions abroad because their babies would not survive outside the womb also welcomed the opening of the clinic in Belfast.</p> <p>But Ruth Bowie, of the Terminations for Medical Reasons campaign group, said a number of women both sides of the border would still be forced to cross the Irish Sea to have a termination. Fatal foetal abnormalities are only picked up within 12 to 20 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 long after the nine-week limit at the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast.</p> <p>\"This development in Belfast will be of no help to the women north and south who are facing the trauma and upset of fatal foetal abnormalities,\" Bowie said. \"Women and men in this situation continue to be forced to travel away from family, friends and their homes at the worst time of their lives.</p> <p>\"We continue to campaign for a change in this outdated law and will not stop until women and men who make this heartbreaking decision are afforded to the dignity to be cared for in their own country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last year Shelter published the results of research into problems with the private rented sector (PRS), focusing on the condition of properties and the behaviour of landlords towards tenants. It was based in part on Freedom of Information Act requests sent out to 326 local authorities, of whom an impressive 322 responded.</p> <p>The final report, <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/policy_briefing_asserting_authority_-_calling_time_on_rogue_landlords\" title=\"\">Asserting authority: Calling time on rogue landlords</a>, told us that more than 86,000 complaints about landlords had been made to local authorities in a previous year, up by a quarter on earlier statistics; 1,477 landlords were well known to councils as serial offenders.</p> <p>Recent figures point to a growth in buy-to-let mortgages of nearly 20%. Interesting that the statistical rise in complaints made about landlords is almost equal to the new amateur landlords coming onto the market. If the 1,477 repeat offender landlords can't be responsible for the 86,000 rising complaints a year, who is behind the other 84,523? Even allowing for the fact that the repeat offenders will be responsible for more than one complaint each, it still leaves a huge amount of landlords driving these allegations who aren't among the usual suspects.</p> <p>As a tenancy relations officer who has worked in the housing sector since 1990 I have perhaps a better idea than many, having seen trends ebb and flow the PRS during that time.</p> <p>The two biggest problems facing the sector today are the explosion in unregulated letting agents, with the concomitant fraud and bad practice that are endemic, and the rise in the buy-to-let amateur and so called \"reluctant landlord\" where people who can't sell their home turn their hand to renting it out without a clue about what they are getting themselves into.</p> <p>I cannot remember the last time I received a complaint about a portfolio landlord. Landlords who treat their properties as a business have the knowledge and the financial stability to weather the ups and downs of their sector. Missing rents and damage to property are a risk of the business, not a mortgage-threatening crisis to them.</p> <p>The more I deal with disputes between landlords and tenants, mediating and negotiating on a daily basis, the more I am convinced that one of the single biggest causes of rogue behaviour is simple ignorance of the laws, rules and procedures that govern a private letting. That ignorance extends to tenants as well.</p> <p>Private renting in the UK has traditionally been done on a nod and wink basis. The governing logic seeming to be a loose affair of cash for keys, and if it doesn't work out we'll just call it a day and move on. The 86,000 complaints that have come to Shelter's attention will be made up of a wide variety of incidents from serious assaults to minor infractions committed in ignorance by otherwise decent, albeit na\u00efve, amateur landlords who in my experience will often back down and apologise once the law has been pointed out to them.</p> <p>Of course these daily stories aren't as newsworthy as a thug with a baseball bat (who do exist as well, trust me, but never in large numbers), but most complaints are of daft, rash and ill-conceived actions that can be swiftly dealt with. Every day I have conversations with these inexperienced landlords and have to repeatedly explain basic legal concepts, such as the need for a possession order or that a notice itself doesn't end a tenancy or turn the tenant into a squatter if they don't move out. It's not that they are resistant, they are just unaware.</p> <p>If you want an insight into the problem just google around a few landlord chat forums and see some of the cock-eyed questions and urban myths being floated around in the PRS landlord community.</p> <p>Many organisations around the country these days are leaning towards education as a way of preventing people from breaking laws that they don't even realise are there. The London landlords accreditation scheme (LLAS) runs training courses for landlords and tenants on a wide variety of topics to help landlords run their letting properly and knowledgeably.</p> <p>In the Midlands, the excellent Mary Latham works through 'Homestamp', partnering up with West Midlands University, its student union and private landlords to spread the word, delivering training courses and educating people where it is needed in an attempt to improve the relationship between landlords and tenants.</p> <p>I am also meeting more tenants groups who are getting themselves and their members educated in an attempt to tackle problems in their area and also to bring pressure to bear on government thinking.</p> <p>A decade ago, the only training courses on offer were through organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Housing or Shelter, and these courses were largely aimed at housing professionals working in councils, housing associations or through voluntary agencies. Now, finally, there are courses for landlords and tenants too.</p> <p>Many councils have decided to create their own local social lettings agencies, on the logic that if the PRS is so dogged with amateurism and bad practice the most effective way of dealing with it is to roll their sleeves up and join the industry, becoming a force of influence as well as a profit making service provider. For many of the more clued up councils, this also includes training and even mentoring PRS landlords.</p> <p>I passionately believe that this is the way forward, out of this stupid amateur free-for-all that is the PRS. Of course robust prosecution has its place, but I would have more time to pursue criminal landlords through the courts if I didn't spend so much of it having to explain the same laws over and over again to people who have simply got out of their depth.</p> <p>A trained and knowledgeable landlord community would bring those 86,000 complaints down to a manageable level, leaving the majority of offenders in the smaller group of repeat, known offenders exposed in the spotlight where we can pick them off.</p> <p>The real work needs to be in raising awareness and knowledge levels. Let's save the punishment for the real offenders and make partners the growing mass of small landlords who need the help.</p> <p><em>Ben Reeve-Lewis is a tenancy relations officer for a local authority in London</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and </strong><a href=\"http://jobs.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest job</strong></a><strong>s direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p><em>This week's playlist has been selected by Gary Willis, who goes by the username Fintan28.</em></p> <p>Where to start? Here's an advanced course by Professor Willie Dixon. An excellent seminar on <strong>Bassology</strong> that's chock-full of the right stuff. Double credit for the double bass. Jimmy Blanton needs no refresher course, as he shows while walkin' the Duke Ellington Orchestra to meet <strong>Jack the Bear</strong>. One can only ponder the might-have-beens had Jimmy not been called up to the Big Sky Orchestra early.</p> <p>How does a piece of music become iconic? Start with a bass line worked out on the piano by Carole King. Hand the result to Wendell Marshall to give it life, a bit of percussion, gorgeous strings and Ben E King's incredible vocal to top it off. Fifty years on, <strong>Stand By Me </strong>still raises the hair on my arms.</p> <p>If my teenage self had heard Wimple Winch's<strong> Save My Soul</strong> in 1966, the astounding attack at the end of each chorus would have been mine to revel in 35 years early. My bad luck being American. Bassist Barry Ashall has said he was just trying to keep up with his guitar player; sounds like the hounds were on both their heels. Weather Report's train pulls into a <strong>Barbary Coast</strong> station with Jaco Pastorius stoking coal. Jaco surely adheres to the leave-em-wanting-more school, as the train leaves the station much too soon. Fortunately, longer live versions exist.</p> <p>As rock moved into arenas and stadiums, a problem arose: how to give the folks in the nosebleeds their money's worth? After all, if you need a telescope to make out Mr Dio and the rafters have turned the guitars into sonic stilettos, the least you can do is make their chests vibrate. On Black Sabbath's <strong>Lady Evil</strong>, Geezer Butler turns the arena into a living, breathing animal with his monster bass riffs. </p> <p>Crowd control in the arenas was another consideration, addressed admirably by Tom Hamilton. <strong>Sweet Emotion</strong>'s hypnotic signature opening lines immediately grab your attention and can be extended to give the crowd (and that somnambulant sound engineer) time to refocus before the rest of Aerosmith climb aboard to rock the house.</p> <p>In the 70s, kids discovered they could literally rock their own houses. Picture <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Pacer\">AMC Pacers</a> \u2013 hatchbacks tied down to the Marshall stacks inside, front seat full of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabst_Blue_Ribbon\">PBR</a>s \u2013 rolling up to the party house. Once all the gear was connected, it was even odds Bootsy Collins was gonna be thumping the walls. Parliament's <strong>Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)</strong> thumps em good.</p> <p>Thom Yorke does his own bass work on <strong>Black Swan</strong>. As RR regular Nilpferd observed: \"[He] makes it the perfect tool for expressing the menacing alienation of the lyric.\" Was it Robert Smith's alienation from himself that produced the following lines?<br><em><br>Further we go<br>And older we grow<br>The more we know<br>The less we show</em></p> <p>It's hard to say, but Simon Gallup's racing bass line makes one feel they're chasing after something that can never be caught. A <strong>Primary</strong> quandary?</p> <p>Us3 took their name from a Horace Parlan album, borrowed the Ron Carter bass line (and a whole mess of Blue Note stuff) to stitch together the infectious <strong>Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)</strong>. Nice piece of embroidery, that. On <strong>Funkin' for Jamaica</strong>, Marcus Miller seems to have borrowed the groan of an old wooden wharf being pounded by the ocean's swell. Just enough to hold Tom Browne and crew together.</p> <h2>The list:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcqqyL-Y6Go\">Bassology \u2013 Willie Dixon</a>[Bassist: Willie Dixon]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9x-g0ox0I0\">Jack the Bear \u2013 Duke Ellington Orchestra</a> [Jimmy Blanton]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USnVTJ7e2gk\">Stand By Me \u2013 Ben E King</a> [Wendell Marshall]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi9GXxVDJQg\">Save My Soul \u2013 Wimple Winch</a> [Barry Ashall]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h56USliw3eo\">Barbary Coast \u2013 Weather Report</a> [Jaco Pastorius]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBAj3WPX0i8\">Lady Evil \u2013 Black Sabbath</a> [Geezer Butler]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82cJgPXU-ik\">Sweet Emotion \u2013 Aerosmith</a> [Tom Hamilton]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ-9FpUh0q0\">Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker) \u2013 Parliament</a> [Bootsie Collins]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg8Vq6w0JSE\">Black Swan \u2013 Thom Yorke</a> [Thom Yorke]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xrZ61cuKLk\">Primary \u2013 The Cure</a> [Simon Gallup]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwBjhBL9G6U\">Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia) \u2013 Us3</a> [Ron Carter]<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuUy2ShGLyo\">Funkin' for Jamaica \u2013 Tom Browne</a> [Marcus Miller]</p> <p>\u2022 Listen to these songs on a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjJcJNDIhar6Wqvuk44BAVNENz9Vxo8A&amp;feature=mh_lolz\">YouTube playlist</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 See all the readers' recommendations on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/oct/04/readers-recommend-best-bass-lines\">last week's blog</a>, from which Gary selected the songs above.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:3KYJ3PYMA95ScvPMe7lxz7\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:3KYJ3PYMA95ScvPMe7lxz7\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"540\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u2022 Here's a Spotify playlist containing readers' recommendations on this theme.</p>",

The author is furious with the complacent middle Englanders who run the fictional West Country town of Pagford, and furious above all about their callous disregard for the poor.</p> <p>By focusing on a parish council, Rowling almost entirely avoids explicit mention of party politics, but it is perfectly obvious that the faction seeking to decouple Pagford from the sink estate on its outskirts are Tories. Their ally in this, and a second project to shut down a drug clinic in the service of public sector cuts, is grandee Aubrey Fawley, possessor of a fine old house and a seat on the district council.</p> <p>Reaction to the novel on the right has been predictably outraged. The Daily Mail's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2209165/J-K-Rowlings-The-Casual-Vacancy-review-Wheres-magic-tale-middle-class-monsters.html\" title=\"\">Jan Moir denounced it</a> as a \"socialist manifesto masquerading as literature\". Former Daily Telegraph editor <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9573579/JK-Rowling-has-turned-her-back-on-the-culture-that-made-her-great.html\" title=\"\">Charles Moore apparently read it through such a fog of rage</a> at its supposed political correctness that he mistook the town's Sikh GP for an \"admirable\" character (because non-white) when in fact she is the nastiest character by a mile.</p> <p>Elsewhere, opinions have been mixed. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/casual-vacancy-jk-rowling-review\" title=\"\">Melvyn Bragg called it \"stunning\"</a> and suggested Rowling's teenage underclass heroine Krystal Weedon would make the journey to posterity alongside Harry Potter himself.</p> <p>But the liberal commentariat who might have been expected to cheer Rowling to the rafters have not done so \u2013 yet. Reviewers instead picked on points of style and disagreed about whether the first or second half of the book is best.</p> <p>Other contemporary novelists attempting a state-of-the-nation snapshot \u2013 Rose Tremain, Sebastian Faulks \u2013 have tended to use a wider angle, bringing in such disparate points of view as east European migrants and jihadist terrorists. In focusing tightly on a single community, Rowling shows that it is in local matters that questions of value are at their sharpest and most inescapable; that it is in our choices regarding what most immediately concerns us (our neighbourhoods, our children's schools) that we are most ruthless and most exposed.</p> <p>The book ducks national politics. Parish councils are rarely as powerful as Rowling suggests, and it doesn't really make sense that we hear nothing of the local MP or Conservative association. But to someone who has spent the past two years working towards the election of the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/30/queens-park-parish-politics-democratic-revival\" title=\"\">parish council in London</a>, it is heartening to see grassroots politics treated with deadly seriousness.</p> <p>Pagford parish has lost its way morally, with tragic consequences, but far from the nihilistic cynic some have labelled her, Rowling shows there is a way back. When Samantha Mollison, bored daughter-in-law of the novel's chief villain and owner of a failing bra shop, finds herself afflicted with an unfamiliar \"desire to be absorbed in something bigger than herself\", what does she do? She volunteers to become a councillor and hear the arguments for the drug clinic.</p> <p>That Tory opinion-formers hate and fear this novel's influence enough to bother denouncing it is heartening for anyone who thinks books can shape as well as reflect the world in which they are made. But if anyone is in doubt that a novel published in 2012, even one with millions of readers, can do much to bring about the social transformation that is required if real-life Krystal Weedons are to get the chance in life that Pagford denies them, Rowling reminds us very clearly that there is another way: join the decision-makers. Get involved in politics.</p>",

  "<p>Home Office ministers sought a pardon for Jordanian terror suspect Abu Qatada in a bid to deport him from the UK, a tribunal has heard.</p> <p>James Brokenshire, the then security minister, asked Jordanian ministers in February if the radical cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, could be pardoned if returned.</p> <p>Even when Brokenshire was told this was not possible, the government had a \"plan B\" to find out when the Jordanian king could issue such a pardon, the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) in central London heard.</p> <p>Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, revealed details of the talks which took place at a meeting in Jordan on 14 February.</p> <p>Under cross-examination by Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Abu Qatada, Layden agreed that the possibility of a pardon for the cleric was explored.</p> <p>\"I think the question of a pardon had been asked earlier and Mr Brokenshire was asking for an answer,\" Layden said.</p> <p>The pardon was being sought because the evidence against Abu Qatada was \"granted by torture\", Layden agreed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/10/abu-qatada-extradition?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Siac is hearing Abu Qatada's appeal </a>against deportation after Europe's human rights judges ruled the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/abu-qatada-deportation-blocked-european?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">51-year-old could not be deported </a>while there was a \"real risk that evidence obtained by torture will be used against him\".</p> <p>Layden also said simple assurances from the Jordanian government that evidence gained by torture would not be used were never going to be enough to deport him as it was a matter for the prosecutors and the courts, not the government.</p> <p>The UK government also asked Jordanian prosecutors if they would give \"an undertaking in advance that they would not rely on the statements\" gained through torture, but the Jordanians refused, Layden agreed.</p> <p>An attempt to get Jordan's state security court to rule on the admissibility of the statements before Qatada was deported had also been rejected, he added.</p> <p>The tribunal continues.</p>",
  "<p>When the matchmaker turned up at her house, 13-year-old Rehana Begum knew something was wrong. Shortly afterwards, an unknown woman smiled at her from the doorway; her worst fears were confirmed. Her parents were planning to marry her off.</p> <p>Rehana, a class six student at a secondary school in Nilphamari district in northern Bangladesh, was well aware of the likely consequences of early marriage \u2013 an end to school, isolation from her friends and a life of hard work at her in-laws. But she also knew outright rebellion was out of the question. In the poverty-stricken, deeply conservative northern districts of Bangladesh, children defer to elders.</p> <p>Fortunately for Rehana, she knew exactly who to call: the district's vaunted \"wedding busters\", a movement consisting of 11 groups of around 20 youngsters, campaigning against child marriage.</p> <p>Arriving home from school the next day, Rehana found the group talking to her mother, who remained belligerent. \"Who will help us find a nice boy when she gets older?\" she demanded. \"And who will protect Rehana on her way to school?\"</p> <p>The children are well versed in handling such scenarios; they don't argue, but methodically list the evils of child marriage. \"We can't force them to listen to us,\" said Antara Tabassum, 16, one of the leaders of the child protection group in Nilphamari's Jaldhaka Upazila sub-district. \"All we can do is show them that child marriage is a curse.\"</p> <p>The intervention of such groups is a key reason why all 11 of Jaldhaka's unions or local councils have been able to declare their respective localities \"child marriage-free zones\" \u2013 no mean feat in a country where almost one in three children is married off before turning 15. According to <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/children_4865.htm\" title=\"\">Unicef data</a>, 74% of Bangladeshi girls are married before the legal age of 18.</p> <p>\"Child marriages are a significant obstacle to development in Bangladesh,\" said Myrna Evora, country director of <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/where-we-work/asia/bangladesh/\" title=\"\">Plan Bangladesh</a>, a children's charity that campaigns against early marriage. \"Early and forced marriage often drives girls into a cycle of poverty and powerlessness. They tend to miss out on an education, suffer from poor health and give birth to children who are also weak and malnourished.\"</p> <p>It has taken years of hard work for Jaldhaka to buck the national trend. \"The wedding busters succeed because it is part of a community-based, bottom-up approach,\" said Shamsul Haq, a local council chairman. \"We bring together the government, elected representatives and NGOs like Plan Bangladesh, and work with a comprehensive approach. You can't defeat something like this with heavy-handed law enforcement.\"</p> <p>Although Bangladesh passed the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Ordinance in 1984, making it illegal for males under 21 and females under 18 to marry, enforcement remains lax.</p> <p>Experts say there is widespread ignorance about the health consequences of early marriage. Child brides become part of a vicious cycle of chronic malnutrition and are at high risk of death during childbirth. According to Unicef's <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/sowc2011/pdfs/SOWC-2011-Main-Report_EN_02092011.pdf\" title=\"\">State of the World's Children 2011 report</a> (pdf), girls who become pregnant before the age of 16 are three to four times likelier to die giving birth than women in their 20s.</p> <p>\"Most child brides become mothers while they are children themselves,\" said Dr Mahbub Hasan, a surgeon at the district hospital in Nilphamari. \"Because their bodies are not fully formed, they're at risk of prolonged or obstructed labour. This threatens the lives of both mother and child. Early marriage is hampering our efforts to bring down maternal and child mortality.\"</p> <p>In Bangladesh, the problem of child marriage is rooted in complex socio-economic factors. Girls from poor families are likelier to become child brides and go on to raise children in poverty. Yet the entrenched and illegal dowry system \u2013 where a bride's family pays significant sums to the groom \u2013 encourages the marriage of adolescent girls, because younger brides typically require smaller dowries.</p> <p>Experts point to girls' education as by far the most important weapon against child marriage. The government, with support from the World Bank, has been giving small cash transfers or stipends to encourage girls to stay in school. According to a <a href=\"http://go.worldbank.org/WP5CE87SL0\" title=\"\">World Bank study</a>, the overall proportion of females who married in stipend project areas declined between 1992 and 1995, from 29% to 14% for 13 to 15-year-olds, and from 72% to 64% for 16- to 19-year-olds.</p> <p>\"Education is crucial to combat child marriage,\" says Evora, whose organisation is launching a <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/girls/child-marriage.php\" title=\"\">five-year campaign</a>, coinciding with the international day of the girl on 11 October, to stop child marriage. \"We've also done important work in promoting birth registration and marriage registration in the Nilphamari area, with very encouraging results. Nowadays kazis, or marriage registrars, are demanding proof that brides are above 18.\"</p> <p>Since child brides are often isolated from their network of friends and family, the wedding busters go from village to village, holding courtyard meetings and staging amateur plays.</p> <p>With direct access to the local council chairperson and even the police chief, they can call in the big guns if necessary. \"The kids can stop 50% of child marriages by themselves. In the rest of the cases, we get involved,\" said Ehsan Chanu, former chairman of Mirganj local council.</p> <p>In Jaldhaka, after an hour of pleading and cajoling, the children have persuaded Rehana Begum's mother, Dilara, to relent. Tears flow as she recalls her own early marriage. \"You're right. Rehana should study and have a better life than I did,\" she says. \"I'll talk to her dad.\" For Nilphamari's wedding busters, it's another \"bride\" saved.</p>",
  "<p>\"These are my chromosomes!\" exclaimed the teaching assistant, holding aloft a black and white photograph of 46 stripy worms. \"Mine! Isn't that cool? I have a blown-up version framed in my room! You'll all get your own when you do the karyotyping lab session next year.\"</p> <p>I was a first-year undergraduate student, delighted to be studying genetics \u2013 a subject I'd loved since I first encountered it at the tender age of 14 \u2013 and couldn't wait to see my own chromosomes.</p> <p>Sadly, however, it was not to be: the university had to stop offering that lab session a few weeks later when a student in the year ahead of us noticed that she had a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/balancedtranslocation\">balanced translocation</a>. This abnormality didn't affect her own health \u2013 she had all the DNA she should have, just not in the right places \u2013 but it did suddenly shed some light on her sister's recent string of miscarriages. The whole family had to be referred for genetic counselling, the university's legal department suddenly started to think about liability issues, and I never did get to see what my chromosomes look like.</p> <p>At the age of 19 I lacked the perspective to see that the university had made the right decision. But now, after a PhD, a postdoc, a short stint in the biotech sector, and five years back in academia as a project manager in the field of human genomics, I wonder why they ever thought the karyotyping lab session was a good idea in the first place.</p> <p>It's not that I'm any less curious about my chromosomes \u2013 on the contrary, I'd still love one of those photos, and when companies like <a href=\"https://www.23andme.com\">23andMe</a> started offering direct-to-consumer genetic analysis, my inner teenaged genetics geek was extremely tempted. How amazingly cool would it be to see how my own DNA sequence maps onto everything I've ever learned about genetics?! A part of me would absolutely love to send in that spit sample and have a good look at what's going on in there.</p> <p>But then I start thinking about how surprised I always am when people around my age still have grandparents. Both my grandfathers died before I was born, one grandmother when I was 15 and the other when I was 21. My family's genetic legacy includes heart disease, various types of cancer, schizophrenia, glaucoma, possibly MS \u2026 you name it. Granted, the next couple of generations seem healthy enough and things like throat cancer in a coal miner probably aren't genetic anyway, but there's definitely the potential for some rather nasty surprises lurking in my DNA.</p> <p>Would I want to know?</p> <p>Yes \u2026</p> <p>\u2026 and no.</p> <p>Yes, because it would still be super interesting (I mentioned the genetics geek thing, right?), and potentially very useful. For example, the risks of some genetic predispositions to disease can be partially mitigated by earlier and more frequent screening.</p> <p>No, because for many other gene mutations there's absolutely nothing you can do with the information except worry about whether, how, and when it's going to make you ill.</p> <p>There are other factors to consider, too. For example, my results could also affect other members of my family \u2013 should I consult them before I even think about proceeding? What kinds of analysis of my DNA might become possible in the future that I haven't even considered yet? Maybe I won't want to know how much of my personality is genetically programmed, if such a thing becomes possible. </p> <p>And \u2013 the big one \u2013 what about the risks to my privacy? Even if my DNA sequence is stripped of all personal and demographic information, the sequence itself is enough to identify me. I don't want anyone other than me, my family, possibly my doctor, and academic researchers working on projects approved by institutional research ethics boards getting their hands on those data thank you very much. But that won't necessarily be under my control.</p> <p>I'm still very interested \u2013 you might say that curiosity is in my genes. But so is caution, so I think I'll wait. Direct-to-consumer whole genome sequencing will be even cooler, you know \u2026</p>",

Photograph: Flickr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://www.flickr.com/photos/magnuscanis//Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>A recently published <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/41/14184.full.pdf+html\">study</a> by <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/news/news/item/nasty-noises-why-do-we-recoil-at-unpleasant-sounds-copy\">Newcastle University</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\">Wellcome Trust</a> has revealed interactions between the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10900/\">auditory cortex</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/amygdala.htm\">amygdala</a>, which suggests a mechanism for why we find some sounds so unpleasant. For the record, I'm sure an announcement triggering news stories about unpleasant sounds coinciding with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/david-cameron-speech-conservative-conference-verdict\">David Cameron's speech</a> was just a coincidence.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10900/\">auditory cortex</a>, as the name suggests, is responsible for processing audio stimuli, or 'sounds' as they're more commonly known. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala#Emotional_learning\">amygdala</a>, by contrast, is responsible for processing the emotional component of our experiences. \"Amygdala\" is Latin for almond, because that's what it looks like. The basic system of naming neurological regions seems to be asking \"what does it look like?\" followed by \"what's that in Latin?\" like some squishy ancient Roman version of Pictionary.</p> <p>The amygdala plays a constant and important role in our daily lives. For example, imagine I'm giving a lecture to disinterested students. Half way through, I decide to liven things up and ask a student in the front row a question. As I turn to him, my belt snaps and my trousers fall down, revealing Christmas-themed boxer shorts that I'm wearing due to not doing any laundry as a result of preparing for the lecture. I reflexively bend down to pull my trousers up, but forget my position and accidentally head-butt the student. He is knocked unconscious and collapses forward. I'm dazed by the impact too, but my trousers are still around my ankles so I end up toppling forward, onto the prone student. At this point my boss walks in, to see me, trousers down, on top of one of the students.</p> <p>Such an experience, if it happened (and it genuinely hasn't, I promise) would be mortifyingly embarrassing for me, and every time I remember it or think of it I'd no doubt be overcome by a nearly crippling sense of shame and embarrassment. The amygdala is what does this; it gives memories their <a href=\"http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/Brizendine/Phelps2004.pdf\">emotional component</a>, which is a crucial element of learning, teaching us that some things are pleasant (e.g. good food sources) and should be sought out, and some things are unpleasant and dangerous (e.g. predators, poisoned food), and should be avoided. If I had no amygdala, I would have still been embarrassed by the instant as it happened, but I wouldn't remember that element of it. My memory of it would be essentially neutral, as if I'd catalogued it away as \"Trousers-down Christmas-pants Apparent-assault incident no. 396.b\" (If I don't learn the negative consequences of the event, there's no reason I wouldn't end up repeating it)</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/news/news/item/nasty-noises-why-do-we-recoil-at-unpleasant-sounds-copy\">the recent study</a> suggests there are some sounds that we find intrinsically unpleasant, and in response to these the amygdala appears to directly modulate the auditory cortex, heightening our perception of sounds we find unpleasant. Only 13 participants were used, so it's not too encompassing, but interesting nonetheless, for numerous reasons.</p> <p>Much of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/10/newcastle-university-scientists-brain-unpleasant-sounds-reaction\">media attention</a> has focussed on the 5 sounds that participants found most unpleasant. These were:</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/wellcometrust/knife-bottle\">Knife on glass bottle</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/wellcometrust/fork-glass\">Fork on glass</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/wellcometrust/blackboard-chalk\">Chalk on a blackboard</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/wellcometrust/ruler-bottle\">Ruler on a bottle</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/wellcometrust/blackboard-nails\">Fingernails on a blackboard</a>.</p> <p>From this list, it would be easy to conclude that humans are predisposed to hate glass and blackboards. However, the link above describes them as the most unpleasant sounds in \"everyday Life\". In all honesty, when was the last time someone would have heard these sounds in daily life? Blackboards are regarded as quite old school these days (no pun intended). </p> <p>Also, \"ruler on bottle\"? How often does anyone aggressively measure a bottle? Although admittedly, this sounds like exactly the sort of thing that would come up in the lab that performed the study. Some poor overworked and underpaid postgrad, on their <a href=\"http://io9.com/5948206/here-are-the-fifteen-professions-that-drink-the-most-coffee-guess-whos-number-one\">18th cup of coffee</a>, having to check all the bottles are the same length the night before the experiment, to ensure consistency, eventually snaps and starts attacking them with the nearest instrument to hand, creating a rather unpleasant sound. </p> <p>Interestingly, all the unpleasant sounds fall within <a href=\"http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml\">the 2000-5000 hertz range</a>, suggesting we are predisposed to find this range unpleasant. It may be to do with human screams, which are usually within this range. Baby cries are often cited as one of the most distressing sounds, and as a father of a 7 month old I can confirm this. Perhaps we've evolved to find these sounds unpleasant in order to compel us to put a stop to them as soon as possible? This would have to be counterbalanced by our evolved desire to look after our young, though. There are probably many \"immediate\" ways to silence a baby, but the majority of those are unlikely to take the baby's safety into account so wouldn't be any use in preserving the species.</p> <p>Another theory I've heard is that we have evolved to find this sort of sound unpleasant as it reminds us of the cries of<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Smilodon\"> sabre toothed cats </a>and the like. Exactly how these people know what sabre toothed cats sounded like is anyone's guess. Perhaps they have access to a time machine, so could observe them directly? But saying that, if you're a scientist who invents a working time machine in order to achieve scientific success by pursuing your theories about unpleasant noises, observation clearly isn't something you're good at. </p> <p>But maybe these are learned responses, rather than intrinsic? It's impossible to say that the subjects hadn't encountered h<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118589/\">igh pitched noises in unpleasant contexts</a> before the study. I remember being told several times that there is no noise worse than nails on a blackboard, but this was before I'd heard it, so was primed to find it unpleasant when I did.</p> <p>Context is also important. A mild cough is usually a fairly irrelevant sound, but if you're in a cinema or theatre, it can be maddening. I quite like the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1zfG9No12Y\">Geordie accent</a>, especially when employed by loveable scamps <a href=\"http://www.officialantanddec.com/home\">Ant and Dec</a>, but I can't abide it when it is delivered via the medium of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Cole\">Cheryl Cole</a>. </p> <p>Overall, an interesting study, albeit one that I imagine may produce different results if repeated in 30 years' time, when the least popular noises will probably be something like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11056840\">autotuning</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq0EmbY3XyI\">Nokia Ringtone</a> and anyone singing '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/whosgio\">Go Compare</a>!'</p> <p>Although one last part does confuse me. Apparently the connection between the auditory cortex and amygdala in response to unpleasant noises were revealed via <a href=\"http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/what-is-functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-fmri/\">fMRI</a>. As someone who has taken part in numerous fMRI experiments, I would say the best place to be if you wish to be bombarded by very loud high-pitched unpleasant noises is <a href=\"http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/how-realistic-is-fmri.html\">INSIDE AN fMRI SCANNER</a>! I'm baffled as to how the experimenters managed to filter out all the high pitched noises in order to expose subjects to some high pitched noises. </p> <p>But unless they made the whole study up, they did. Isn't science brilliant!</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett considers his own voice to be a deeply unpleasant noise, so avoid it entirely by following him on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a><br></em></p>",
  "<p>In December 1981 the Observer ran Hugh McIlvanney's elegy for Muhammad Ali after the great fighter's career-ending defeat by Trevor Berbick in the Bahamas under the headline \"The king who went out on a dustcart\". Most recent accounts of the sacking of Sir Alf Ramsey as England's manager on 1 May 1974 adopt the same tone, summoning a mixture of regret and indignation at such shabby maltreatment.</p> <p>When reading the statement put out by the Football Association's international committee, under the imperious influence of Sir Harold Thompson, to announce the 1966 World Cup winner's dismissal, one concedes the validity of their disgust.</p> <p>\"Committees of the FA, which have been considering the future of English football,\" it read in Kremlin-apparatchik charmless prose, \"have examined some aspects in detail and progress has been made. At a meeting on 14 February the executive committee set up a sub committee with the following terms of reference: To consider our future policy in respect of the promotion of international football. Following meetings, a unanimous recommendation was submitted to the executive committee that Sir Alf Ramsey should be replaced as the England team manager. The recommendation was accepted unanimously by the executive committee.\" Colin Crompton could not have put it more mellifluously.</p> <p>And yet this sense of disservice is revisionist. Since April 1972, when G\u00fcnter Netzer had orchestrated West Germany's 3-1 evisceration of England at Wembley in the first leg of the European Championship quarter-final, it had become quite common to read that Ramsey had outlived his usefulness. The away leg, a 0-0 draw for which the manager had picked Arsenal's Peter Storey and Leeds United's Norman Hunter in midfield, was littered with so many England fouls that the correspondent of the biggest selling newspaper of the day, Alan Hoby of the Sunday Express, wrote: \"I felt embarrassed and ashamed by the Englishmen's violent, ugly methods.\"</p> <p>After the draw with Poland in 1973, Ramsey lingered for six months while England's absence for the first time from a World Cup finals tournament that they had deigned to enter sank in. The Poland game provoked a withering editorial from Foul magazine. \"Dirty defensive play was actually programmed into the English tactical plan before the match began \u2026 so when we say that Alf must go, it's not purely because we want to see England's football lifted out of the sterile unimaginative rut \u2026 it's not because English supporters would like to see wing-halves and flank forwards given a chance to establish themselves before they become extinct \u2026 it is because the whole idea of using illegal tactics as a defensive ploy to cover for the inadequacies at the back, and to incapacitate the opposition from keeping our forwards out, is sickening and a travesty of the way football should be played.\"</p> <p>The motive, then, was perceived as just even if the FA's method was typically ignominious. Ramsey's employers kept him hanging on for two more matches after the conclusion of the World Cup qualifying group, a 1-0 defeat at home by Italy to close 1973 in which Bobby Moore won his last cap and a 0-0 draw with Portugal in Lisbon the following spring when the manager, perhaps keen to indicate conspicuously that he was demonstrably not yesterday's man, sloughed off his hidebound reputation and gave debuts to Phil Parkes, Mike Pejic, Martin Dobson, Dave Watson, Stan Bowles and Trevor Brooking. His attempt at rejuvenation, however, was in vain. The FA had come to its decision even before England took the field at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz.</p> <p>Thompson had, according to Brian Glanville and Leo McKinstry, borne a grudge ever since Ramsey had asked the FA chairman to extinguish the cigar he was smoking at the breakfast table in the team hotel after the players had complained about the fumes. \"Sir Alf's fate was sealed from that moment,\" wrote McKinstry. Thompson, the vice-president of St John's College, Oxford, had been enraged by Ramsey's lack of deference.</p> <p>There is something hilariously hypocritical about Thompson's concept of respect and his behaviour towards England's managers. Ramsey \u2013 who was knighted in 1967, a year before Thompson \u2013 was insulted by the committeeman's insistence on always referring to him by surname alone. At an official dinner in 1976 when Don and Elsie Revie were sitting next to Thompson, Ramsey's eventual long-term successor objected to his employer's supercilious schoolmasterly form of address. \"When I get to know you better, Revie, I shall call you Don,\" Thompson pompously said. In a brilliant but reckless reply, Revie said: \"When I get to know you better, Thompson, I will call you Sir Harold.\"</p> <p>Analysing Ramsey's sacking and the part prickly relations between the two knights played in it, Glanville wrote: \"Thompson was surely right, but probably right for the wrong reasons.\" The FA settled Ramsey's \u00a37,200-a-year contract, paying the 54-year-old a lump sum of \u00a38,000 and granted him an annual pension of \u00a31,200. By comparison, when Revie was appointed he told the FA the salary might just pass muster in Division Three but First Division managers were on considerably higher wages. After negotiation, Revie and the FA settled on \u00a325,000 a year, slightly higher than the top-flight average but much less than the \u00a350,000 signing-on fee plus \u00a331,500-a-year deal Everton had offered Revie in the summer of 1973. That 240% increase on the England manager's salary was symptomatic of a governing body that had exploited Ramsey's sense of duty and it was how the FA treated him as a man rather than as a manager that drew most censure.</p> <p>For years at formal briefings Ramsey had treated criticism with contempt and adopted a brooding aloofness that conveyed his impatience and scorn. Informally he could, said David Lacey, \"be an engaging conversationalist if caught in the right mood and at the right moment\". The public, though, who were dependent on the filter of the media and the bear-baiting derision of ITV pundits such as Malcolm Allison and Brian Clough, could be forgiven for wanting a respite from Ramsey's defensiveness and taciturnity. The leading candidates to replace him \u2013 Leicester's Jimmy Bloomfield, Coventry's Gordon Milne, Gordon Jago of QPR, Burnley's Jimmy Adamson and Bolton's Jimmy Armfield \u2013 all offered the opportunity of a generational shift and most of them an affability alien to Ramsey. It was too late, though, to conclude negotiations with any of them or their clubs before the Home Championship and the summer tour, so the FA resolved to appoint a caretaker and chose the epitome of cordiality and benevolence, luring Joe Mercer out of semi-retirement as the general manager of Coventry City to hold the fort.</p> <p>The contrast with Ramsey was marked at his first press conference. \"His humour has fluttered happily about the stage recently vacated by the serious monologist,\" wrote the Observer's Peter Corrigan. \"Kind words and patted backs have added gaiety to the atmosphere and we are near the realisation of the worst fears of those who equate his temporary appointment as England team manager to Uncle Remus doing holiday relief for Genghis Khan.\"</p> <p>At the age of 59 when he agreed to take the post, Mercer had spent the past 43 years in football, first as an attacking wing-half with the Everton side who won the title in 1938-39 before losing the cream of his career to military service during the second world war, then winning two more league championships as Arsenal's captain in 1947-48 and 1952-53. After a year spent running his grocery business on retirement, he was appointed manager of Sheffield United, moving to Aston Villa following three and a half seasons at Bramall Lane.</p> <p>At Villa Park he built a competitive and talented young side who were dubbed, given the fad for alliterative nicknames such as Drake's Ducklings and the Busby Babes, the Mercer Minors. He won the first League Cup with Villa in 1961 but was sacked in July 1964 after returning from a sabbatical he had been forced to take to recover from a nervous breakdown. Although he was advised by his doctor to forgo completely the stresses of management he applied for and was appointed Manchester City's manager in 1965 where, in tandem with Allison, the visionary coach he hired as soon as he got the job, he almost went through the card in trophies \u2013 Second Division title, Football League championship, FA, League and Cup Winners' Cups.</p> <p>His contribution to City was commemorated in the Kippax tribute still sung at the Etihad to the tune of Auld Lang Syne: \"The Stretford End cried out aloud: 'It's the end of you Sky Blues.' Joe Mercer came. We played the game. We went to Rotherham, we won 1\u20130 and we were back into Division One. We've won the League, we've won the Cup, we've been to Europe too. And when we win the League again we'll sing this song to you: City, City, City.\" Note the lack of any mention for Allison there. By 1970 the coach was exasperated at the perception that his influence was inferior to Mercer's and agitated to succeed his boss. After a couple of years of politicking, with the two men aligned to battling boardroom factions, Allison got his way and Mercer was stripped of responsibility for the first team in October 1971. \"I still believe I have a lot to offer,\" he said. \"I'm a tactician not an administrator and don't really see myself as a general manager.\" But a general manager he became, seeing out the season in which City's title bid stalled after the signing of Rodney Marsh, before leaving for Coventry to mentor Milne.</p> <p>Anyone who thought that, at his age and with his mobility restricted by chronic sciatica, Mercer would be happy to take his role literally by doubling up as the team's protector and maintenance man was quickly disabused. \"I have given a lot of thought to my task,\" he said, \"and psychologically I have to make sure that the loyalty these players gave to Alf lives on for the next manager. Anything I add to the excellent organisation Alf left behind must be a natural extension of it. Tactics, after all, are there as a base from which players can express themselves naturally.\"</p> <p>The squad at his disposal had been picked by Ramsey 12 days before his sacking was announced. Mercer's demand that the 20-strong selection expressed themselves naturally and his instruction at their first gathering were the fundamentals of the philosophy he adopted for his 36 days in charge. \"Let's all at least bloody smile, eh lads?\" he said to them.</p> <p>For his first match against Wales at Ninian Park, Mercer opted for a three-man forward line of Mick Channon, Stan Bowles and Kevin Keegan, the latter winning only his third cap in three years, oddly all against Wales. Leaving out Martin Peters and thus breaking the chain with 1966, Mercer had said that he would select players of quality and verve and was true to his word. Wales, who hadn't scored a goal for 364 days, were easily outplayed but, paradoxically for David Lacey given Mercer's emphasis on attack, the defence, and Colin Todd in particular, deserved most credit. Although Bowles opened the scoring in the first half, it gave a misleading gloss to an otherwise disjointed contribution from the QPR attacker. More significantly was the identity of the second scorer, Keegan with his first for England after sticking out a foot to meet David Nish's cross. \"Having sacked the producer and thrown away the script,\" wrote Lacey in the Guardian, \"England could hardly have hoped for more than a series of impromptu sketches and if this was the sum of their ambitions they were not to be disappointed.\"</p> <p>Expected to experiment four days later against Northern Ireland at Wembley, Mercer picked the same team, again awarding Emlyn Hughes the captaincy, sticking with three of Derby County's back four and issuing Keegan with another licence to roam. But it was the player best known to Mercer, Manchester City's tireless midfield dynamo Colin Bell, who had the greatest impact by establishing dominance in midfield thanks to his tenacity for winning possession and his powerful, surging breaks upfield. Keegan, too, managed to reproduce some of his trademark club darts behind the full-backs but was too often let down by the service of a team that sent in too many crosses for one without an orthodox centre-forward, centres that Pat Jennings easily thwarted. Mercer resolved this after 55 minutes, \"at a stroke\", he said, by replacing Bowles with Leicester City's Frank Worthington who was deadly in the air, a quality his misleading reputation as a flick-obsessed showman has obscured. Fourteen minutes into his debut Worthington rose beyond the far post to direct a header from Channon's cross towards his club-mate Keith Weller who nodded the ball past Jennings in a goal conceived at Filbert Street.</p> <p>Two games for Mercer and two victories with enough grounds for optimism to keep his smiling face in the papers appended to his anointment as \"Uncle Joe\". But the real test was still to come, England's five-match run as jilted warm-up man for teams who had qualified for the World Cup in West Germany. Scotland came first but before the caretaker faced his first traditional Hampden Park reception, he had to deal with Bowles, who had absconded from the team's Welwyn hotel two nights before the game to go to the dogs at White City. Asked by a reporter who spotted him whether he intended to return to fly to Scotland the next day, he said: \"No.\" He later rang Mercer to apologise and issued a statement saying: \"I left the England party yesterday because I was sick and depressed. It has always been my ambition to play for England, particularly at Wembley, and no one can know how I felt when I was taken off.\" Mercer accepted the apology, saying: \"It's sad isn't it?\" then told Bowles there was no way back under his management.</p> <p>Worthington started against Scotland in Bowles's place, with Peters in for Keegan and Norman Hunter for the injured Roy McFarland, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhlMg6-jAFU\" title=\"\">but England failed comprehensively on a sodden pitch</a> to match Scotland's flexibility, the pace of the rampaging full-backs Danny McGrain and Sandy Jardine and the central midfield control seized by Billy Bremner and Davie Hay. They were 2-0 down after 30 minutes and, though Dave Watson's introduction at half-time to replace Hunter and end the experiment with two No6s at the heart of defence, stemmed the Scottish tide, the nearest England came to goals were rare headers from Peters and Worthington. Lacey, citing Harold Pinter's The Caretaker, highlighted the team's lack of fluency: \"England did not play badly in their makeshift mundane way; but in the hands of their caretaker they have become a team of Davises, each with an idea of how to get to Sidcup, none with the means, on his own, of putting the operation into practice.\"</p> <p>Argentina's visit to Wembley on the Wednesday night following the defeat at Hampden Park was their first since the ill-tempered World Cup quarter-final in 1966 that is for ever linked with Antonio Ratt\u00edn's sending-off and Ramsey's excoriation of England's opponents as \"animals\". So raw were Argentina's wounds that they agreed to stop off en route to West Germany only if an Argentinian refereed the game. This precondition proved crucial.</p> <p>With Nish injured, Hughes moved to right-back where he was partnered, on the opposite flank, by his Anfield team-mate Alec Lindsay. Keegan, Channon and Worthington were given the opportunity to impress up front, with the graceful Brooking, after a long campaign by Glanville, at last given the role of midfield creator to dovetail with Keegan's clever exploitation of space. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRXX-bjMJIk\" title=\"\">England went ahead seconds before half-time</a>, Bell rolling a pass behind Argentina's defence for Channon to race on to, round the keeper and score. As the players trooped off for half-time, Hughes pushed his counterpart, the captain Roberto Perfumo, in the midst of an argument, only for his other counterpart, the right-back Rub\u00e9n Glaria, to end the row by smacking Hughes in the face. Remarkably the referee, Arturo Iturralde, chose to ignore this and Argentina defused the situation by replacing Glaria for the second half.</p> <p>England's slick passing and movement made another inroad 10 minutes after the break from a corner won when Worthington latched on to Brooking's excellent penetrative pass. Keegan took it short and when the ball was clipped into the penalty area it bounced up in front of Bell who smashed a shot against the underside of the crossbar and left Worthington to turn the ball in with an acrobatic flick of his left foot. Mario Kempes got one back four minutes later, steering home his shot from 15-yards after Peter Shilton had palmed out a cross to his feet. But with only a minute of the match remaining and England looking more confident and commanding than they had done for more than a year against such good opposition, Kempes struck again. Having taken too much time to control Ren\u00e9 Houseman's cross, Kempes was tackled by Hughes, seemingly fairly. But such was the flourish with which the centre-forward threw himself to the turf, the referee, Kempes's countryman, was persuaded to award a penalty despite the England captain's impassioned protestations. The crowd clearly thought Kempes had dived, booing him as he ran up to take the penalty, continuing after he smacked it past Shilton and building to a climax moments later at the conclusion of the match. Yet despite conceding an undeserved draw, England's spirit, coherence and occasional flamboyance suggested the players were beginning to break the bonds of caution and rigidity.</p> <p>Mercer flew with the squad to Leipzig for the first leg of their tour, where they took on East Germany, who would defeat their neighbours, hosts and eventual winners, West Germany, in the group stage of the World Cup. After playing in all four of Mercer's games, Keith Weller's international career ended with him being dropped for Martin Dobson who won his second cap, this time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9VvKoRyhE\" title=\"\">in front of a crowd of 100,000 at Zentralstadion</a>.</p> <p>With Worthington, Keegan and Channon again selected up front, as they would be for all three games in eastern Europe, England picked up where they had left off against Argentina, tearing the East Germany defence apart and beating a tattoo on the woodwork, hitting the bar and a post twice each. The movement of the front three caused havoc, creating opportunities for Dobson, Brooking and Bell to shoot as well as repeatedly carving out chances for themselves. And yet they fell behind in the second half to Joachim Streich's goal 24 minutes from time. It took 90 seconds for England to rally, Channon equalising direct from a free-kick with a scorching shot, and though a draw was disappointing given their excellence and ebullience, Mercer was heartened by the performance. \"We hit the woodwork more times than a team of lumberjacks,\" he said ruefully. \"An old-fashioned manager and old-fashioned posts.\"</p> <p>In the Observer Corrigan noted that the caretaker had been treated to a bottle of champagne after the match to celebrate England's exhilarating display. \"The cork popped with such force it hit the ceiling and rebounded into the company. 'Christ, we've hit the post again,' Mercer said.\" With a spirit of adventure restored to the side, one shy FA official told Lacey: \"I haven't enjoyed a game so much for years.\"</p> <p>Keeping the same lineup for the match in Sofia against Bulgaria, England came away with a 1-0 victory that flattered their hosts. Again the interchanging of Keegan, Worthington and Channon flummoxed the opposition and, with Bell, Dobson and Brooking sharing an ability to find the front men, England destroyed the Bulgarian defenders' positional discipline. Worthington scored by beating the offside trap before calmly finishing when one-on-one with the keeper but it was Channon's marauding running and deft manipulation of the ball that enchanted the crowd.</p> <p>Apart from a problem over accommodation in Sofia, eventually sorted out when the squad was given the press's hotel and the journalists each given three bottles of beer to compensate for their relegation for a night into inferior digs, there had been no hitches on the tour. All that changed the morning after they had defeated Bulgaria when they arrived at Belgrade airport. Keegan, like the rest of the squad, was not wearing his England tie or blazer, a sartorial lapse with unpleasant consequences. While waiting for his luggage he sat down near the baggage carousel while a couple of his team-mates messed about on the conveyor belt. Keegan was promptly arrested by Yugoslavia's border police and taken to a back room, where he was punched, kicked and truncheoned before being charged with sexually assaulting a stewardess, a further assault on a guard, disturbing the peace and causing an obstruction. The players refused to abandon him to his fate and FA officials, British embassy staff and Mercer eventually persuaded Keegan's captors that he was innocent and should be released.</p> <p>Keegan, battered, bleeding and shaken, was not, however, spooked by his experience when he took the field. Keeping an unchanged side for the third game in succession England once again impressed, this time as much for their fortitude as their new-found attacking adroitness. Channon put them 1-0 up from a corner before Yugoslavia had hit their stride, spurring the hosts to up the ante with some sublime, inventive passing and intelligent runs. They equalised before half-time and took the lead when Brane Oblak hit a thunderous 25-yard shot past Ray Clemence in the second half.</p> <p>England, less assured than they had been during the preceding three games, attempted to gain a foothold back in the match by using Channon's pace to try to stretch the opposition defence but they were too canny and too often ushered him down culs de sac. Throwing on a substitute for the first time since Hampden, Mercer sent on Malcolm MacDonald for Worthington and after 10 minutes the replacement found Keegan, who scored England's second with a thumping diving header. At the death MacDonald bullocked through the offside trap only to spurn the chance to win the match by snatching at his shot and England ended the tour with a creditable draw.</p> <p>And that was the end of Mercer's mission. The FA was so impressed by the friendly atmosphere he had fostered that questions about the possibility of Mercer taking the job on a longer-term basis, with his Coventry protege Gordon Milne as the straight man in the double act, were not immediately quashed. Mercer, too, seemed open to persuasion but the FA was working on another plan, putting out feelers to the most successful English club manager available, Leeds United's Revie, which ultimately proved fruitful even if Lancaster Gate subsequently had grave cause to regret its choice.</p> <p>Mercer went back to Highfield Road, thanked for putting the smile back on the face of English football during what Glanville vividly called his \"beguiling interregnum\" . Moreover he had established a platform for more free-wheeling talents in the side, a sadly short-lived achievement as far as Worthington was concerned but one which benefited Keegan and Channon. Just as importantly, though it proved ephemeral, was giving England their dignity back on the eve of a World Cup at which they would be bystanders. It had been all very well for England to refuse invitations to the World Cup before the second world war but one must emphasise how deep the sense of humiliation felt was by the realisation that they were too damn ugly to attend the global television party.</p> <p>\"I didn't want this bloody job in the first place,\" Mercer had told the players, naturally with a smile, at their first meeting. By succeeding at restoring their reputation, however briefly, the reluctant caretaker did more than keep the house in order. He gave them a blueprint for renovation that was disastrously ignored when the caution and anxiety he had temporarily banished returned with a vengeance.</p>",
  "<p><em>Every day, I back my MacBook Pro up to an external hard drive. I get back from holiday to a reminder that Time Machine isn't backing up because it can't find the external hard drive. I look across my desk and realise it's missing. The only thing I can think of is that it's fallen off the desk into the bin, and it's possible that my cleaning lady emptied it. What should I do if my backup disk, which contains everything I've ever done on my computer, has been thrown away with the rubbish? Is it a major security risk? Is there anything I can do except pray it's been destroyed in the council crushers?</em><br><strong>Name withheld</strong></p> <p>It took me a while to understand this question because, as originally phrased, I imagined the drive had somehow fallen into the Mac OS X Trash folder, rather than a physical waste basket. Also, if that happened to one of my external hard drives (EHDs), I reckon it would be obvious because it would still be attached by both a USB cable and a power cable. However, NW says it was a small, portable USB-powered drive and that the USB cable could have become detached.</p> <p>The first lesson is that every hard drive is a security risk, because if it falls into someone else's hands, they can read the data. For this reason, large companies prefer to use laptops with encrypted hard drives, and in many cases, the backup procedure will offer the option. If you chose (or were able to choose) <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4255?viewlocale=en_US\">encrypted backup</a> then your data is safe. The drive cannot be read without the password.</p> <p>If you don't do this at the time, you can encrypt a drive later. In Mac OS X Finder, right-click the drive and select Encrypt from the drop-down menu.</p> <p>But most people don't encrypt hard drives, including me, and it may slow the system down. </p> <p>If someone does find your drive then they will be able to read the data by connecting it to another Mac. However, they are statistically more likely to plug it into a Windows PC, and Windows cannot read the HFS+ format \u2013 also known as Mac OS Extended (Journalled) \u2013 used by Time Machine\u2026 unless they install something like <a href=\"http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive\">MacDrive</a> as well. It's pot luck whether someone would make the effort.</p> <p>Incidentally, some EHD manufacturers still ship drives that are preformatted using Microsoft's FAT32 system, which can be read by all versions of Mac OS X and Windows. Some may use the improved exFAT version, which can be read by Macs running 10.6.5 (Snow Leopard) and PCs running Windows XP SP3, or later.</p> <p>For safety's sake, it would be a good idea to change any passwords and other things that someone might be able to extract from browsers or emails on your hard drive. Indeed, this would be a good thing to do even if you hadn't lost a drive. Most of us have accumulated passwords over five or 10 years, and the older ones may be quite weak by today's standards.</p> <p>The speed of computer processors has increased dramatically over the past five years, and this means it's much easier to crack passwords than it used to be. Also, password cracking programs have become much more sophisticated. They don't just use dictionaries and common passwords (123456, password, welcome, sunshine), they also target common password formations (monkey72, yeknom72 etc) and the use of haxor characters (m0nk3y72, p455w0rd etc), which is known as leet (1337) or leetspeak. </p> <p>Every time a website leaks a few million passwords, the crackers learn more about the way people create passwords. They've been learning a lot recently.</p> <p>The simplest way to make a password harder to crack is to make it longer, as an <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/936/\">XKCD</a> cartoon explains. Today's passwords should be at least 10 characters long and preferably include a mixture of characters, not just lower case letters. Having started using 9-character alphanumeric passwords in the mid-90s, I'm thinking of upgrading to 12. This would extend the \"brute force\" cracking time of a lower case random (non-dictionary) password from a few days to about a century.</p> <p>You should also think about your backup procedures. Time Machine provides a backup on an EHD, but a thief could have stolen both the laptop and the backup, or the house could have been affected by some other disaster (fire, flood, typhoon, whatever). This is why sensible companies always ensure they have an off-site backup.</p> <p>Individuals can tackle this in different ways. For example, before going on holiday, you could have left your backup drive with a relative or trusted neighbour. (This is where encrypted hard drives really score.) An alternative is to back up some or all of your hard drive to an online \"cloud\" service. <a href=\"http://mozy.co.uk/\">Mozy</a> was set up for this purpose, but alternatives include <a href=\"http://www.backblaze.com/\">BackBlaze</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carbonite.com/\">Carbonite</a> and <a href=\"http://crashplan.co.uk/\">CrashPlan</a>.</p> <p>Online storage is always \"off site\" but it has disadvantages. It can take a very long time to upload your data, and if your computer fails, it's nothing like as handy as having a bootable external drive. However, it can be useful if you don't have terabytes of data.</p> <p>At this point, it might be helpful to understand the difference between backups and archives. A backup is a copy \u2013 perhaps a \"carbon copy\" \u2013 of the stuff your computer, including the operating system and software. However, these are replaceable. What you can't replace is your historical data, so this should be archived to a suitable storage medium. People usually use DVD or CD-Rom discs, but a second EHD is an option, and SD cards are becoming increasingly attractive. (See my previous answer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2011/jun/02/ask-jack-digital-photos-backup\">Backing up digital photos</a>.)</p> <p>In other words, a backup is a short-term insurance policy, while an archive is a long-term repository. Your backups will change on an hourly or daily basis, whereas your archives may not change for decades.</p> <p>In many cases, backup needs are quite modest (a few documents created, spreadsheets updated etc) while the archives are huge (multiple gigabytes of music and movie files, photographs, financial records and so on). If you are in this situation, you can use an online site to back up the stuff you're actually using while keeping archive copies of the old stuff on DVDs. </p> <p>Amazon has recently launched <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/\">Glacier</a> to provide cheap online archiving, but that's still only one copy. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/feb/14/email.yahoo\">Schofield's Second Law of Computing</a> asserts, data doesn't really exist unless you have two copies of it. Preferably more.</p>",

  "<p>Russell T Davies's new CBBC project, arriving on screen later this month, is a simple pitch encapsulated in a Ronseal title: Wizards vs Aliens. It's Harry Potter meets Doctor Who. As Davies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/28/doctor-who-russell-t-davies\" title=\"\">told the Observer</a> earlier this year: \"The only thing that could make Harry Potter better, in my view, would be if a big spaceship arrives at the door of Hogwarts, but it never does. It does in ours, in episode one.\"</p> <p>The show, which Davies created with his Doctor Who and Sarah Jane Adventures collaborator, writer Phil Ford, is centred around a wizard called Tom (Scott Haran), a 16-year-old schoolboy who lives with his mugg \u2026 um, \"un-enchanted\" father and sorceress grandmother (Annette Badland). Tom is caught up in a desperate fight for the wizarding world's survival against the Nekross: an alien race that roams the cosmos to gorge on magic. It's a straightforward setup, but one that establishes its background, rules and mysteries with ease. What happened to Tom's mother, for instance? What's the Nekross king's master-plan? And just what is all this magic&#xa0;malarkey&#xa0;anyway?</p> <p>Comparisons are easy, but Wizards vs Aliens doesn't feel like a replacement for The Sarah Jane Adventures, which came to an end following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/19/elisabeth-sladen-doctor-who-star-dies\" title=\"\">the death of the show's star</a>, Elisabeth Sladen, last year. The opening two episodes seem to have their own identity: a lighter, whimsical tone more obviously aimed at 7- to 12-year-olds than the darker themes of Alzheimer's, homelessness and loss that The Sarah Jane Adventures tackled.</p> <p>It went down marvellously with children at a screening of the show last week. \"Can we watch it again?\" one girl giddily asked Ford afterwards. Adults may also find much to like: if the Steven Moffat Doctor Who era has left you cold, then this might feel like a blast from the very best of Russell T Davies's past.</p> <p>Davies and Ford came up with the idea while discussing the limitations of writing Doctor Who \u2013 a show that looks to science (believe it or not) rather than magic. The conclusion? To fuse the two. Hence the opening, in which a magic ritual is rudely interrupted by the appearance of an enormous mothership \u2013 introducing not only the central elements of the show, but also the scale and ambition of the project. For while the writing is sharp, clever and imaginative, this is also one of the biggest productions children's TV has ever seen.</p> <p>The Sarah Jane Adventures was relatively high-end in terms of children's TV \u2013 but Wizards vs Aliens has set pieces (its biggest is a cheeky nod to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), prosthetics and special effects that wouldn't look out of place in Doctor Who itself. The only exception, oddly, being Brian Blessed's Nekross king \u2013 less Jabba the Hutt, more Jabba the Sentient Whoopee Cushion.</p> <p>The show feels like an evolution of premium children's drama that began with the Sarah Jane Adventures and will hopefully go on to include other high-concept children's programmes. Because while shows such as Horrible Histories and Tracy Beaker \u2013 both adaptations \u2013 may be clever, mature examples of how children's TV has grown up, science fiction arguably brings with it more risk. At a time when CBBC has lost its BBC1 slot and original children's programming is so sparse \u2013 an \"endangered species\", as Davies himself has called it \u2013 that's a risk worth taking. </p> <p>And here, magically, it appears to have paid off.</p>",

  "<p>Matt Damon is set to make a follically challenged appearance in Terry Gilliam's forthcoming dystopian fantasy The Zero Theorem, the actor has revealed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/matt-damon-has-a-small-part-in-the-zero-theorem.html\" title=\"\">Speaking to the Vulture blog</a>, Damon said he was looking forward to working with Gilliam for the first time in a decade. The pair previously collaborated on the US-born director's 2005 adventure-fantasy The Brothers Grimm.</p> <p>Damon said the former Python had been keen to make use of his recently shaved pate: Damon cut all his hair off for an upcoming science fiction project, Elysium. The Bourne Ultimatum star said his role in Gilliam's film would be a small one, but added that he would \"do anything for Terry\".</p> <p>\"I wrote Terry this whole email, because we had this whole conversation about what the character would look like,\" Damon said. \"Because the story takes place in the future, he had a specific look that he wanted.</p> <p>\"But then I had to [points to shaved head], and I said, 'Terry, what should we do?' And he said, 'Actually, we can take advantage of the fact that your head is shaved. Why don't we change your hairline?' So he mocked up a picture and sent me a real receding hairline, with white spiked hair. 'We might as well take advantage of the fact that you're bald and really do something, present you in a way you've never been seen before.'\"</p> <p>Damon's cameo recalls that of Tom Cruise as the balding, foul-mouthed Hollywood producer Len Grossman in Ben Stiller's 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder. Johnny Depp also went bald for his turn as Hunter S Thompson in Gilliam's 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The Zero Theorem, a fantasy starring Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz as an eccentric computer genius trying to discover the meaning of life, is about to start shooting in Bucharest. The film also features Tilda Swinton and David Thewlis in undisclosed roles. <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a410414/tilda-swinton-david-thewlis-join-terry-gilliams-the-zero-theorem.html\" title=\"\">Gilliam said recently</a>: \"The main character is literally living in this burnt-out chapel which one could take as a metaphor for old beliefs and old systems. He's a computer genius but he's just sitting there waiting for a phone call, which he's hoping will give meaning to his life.</p> <p>\"It really is about relationships, and discovering what's really important in life \u2026 two-thirds of it \u2013 if not more \u2013 take place in a ruined chapel.\"</p> <p>Gilliam has also revealed the look of the chapel, as well as various other buildings that will feature in the film, on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Terry.Gilliam\" title=\"\">his Facebook page</a>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2011/12/14/update-on-measures-to-tackle-bovine-tb/\" title=\"\">decision to cull badgers as one component of the government's policy to eradicate bovine tuberculosis (TB)</a> is undoubtedly emotive but it has not been taken lightly. The furore over culling badgers is distracting attention from the real problem.</p> <p>Bovine TB is a serious disease that can infect many mammals, including goats, pigs, alpacas and even in a small number of cases, people. Its incidence has been increasing steadily since the 1980s.</p> <p>What was once a disease isolated to small pockets has now spread to vast swaths of south-west and western England. The number of new cases has doubled every nine years. In 2011, 3,741 new cattle herd cases were reported. Even the culling of up to 26,000 cattle each year to reduce the spread of the infection within the national herd has not stopped this relentless increase.</p> <p>Understandably, many people object to culling badgers, but this decision by ministers was taken based on the best available scientific evidence after more than 15 years of intensive research.</p> <p>Evidence from other countries with bovine TB, such as Australia and New Zealand, shows that TB in cattle cannot be controlled without also controlling the disease in wildlife that act as a reservoir for the disease.</p> <p>Research in England has demonstrated that cattle and badgers transmit the disease to each other. It also showed culling badgers leads to a reduction of the disease in cattle if it is carried out over a large enough area and for a sufficient length of time.</p> <p>There has been debate as to why the policy does not exactly replicate the field studies previously carried out, and therefore how we can be confident of achieving comparable results. But rarely will any trial in any area of scientific research provide an exact replica of its planned use in real life. Instead, what is important is that the research provides enough evidence of the likely outcome so that decisions on its application can be taken confidently. In this case, the science tells us that badger culling can play a significant positive role in reducing the spread of TB.</p> <p>The two pilot areas where culling will initially take place will enable us to test our assumptions about the effectiveness, safety and humaneness of culling by means of controlled shooting. They will be overseen and evaluated by an independent panel of experts who will report their findings to ministers. The costs and the benefits of the approach being piloted have been assessed both in terms of the financial implications and the difference this will make to the progression of the disease in cattle.</p> <p>This application of what we have learned from careful scientific experimentation includes measures to counteract some of the problems that have been highlighted by those studies. Culling will only be permitted in areas sufficiently large that the impact of any short term increased incidence of disease - from disruption to the badger population - is outweighed by the long-term benefit in the culled area. Farmers proposing to cull must also apply management measures to reduce the risk of spread of disease between badgers and cattle, and culled areas must be planned to reduce as much as possible the likelihood, or impact of, increased movement of badgers.</p> <p>We have made it clear that these culls alone will not solve the problem of TB in cattle. There is no single solution and they represent part of a comprehensive package of measures that the government is taking to arrest the increase in new bovine TB cases.</p> <p>In high-risk areas herds are tested annually and any cattle that test positive are removed. Herds with infected cattle are tested more frequently until all the cattle that test positive have been removed. Restrictions on cattle movements have been strengthened to reduce the chance of disease spreading from cattle to cattle, and we continue to look at ways we can improve cattle TB testing.</p> <p>Farmers are taking measures to stop badgers from contacting their cattle and are beginning to assess the risk of buying cattle from herds that are at high risk of being infected. While these measures are helping to slow the advance of bovine TB, without further action they alone cannot solve the problem.</p> <p>Some solutions are more readily available than others. Many people have argued that we should be using vaccines to tackle the problem. But vaccines are not a panacea.</p> <p>The government has funded, developed and licensed an injectable badger vaccine, but it has its limitations. Badgers need to be trapped before they can be vaccinated, and the process will need to be repeated annually for many years, which makes it extremely expensive to use. The vaccine is not 100% effective in preventing TB, and is ineffective in animals that are already infected with TB and that will continue to spread disease. So current vaccines will not be as effective as culling in reducing spread of the disease from badgers to cattle.</p> <p>We are planning to invest a further \u00a315.5m in vaccine development over the next four years to continue to develop both an oral vaccine for badgers, which may be cheaper and easier to use, and a vaccine for cattle. But it will be several years at least before either of these methods are available and we cannot afford to wait for them.</p> <p>We must not lose sight of the problem that we are trying to address. We are tackling a very resilient pathogenic micro-organism, <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em>. Badgers are an excellent reservoir host for this bacterium because they can often carry and spread the TB bacterium without showing signs of disease or without serious illness.</p> <p>The rapid spread of this disease is one of the biggest threats to our dairy and cattle farmers. Few would argue against the need to arrest the progression of this disease throughout the English countryside. The task of managing the disease and bringing it under control will not be easy. We need to use all the methods available to us and continue to develop new methods if we are going to succeed.</p> <p>\u2022 Professor Ian Boyd is Defra's chief scientific adviser and Nigel Gibbens is the chief veterinary officer</p>",
  "<p>Millions of workers could end up automatically enrolled into high cost and poor performing pensions because employers do not get enough help in finding value-for-money schemes, a report has warned.</p> <p>Since 1 October employers of large companies have been bound by law to enrol employees into a workplace pension scheme, with set rules on how much should be contributed.</p> <p>The auto-enrolment rules are set to be rolled out to smaller employers over the next six years in a bid to encourage more people to save for retirement, but the report published by the Pensions Institute at Cass Business School warns that some members could end up missing out on valuable retirement income due to the scheme their employer has selected.</p> <p>The report looked at existing schemes and found that thousands of employees were paying charges adding up to 3%, which is six times the charge available on some pensions.</p> <p>It said analysis of retirement incomes of those in the high charging schemes showed they \"will be worth only about an average of 50% of the income achieved by members in low charging schemes after 40 years of membership\".</p> <p>Pension savers with employers who already run schemes could face the biggest charges, as even if their employer has opened a new lower cost pension they may have existing savings in the old scheme.</p> <p>The report also argued that an \"advice gap\" for smaller employers has been created as an unintended consequence of auto-enrolment, combined with the retail distribution review which will ban adviser sales commission on schemes sold from 1 January.</p> <p>It suggested the introduction of a kite-mark code could help smaller employers seek out schemes which represent best value for money.</p> <p>Professor David Blake, director of the Pensions Institute, said there is some time to tackle the problem as many smaller companies do not need to implement auto-enrolment until mid- to late-2013.</p> <p>\"A clearly signposted kite-mark website for good quality value-for-money schemes, available to all employers irrespective of their size and employee profile, would facilitate fair and equal treatment for all private sector employees,\" he said.</p> <p>The report, titled Caveat Venditor, argues that auto-enrolment should be governed by the principle of seller not buyer beware. As employees are passively auto-enrolled into schemes they are \"buying blind\", it said.</p> <p>Chris Daykin, trustee director of Now: Pensions, which sponsored the research, said: \"'Let the seller beware' puts the onus on the seller to ensure its product will do what it says on the tin: to produce a lifetime income in retirement that is fair value relative to the contributions paid.\"</p> <h2>Old age poverty crisis</h2> <p>Auto-enrolment aims to tackle growing concerns about an old age poverty crisis, as people live for longer but fail to put enough away for their later years.</p> <p>Recent official figures show the number of private sector workers paying into a pension is at its lowest since records began in 1953. In 2011 just 2.9 million private sector workers put money into schemes, the first time active membership dipped below three million.</p> <p>More than half-a-million people will be saving for the first time into a workplace pension by Christmas under auto-enrolment, according to government estimates.</p> <p>Steve Webb, minister for pensions, said: \"I am watching pension charges like a hawk. The creation of Nest [a not-for-profit pension scheme set up under the new rules] has prompted new low-cost offers in the market, which is encouraging.</p> <p>\"But I am concerned about charges in legacy schemes and have challenged the industry to bring these into line with new business. I have the power to cap charges and will do so to protect consumers if I need to.\"</p> <p>Tom McPhail, a pensions expert at IF Hargreaves Lansdown, agreed there was a risk that failure to regulate auto-enrolment schemes could lead to poor results for members. However, he dismissed some of the report's findings.</p> <p>\"The report makes some rather hyped up claims regarding pension charges and <a href=\"http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/report_abstracts/rr_abstracts/rra_804.asp\" title=\"Department for Work and Pensions\">seems to ignore the recent DWP research</a> which shows that average pension charges for workplace pensions are now below 1%,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are concerned that as the Pensions Institute so readily dismisses investment performance and good member engagement as factors affecting pension payouts, it also fails to address the importance of employers providing their employees with an effective shopping around process at the point of retirement.\"</p> <p>He said he felt a price cap of 0.5% \"would stifle innovation, undermine member service and communication and ultimately it would lead to poorer member outcomes\".</p>",

  "<p>This week videogames reminded me of the virtue of patience. Every second triple-A title contains enough high-octane shenanigans to shatter the thin film of glass on my TV set, prompting me to duck lest a kitchen sink hit me in the face.</p> <p>Games with guns hardly give you a chance to pause for a breath these days, so it's been refreshing this week to see two genuinely entertaining titles that prize a little cognitive thought on my part before I pull the trigger. The first is Arkane's Steampunk yarn, Dishonored \u2013<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/oct/08/dishonored-review\" title=\"\"> already reviewed here</a> by Simon Parkin. The second is XCOM: Enemy Unknown.</p> <p>XCOM, in case you're hearing about it for the first time, is the latest entry in a series of point and click, turn-based strategy games, the first of which was 1994's UFO: Enemy Unknown. The plot is pretty straight-forward: aliens are invading planet earth and the player, as the commander of an international defence initiative called XCOM, is charged with repelling the off-world cads. The way they go about this is by managing XCOM's finances and resources, and deploying soldiers to take down the alien threat wherever it appears on planet earth.</p> <p>When the latter occurs, players take control of a team of troops pitted against a selection of alien enemies. Battles take place from an inclined, top-down perspective that the player can swivel to show cover points and raised platforms from different perspectives. Most of the map is shrouded in a fog when the player's forces enter it, but as they progress through the mission, more and more is revealed to them \u2013 including the aliens lurking in the distance. The game tosses in the odd animation of aliens shrieking or a marine dashing through the map to ratchet up the tension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397559905\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/columnists/2012/10/11/1349948850008/XCOM-Enemy-Unknown-008.jpg\" alt=\"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ground missions in XCOM are tense, drawn-out affairs where stoic patience and nerves of steel are required. The temptation to send a team of grunts storming into a UFO crash site or alien base is something players will need to rein in; if you do this, your soldiers will die \u2013 simple as that. The best way of navigating the battles is to shore up your team's flanks and try to outmanoeuvre and out-position any enemy forces while keeping in cover.</p> <p>When combat happens, it tends to be quick, brutal and bloody. The alien AI does its best to out-flank the player's squad and both sides have weapons that can shoot through or completely blast away cover. When an enemy enters the player's line of sight, the game takes into account their troop's position, the weapon they're using and their overall skill level and then assigns them a hit percentage. This means opening fire on some targets can be risky; do you take the shot where you have a 45% chance of hitting a target? Or do you leg it back into cover? Make the wrong choice and your troop could get turned into paint pretty quickly.</p> <p>The stakes in every mission are raised considerably as the player progresses further into the game. Every soldier who makes it back alive from a mission gains experience points, which the player can use to unlock abilities depending on what class they are \u2013 be it the ability to target enemies in their team-mates' lines of sight (sniper) or faster movement between cover (squaddie).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397559906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/columnists/2012/10/11/1349948783559/XCOM-Enemy-Unknown-008.jpg\" alt=\"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As troops level up, they even acquire nicknames, making any death suffered on the battlefield feel more personal. There's even a shot-glass-laden memorial wall in the base barracks, complete with bagpipes on the soundtrack to hammer home the sense of loss.</p> <p>Back at the base, the player's second main concern is managing XCOM's operations and equipment and their decisions have a huge impact on the effectiveness of their troops. As the base's research department conducts autopsies on alien cadavers and examines artefacts, equipment and ship fragments brought back to the base, the engineering department is able to build tougher armour, more lethal weapons and better field equipment and vehicles.</p> <p>Players also have the option of building new sections on to their base such as satellite uplinks, a foundry and more laboratories, which in turn increase XCOM's ability to better patrol the skies above earth, build better weapons and open up more equipment options.</p> <p>At the start of the game, players are assigned a budget from member states of XCOM, and it's up to them to decide how to spend it. They're also tasked with deciding when and where to deploy the XCOM troops, which can have a profound affect on the funds coming in. If they ignore the pleas of certain nations where abductions or terror attacks are taking place, the panic-levels of those countries will rise and they'll eventually pull out of the XCOM project, cutting the all-too-crucial funding. Running XCOM is as much a managerial and political juggling act as it is a tactical affair.</p> <p>Newcomers should take heed; XCOM is merciless. Normal difficulty offers a pretty decent challenge where the player starts off on the back-foot and only gains the upper hand through savvy management and tactical awareness on the battlefield. However, the jump between that experience and Classic or Ironman \u2013 where it's possible to see nations pull funding at a furious rate \u2013 is marked. I haven't attempted the Impossible difficulty setting yet and I'll admit it's because I'm terrified of the prospect. I'd rather take my chances against human foes in the multiplayer where I'll likely stand more of a fighting chance.</p> <p>The game's presentation rides the line between slightly cartoon-like and darkly sinister. Firaxis seems to have mined the classics of sci-fi cinema and vintage pulp comic books for the look and feel of their game. Some of the bulb-headed aliens look cute to begin with, for example, but this impression fades fast when you've seen them reduce your favourite squaddie to a bloody pile of innards with a single laser blast. The voice acting is superb and the script is peppered with a ton of in-jokes and asides. The game's score deserves a mention too, piping in atmospheric synth-lines as the XCOM troops feel their way through different terrains, and then driving percussion and pomp when battles finally take place.</p> <p>While the game's natural home is on the PC, the console versions are just as enjoyable. Unlike other attempts at strategy games on consoles (Halo Wars, anyone?) the developers have made the interface feel intuitive and easy to get to grips with. There's a slight snapping effect which occurs when players try to direct the path of a troop that can cause minor irritation, but it's by no means a deal-breaker.</p> <p>There's really only one flaw XCOM has, and that's the timing of its release. The game arrives as the industry's heavyweight triple-A titles start jockeying for position in the Christmas retail release window. This is rather a pity, because it would a complete miscarriage of justice if XCOM slipped under the radar. It doesn't have the brand power of games such as Halo 4, Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 or Assassin's Creed III, but XCOM deserves to sell as many copies as they do. For those players who can exercise a little patience and restraint, it's quite simply one of the best games you'll play all year.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p>I've worked in the sexual and reproductive health and rights sector for more years than I care to mention. It's a sector whose interests I am deeply passionate about promoting, but it is one that often causes me immense frustration.</p> <p>I feel particularly frustrated today on the <a href=\"http://dayofthegirl.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Day of the Girl</a>. It is commendable that we should have a \"day of the girl\"; it is essential that we get the world to sit up and take notice of how girls are neglected, marginalised, abused and discriminated against. It is crucial that we make it absolutely and utterly clear once and for all that forced sex of any sort, at any time, under any circumstances, is unacceptable. It is critical for us to focus on ending child marriage because it violates millions of girls' rights, disrupts their education, jeopardises their health, and denies them their childhood.</p> <p>And yet \u2026 something obvious is missing in all our sincere and potentially effective efforts towards ending child marriage. This month the UK <a href=\"http://www.appg-popdevrh.org.uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">all-party parliamentary group on population, development and reproductive health</a> produced A Childhood Lost - A Report on Child Marriage in the UK and the Developing World; if you haven't time to read its 50 pages, here is the gist of the recommendations:</p> <blockquote> Enforce international conventions on the rights of the child/prevention of violence/minimum age; improve, implement and reform laws on divorce, inheritance and property ownership to give women equal rights; improve registration of births and marriages; scale up high quality education and ensure girls get equal access and hence equal opportunity; invest in programmes to make communities aware of the risks of child marriage and to effect attitudinal and behavioural change; fund shelters for women and girls affected by child marriage; invest in rolling out and scaling up programmes to prevent child marriage and support those at risk or already affected; fund research on the scale of child marriage and its consequences. </blockquote> <p>These are all sound, essential, well-considered recommendations. They focus on legal, administrative and infrastructure change as a means to achieve the goal of ending child marriage. In particular, what is pivotal to all these recommendations is establishing an internationally agreed marriageable age. These are critical steps to fixing a framework for moving forward.</p> <p>This is absolutely fine. I have no cavil with it whatsoever. But \u2013 and here we come to the obvious omission \u2013 we have an unaddressed issue which is that of the age of consent: the age when you are legally allowed to have sex. As countries begin to amend the marriageable age, many amend the age of consent so the two align, if that is not already the case. Sex is regarded as something that can only start to happen when a marriage certificate is in place. This has two consequences: those who have sex before marriage are stigmatised, criminalised and rejected. And since sex before marriage is not supposed to happen, those who have sex before marriage often have no access to sexual health services because of laws, the attitudes of service providers, or because they are too afraid to go there.</p> <p>You end up in the ridiculous situation in which a married girl of 16 can access contraceptive advice and services, while an unmarried 18-year-old is barred from doing so.</p> <p>This is completely nonsensical, and ignores some of the most fundamental and obvious facts about sex and young people. Young people are curious. They are curious about sex. And they'll do it regardless of any social and religious strictures: young people will always find a way round any impediments of that sort, if they truly want something. This is something the sexual and reproductive health and rights community needs to dare to discuss properly and directly, and soon. Unless we genuinely, sincerely and openly accept and understand that young people want to have sex and do have sex, then setting a globally agreed legal age of marriage at 18 is only dealing with half the issue.</p> <p>The question of age of consent has to be built into any recommendations aimed at banishing the abuses of early marriage. Some people will probably see it as off-topic but it should be right at the heart of any programme or policy which has anything to do with changing attitudes and actions which are damaging to young people's sexual wellbeing, not to mention their economic, educational and social welfare. Which is what early or forced marriage is.</p> <p>And as an integral component in that, we must account for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/24/sex-education-more-than-mechanics\" title=\"\">comprehensive sexuality education</a>. Without education young people aren't aware of their rights, and if they aren't aware of their rights, they aren't aware of how established custom, tradition and law may infringe those rights. Without education, they are unaware of the proper respect due to them as individuals.</p> <p>Critically, while it's Day of the Girl, if we want to promote an agenda of respect and rights which will bring an end to child marriage, possibly the people we need to focus on just as much as young girls \u2026 are young boys. Ironic.</p> <p><em>Doortje Braeken is IPPF's senior adviser on adolescents and young people, responsible for co-ordinating programmes in 26 countries</em></p>",

Although al-Shabaab don't always claim responsibility for such attacks, it's not difficult to know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/six-killed-mogadishu-suicide-bombing\" title=\"\">which killings they carry out</a>.</p> <p>Third, the majority of journalists killed in Somalia are murdered as the result of a grudge.</p> <p>While the murder of a journalist is always a heinous crime, corruption and clan loyalty can take Somali journalists on the wrong path. I'm not in any way suggesting they deserved to be killed, but abuse within the profession has led to the deaths of many.</p> <p>Bad practice in journalism is not exclusive to Somalia. I live in Britain and the political and journalistic world is still licking its wounds from a huge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">scandal on phone hacking</a> that has led to a prolonged <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/\" title=\"\">official inquiry</a>.</p> <p>The difference in Somalia is that bad practice can lead to a journalist's death.</p> <p>Corruption is part and parcel of the Somali media. Journalists don't normally ask themselves if a story is important or interesting. It is about how much money they can get from their sources to publish it. It's known locally as <em>sharuur</em>, and it's a form of bribery.</p> <p>The sad reality is that such behaviour can be witnessed on a regular basis. Something I often say to fellow Somali journalists is that we were meant to expose corruption; instead, we are the bad guys.</p> <p>It's common to see Somali journalists getting paid at press conferences. Once the talk is finished, they queue up to collect their cash. And you can even hear the press conference organisers instructing them how to present the story.</p> <p>I am starting to be able to spot the <em>sharuur</em> influence on a news item just by noticing the words that have been used. I can even recognise if the reporter was happy with the amount of money that she or he was paid.</p> <p>For those working with well-established Somali media outlets, the <em>sharuur</em> is higher. It can be up to \u00a31,000 for a news piece. But there's also a large group of journalists known as <em>beesha caalamka</em>, meaning \"international community\" \u2013 those who call themselves journalists just because they own a small video camera, an audio recorder or even a notebook. Just by looking like journalists they can get their <em>sharuur</em> for attending a press conference, though it's much less than others are paid.</p> <p>The phenomenon is getting worse. In the past, media owners would trust their journalists to find stories that could provide a good <em>sharuur</em> and then give them a share of the fee. Now they are appointing <em>sharuur</em> managers to be in complete control of the financial flow.</p> <p>In the rest of the world media outlets tend to finance themselves through sales of newspapers and/or advertisements. In Somalia it's through corruption.</p> <p>If a politician wants to be interviewed, he or she will just negotiate the <em>sharuur</em> and journalists will publish what the sources demand. Sometimes political rivals take revenge through the media: when you become the mouthpiece for someone's enemy, you become a target. And in Somalia it's easier to kill someone than to complain.</p> <p>On one trip to Mogadishu, I remember visiting the port to film general views of it. As soon as I arrived, a policeman at the port's authority came to me and asked aggressively: \"Are you one of their friends?\"</p> <p>I had no idea what he meant. Once I told him who I was and what I was doing, he explained to me that a group of so-called journalists had stormed into his office claiming they were having a bad day and wanted him to pay them <em>sharuur</em> \u2013 threatening that if he failed to pay they would write a negative article about him.</p> <p>Later, I was told that when there's no <em>sharuur</em> in town, some of the inexperienced journalists go around intimidating local officials and businessmen to extort money.</p> <p>Locals in Mogadishu describe two types of militia: those with guns and those with cameras. Corrupt journalists expose themselves to serious potential consequences.</p> <p>Clan loyalty, which is incredibly strong among Somalis, is another huge problem for journalism. Supporting a warlord/politician who belongs to your clan is prevalent \u2013 and when you side with your fellow clansmen, you eliminate impartiality. Rival clans will look at you as a clan member, not as a journalist, and thus view you as a target.</p> <p>As a Somali journalist, I'm ashamed to be associated with the profession, especially when operating in the country. Somali journalists fail to recognise their basic responsibilities to the public. As a result of <em>sharuur</em>, important stories are ignored and Somalis are deprived from their right to impartial information.</p> <p>The profession needs to be cleaned up. The media owners should do it to save the lives of their employees.</p> <p>I feel as if we are watching a group of people committing suicide one by one. If a Somali journalist is killed today we just say, \"Oh, sad, another one killed\", then another one \u2026</p> <p>I strongly believe that if more Somali journalists respected their profession there would be fewer targeted killings. We would also do a better job in serving our people. And that would be a win-win situation for all of us.</p>",

For example, Kummyeong 2 (pictured), documented by EJF as fishing illegally in Sierra Leone in December 2011, was identified three months later in Guinea operating under a new identity. EJF travelled to Guinea in March 2012 where they identified Kummyeong 2 anchored at sea, one mile from the port of Conakry. The vessel had erased its name and painted a new name, Conosu, on its hull.

  "<p>We all know this story. A band form, release a few albums, get <a href=\"http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/interviews/nmejuly.htm\">hailed by a hyperventilating music press</a> as the saviours of indie rock, then burn out, disappearing into an \"indefinite hiatus\". And when they return a few years later, with a handful of gigs and a comeback album, beneath the cheers of fans is an undertone of muttering: they're doing it for the money, right?</p> <p>Wrong. Because this time the story is about Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the Montreal band who defy convention to make the familiar strange. For a start, there's nine of them, and they don't play songs so much as mini-symphonies, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQcE4_7-X78&amp;feature=related\">20-minute tracks</a> of multi-layered guitars, percussion and strings that ebb and flow, crash and drone. In place of lyrics, their albums offer anti-capitalist statements: the sleeve of 2002's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2002/dec/20/popandrock.artsfeatures?INTCMP=SRCH\">Yanqui UXO</a> featured a diagram linking major record labels to arms manufacturers (UXO stands for unexploded ordnance). On Monday, they release their first album in a decade, 'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!; Godspeed announced it to the world by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/04/godspeed-you-black-emperor-surprise-album\">slipping vinyl copies on to the merchandise table</a> at their gig in Boston on 1 October.</p> <p>This refusal to play by the music industry rules shrouds Godspeed in a thrilling mythology: they are outsiders, <a href=\"http://anarchistnews.org/?q=node/1381\">anarchists</a>, punks in the truest sense. The mythology sticks because they all but refuse to tell the narrative of themselves. Early in their existence they instituted a rule: \"No singer no leader no interviews no press photos.\" They may have mellowed on those rules a little, but only a little: this is the only interview they're doing with the English-language press, and it comes with conditions. The interview would happen on email, in a Q&amp;A format, and the full answers would need to be published (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/11/godspeed-black-emperor-interview-full-transcript\">you can read them here</a>). And because there is no leader, all answers are attributed to Godspeed as a collective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2577752%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-jbqQi&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;show_artwork=true&amp;amp;color=000000\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"350\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2577752%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-jbqQi&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=000000\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> <a href=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2577752%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-jbqQi&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=000000\">Reading on mobile? Listen here</a>.</p> <p>That collectivity is partly a political decision \u2013 we'll come back to that. Partly it's a shield to protect acute diffidence. Whatever their characteristics as individuals, as a group Godspeed describe themselves as \"earnest and naive and square\", and the idea that doing things differently sets them apart discomforts them: \"All's we know is that we won't play the stupid game.\" But if they reject the mythology, they no less fiercely reject the implication that they're \"just\" a band.</p> <p>\"We're a band. We're not 'just a band', we're a band. Us against the world, yeah? We feel like most of the stuff we have to muddle through is the same sort of stuff that countless other bands have to muddle through. Nothing special, nothing interesting. It's just that we make decisions based on a particular stubborn calculus. It's just that there's a certain sort of ringing that we chase when we rattle our bones in our tiny practice room. It's just that we like the sound of things a little out of tune.\"</p> <p>The rough poetry of those sentences tell you a lot about Godspeed's music. You find the same faltering rhythms, romantic cadence and prolixity in their early albums, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%E2%99%AF_A%E2%99%AF_%E2%88%9E\">F#A#oo</a> (1997) and <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3489-lift-your-skinny-fists-like-antennas-to-heaven/\">Levez Vos Skinny Fists Comme Antennas To Heaven</a> (2000): both quiver on a faultline between control and chaos, so that for every passage that is restrained, elegant or playful, there's another that surges and spirals, angry and bleak. When Godspeed performed this music live, it was against a backdrop of scratchy films of desolate wastelands, or electricity pylons looming against grey skies, interspersed with a single word, HOPE, beaming in the darkness. That wasn't enough to stop people characterising them as \"prophets of doom\" \u2013 an epithet that sat ill with the group.</p> <p>\"A whole lot of what we were about was joy. We wanted to make music like <a href=\"http://www.ornettecoleman.com/\">Ornette Coleman</a>'s Friends and Neighbours, a joyous difficult noise that acknowledged the current predicament but dismissed it at the same time. A music about all of us together or not at all. We hated that we got characterised as a bummer thing. For us, every tune started with the blues but pointed to heaven near the end, because how could you find heaven without acknowledging the current blues?\"</p> <p>On their new album, Godspeed address those \"current blues\" directly. The cover art includes two bald proclamations: \"Fuck <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Nord\">le plan nord</a>\", referring to a five-year plan for economic development in Quebec supported by industrialists and condemned by environmentalists; and \"Fuck <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/18/bill-78-quebec/\">la loi 78</a>\", rejecting a controversial bill banning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/09/international-fees?INTCMP=SRCH\">student protest</a>. One long track, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXdF9uhVrI0\">Mladic</a>, takes its name from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ratko-mladic\">Bosnian Serb former general</a> put on trial this year in The Hague for war crimes: it is scratchy and furious, all stabbed guitars, pounded drums and strident melodies at times redolent of rembetika, the dissident music of early 20th-century Greece; at the end is a recording of saucepans being bashed at a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/26/montreal-casseroles-student-protests?INTCMP=SRCH\">street protest in Montreal</a>. The other long track, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Szh9E13fedI&amp;feature=related\">We Drift Like Worried Fire</a>, is more abstract but no less suggestive: it is the sound of innocent people being hounded by malevolent social forces but somehow, together, making an escape.</p> <p>Address them as a political band and again Godspeed bristle. \"All music is political, right? You either make music that pleases the king and his court, or you make music for the serfs outside the walls. It's what music (and culture) is for, right? To distract or confront, or both at the same time?\"</p> <p>\"We started making this noise together when we were young and broke. Whatever politics we had were born out of living through a time when the dominant narrative was that everything was fine. Clearly this was a lie. But Clinton was president, the Berlin Wall was down, our economies were booming, and the internet was a shiny new thing that was going to liberate us all. The gatekeepers gazed upon their kingdom and declared that it was good. Meanwhile so many of us were locked out, staring at all that gold from the outside in.\"</p> <p>The only change since then, they argue, is that \"it's easier to find common cause than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Every day it gets a little harder to pretend that everything's OK. The rich keep getting more and we keep getting less. Folks flee to our shores, running from the messes we've made in their countries, and we treat them like thieves. Turn on the radio and it's a fucking horror show: the things our governments do in our name, just to fatten themselves on our steady decline.\"</p> <p>\"We're at a particular junction in history where it's clear that something has to give: problem is that things could tip any which way. We're excited and terrified; we sit down and try to make a joyous noise. But we make instrumental music: means that we have to work hard at creating a context that fucks with the document and points in the general direction of resistance and freedom. Otherwise it's just pretty noise saddled to whatever horse comes along.\"</p> <p>Common cause and context: these are the two things that set Godspeed apart. From the beginning, the decisions they have made about how to work within the music industry \u2013 as well as refusing almost all interviews, they deny free tickets for their gigs to journalists, and work only with independent labels and record shops \u2013 have created a context of dissidence. Success reinforced their subversive imperative. \"When we started earning rent from this racket, we felt a lot of internal pressure to stay true to our adolescent dissatisfactions: not adolescent like immature or naive, adolescent like terminally disenfranchised and pure. And so we made decisions that irritated a lot of people. We were barely articulate. We didn't deal with outsiders well.\"</p> <p>With Godspeed, idealism exists hand-in-hand with disillusionment \u2013 which is what prompted their hiatus a decade ago. \"You dive into this horrid music-business mess determined to do your part to make it change, but then nothing changes. You have victories that feel enormous but mostly nobody notices but the kids in the front row. Also, while that battle's important (because all battles against this normalised decline are important), most of the world, justifiably, could give a fuck. There's more important work being done out there, greater class injustices than music-industry greed.\"</p> <p>And there's the common cause: a sense of community with people, anywhere, who feel disenfranchised. At the forefront are Godspeed's fans: \"We don't privilege our worries above the worries of the kids in the front row,\" they say. \"We play to the kids in the front row because we used to be the kids in the front row.\" But in the background is anyone they perceive to be adversely affected by capitalism \u2013 people they increasingly feel cannot be ignored. \"Post-9/11, post-7/7, there's a police state that tightens more every day, and in our day-to-days, we're all witnesses to the demeaning outcomes of debauched governance: random traffic stops, collapsing infrastructure, corrupt bureaucrats and milk-fed police with their petty intrusions.\"</p> <p>This is where Godspeed's operation as a collective, rather than a regular band, becomes politically provocative. They don't simply espouse anti-capitalism but embody it, rejecting the selfish individualism at its core. By operating non-hierarchically, and in opposition to what are elsewhere considered financial truisms, they make an alternative society look not just attractive but attainable.</p> <p>Godspeed, however, are nothing if not self-deprecating: to their minds, they are simply doing what bands do. \"Music should be about things are not OK, or else shouldn't exist at all. The best songs ever are the songs that ride that line. We just try to get close to that perfection.\" My last question is this: do people like me take you too seriously? Their perfect, one-word answer is: \"Probably.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! is released on 15 October on Constellation Records.</p>",
  "<p>Savvy small business owners already know that Facebook is a great tool for communicating with customers and many SMEs are doing a great job. But the real question on every small business owner's mind is how can Facebook help drive revenue and grow their business?</p> <p>Most will tell you that their best source of new business comes from existing customers telling others about their products or services. Word-of-mouth referrals are nothing new, but technology, and social media in particular, has revolutionised the way we discover and share information. This makes it possible, even easy, to amplify those referrals for great effect. There are more than 3.2 billion likes and comments posted to Facebook everyday, many of those to the 37m brand pages. SMEs that are able to replicate the offline face-to-face interaction with customers online by way of engagement, will reap the benefits of awareness plus endorsement.</p> <p>Here are four simple steps that can help you win over customers and turn engagement and social visibility into repeat business and revenue growth.</p> <p><strong>1. Build your Facebook page</strong></p> <p>This may seem basic but getting it right is key. Think of your Facebook page as mission control: it's where you build connections and where those important interactions with the people that matter, your customers, take place. So make sure it reflects your business and what your company stands for.</p> <p>Set a cover photo that encapsulates the essence of your brand and what you represent beyond the widget or services you sell. Include your company logo as the profile picture to give visitors a good feel of your business.</p> <p>Add important business milestones to build out your timeline. Be creative, use images and remember to keep it true to who you are. For example, a boutique bakery might include a picture of the icing-stained notebook the founder scribbled recipes in when it first began.</p> <p>Encourage existing customers to like your page. Make it easy by including the \"find us on Facebook\" button on your emails, newsletters, and website.</p> <p><strong>2. Engage your fans with quality content</strong></p> <p>Once you've built an interesting page, engagement is the key to maximising the power of Facebook and creating the amplified word-of-mouth referrals that will drive growth for your business.</p> <p>Make sure you update your fans regularly. Start with one to two posts a week. With every post you have the opportunity to not only engage with your existing customers and fans but also to influence their network of friends. When someone likes a post or image on your page, this appears in their newsfeed, instantly putting you in front of a whole set of potential new customers. You can see how very quickly your message is spread and amplified, so make each post count.</p> <p>Post regularly but remember that not every interaction is about sales. Create a content calendar to help you get into a rhythm and add new ideas to it to help keep your content fresh. High-quality content will keep fans coming back for more and increase the level of engagement, so keep it human, ask questions and encourage people to interact. From time to time thank your Facebook fans with exclusive offers or coupons. An engaging and successful business timeline should be filled with succinct posts, bold images, videos and the occasional special offer.</p> <p><strong>3. Find and connect to fans with ads</strong></p> <p>You are probably wondering how you can grow your fanbase quickly, with real fans who can be converted into paying customers. Facebook ads can be a great way to find and connect with the kind of people who might be interested in you and your business.</p> <p>Experiment with multiple, well-targeted ads. Regularly check the easy-to-use reporting tool to see which ads work best for different audiences and make the necessary adjustments.</p> <p><strong>4. Influence the friends of your fans.</strong></p> <p>The impressive word-of-mouth amplification happens when you are able to post content that is not only compelling to your fans, but influences their friends too. This grows your network and encourages action offline at the cash register, where it counts.</p> <p>The dynamic nature of the <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/05/31/facebook-promoted-posts-tips/\" title=\"\">Facebook newsfeed means that on average each post will only be seen by 16% of your fans</a>. You can maximise the distribution of your best posts with sponsored stories. This gives them priority in newsfeeds and also displays the post as an ad on the right hand side of the user's feed, giving your post the best chance of being seen. Just as you are more likely to try a restaurant after a friend recommends it, Facebook users are more likely to connect with a brand that they can see a friend has liked too.</p> <p><strong>Make Facebook work harder for your business</strong></p> <p>Research shows that<a href=\"http://www.smallbusinesscomputing.com/emarketing/social-media-tips-for-small-businesses.html\" title=\"\"> 51% of people are more likely to buy a product</a> after liking it on Facebook and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/fmc/guides/reach\" title=\"\">Facebook fans tend to purchase on average twice as much as non-fans</a>. These numbers are compelling for any business, big or small. Using the steps outlined above you'll be up and running in no time and can start to enjoy a growing and loyal base of fans, and ultimately customers.</p> <p><em>Tamsin Fox-Davies is senior development manager UK at </em><a href=\"http://www.constantcontact.com/index.jsp\" title=\"\"><em>Constant Contac</em>t</a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>A culture of \"presenteeism\" appears to have crept into the workplace. This was highlighted in a <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/pressoffice/press-releases/fall-absence-levels-could-masking-deeper-problems-workplace-091012.aspx\" title=\"CIPD: Fall in absence levels could be masking deeper problems in the workplace\">report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</a> (CIPD), which showed that over the past year almost a third of employers said they had seen an increase in the number of staff who turned up to work unwell. At the same time the average number of sick days taken by workers dropped from 7.7 days in 2011 to 6.8 days in 2012.</p> <p>The report suggested staff are increasingly going to work when they are ill rather than risk their job security against a background of redundancies in the workplace. Pulling a \"sickie\" may have been put on the back burner \u2013 at least for now.</p> <p>But are these concerns well founded? Yes, they are. Many employers will use staff absenteeism as one of the selection criteria for determining who is to be made redundant. Indeed, the CIPD report highlighted that half of those they polled used their workers' \"employee absence record\" when deciding who to get rid of.</p> <p>It is, though, a difficult one for employers and employees alike. If you are genuinely ill, are you doing your employer and work colleagues a disservice by coming into work and possibly spreading your germs, all in the name of commitment? This is without even considering how productive you are likely to be and whether you might make mistakes in your work. These concerns were also highlighted in the CIPD report.</p> <p>The study also found that stress-related absences and mental health problems were on the rise. I can well believe this. I have seen a significant increase in inquiries in the past year from employees suffering from work-related illness, largely caused by either being overworked or because of dire relationship issues with their managers. In many cases, those suffering with stress have already been put on a \"performance improvement plan\" by employers increasingly striving to maximise their workforce in this economic climate.</p> <p>If you are suffering with work-related stress the concept of \"presenteeism\" is less likely to apply to you. How can you present yourself for work in the very environment that is causing the stress? And yet, you could find yourself out on a limb in a redundancy selection process where your scorings will be adversely affected by your being absent.</p> <p>In these circumstances, you are best advised to protect your position by lodging an internal grievance against your employer as soon as you can, or by challenging your performance improvement plan \u2013 in both cases as long as you believe you are justified in doing so. This means if you are subsequently selected for redundancy you will have put down a marker beforehand. Your employer will not have a \"clear run\" to use your absenteeism as the main reason for your redundancy, because issues will have been raised by you beforehand.</p> <p>Of course, whether or not you agree with your employer about your performance issues, it is always possible to negotiate an exit under which you would leave with an agreed settlement package. Indeed, these types of discussions are being encouraged by the government as part of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2012/sep/14/coalition-employment-law-plans\" title=\"Are the coalition's employment law plans bad news for workers?\">employment law reforms</a>.</p> <p>It is perfectly understandable why those who are at risk do not want to give their employers an opportunity to use their sickness record against them, whether in terms of a redundancy selection or otherwise. It is a shame for those workers who are genuinely ill, however, that they feel they have to struggle to work nevertheless. It's definitely a sign of the times.</p> <p>Have you ever gone into work when you were ill, and was your boss grateful? Or have any of your work colleagues come to work unwell when you wish they hadn't?</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer with </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/philip_landau.htm\" title=\"Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors website\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a></p>",
  "<p>It seems there is a worrying tendency that lurks in the health service. Every time someone spots something that is not up to scratch, there's a call for more centralised checks and controls with a carefully designed, one size fits all, prescription of how to put things right that then needs to be uniformly applied. We are, after all, a NATIONAL Health Service.</p> <p>But that's not how modern medicine works. The time of 'only the doctor knows best' is a thing of the past. These days patients, rightly, often have just as important a role in managing their symptoms as doctors do.</p> <p>The key driver for improving quality in every acute, community, mental health and ambulance trust in the country is having a strong and effective trust board that takes responsibility and is held accountable for the quality of service their trust delivers.</p> <p>Of course, national standards and approaches have their role to play. Last week's joint Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Physicians report, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/04/nhs-hospitals-neglecting-rounds-doctors\" title=\"\">called for changes in ward rounds</a>. We would not argue with their findings, such as recommending that ward-round teams should use locally adapted checklists to improve patient safety and strengthen multidisciplinary communication; or that consultant-led ward rounds should be conducted in the morning to facilitate completion of tasks during the day. Indeed, some of these recommendations echo good practice that has emerged from the <a href=\"http://www.foundationtrustnetwork.org/home/\" title=\"\">Foundation Trust Network</a>'s benchmarking studies. These have shown, for instance, the benefit of early morning ward rounds to enable elderly patients to be discharged the same day.</p> <p>However, the key point is that NHS trusts can achieve good outcomes from completely different, but equally valid, ways of working. For example, some trusts have a minor injuries unit as part of their A&amp;E while others have GP-run units to deal with less seriously ill patients. Our elderly care study showed two trusts were getting equally impressive patient outcomes from very different approaches \u2014 one focussing on fast discharge with intensive support at home and another by concentrating on full rehabilitation in the hospital setting. Each approach works perfectly for their particular circumstances.</p> <p>Many variations in how services are delivered aren't unplanned accidents, they're designed responses to meet specific local needs.</p> <p>Above all, it's important to understand that national standards, by themselves, are no guarantor of quality. What guarantees quality are the hundreds of actions undertaken by each of 1.3 million NHS staff every day. And in secondary care these staff are ultimately responsible to each NHS trust board. Each board, in turn, is not just accountable for clinical standards but also for engendering a culture where quality \u2014 patient safety, patient experience and clinical outcomes \u2014 are paramount.</p> <p>Staff deliver a quality service if leadership and management are right and that lies firmly with each trust board, not with <a href=\"http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Monitor</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm\" title=\"\">Department of Health</a>.</p> <p>As a forthcoming FTN guide to quality assurance argues, the ability of a board of directors to control and direct an organisation is not an end in itself. It is, however, an essential precondition to delivering safe, effective, personalised healthcare. This quality can only be delivered if it is planned for, and if risk \u2014 in what is essentially a risky business \u2014 is managed well.</p> <p>The guide, which we'll launch at our <a href=\"http://www.foundationtrustnetwork.org/events/ftn-annual-conference-and-exhibition/\" title=\"\">annual conference in Liverpool on 23 and 24 October</a>, shows that the key prerequisite here is robust, accurate and useful information that is available to the board and those holding the board to account. School league tables, crime maps and publication of detailed data on council spending have all played their part in raising quality across other public services. The annual quality accounts that each NHS trust needs to produce \u2014 or something similar \u2014 need to have the same status and impact in our sector.</p> <p>The obvious question to ask is what happens when there is a clear board failure to maintain the quality standards required as, for example, we appear to have seen in Mid Staffordshire back in 2009. That is the point where a robust national regulatory regime with appropriate powers of intervention does have a key role.</p> <p>Delivering high quality, patient centred, healthcare must lie at the heart of everything the NHS does. The only way to guarantee this, though, is to place accountability for quality where it properly belongs \u2014 with each NHS trust board \u2014 however tempting the belief that it can be driven from the centre.</p> <p><em>Chris Hopson is chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. <a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\">Join the Guardian healthcare network</a> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong><br></p>",

  "<p>Academia is a competitive field and a PhD is just one of the things required. To get started and to get ahead in academia you will need to be passionate about what you do and savvy about how you do it. You will need to be patient and if you can be flexible, it will certainly help.</p> <p>Publish as soon as possible and aim for high quality journals (with second-choice journals in mind as a back-up). Note that the <a href=\"http://www.ref.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Research Excellence Framework (REF)</a> is due in 2014 \u2013 this is the system used by UK higher education funding bodies to assess the quality of research produced by university departments. The department will then receive an amount of public funding determined by its performance in the REF. Established staff are usually expected to submit four 'research outputs' to the REF.</p> <p>Although early career researchers may be exempt or asked to submit fewer outputs to the REF, be aware that if you are applying for jobs in the run up to 2014, departments will be looking for candidates with publications ready to submit. You might also be asked to <a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/funding-and-guidance/tools-and-resources/impact-toolkit/what-how-and-why/what-is-research-impact.aspx\" title=\"\">demonstrate the impact of your research</a>, as impact case studies are the basis of 20% of the REF assessment.</p> <p>Although the pressure might ease after the REF, publications remain crucial for progressing your career \u2013 unless you want a teaching-only academic career. If this is the case, research whether teaching-only promotional track jobs exist in your field and which universities are offering this route. Teaching-only promotional track jobs are those that allow you to progress up the academic career ladder to the level of professor in an equivalent manner to research-and-teaching lecturers. For teaching-only jobs, publications will be less important, although check the criteria carefully \u2013 you might still be required to demonstrate that you can keep up with new developments in your field. Several universities offer this route: Bristol University, for instance, calls these jobs <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/hr/grading/academic/role-profiles/3-summary.html\" title=\"\">Pathway 3</a>. If you are not finding many of these roles available, you could look for positions in teaching-focused universities with a higher teaching to research ratio. At these institutions there might be less pressure to publish and bring in funding, as teaching would form the core of your workload.</p> <p>If you want a research-only permanent job in academia, you might struggle. These exist in some disciplines and institutions, but are generally rather rare. You have to be a world-class researcher, regularly bringing in large grants, for a university to give you a permanent contract. For the most part, researchers are employed on fixed-term contracts as postdocs or fellows; their first permanent post will be a lectureship. If you want to progress up the ranks in research, applying for funding is as crucial as publishing your research. You might start small, with travel grants or funding for events, but find out what early career fellowships and awards are available from relevant research councils and charities, and factor these into your career plan.</p> <p>To get a lectureship, you'll need some teaching experience. It will also help if you have a teaching and learning certificate and are a fellow of the <a href=\"http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Academy</a>. A teaching qualification is increasingly one of the desirable criteria on lectureship applications; it might be essential before too long. If you are aiming to be a teaching-only academic, this is even more crucial; you will need to demonstrate that you are an outstanding and innovative teacher. In some universities teaching experience is hard to come by and you will have to search further afield for opportunities. If there are no teaching assistant vacancies in your own department, are there any other departments you could teach in? Failing that, get in touch with the conveners of courses you could teach at other institutions and ask if they need anyone \u2013 if not, could they keep your CV on file? Check vacancies at the <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Open University</a> and consider teaching at adult education/further education providers. You could also get in touch with relevant departments and offer to do a guest lecture or seminar.</p> <p>On that note, organising your own seminar series or conference will be a good move for your academic career. It is a way of contributing to the life of the department, meeting with other academics in your field, and getting administration experience. To add to your administration experience \u2013 which you'll be expected to demonstrate when applying for lectureships \u2013 and to enhance your profile, look into whether you can take a committee role within your department, learned society or at a journal.</p> <p>In summary, define your career goals and once you have a destination in mind, be proactive about getting there.

  "<p>The distinguished Roman Catholic historian Eamon Duffy called it the most significant religious event of the last 500 years; the second Vatican council, which opened 50 years ago, on October 11 1962, in Rome, changed the Catholic church more than anything else that has happened since Luther nailed his 95 theses up on the church door in Wittenburg.</p> <p>Two thousand six hundred bishops from all around the world met in Rome for three years on and off, to reinvent the church for the modern age. When they had finished, the largest religious denomination in the world was quite unrecognisable.</p> <p>There had been plenty of earlier responses to the modern world, but they were almost all unrelentingly negative. Typical was Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors, which condemned religious freedom, any civil control over the catholic church, and even the idea that \"the Roman pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with progress, liberalism and modern civilisation\"</p> <p>We can wonder how many Catholics actually believed all that; but this was and remained official teaching, supplemented by the decree of the first Vatican council of 1870, proclaiming papal infallibility. Those deeply reactionary ideas inspired, or justified, dictatorships in Spain, Slovakia, and Latin America. They contributed to the savage polarisation of opinion in France, which left part of the French Catholic church deeply antisemitic and opposed to the Republic.</p> <p>The second Vatican council changed all that. The documents of the council showed the church embracing many of the things that Leo XIII had condemned. The Roman Catholic church now believes, sincerely, in human rights, in democracy, in freedom of religion, and that antisemitism is a dreadful sin. In theory, at least, the church even believes in a sort of democracy for itself. The laity are as much part of the \"Pilgrim people of God\" as any pope or conclave.</p> <p>The Latin mass has not been abolished, but it has almost disappeared. The more reactionary elements of the French church, under Archbishop Lefevre, went into formal schism over this, but also over the changed attitude to the Jews; the embrace, even in principle, of religious liberty; and the admission that popes might be wrong.</p> <p>Almost from the moment council ended the arguments started as to whether it had brought too much change or too little. In 1968, three years after the council's end, Pope Paul VI made the disastrous decision to condemn artificial birth control, even within marriage, against the advice of a commission he had appointed to look into the matter. That lost his church the loyalty of the middle classes in the west.</p> <p>More obviously apparent was the loss of priests. In the 10 years after the council 100,000 men left the priesthood worldwide. Once the walls of custom and reverence that had surrounded them were broken, there seemed nothing to keep them in. The 70s, too, saw an explosion of child abuse, as would emerge from later figures. The enclosed orders of nuns emptied. Daring theologians began to question papal infallibility.</p> <p>The election of the Polish Pope John Paul II in 1979 marked the beginning of a prolonged backlash. Progressives saw the work of John Paul II as destroying the legacy of the council, assisted by his doctrinal chief Cardinal Ratzinger, who had been a leading liberal at the council, but changed his mind after 1968. But it's important that both men claimed to be preserving the true spirit of the council and argued that its documents had been misinterpreted, not mistaken.</p> <p>But increasingly these arguments seem dead to the contemporary world. Most of the Catholics alive today have been born since the council ended. They have known no other church. And the great shift of power towards the laity seems irreversible, if only because without the support of the laity there will be no more priests. This week, Cardinal Schoenborn of Vienna, one of the most intelligent conservatives in the modern church, announced plans to reduce his diocese from 660 parishes to 150. There just aren't the priests or people to service any more. Restoring the Latin mass, renouncing democracy, and re-embracing antisemitism wouldn't change those facts. Duffy is right: the council changed Christianity more than any event in the last 500 years \u2013 except, perhaps the French revolution; and the council was really the start of the Catholic church's long-delayed grown-up response to the challenge of the enlightenment.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended at 12:38 on 11 October 2012.

  "<p>A Chinese former official who won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/china-environmental-press-awards\" title=\"\">an award for his expos\u00e9 of illegal forest clearing</a> has gone on trial accused of profiting by printing his books on environmental conflicts without proper licences.</p> <p>Liu Futang won the environmental press award, co-organised by the Guardian, in April. Three months later the 65-year-old was detained while receiving treatment for high blood pressure and diabetes at a hospital in southern Hainan province.</p> <p>His trial opened in Longhua, Haikou city, on Thursday morning. He is accused of \"conducting illegal business\", and supporters say he could face five years or more in jail. They believe that his last book, The Tears of Hainan II, particularly angered authorities. It highlighted a project to build a coal-fired power plant at Yinggehai, which met fierce opposition from residents.</p> <p>Prosecutors claim Liu ignored the law by illegally publishing, printing and distributing a total of 18,000 copies of his books. They acknowledge that he gave away the books, but argue that the total amount of money involved in the scheme was 464,000 yuan (\u00a346,100), and claim Liu illegally obtained 78,000 yuan.</p> <p>Feng Yongfeng, founder of NGO Green Beagle and one of the judges of this year's award, wrote on his microblog that Hainan prosecutors should withdraw the case, as there was no way it could be considered illegal business since Liu had published the books primarily to give to people.</p> <p>\"The purpose was sharing the difficulties of environmental protection. He never wanted to sell it \u2026 The circulation could only be useful to spread knowledge of environmental protection, not to have any impact in terms of the market,\" he said. \"Liu Futang has recognised his mistake on illegal publication and will learn from his experience.\"</p> <p>Xia Jun, a public interest lawyer, wrote on his microblog that the defence might be able to win the activist a two-year term or even a suspended sentence by stressing that he had been seeking to protect the environment.</p> <p>Liu's wife and son and one of his friends were allowed to witness the trial. Relatives had not been able to see him prior to the hearing. His niece, Liu Xiuli, said the activist had appeared in poor health and they were very concerned about his mental and physical wellbeing. She said he had been too emotional to speak at times during the case.</p> <p>Liu won the citizen journalist prize in the <a href=\"http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4866\" title=\"\">China environmental press awards this spring</a> after he revealed that developers of a yacht marina had destroyed one of the world's last groves of water coconut trees. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/china-environmental-press-awards\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> at the time: \"The degradation is terrible \u2026 The local media hasn't written a single word, but I've posted 40 articles that have been followed up by newspapers and TV from across the country.\"</p> <p>The awards are jointly organised by the Guardian, chinadialogue and the Chinese web portal Sina, with funding from the Guardian Foundation and SEE, a Chinese charitable body.</p>",
  "<p>The \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) mega-merger between BAE Systems and EADS collapsed as a result of personal opposition from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and despite a series of 11th-hour interventions from Downing Street officials and their counterparts in Paris and Berlin attempting to keep the deal alive.</p> <p>The proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the Franco-German owner of Airbus would have created a pan-European manufacturing powerhouse with 220,000 employees, making hi-tech products ranging from nuclear submarines and Typhoon fighter jets to the A380 superjumbo. Sources close to the deal said Merkel had become the most significant obstacle to thrashing out an agreement, with No 10 officials participating in frantic high-level discussions on Tuesday night when it became clear that opposition from Germany was in danger of scuppering the deal.</p> <p>\"It [Merkel's opposition] was a key factor in the decision to terminate the talks,\" said the source. Another added that Merkel appeared to be \"philosophically opposed\" to combining a defence business with a civil aerospace company. \"The fundamental problem is that Merkel does not feel comfortable with the deal, full stop.\"</p> <p>The UK, French and German governments all had the power to veto the deal but Berlin's concern over the potential size of the French shareholding in the combined company, as well as disagreements over the location of the group's headquarters, proved to be the deal breaker that could not be resolved by the last-ditch round of phone diplomacy.</p> <p>BAE's chief executive, Ian King, said failure to agree the size of French and German shareholdings was the key factor behind abandoning the deal , ahead of a 5pm deadline set by the UK Takeover Panel.</p> <p>Declining to comment on Merkel's role, he indicated that Paris and Berlin would have to change their stance if the companies ever wanted to attempt a merger in the future. \"Unless European governments completely change their current view, we would not be in a position to resurrect the deal.\"</p> <p>BAE's chairman, Dick Olver, said the UK government had been \"incredibly helpful\" and denied that the failure to pull off the deal had now made BAE vulnerable as a takeover target for other overseas buyers \u2013 despite speculation that a US defence group such as Boeing or Lockheed Martin could now consider an approach for Britain's largest manufacturing employer.</p> <p>The defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said the deal \"had to be done on the basis it was in Britain's national interest\" but the two companies had decided it was \"too difficult to progress this project further\". A source close to EADS said David Cameron had been \"really, really interested\" in the merger. \"There was a view that the British would be the biggest problem but that did not turn out to be the case.\"</p> <p>In a joint statement, the companies said they could not resolve state concerns about the deal, with the UK, French and German governments unable to reach agreement. \"It has become clear that the interests of the parties' government stakeholders cannot be adequately reconciled with each other or with the objectives that BAE Systems and EADS established for the merger,\" the statement said.</p> <p>A person close to the negotiations added that while Germany had proved to be the biggest obstacle, there were still differences to resolve between France and the UK that had not been cleared by Tuesday night's flurry of calls, even if there had been more substantial progress between London and Paris. It is understood that every solution proposed drew an objection from one of the three governments.</p> <p>France, which controlled 15% of EADS directly, was unhappy with German demands for the business to have its headquarters in Munich, while Germany was concerned that France could end up with a bigger shareholding in the new business than the 9% it was seeking.</p> <p>The UK, in turn, refused to allow German and French political representatives to sit on the BAE board, as would have been likely under the dual-listed structure envisaged by both companies.</p> <p>The UK's largest trade union, Unite, said a merger would have \"protected the UK's long-term interests\" if it had been accompanied by a jobs guarantee for British employees. BAE employs 37,500 people in the UK and is Britain's largest manufacturing employer.</p> <p>Ian Waddell, a Unite official, said the UK government could secure such a guarantee in future mergers or takeovers by taking an equity stake in BAE. Although the British government has a \"golden share\" in the business, which can block a foreign takeover, it does not control a significant block of shares similar to France's stake in EADS. When their indirect and direct shareholdings are taken together, France and Germany each control 22.35% of EADS. \"It was an unequal negotiation with France and Germany,\" he said.</p> <p>Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP for Wyre and Preston, who organised a petition against the deal signed by 45 MPs, said the deal should never have been promoted due to the threat of French and German political interference.</p> <p>Wallace said the collapse of the merger put the future of BAE boss King, and his board colleagues, at risk. \"The BAE board should now reflect long and hard at what their strategic error could mean for the company's future. If they have put at risk my constituents' jobs and fatally wounded the UK's jewel in the manufacturing crown, then they should consider their position.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is surely not unreasonable that even those with no background or interest in public sector commissioning and procurement understand that dealing with citizens is different to manufacturing pins.</p> <p>Despite the obvious difference, there remains one overriding principle that commonly informs our approaches to both. To produce anything efficiently, at the best price and to deliver quality, it must be done at scale.</p> <p>The idea of universally achievable economies of scale is deeply ingrained. It is alarming that this thinking so completely dominates the design and management of service delivery at all levels of the public sector in the 21st century \u2013 and yet often it simply isn't true.</p> <p>Why, in the current climate, do we tolerate services that are remote, provide less impact and cost more? The answer, at least in part, is because our mind is closed to the very idea that disaggregation might be more cost-effective. Perceived inefficiencies almost always seem to lead to strategies based on a further tier of aggregation, scale and management control, often to a point where inefficiencies become so opaque that they become desperately difficult to address, even as they become more apparent to the rest of us.</p> <p>As we do this we also drive out the plurality of supply and local multipliers that are widely recognised as vital for high performance in public sector spend.</p> <p>It is for these reasons that<a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Locality</a> is working with Professor John Seddon of <a href=\"http://www.systemsthinking.co.uk/home.asp\" title=\"\">Vanguard Consulting </a>on a research project with major policy implications, that will challenge some of the widely held assumptions that in our view lead to diseconomies of scale.</p> <p>Locality members have reported endless examples of diseconomies of scale, from youth services to legal aid services to mental health interventions, through to employability schemes like the Work Programme. Reports relate particularly to areas of complex social need, where solutions would be better found by responding to particular individual needs rather than one size fits all approach.</p> <p>Through our research we plan to develop an evidence base which we hope will encourage a new approach to public service decision-making. An ambitious aim? Certainly. But it's not just us making this argument.</p> <p>In 2008, Nesta ran its <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/big_green_challenge\" title=\"\">Big Green Challenge</a>, designed to stimulate community-led responses to climate change. In its 2010 publication, <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/reports/assets/features/mass_localism\" title=\"\">Mass Localism,</a> reflecting on the success of the challenge and the importance of innovation and diversity, Nesta said the government should resist the temptation to scale successful community innovation and should instead enable local innovation to flourish.</p> <p>This is a fundamentally different way of conceiving the design and delivery of services. The more complex the social problems, the more important it is to design services in such a way that deep value relationships can be formed between service providers and users. More accessible, responsive and embedded provision can then deliver stronger and more cost effective outcomes and impacts.</p> <p>In early discussions about the research, one leader from the voluntary sector said our work sounded interesting, but added that \"it almost sounds as if you are going to argue against one of the immutable laws of economics\".</p> <p>We would argue that the idea economies of scale is not an immutable law when applied to the delivery of services. Things can become more expensive when you do them at scale because management costs often multiply rather than divide. Our research project to investigate these assertions and is expected to be completed by spring 2013.</p> <p><em>Neil Berry is the head of enterprise at</em><a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> Locality</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email </em><a href=\"mailto:public.leaders@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>public.leaders@guardian.co.uk</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Human beings are restless, nosey and aggressive. These characteristics have made us one of the most invasive species our planet has ever encountered and allowed us to colonise nearly every terrestrial environment. During this progress, humans have made many acquisitions, several of them unwanted. Our constant movement between vast, populous cities and novel environments makes us easy prey for opportunistic pathogens that replicate fast, and transmit by sneezes and dirty hands before sickness even begins to show. These pathogens can spread around the world in hours by aeroplane to infect the unsuspecting on another continent. That's how <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/swineflumulti1.shtml#the_2009_swine_flu_pandemic\" title=\"\">\"swine flu\" spread in 2009</a>; it was already unstoppable by the time we noticed it. We were lucky it wasn't particularly virulent.</p> <p>David Quammen's <em>Spillover</em> is a collection of stories about the sources of diseases called <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/diseases/zoonoses.htm\" title=\"\">zoonoses</a>. These are the infections that humans acquire from other animals; the most notorious recent example is HIV/Aids, but they encompass a huge range of viruses, bacteria and parasites, including Ebola,&#xa0;some malarias and Q fever. It seems that zoonoses are increasing, at least reports of them are. In 2012 alone,&#xa0;hantavirus (a Sars-like virus), <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/campaigns/farmsafe/ecoli.htm\" title=\"\">E coli O157</a> and legionnaires' disease have hit the headlines \u2013 all originated in other animals.</p> <p>Quammen tells us we don't have far to look for blame when weird infectious diseases spring up: they usually result from humans moving into wild ecosystems or from forcing encounters with other species. Bats are at the centre of many of his stories; they seem to be a reservoir for a number of the nastier viruses \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/fact_sheets/fact_sheet_marburg_hemorrhagic_fever.pdf\" title=\"\">Marburg</a>, probably <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/Ebola_Fact_Booklet.pdf\" title=\"\">Ebola</a>, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs262/en/\" title=\"\">Nipah</a> and Hendra viruses \u2013 as well as a source of bacterial and fungal infections. Bats are excellent crucibles for pathogens because they often live in huge numbers at high densities, roost in tight proximity and, in part because of habitat loss, congregate around human settlements. Bats could have provided cavemen and women with measles and mumps too. Another particularly acquisitive period in human evolution was probably livestock domestication about 10,000 years ago. This seems to have been the major trigger not just for human civilisation, but also for the accumulation of the familiar repertoire of communicable human diseases.</p> <p>If they are not made locally extinct by our activities, other animal species either hang on at the fringes of human settlements, or take to suburban living. In the US, homes in woodland idylls are aspirational dwellings, but the human invasion has made Lyme disease a widespread problem. Having lost their own space, the wild reservoir hosts of this bacterial infection \u2013 mice and deer, with their tick vectors \u2013 are forced to colonise the newly made backyards and come into contact with humans. Likewise, intimate living with rats in chaotic medieval cities allowed plague to spread worldwide, and as rat populations thrive in modern cities too, it wouldn't take much of a drop in living standards to give plague a new foothold.</p> <p>Smaller, highly mobile creatures also bring unwanted pathogens into human spaces. Mosquitoes can make the transition from forest to city living strikingly easily. They ride in planes and have taken with them terrible afflictions, such as <a href=\"http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/west_nile_virus/\" title=\"\">West Nile virus</a> to the US, and have spread dengue virus in Asia and South America. Mosquitoes breed fast, are genetically flexible, and can adapt rapidly to change their feeding and flying behaviour, tolerate climate shifts and develop insecticide resistance. Some are adept at breeding in almost any drop of uncovered water, for instance in an old tin can, a discarded tyre, or a hollow plant stem. This way,<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2134583/Huge-Asian-tiger-mosquitoes-poised-invade-UK--bring-deadly-diseases-dengue-fever-them.html\" title=\"\"> Asian tiger mosquitoes have spread to Europe</a>, where they now breed and are known to have transmitted chikungunya virus to Italy.</p> <p>Quammen has not considered \u2013 perhaps because we have only recently had the technology to witness it \u2013 the extraordinary amount of gene swapping among pathogens. Some of the most mobile of these genes supply components for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and may help a pathogen to change its host. This genetic movement, in combination with the profligate use of antibiotics, has now rendered a large armamentarium of once life-saving drugs useless.</p> <p>Zoonosis is a topic that, like the pathogens themselves, is hard to keep under control, and Quammen's treatment is rather uneven. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he veers from inflamed alarmism to cold, sober mathematics. I started off feeling irritated by asides such as \"Here's what you have to come to understand \u2026\" But he is terrific when on a quest to uncover the circumstances that led to a particular spillover event. The stories of the victims and the scientists are told in astonishing detail. He has named nearly all the local heroes of epidemiology and made several forays into west Africa in the process. He's at his best towards the end of the book in the section devoted to HIV, although soon afterwards he becomes so impassioned he inserts long flights of fictional fancy about the \"Voyager\" who brings HIV into the wider world. The book needed fiercer editing.</p> <p>Like bats, humans now live together in huge numbers, tightly packed and forever flitting from place to place. We are prime candidates for, as Quammen puts it, the Next Big One. What will it be? Perhaps an RNA virus, like the one portrayed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/03/contagion-steven-soderbergh-review\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh's film <em>Contagion</em></a>, but probably one more banal \u2013 influenza. Again though, we can teeter from the routine consideration of seasonal influenza (which still kills thousands of people each year) to scaremongering about bird flu (which has so far killed only a few hundred \u2013 though more than half of those infected died).</p> <p>The problem is that, for all its apparent simplicity, the flu virus hides its secrets well. It is constantly changing to acquire and shed mutations, at the same time gaining and losing virulence and shifting host adaptability. Making the annual vaccine for seasonal flu is an industrial-scale challenge of diplomacy and logistics, masterminded by the World Health Organisation. Influenza drugs are poor and resistance to them builds up quickly during an epidemic. So although we know a lot about flu, there is a lot more we don't know. We can't predict with much accuracy when the next spillover from birds will happen, whether or not it will spawn a devastating pandemic killing tens of millions, or where, how and what subtype it will be. We only know we still don't have the surveillance systems in place to stop it in time.</p>",

  "<p>A letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act shows that there was discussion at the highest level of the Heath government over the decision to prosecute trade unionists, in one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/03/union-pickets-seek-quash-convictions\" title=\"\">most controversial cases</a> of the last four decades.</p> <p>Surviving members of the so-called Shrewsbury 24, including actor Ricky Tomlinson, believe that a letter from the then attorney general, Sir Peter Rawlinson, to the then home secretary, Robert Carr, could be a key factor in having their 1973 convictions quashed.</p> <p>The letter was unearthed from the National Archives at Kew under the 30-year rule by researcher, Eileen Turnbull. It now forms part of the evidence assembled for the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) in a bid to overturn the convictions of union pickets arrested during the first-ever national building workers' strike in 1972. The strike lasted twelve weeks and resulted in a pay rise but the union's picketing tactics enraged the construction industry and the government.</p> <p>Five months after the strike ended, the 24 were arrested and charged with offences ranging from conspiracy to intimidate to affray. They were convicted at Shrewsbury crown court in 1973 and six were jailed, with Tomlinson (two years) and Des Warren, (three years) receiving heavy sentences. Their case became a cause celebre for the left and the union movement.</p> <p>In his letter, dated 25 January 1973, Sir Peter tells Carr that the strike had produced \"instances of intimidation of varying degrees of seriousness\" and he had to decide whether they should be prosecuted.</p> <p>But he added that \"the intimidation consisted of threatening words and ... there was no evidence against any particular person of violence or damage to property.\"</p> <p>Sir Peter said that Treasury counsel, to whom the director of public prosecutions had referred the cases, \"took the view that the prospects were very uncertain, and in the result I agreed with him that proceedings should not be instituted.\" He added that the accused would have the right to a jury trial which \"past experience shows\" the defendants would certainly choose.</p> <p>\"One has therefore to consider the prospects of conviction by a jury rather than by a magistrates's court and you will appreciate that accordingly different considerations apply,\" he concluded. \"First, the delay involved in bringing the case to trial would lend an air of unreality about the proceedings long after the strike has been settled and this would be likely to work in favour of the accused. Secondly, juries tend to treat mere words more leniently than actual violence.</p> <p>Thirdly, a jury would be likely to be influenced by the political factor that conviction might revive a strike atmosphere.\"</p> <p>Despite this assessment, three weeks later the 24 were charged. The Conservative government at the time had close links with the building industry and was always suspected of being under pressure from that quarter to act.</p> <p>Turnbull said that the letter and other documents clearly show that the decision to prosecute was taken for political reasons. \"Its significance is that the highest law officers in the land ... were of the view that they did not have the evidence to prosecute.\"</p> <p>She said that other relevant documents were being held back under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/23\" title=\"\">section 23 of the Freedom of Information Act</a>, which applies to national security. \"This was a building workers strike,\" she said. \"It was not, and could never be described as a threat to national security. We believe that the missing documents will show by whom and why the decision was taken to prosecute the pickets.\"</p> <p>Tomlinson, now a successful actor in films and television such as The Royle Family and Brookside, said: \"we have maintained our innocence for forty years. We have always known that there was political interference by Ted Heath's Conservative government in respect of the charges brought against us.\" He added that a lack of evidence clearly did not matter: \"they decided to throw the conspiracy charge against us which was a way of getting around the evidence problem.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the CCRC confirmed that the case, which is being handled by the solicitors, Bindmans, was under active review. Sir Peter died in 2006, Robert (later Lord) Carr earlier this year and Des Warren in 2004.</p>"
