  "<p>There was heartbreak and a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at the North Greenwich Arena on Thursday night as Britain's men's wheelchair basketball team were dumped out at the semi-final stage for the third Paralympics in a row after a 52-69 defeat by Canada.</p> <p>The British team were always going to be up against it: Canada had won two golds and a silver in the last three Paralympics and had Patrick Anderson, the Michael Jordan of wheelchair basketball, as their lodestar. When the teams met in the group stages, Anderson scored 29 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds \u2013 a rare triple double \u2013 as Canada won 70-54. This time round his scoring was not as hot, with 17 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds, but his superb all-round game ensured Canada won with something in hand.</p> <p>And a helping hand, according to the British forward Terry Bywater, who was highly critical of the referee, Mati Quintana, afterwards. \"The referee thought he had a point to prove,\" Bywater said. \"He was trying to forgo our home advantage. It's tough when Patrick Anderson picks up his first personal foul 36 minutes into the game.\"</p> <p>Anderson, who lost both his legs after he was pinned against a wall in a car accident when he was nine, had averaged 24.8 points coming into this match. But his hands were cold early on and he appeared frustrated at British attempts to double team him. His first three shots clanked off the rim as Britain went 12-8 up.</p> <p>The crowd smelt an upset. British lay-ups were cheered like an NBA-title winning shot on the buzzer, every contentious refereeing decision was booed, and happy-clappy patriotism was quickly tossed aside. This had edge.</p> <p>But while Anderson was misfiring, shooting only five from 14 in the first half, his fellow forward Richard Peter \u2013 who picked up his disability aged four when a bus backed into him, causing his hip and spinal cord to break \u2013 scored eight quick points as Canada recovered to lead 21-16 after the first quarter.</p> <p>It did not help that Britain's three-point shooter, Joni Pollock, who had sunk a Games' best 40% from distance before last night, was zero from three from outside. All sportsmen have superstitions but Pollock's is unusual: he is particular about the way he tapes his fingers and, if he gets it wrong, he feels \"cursed\" in a match. Perhaps he also stepped over a black cat on the way to the Arena too.</p> <p>Still, at halfway it was just about competitive with Canada 33-26 up. And then, very quickly, it was not. Canada outscored the British team 24-10 in the third quarter, stretching the gap to 20. After that it was time to go through the motions.</p> <p>Great Britain will now duke it out with the United States, who lost 63-72 against Australia in their semi-final, for a bronze on Saturday night. Canada, meanwhile, will face the world and Paralympic champions, Australia, for gold.</p> <p>The British team will start as favourites but on last night's evidence their third/fourth place play-off will be close. The Australians got the jump on the USA early, led 18-8 at the first quarter and looked to be heading for the hills at 31-18 in the second. But the Americans, perhaps inspired by the droning cries of \"US-A! US-A!\" and \"defence\" fought back hard.</p> <p>But despite tough defence from the USA centre Joseph Chambers, a one-man tattoo parlour, seven points at the end of the third quarter became nine by the end. The Australians were just a little too muscular and strong under the basket, with Justin Eveson, who scored 21 points and had 10 rebounds, particularly effective.</p> <p>The US coach, Jim Glatch, called it right afterwards when he said: \"We knew it would be rough. Australia are a great team and are the reigning world champions. We put up a fight and kept kicking at them but at the end we could not kick enough.\"</p> <p>On Saturday's match he was non-committal. \"Great Britain are a great side,\" he said. \"They are going to give us headaches so we are going to have to be on our A game.\"</p> <p>Headaches are something most wheelchair players know all about, of course. In recent days columnists have raved about wheelchair rugby, aka \u2013 for some unfathomable, probably marketing-induced, reason \u2013 \"murderball\". But this was just as confrontational \u2013 with wheelchairs being bumped, barged and tipped over like bins at the municipal dump \u2013 and with deeper tactics and immense skill too.</p> <p>It was Great Britain's misfortune, however, that the most skilful player last night was wearing the red of Canada.</p>",
  "<p>David Weir is simply unstoppable. A performance of iron-clad confidence and control brought him an extraordinary third gold medal of the Games on Thursday night, cementing his position as the world's leading wheelchair athlete and leaving his rivals shattered.</p> <p>Weir shadowed the leader, China's Zhang Lixin, from the gun, tucking in second out of lane seven, and never lost that prime position until he ripped off the final bend to win the T54 800m in 1min 37.63sec as the stadium erupted in joy and the DJ spun Werewolf in London, his signature tune.</p> <p>\"I had to dig deep tonight, it did hurt,\" said Weir, whose suit came undone on the first lap. \"They're all special. I've defended my title in both the distances I've won and now I've got a gold in the 5,000; I only got bronze in Beijing. I feel like I'm on top of the world at the moment.</p> <p>\"I dreamt about it and wished I'd come away with three gold medals, with maybe another one on the way, but you just dream of things like that.\"</p> <p>Switzerland's Marcel Hug, the world record holder and Weir's great rival, kicked late for silver while bronze went to Thailand's Saichon Konjen.</p> <p>Just like at the Olympics, some medals are softer than others here. In the T12 5,000m on Monday night, to pick one example, the silver medallist could afford to come home a full 26sec behind the world record set by the winner, Morocco's El Amin Chentouf.</p> <p>None of Weir's fall remotely into that category. His opponents are hardened, elite racers, toughened by a professional circuit of marathons and track events. These victories are every bit as difficult as those of Mo Farah, his only serious rival for athlete of the summer, last month.</p> <p>Hug, beaten by Weir for the third final of these Games on Thursday night, is the world record holder at four distances from 800m to 10,000m. Weir's season's best was the third-fastest in the race. But, just like Farah in August, when the east African stars bordered on supine in their tactics against him, sometimes an athlete turns up at a major championships holding what amounts to a hex, a psychological edge that, after the first victory, makes the competition freeze up. Weir has got them beaten before the gun goes and Sunday's marathon, and his chance for a fourth gold, may well confirm it.</p> <p>While Weir's rivals are tough, Hannah Cockroft's must wonder why they bother turning up. The 20-year-old added gold by a huge margin in the 200m to her unfeasibly dominant 100m triumph on the opening night of competition. Cockroft's time, a Paralympic record of 31.90, tells nothing of a winning margin that may have approached 10 chair-lengths.</p> <p>Powering off from the staggered start, she had caught two athletes outside her within 30m and never looked back.</p> <p>Was it ever in doubt? \"I was in doubt on that one,\" Cockroft said after collecting her medal. \"Even my coach had a bit of doubt on that one. Even though the 200 is my favourite event it's also a lot of the other girls' favourite and best events, and they all said, 'Yeah, we're coming to get you on this one.'</p> <p>\"I hit the fastest speed I've hit during these Games in that race and can't complain \u2013 Paralympic record. But the gold medal's what I wanted and that's what I got.\"</p> <p>From a team who picked up a measly two golds \u2013 both from Weir \u2013 in Beijing, Thursday alone saw eight British medals in track and field.</p> <p>Dan Greaves, Discus Dan to his Twitter followers, looked nailed on for gold in the F44 having thrown a Paralympic record 59.01m until the American Jeremy Campbell nailed him with a fourth attempt of 60.05. Greaves, who competed for GB's able-bodied team alongside Farah as a junior, had two more goes at bettering that but could not go further than 57.67.</p> <p>Ben Rushgrove, the British sprinter who waded into the blades controversy this week by telling Oscar Pistorius he should \"acknowledge that he is disabled\", ran his lungs out for a bronze in the T36 200m in a personal best of 24.83. Rushgrove was ecstatic, having been run out of the medals in the 100m earlier in the week. \"I wanted that medal so badly, so badly. After the disappointment of the 100 I had to prove I'm still one of the top guys in the world.\"</p> <p>That was swiftly followed by another bronze for Britain's Paul Blake in the T36 800m to add to his silver in the 400m on Tuesday night. Ola Abidogun picked up another bronze for GB in the men's T46 100m and in the morning session Bev Jones won her first Paralympic medal in four Games' worth of trying with bronze in the F37 discus.</p>",
  "<p>Set in pre-Olympics London (remember those giddy, carefree days?), this thriller, co-scripted by Paul Abbott, fails to generate that much contemporary relevance. When a not-all-it-seems shooting outside a nightclub sees her brother arrested, Paris fashion exec Deeva (Parminder Nagra) returns to her old London home to clear his name. With Stephen Dillane as a forceful and well-connected police detective, a far-reaching and dangerous conspiracy is uncovered. There's a good cast here, but it's hard to shake off the feeling that this would probably work better on TV, the subject matter being very familiar to those who like their drama delivered in episodes. It's&#xa0;a feeling not helped by everything being overlit and largely filmed handheld, making it all look very small-screen friendly.</p>",
  "<p>Former President Bill Clinton wowed delegates and pundits alike with his Democratic national convention speech on Wednesday night. Clinton's success was no surprise. His sky-high favorability rating of 69% among the American public is matched by few other politicians, former or otherwise. But it wasn't always this way for the man from Hope.</p> <p>Indeed, Bill Clinton's relationship with the American public and even members of his own party is better described as a rollercoaster ride than a sustained love-fest. He's hit high highs, during his long career, but also lows that would dismay even the costliest New York shrink.</p> <p><strong>1. Clinton enters the 1992 Democratic convention with negative favorable ratings</strong></p> <p>After a primary season that saw Clinton overcome the Gennifer Flowers scandal, Clinton limped into the general election against President George HW Bush. A bad economy made Bush vulnerable, but it was independent Ross Perot who had jumped into the lead.</p> <p>Clinton's struggles were because of net favorables ranging from the negative single digits to the low double digits. Perhaps only Bob Dole and Mitt Romney have had worse standing among the American people for a challenger at the same point during the campaign.</p> <p>No problem for Clinton. He selected a popular running-mate in Al Gore, ran what was arguably the most successful convention in the modern era, and jumped out to a lead that he never lost.</p> <p><strong>2. Clinton's popularity drops quickly upon entering office</strong></p> <p>No president in polling history saw his approval ratings drop faster than Bill Clinton. Clinton's disapproval started to creep above his approval rating only four months into his presidency. Despite tremendous fallout from his pardoning of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford managed to last four and a half months before his net approval rating went negative.</p> <p>Clinton's inability to control his domestic agenda was the cause of his drop in early 1993. His economic plan was derided as a tax-raiser, and he tried to fight on too many policy fronts at once. Clinton was eventually able to pass his budget by two votes in the House and a single vote in the Senate, but his popularity faded again following the Hillary Clinton-led failed attempt at healthcare reform.</p> <p>Clinton's Democrats would lose control of both the House and Senate in the 1994 midterm elections. Again though, Clinton pulled a rabbit out of the hat. He won a contentious government shutdown against congressional Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, in 1995 and would go on to win the 1996 presidential election by nearly 10 points.</p> <p><strong>3. Clinton was personally disliked, though most thought he was doing a good job</strong></p> <p>Usually, a president's personal approval ratings match his job approval. There can be relatively minor differences, as Barack Obama has currently, but they are usually only a few percentage points.&#xa0;</p> <p>Following the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton became an anomaly. Americans detested his personal behavior, yet the country's economy was humming. Republicans tried to take advantage of the prior and impeached him.</p> <p>The 1998 midterm elections became the first midterm in 66 years in which the president's party <em>gained</em> seats in the House of Representatives. It turned out that although only 35% of voters had a favorable view of Clinton as a person, his 55% job approval rating trumped his personal weaknesses. That 55% approval nearly matched the 56% who thought Clinton should stay in office despite the Lewinsky affair. Meanwhile, congressional approval had fallen to 41%, nearly identical to the 40% who did think Clinton should leave office.</p> <p><strong>4. Clinton leaves office the most popular president since the second world war</strong></p> <p>Names like Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan dominate discussions of the most popular presidents over the last 60 years. Contrastingly, Bill Clinton was embroiled in some ugliest partisan battles in presidential history (remember Whitewater, Kenneth Starr, and the \"vast rightwing conspiracy\"). Today, though, we tend to remember Clinton as a president admired on both sides of the aisle. How so?</p> <p>Thanks to a booming economy, he left office with a 66% approval rating, including a 39% approval rating from Republicans \u2013 so that's how we remember him. (And compare that with war hero Dwight Eisenhower, who managed only a 59% final overall job approval rating.) By contrast, President Obama currently has an approval rating of just 7% among Republicans. </p> <p><strong>5. Clinton falters during the 2008 Democratic primary season</strong></p> <p>Even so, like any rollercoaster, Americans' perceptions of Bill Clinton took yet another dip. Clinton made a number of controversial statements during his wife's run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. From his \"biggest fairy tale\" comment about Barack Obama, to his remark about the role black voters played in Obama's victory in the South Carolina primary, Clinton came across as mean-spirited and even, in the eyes of some, as a race-baiting dogwhistler.</p> <p>Clinton's favorability rating dropped to 50% with the general public, but more surprising was how Democrats then viewed him. A quarter of all Democrats had an unfavorable opinion of Bill Clinton. This political base favorability rating is what you'd expect for a president who loses a general election by 5 to 10 points. (Fortunately for Clinton, he was no longer running for office.)</p> <p>Still, Clinton would persevere, as he always does. He mended fences with Obama and campaigned for him later in 2008. Today, Clinton's favorability rating of 69% includes an astronomical high of 93% among Democrats. Yet he maintains his cross-partisan appeal, with favorability scores of 68% with independents and 43% with Republicans.</p> <p>Bill Clinton truly embodies the saying that \"it's not how you start, but how you finish that counts.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama expressed regret in a conference call with campaign volunteers disgruntled over being locked out from tonight's nomination speech.</p> <p>He told them: \"I just want to begin by saying how much I regret that we're not all gathering together in one place to deliver my acceptance speech tonight.\"</p> <p>Tens of thousands of volunteers have travelled to Charlotte, North Carolina, to hear Obama formally accept the party nomination for the White House race. Some had travelled long distances, a costly exercise involving air fares and hotels.</p> <p>But the speech was moved from the 73,000-seater Bank of America football stadium to the neighbouring convention centre, which holds only 23,000. Only those who had been attending the convention for the last two days are to be permitted access, leaving a potential crowd of 50,000 who had been allocated tickets outside.</p> <p>Some of the volunteers had qualified for tickets by doing nine or more hours of work for the campaign.</p> <p>Such a conference call with the president is unusual and may reflect the sense of grievance being conveyed upwards to the White House from field officers.</p> <p>In the call, Obama predicted it would be a \"really close election\" and that he would need their help.</p> <p>The reason for the switch from the stadium was safety concerns, he said. \"I could not ask you \u2013 our volunteers, our law enforcement, first responders \u2013 to subject themselves to the risk of severe thunderstorms,\" he said. Getting so many people into the stadium, with all the security concerns involved, was hard enough but getting them out would have been even tougher, Obama said.</p> <p>\"If we had started seeing severe thunderstorms and lightning, in particular, it would have been a problem. And we would have had a situation where we were putting you guys at risk.\"</p> <p>Party officials were trying to direct those without tickets to various venues round the city where they could watch the speech along with other fellow Democrats.</p> <p>The president said the switch meant there would be less fanfare than at the stadium.</p> <p>Responding to Republican claims that the switch had been because of fears he could not fill the stadium, reflecting a sense of disenchantment among the party grassroots, Obama said: \"The issue in this election is not going to be enthusiasm, because I think about you all on buses and in carpools and airplanes traveling here to Charlotte.\"</p> <p>He added: \"So my main message is we can't let a little thunder and lightning get us down. We're going to have to roll with it.\"</p> <p>He described the convention so far as unbelievable. \"Michelle \u2013 what can I say? I'm a little biased, but she was unbelievable. And yesterday president Clinton, who I think broke down the issues as effectively as anybody could,\" Obama said.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League is considering the introduction of rules to control escalating player wages before the huge influx of cash from the next television deals in 2013-16. Potential rules presented to the clubs by the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, at a meeting in London on Thursday include a salary cap or a form of Uefa's financial fair play rules.</p> <p>Some clubs feel strongly that the new TV deal, with \u00a33bn already secured from the UK rights, should not be swallowed up by a new wave of pay inflation. But any rule change requires 14 of the 20 Premier League clubs to agree and it is not clear whether sufficient clubs will be in favour of strengthening financial regulations.</p> <p>Manchester United and Arsenal, both of whom made profits in 2010-11, are understood to favour rules similar to Uefa's, which require clubs to move towards breaking even financially, not making losses. On Thursday Ars\u00e8ne Wenger supported that view, the Arsenal manager saying: \"You should just get the resources you generate, that will determine the real size of the club.\"</p> <p>However, some clubs see that as a move by the two with the greatest income to outspend everyone else. Manchester City, whose path to becoming Premier League champions has been achieved by the club's Abu Dhabi owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, subsidising huge losses, are thought unlikely to support new regulations, even though they have consistently said they are aiming to break even. City argue that a level of investment by an owner to bankroll losses is necessary to lift a club to success on the field and commercially.</p> <p>Other clubs, including Fulham, Everton, West Bromwich Albion, Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur, are also understood to question whether clubs need new regulations, rather than being trusted to manage their own affairs.</p> <p>Despite income rising every year, pay to players has risen steadily over the past decade. In 2001-02, clubs spent \u00a31.1bn, 62% of their income, on players' wages. In 2010-11, the most recent year for which financial figures are available, income grew to \u00a32.5bn but players' wages amounted to \u00a31.8bn, 70% of the clubs' turnover. Despite massive commercial growth and the Premier League's growing popularity abroad, only eight of the 20 clubs made a profit in 2010-11.</p> <p>West Ham United's chairman, David Gold, is vocally in favour of introducing rules to limit wages to help clubs make a profit, as is Dave Whelan, the Wigan Athletic owner. Peter Coates, the Stoke City owner, said all clubs would be helped by having to conform to agreed rules.</p> <p>\"I hope this view is widely shared: we cannot have all the new money going in inflated wages and payments to agents,\" Coates said. \"There is no need to do that; we will have the same players, they won't get better because we pay them more. It should not be beyond us to find a formula which works for us all.\"</p> <p>Ellis Short, the owner and chairman of Sunderland, who lost \u00a38m last year having spent 77% of the club's income in wages, is understood to favour restricting salary increases to 10% in each of the new TV deal's three years.</p> <p>The clubs have agreed to work on the proposals in two separate groups of 10, then for all 20 to meet to consider the issue in detail at the end of September. The Premier League did not want to comment in detail until further work has been done; a spokesman confirmed: \"There is a process under way to examine potential further financial regulation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Beaming from ear to ear, Jeremy Hunt called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/05/conservative-cabinet-reshuffle-explained-video\" title=\"\">his new NHS posting</a> \"the greatest privilege of my life\". That was before he saw his in-tray. He must by now be gazing at a pyramid of hand grenades with loose pins \u2013 although he may not recognise them until they explode.</p> <p>He is, after all, without any experience of this most complex and delicate service in the midst of a deliberately disruptive re-disorganisation and commercialisation, one the NHS chief executive famously calls \"big enough to be seen from space\". What's more, Hunt's job is to do two impossible things at once.</p> <p>First, it's full steam ahead on the great plan. Woebegone Andrew Lansley was assured there would be \"no stepping off the gas\". Indeed, set hard in law, under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/20/nhs-reform-health-bill-passes-vote\" title=\"\">the new act</a> there can be no turning back on the competition regime that lets \"any qualified provider\" bid for every part of the health service, a process already bursting out into more local private contracts than we can count. The NHS is the chosen testbed for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jul/11/open-public-services-white-paper-expectations\" title=\"\">Open Public Services white paper</a> plan to outsource all the public sector \u2013 though trying it first on the NHS was like putting in the miner to see if the air was safe for the canary. Hunt has no problem with the big idea; as co-author of a revealing 2005 pamphlet, he announced: \"Our ambition should be to break down the barriers between private and public provision, in effect denationalising the provision of health care in Britain.\" But between the neat ideology and the chaotic reality, he will find a great chasm.</p> <p>His second task contradicts the first: No 10's instructions are to close down NHS trouble before the election: stop the noise, tell a good story, schmooze the staff, keep it off the headlines \u2013 all this with cuts beyond anything the NHS has ever known. Lansley was sacked, they say, for failure to communicate: all that's needed is a change of messenger. Hunt's smiley face, silver tongue and naked ambition will ensure he neutralises Cameron's greatest electoral hazard after the economy. Frankly, it's a hopeless task: lipstick on a pig.</p> <p>What will he find? Cash crises breaking out all over. The King's Fund deputy director says cuts will be closer to \u00a350bn than \u00a320bn. John Appleby reports a 1% cut each year, compounded by 2.5% inflation, when the NHS always hits crisis without at least 2% above inflation to keep up with ageing patients. The NHS Confederation warns of \"a super-tanker heading for an&#xa0;iceberg\". There is emergency cash saved by the NHS Commissioning Board this year: Appleby expects mounting trouble from next year to election year. Labour private finance initiatives exacerbate the problem \u2013 but PFIs are only 1% of NHS turnover.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.slh.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">South London Healthcare NHS Trust</a> in administration is harbinger to&#xa0;many more. Foundation trusts, supposedly financially secure, are among the next \u2013 Peterborough losing \u00a350m a year is top of the danger list, with a long tail of others. The Department of Health is cutting tariffs, putting the bottom 10% in peril. No 10 is alarmed by a string of A&amp;E and maternity units set for closure: with William Hague, Paul Burstow and Iain Duncan Smith demonstrating to save local hospitals, what chance of persuading the public that some re-configuring is essential?</p> <p>Set aside the destructive nature of the&#xa0;NHS plan, and the immediate crisis springs from creating total turmoil at a time of what Stephen Dorrell, the health select committee chair, calls the toughest cuts ever imposed on any health service in the OECD. The official price is \u00a33bn, but that's not counting lost productivity and expertise as everyone reapplies for their job and frightening numbers of senior managers quit, with a real shortage of expertise to fill the 212 clinical commissioning groups. Nick Timmins's report Never Again, a clear-eyed analysis of Lansley's chaotic act, quotes senior civil servants warning: \"We did point out to him that his plans were written before the big financial challenge, and didn't that change things? He completely did not see that at all. He completely ignored it.\"</p> <p>Labour fought the election with an honest if dangerous plan to rationalise many hospitals units. Health experts all agree it must be done. But however well planned and well consulted, closures are always unpopular. Cameron's flagrant dishonesty \u2013 \"I'll cut the deficit, not the NHS\", now neatly reversed \u2013 was matched by lies about \"Brown's cuts\" as he joined picket lines at Chase Farm hospital, long needing reorganisation, in 2007. That led to a cowardly moratorium on all closures for two crucial years. Now&#xa0;managers wait to see if Hunt&#xa0;will again kick these into post-election never-never land. If so, he will need to prise money from the Treasury to prop up failing hospitals, with money needed&#xa0;for the community.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the great ideological plan marches on. Here's the paradigm: <a href=\"http://www.basildonandthurrock.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals</a>' accounts show an income drop of 13%. Why? Because severe rationing of treatments has cut the number sent for operations. The new president of the British Orthopaedic Association warns that rationing by \"draconian referral criteria\" for hip and knee replacement denies treatment until people lose their independence, while 120,000 wait on lists for more than 18 weeks. How will Basildon and others fill their cash gap?</p> <p>The Financial Times reports that the financial plan is for a large expansion of private work, aided by NHS restrictions fuelling a steep rise in patient-funded private surgery for hips and knees. So that's the way the NHS goes \u2013 rationing pushes more patients into the private sector: the act lets hospitals use 49% of beds for private work. Already insurance companies are jumping in to offer top-up cover for services the NHS is withdrawing. Under Labour, private practice dropped sharply as NHS waiting times fell to near zero: general hospitals were allowed to use only 2-3% of their facilities for private practice. Now that's in reverse \u2013 and it won't be popular.</p> <p>A burst of takeovers of GP surgeries by private companies is an early visible sign to the public of what's afoot: in Cameron's own Witney seat, Virgin Care has taken over <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Services/gp/Overview/DefaultView.aspx?id=42569\" title=\"\">Deer Park Medical Centre</a>, with an exodus of staff and patients, amid many complaints about locums.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt soon has to take secondary legislation through parliament so the regulator <a href=\"http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Monitor</a>can absorb the competition board \u2013 the most contentious driver of NHS commercialisation. That will be rowdy. He may beam with satisfaction at the fulfilment of his pamphlet's plan. But that's a hard sell to most voters, no matter how nicely he smiles.</p> <p><em>polly.toynbee@theguardian.com </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012 because it said incorrectly that \"Monitor, the regulator, is cutting tariffs, putting the bottom 10% in peril\".

It also confers certain important rights on their neighbours, designed to protect adjacent buildings. These rights particularly cover activity on the mutual boundary or in connection with party walls. They further encompass activity in the nature of deep excavations within three metres of the neighbouring foundations. Householders can require the developer to issue formal notices in respect of works covered by the act and, as I can attest, really focus the mind of developers on the appropriateness of the work in hand and the manner in which it is carried out.</p> <p>Additionally householders should be alert to potential right of light scenarios. The common law provisions may be antiquated but are still applicable, and, should the rights have been legally acquired, a development likely to breach those rights can be challenged at law.<br><strong>Barry Butler</strong> <br><em>Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Eight whole metres allowed for an extension.

  "<p>I've never been able to decide who I&#xa0;love the most between Harriet Cass and Charlotte Green; I assumed it would just, one day, shoot through my&#xa0;heart like an arrow. It's Harriet. She's the one. Charlotte was just a distraction, she never meant a thing to&#xa0;me.</p> <p>Sadly, they've <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/05/familiar-bbc-radio-voices-to-depart?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"both taken voluntary redundancy\">both taken voluntary redundancy</a> and now all I'll ever know is this huge sense of loss, emptying into my ears like an olive oil-based anti-wax solution.</p> <p>I hover over the typing of \"beautiful voice\" \u2013 naturally their voices are beautiful, soft and low, but most of all, quite posh, and I find it irritating, after this much of my life, that Radio 4 newsreaders still aren't allowed to sound like anybody but the Queen (don't give me Neil Nunes. He sounds more like the Queen than any of them). If they cared for democracy (Radio 4, I'm still on \u2013 not Cass and Green who, I&#xa0;believe, care deeply), they would employ announcers with accents that are directly proportional to the number of listeners they had from each area. If some of us didn't understand the 5% of news that was delivered from the Highlands, no matter. We could look on the internet.</p> <p>That aside, they are both classically easy on the ear, never harsh nor jerky, always in control. That doesn't explain the intensity of the relationship. In common with all radio presenters, they inspire a lot of imaginative projection. I constantly think I know what Sue MacGregor is really thinking; I am one step away from thinking she's only talking to me. When Tamsin Greig got a career outside The Archers, her appearance baffled me. Not because I&#xa0;thought she would be taller or shorter; rather, I was stunned that she had a corporeal existence at all. The disembodiment of these voices suggests fairy-godmother powers, so that I think of them as telepathic, magic, unendingly wise; for some reason it doesn't work with Chris Moyles, whose corporeality comes as&#xa0;no surprise.</p> <p>Nowhere is that sense stronger than with the newsreaders, though, who bring so little of themselves to the air that no imaginative conjuring is too far-fetched. You could build Charlotte Green, the woman, from scratch; who's going to stop you? All you really&#xa0;know about her is that she <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKBWsy5A2bA\" title=\"cracked up on air once\">cracked up on air once</a> when she heard&#xa0;a funny noise.</p> <p>Because Cass and Green live principally inside your own imagination; because they never give a view; because they never change; because, in a sense, the news never changes, always going from bad to worse, before quietly resetting itself so it can go back to bad; these voices provide continuity, not just for the schedule, but for the nation as a whole. It is often said that Cass, in particular, could announce a nuclear war and still make you feel as though she'd just given you a hot water bottle; but that isn't her voice \u2013 nobody's that reassuring \u2013 so much as the fact&#xa0;that she is immutable. So long as she remains the same, so can the world.</p> <p>Except it can't. What a&#xa0;bummer.</p>",
  "<p>Children with the worst reading skills could improve their literacy with daily supplements of fatty acids found in fish, seafood and some algae, researchers claim.</p> <p>Scientists gave a daily 600mg omega-3 fatty acid pill to children aged seven to nine and found that those whose reading skills were in the lowest fifth of the normal range improved over the four months of the study.</p> <p>On average, the children in the bottom 20% for literacy boosted their reading age by three weeks more than a control group taking a daily placebo. Those in the lowest 10% for literacy improved their reading age by 1.9 months compared with the placebo group.</p> <p>The idea that omega-3 supplements can improve brain function in some children is controversial, and the latest study, from researchers at Oxford University, has already drawn criticism. The study was funded by a company called DSM Nutritional Lipids, which makes omega-3 supplements, though the study was performed at Oxford independently.</p> <p>One contentious point is that the study, involving 74 Oxfordshire schools, looked at reading and behavioural problems in 362 children who were in the lowest third for literacy skills. Analysis on this group of children found no improvements in reading or working memory, and while parents said their children had fewer behavioural problems, their teachers reported no change on these scores.</p> <p>The positive effects of the pills were seen only in a subgroup of the worst-performing 224 children and for reading only. Again, teachers recorded none of the improved behaviour parents saw, such as less hyperactivity and \"so-called opposition-defiant behaviour\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/staff/research/profile/richardson.html\" title=\"Oxford: Alex Richardson\">Alex Richardson</a>, who led the study at Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, said the original trial had been designed to look at children in the poorest 20% for reading skills, but children in the bottom third were added to get the right number of participants for the study.</p> <p>Despite the study's shortcomings, Richardson said the potential improvement in the poorest readers warranted follow-up work to confirm or rule out the effect.</p> <p>\"This is not going to help any child who isn't lacking in these nutrients,\" she said. \"But to bring up the tail-end, that is something that theoretically makes sense. This is such an important group of children in terms of their life chances, and you have to catch them early. It's a cumulative thing.</p> <p>\"Kids who can't read are effectively going to miss out on the rest of their schooling, because if you can't read it is very difficult to access the rest of the curriculum.\"</p> <p>Omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), appear to play a crucial role in brain development by supporting the growth of neurons and their connections to one another. The substance is found naturally in fish oils and some algae, but may be lacking in some people's diets.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/micheal.crawford/\" title=\"Imperial: Michael Crawford\">Michael Crawford</a>, who studied DHA and brain development at Imperial College London, said the substance was vital for healthy brain development of children in the womb.</p> <p>\"Once they are born, the basic architecture of their brain is already defined. You're not going to make an Einstein out of somebody who doesn't have the potential at birth,\" he said.</p> <p>But he felt the results warranted further investigation. \"You're bound to get a gradation in ability. Some children will be at the top and some at the bottom. The ones at the top you're not going to influence very much, if at all, but the ones at the bottom, the fact that you can make a difference to them is important. It shows there is a potential to help those who are least able.\"</p> <p>Crawford said much longer term studies were needed to confirm the extent of any effect of omega-3 on children's brains at school age.</p> <p>\"The problem with all of these studies is that they're really addressing a formed brain, and so they are far too short and underpowered by comparison with any of the sorts of trials we do in clinical medicine. For some reason, the people working with children, on the brain, expect the brain to be manipulated in a period of 16 weeks. It's a fundamental flaw.\"</p> <p>Details of the study are published in the journal <a href=\"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043909\" title=\"Docosahexaenoic acid for reading, cognition and behaviour in children aged 7-9\">PloS One</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012.

  "<p>In January of this year the parents of the exiled Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani took a call at their apartment in Tehran from a man who said he was an official of the supreme court of the Islamic Republic. He began shouting at her father, telling him that his daughter would be punished, that her breasts would be cut off and presented to him on a plate.</p> <p>A few days earlier, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJ9IChKF90\" title=\"\">Farahani had appeared in a short black-and-white video</a> with 30 other \"young hopes\" of the French cinema to promote the C\u00e9sars, the \"French Oscars\", where she had been nominated for her role in the winsome immigrant comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2L8m3Agtvg\" title=\"\">Si Tu Meurs, Je Te Tue (If You Die, I'll Kill You)</a>. The promo had each actor take off an item of clothing as they stared into the camera to commit their \"body and soul\" to their art. Farahani chose to bare her right breast, saying: \"I will put flesh to your dreams.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What followed in Iran was little short of a cultural earthquake. \"It was a catastrophe,\" she remembers, her head dropping into her hands. \"I don't know exactly how many tens of millions of people typed my name into Google the next day, I don't want to know \u2026\" A taboo of unimaginable proportions had been shattered, and not by some publicity-hungry provocateur, but by the most loved and admired actor in the country. Farahani may have only been another 29-year-old hopeful in France, but in Iran she became a star the moment she appeared in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187809/\" title=\"\">Dariush Mehrjui's The Pear Tree</a> at 14. Eighteen films later there is more than a little of Garbo, Jeanne Moreau and Irene Papas about her: a rare beauty and intelligence married to a burning emotional honesty in a country where truth of any kind is hard to come by.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1113810/\" title=\"\">M for Mother</a> she seared herself into the national consciousness playing a pregnant woman gassed during the Iran-Iraq war, abandoned by her husband and now carrying \"a gift from God\" in her womb. Both rural and urban Iran embraced her as their down-to-earth hero: Golshifteh, the star without airs. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marjane-satrapi\" title=\"\">Marjane Satrapi</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/may/15/biography.iran\" title=\"\">Persepolis</a> who directed her in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663321/\" title=\"\">Chicken with Plums</a>, says: \"She was not just Iran, she was the mother of Iran.\"</p> <p>The day the video was posted, when what she calls the \"fire\" started, the official Fars news agency in Tehran issued a communique lacerating her, saying that the pictures showed the \"hidden, disgusting face of cinema\". This kind of opprobrium had never before been poured on an artist, however much they had upset the regime. Her exile was now a banishment.</p> <p>Farahani had already been banned from working by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for not wearing a headscarf at the New York premiere of Ridley Scott's CIA thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126190/body.of.lies\" title=\"\">Body of Lies</a>, where, playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, she became the first Iranian actress to appear in a Hollywood film since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>The film's critical take on the CIA \u2013 which overthrew Iran's last freely elected government in 1953 \u2013 cut little ice with the ayatollahs, who took her passport away as further punishment. Four years ago, with doors closing all around her amid a pre-election crackdown that would eventually spark the green revolution, Farahani fled to France after being in effect fined the impossible-to-pay sum of \u20ac2m. When she spoke out from Paris in favour of the failed green revolution, she was told not to return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395794011\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346952522827/Farahani-in-About-Elly.-010.jpg\" alt=\"Farahani in About Elly.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farahani in About Elly. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a final twist of the knife, the censors banned the last film she made there, Asghar Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360860/\" title=\"\">About Elly</a>, even before it was shown. Like many before her, Farahani had quietly ignored the ban to take the lead role, hoping it would all blow over.</p> <p>Strangely, it would never have seen the light of day, nor have won the Silver Bear at Berlin, had it not been saved by an unlikely intervention from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself, who said it was \"not fair that a film be condemned by the mistake of one actress\".</p> <p>But that was before she slipped her shoulder out of her shirt with the unconscious air of Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People and became a lightning conductor for the divisions within Iranian society. Ahmadinejad is never likely to be so forgiving again.</p> <p>Farahani insists, however, that she did not set out to shock or provoke. \"I hate politics. It is not my job. As always, something you do for nothing becomes political. I knew it would be difficult. But I am living in France now, I have to work here, and either I am living here or I am not.</p> <p>\"It was a big shock for me and my family and for the whole of Iranian society. The good thing is it started a huge debate that could never have happened before. I was there watching people insult me, others answering them, others defending me, others attacking again.</p> <p>\"There were lots of fights within families. Young people especially saw who they were through this debate, and they saw the reality of people they were trusting in.\"</p> <p>The collateral damage was nevertheless immense. Her father, a lion of a man, a communist theatre director and a dissident both under the shah and Khomeini, stopped talking for five days and had to be admitted to hospital after repeated threats. \"It was very bad. This was the first time they couldn't support me. The fire was so strong that they were also burning in it.</p> <p>\"I should be careful because I know they are being held hostage \u2026 But then after a while, because of the background of my father \u2013 who dragged himself up from very humble origins \u2013 their feelings began to change. My father was afraid I had lost the support of the people, which is very important to him, because he has spent his whole life battling for the people, sacrificing everything. But after a month or two he saw the people had more respect for me, and he became very happy.</p> <p>\"They even went to a wedding of nomads in the centre of Iran. Everyone from all the generations came to them and held their hands and said: 'Don't be sad. We love Golshifteh.' My mother started crying. That is the beauty of Iran, and that is why I am so proud of being an Iranian, especially the women.\"</p> <p>But Farahani doesn't want to be a \"Joan of Arc, an actress 'with a story', an exotic victim of persecution. Exile is like death. You cannot understand it until it happens to you. The whole world wants to see you as a victim and they push you to be even more a victim because they see you miserable and they feel good. That is why French people are so obsessed with causes like Syria. It is a kind of pornography to make them feel better about being themselves, but they don't give a shit. They say, 'Come, we will look after you,' and then they fuck you up and don't give you papers. I am just an actor, and I want to work.\"</p> <p>That said, she is hugely grateful to France. \"For the first time in my life I appreciated being a woman. Paris is a city that liberates you as a woman from all your sins that you think you are guilty of, it washes away all of that and you are free.\"</p> <p>She pulls a white scarf around her shoulders. It's her old headscarf, \"my old friend\". \"The biggest problem for Iranian actresses,\" she says is not the government but the world outside \"who think we come out of our mothers with our heads covered\".</p> <p>\"Look at <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0368689/\" title=\"\">Leila Hatami</a>. Normally after winning an Oscar [for Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jun/30/a-separation-review\" title=\"\">A Separation</a>] you get lots of work. But nothing is happening and she speaks four languages.\"</p> <p>But Farahani won't be held. She has two more films coming out this autumn in France, a new road movie shot in the US with Sienna Miller, and the almost made-to-measure lead in Atiq Rahimi's The Patience Stone, which he adapted from his own Goncourt prize-winning novel about an Afghan woman standing guard over the body of her husband.</p> <p>Satrapi compares Farahani to Elizabeth Taylor at her height, but she is a better actor than Taylor: smarter, funnier and more at ease with herself, this is someone who, after spending her childhood welded to a piano, said no to the Vienna Conservatoire.</p> <p>For like her father, Farahani is a fundamentalist about art. She tells how Farhadi \"tortured\" her on the set of About Elly, forcing her to break her voice for the part, making her shout at the Caspian sea for half an hour every morning before shooting and swallow chickpea flour so she could only croak and rasp. Her eardrum was perforated in the beating she took from another actor and he refused to let her be treated till they finished the next day. They haven't spoken since. \"He's my friend but he cannot talk to me. He is still coming and going from Iran. I am evil now. Paranoia is part of how they control you.\"</p> <p>\"I have scars from every film I have made,\" she says, lifting her sleeve and leg to show me. \"There is nothing to protect actors. They treat you worse than a dog. You work like a slave, and you know I like it. That is the way it should be. Every film should be like your last.\"</p> <p><em>About Elly is released on 14 September</em></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron was on ITV Daybreak's comfy sofa to promote the coalition's latest relaunch (we must all build more conservatories) before breakfast yesterday, while Ed Miliband was in the City before lunch preaching something called \"pre-distributional\" politics (free conservatories). But, as so often, the day's heavy lifting was being done across the Commons dispatch box.</p> <p>Conscientious MPs crowded in to see if the rumour was true that Vince Cable has been placed under house arrest as part of the reshuffle. It was true, almost. The Lib Dems' leader-in-exile turned up for his monthly hour of business questions flanked by his new free market ministerial minders, \u2013 Labour's Chuka Umunna's label - Matt Hancock and Michael Fallon. Cable was not gagged as such, let alone tagged or even discreetly chained. He was allowed to give several answers, initially lacklustre but with growing confidence, faltering only when challenged about Cumbrian housing shortages by Tim Farron, his younger rival in the post-Clegg succession stakes. Sarcastic Labour cries of \"dream team\" may well have put him off his stroke.</p> <p>As always, the unscripted moments were most interesting, for a starlet was born. Not Hancock or Fallon \u2013 one a Dave 'n' George groupie, the other a Thatcher retread with distinctly bald tyres \u2013 but the token Lib Dem newcomer on the squad, Jo Swinson, 32.</p> <p>Whereas the brainy pair clung to their key stage 3 civil service scripts, anodyne stuffed shirt answers way beyond a fault, Swinson was perky and even sympathetic to MPs on all sides who were voicing alarm that coalition zeal for markets may stuff Britain's remaining post offices. Well done, Jo. Perhaps she is the post-Clegg leader? Just kidding, Nick. As so often after a mass sacking, the mood was kind. For instance, there was cross-party praise for the outgoing further education minister, John Hayes, switched to the energy brief.</p> <p>Labour's Ian Mearns (Gateshead) actually said of minister Fallon, an ex-MP for Darlington, that \"at least he knows where the north-east is\". Fallon is now safely installed in Sevenoaks, so this was generous.</p> <p>But it was nothing to the tributes lavished on Sir George Young, deposed as leader of the Commons after a mercurial career that has seen him sacked and recalled by Mrs T, then raised from the near-dead by Cameron, a fellow pupil at what Olympic rowing fans now call Eton Dorney comprehensive. And what better way to demoralise Young's successor, Andrew Lansley, than to praise his martyred predecessor as a champion of parliament?</p> <p>Lansley took it well: if he had been half as gracious at health he might still be RoboCop to the NHS. Pummelled on subjects ranging from banned Lancashire Morris dancers to the disbanded 2nd battalion of Fusiliers, he was politely cautious. Then when invited to condemn a limp-wristed judge he more or less told Tory \"libertarian\" Phil Davies to get stuffed. This was a promising start.</p> <p>Less propitious was the conservatory liberation statement made later by Eric Pickles. With his cropped hair and chilly demeanour Pickles looks like another Eric: Eric von Stalhein, the villainous German spy in countless Biggles adventure stories.</p> <p>Von Pickles made much of the \"common sense\" and \"practical measures\" that he will be unleashing to revive the Labour-battered construction industry. The Green Belt will be safe with him, he assured MPs, before explaining that local authorities will be able to tweak the belt a bit to build new homes on it.</p> <p>Hilary \"Biggles\" Benn, his Labour shadow, was having none of the blather. For all his talk of localism von Pickles is taking the power to strip councils of their control over planning decisions if they don't do what he wants, protested Biggles. In desperate response von Pickles played the class card, which may well explain his survival in an Eton Dorney cabinet.</p> <p>All very well for a millionaire aristo like Benn with his rolling acres, he replied. But \"I speak as a working class lad who is proud to own a detached house whose garden is smaller than your croquet lawn.\"</p> <p>Duh? The croquet lawn is not a contest this cabinet can win.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama should be losing the 2012 presidential election \u2013 or so says the conventional wisdom. With <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\">unemployment above 8%</a>, a recovery that is mediocre at best and economic uncertainty far more the rule than the exception, there is certainly something to this argument. Yet, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">according to polling guru Nate Silver</a>, President Obama is currently a 76% favorite for re-election.</p> <p>So why does Obama continue to maintain a small, yet stubborn lead not only in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/p/2012-election/polls/president\">general election polling</a>, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013 in a <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1781\">majority of key swing states</a>? It's the same reason he should be losing the presidential race: his Republican opponents.</p> <p>That might seem like a confusing explanation, but it's emblematic of the extent to which the GOP has been Obama's worst enemy over the past four years while, at the same time, may ensure that he is re-elected president.</p> <p>To unpack this admittedly convoluted argument, let's begin with focusing on the dominant political dynamic of the past four years. It's not about President Obama's legislative agenda or his post-partisan dreams, but rather the unceasing and unprecedented obstructionism of the Republican party. From day one of his presidency (actually, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/biden-mcconnell-decided-to-withhold-all-cooperation-even-before-we-took-office/2012/08/10/64e9a138-e302-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html\">even before Obama took office</a>), Republicans made the conscious decision to not just simply oppose Obama's entire policy agenda, but to actively and flagrantly thwart it. They promiscuously used the filibuster to block <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/news/la-pn-republicans-block-smallbusiness-tax-break-on-procedural-vote--20120712\">even the holding of votes on Democratic proposals in the Senate</a> and punished party members who contemplated the idea of working together with Obama or \u2013 even worse \u2013 compromising with him.</p> <p>Indeed, that Obama was even able to pass an <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/are-we-better-off-there-s-no-easy-answer.html\">$800bn stimulus measure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\">comprehensive healthcare reform</a> is perhaps the single most surprising political story, not just of the past four years, but indeed the past 40.</p> <p>The Republicans' obstructionist \"successes\" have taken a heavy toll and can be seen most dramatically in US economic performance since 2009. When fiscal policy has been expansive \u2013 as in the case of the stimulus being passed only a few weeks after Obama took office \u2013 the result has been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-the-stimulus-work-a-review-of-the-nine-best-studies-on-the-subject/2011/08/16/gIQAThbibJ_blog.html\">job creation and economic growth</a> (albeit of the more tepid variety). When Congress has adopted GOP-favored policies of austerity \u2013 spending cuts and reliance on tax cuts to stimulate the economy \u2013 the results have been far worse. By consistently opposing and blocking any effort by Obama and the Democrats to grow the economy through additional stimulus measures, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/republicans-defeat-obama-jobs-bill\">the president's job bill</a>, and even seeking to intimidate the Federal Reserve into focusing its attention on inflation rather than unemployment, they have actively undermined policies with the potential to spark an economic turnaround.</p> <p>While one can debate the morality of such an approach, the political results speak for themselves. An underperforming economy has harmed the president's political prospects and made him far more vulnerable to defeat than he would have been if Republicans had supported or, at least, not completely obstructed his stimulus efforts. This creates a rather disturbing political dynamic: namely, that the GOP strategy of obstructing Obama's agenda was political savvy and their only real hope of ensuring his defeat in 2012.</p> <p>Opposition was the only real alternative for a party intent on taking back the White House in four years, and it certainly helped Republicans to take back the house in 2010.</p> <p>Had Republicans been more supportive of his agenda, or at least allowed the Senate to hold votes on it, the economy would likely be in better shape and Obama would be in a far better position for re-election. From that perspective, obstructionism has been a net political plus for the GOP.</p> <p>But obstruction is not opposition, and this is where Republicans have left the door open for Obama. By giving the president no support for even the smallest bits of legislation (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein\">including programs they once supported</a>) and by not even allowing votes in the Senate on the president's agenda, they went from loyal oppositionists to relentless and partisan scolds \u2013 a point brilliantly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80808.html?hp=t1_b1\">reiterated by former President Clinton in his speech at the Democratic convention Wednesday night</a>.</p> <p>This is the downside to the GOP's four-year scorched-earth policy. By adopting such extreme anti-Obama positions, by taking the stance that any and all efforts to use the resources of the federal government to grow the economy are incipient socialism, and by making the political defeat of Obama, rather than just his policies, the party's central priority has opened up Republicans to the charge that they have been needless obstructionists who had no plan of their own for fixing the economy. It's hard not to see Romney's failure to offer any serious policy proposals for turning the economy around at his own convention as evidence of a party that refuses to contemplate any policy that doesn't include cutting taxes or shrinking regulation.</p> <p>So the same radical anti-government forces that push Republicans to reject every element of President Obama's policy agenda also make it impossible for the party's standard-bearer to offer voters anything more than empty platitudes.</p> <p>Far worse, the GOP has learned the hard way that, metaphorically, if you lie down with dogs, you get fleas. Implicit acceptance of the far right's narrative of Obama as an America-hating socialist has activated the GOP's most radical wing of voters. Republicans took a position not simply of implacable hostility to Obama's policies, but to the man himself. As these extreme voices have increased their influence within the party, they've moved Republicans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/michael-cohen-republicans-embrace-extreme-right\">further and further to the uncompromising right on a host of issues</a> \u2013 from immigration to birth control and abortion \u2013 forcing their party's nominee to take policy positions that alienate even those voters disappointed in Obama's economic performance and inclined to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest cost of this approach is that while polls show that <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/trust_on_issues_obama_v_romney\">voters believe Romney would be a better steward of the economy</a>, they view Obama as someone who is <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/solid-chances-serious-challenges-greet-romney-at-his-convention/\">more likely to favor the middle class and is more in touch with the challenges that affect them directly</a>. That reservoir of trust, combined with the GOP's paucity of ideas, might just be enough for Obama to slide in for a second term.</p> <p>Finally, by adopting such stridently oppositionist positions, not just against Obama but against the notion that the federal government had any responsibilities beyond shrinking itself into oblivion, Republicans have provided a boost to the Democrats' vision of government. Voters <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/151490/Fear-Big-Government-Near-Record-Level.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Business%20-%20Politics\">may still recoil habitually at the idea of big government</a>, but they almost certainly recoil even further from the uncompromising alternative offered by the GOP. In desperate pursuit of political advantage, they have given Obama and the Democrats an opportunity to capture the political middle and redefine liberalism in terms that make it more palatable to a broad cross-section of voters.</p> <p>This is only one part of the long-term damage. By adopting stances of such rigid ideological purity, by needlessly offending the fastest growing minority groups in the country, as well as young voters, and, finally, by basing the party's short-term renaissance on the oldest and most reactionary voters, Republicans have left themselves in a political no-man's land, should they lose this election. Rebuilding a party that has bet its entire political future on unceasing hostility to Obama will not be so easy. In the end, Republicans placed all their chips on seeking to defeat Obama's agenda and, above all, Obama himself. That opposition has brought with it consequences that might not only backfire on election day, but may well also ensure that the GOP spends more than just four more years toiling in the political wilderness. </p> <p>For Obama, Republican hostility has left him bruised and in far worse shape politically than perhaps he should be in. But as he gives his acceptance speech at the Democratic national convention, he has the opportunity to turn the tables on those who have sought so lustily to thwart him. I'm guessing he won't miss the opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>The government's learning curve on planning is like an ant climbing a mountain. Desperate for someone to blame for the lack of growth, David Cameron has fallen back on the Margaret Thatcher's old bogey, local government, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/cameron-clegg-unveil-planning-reforms\" title=\"\">bugbear of planning control</a>. Last year he tried to nationalise development control, in the most cack-handed fashion, and was&#xa0;beaten back. Thousands of landowners came close to pocketing random lucrative building permits, as in Ireland. A crude bid by lobbyists to de-activate local planning was stopped just in time.</p> <p>Now the coalition is moving at least in the right direction. It is staying within the context of its revised framework and concentrating on tweaking the rules. It proposes a \"planning holiday\" on building extensions, to boost local construction. Intensifying the use of building plots, including back gardens, is sensible in a country whose suburbs have some of the lowest densities in Europe.</p> <p>Dismantling Section 106 agreements \u2013 under which developers contribute to the costs<strong> </strong>of infrastructure \u2013 is more controversial. Labour requiring all new estates to have 30%-50% \"affordable\" housing was a clear constraint on building, and means that sometimes nothing is built at all. But to offer to bring all such deals to Whitehall rather than slashing the minimum percentage below, say, 20 is a sure recipe for chaos and delay. The Treasury's Treasury secretary Danny Alexander asserted on Thursday that central government is the best judge of local markets, as he coolly nationalised yet another chunk of local government. To call this a localist government is laughable.</p> <p>Britain today has thousands of acres of land awaiting development. Drive (or, more revealingly, fly) across middle England and everywhere you see post-industrial brownfield sites lying vacant, more, probably, than ever in history. The British are desperately inefficient in their use of land. Young people expect to buy rather than rent far sooner than in Germany or most other European countries. Older families hoard space merely to pass it on one day to their children. There are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2011/oct/19/housing-shortage-oldsters-hoarding-bedrooms\" title=\"\">reportedly 25m unused bedrooms in England</a>, up to 400,000 houses empty and the same number of building plots lying idle with permission granted for building. High street premises are vacant because of restrictions on use.</p> <p>It is not planning but government regulation and subsidy that have distorted the property market for decades, helping neither rich nor poor. Cameron indulged last weekend in his ritual abuse of local councils and talked of putting planning departments into \"special measures\". Most are merely trying to interpret his ever-changing rules. He seems unaware that it is central regulation that lies at the heart of the problem.</p> <p>So where is the real de-regulation? There are no measures to bring empty property or empty sites back on to the market. There are no proposals to encourage subletting. There is no relief from the soaring cost of micro-regulation. Builders reckon Whitehall rules on building materials, wall thicknesses, health, energy, accessibility and safety have added some 30% to costs over the last 25 years, and are now a quarter more onerous than in Europe. It is not the lack of a meadow that holds back house-building in Britain, but government. Cameron should be inquiring into this, not dithering over Heathrow.</p> <p>Housing is like health. Everyone in politics declares it to be \"in crisis\". If house prices are soaring, they are in crisis; if falling, they are in crisis. But for those with an available downpayment, prices are falling, and a mortgage is cheaper than ever. It is not land supply that is \"in crisis\" but housing demand. Houses are no different from cars, holidays, consumer durables and private services. They are \"unaffordable\" because fewer people can afford them. Meanwhile, first-time buying is said to be picking up. Why? Because the government is splashing subsidy over it.</p> <p>The temptation for politicians to blame others for their own failings is understandable \u2013 and now overwhelming. But the British economy is stuck in double-dip recession, not because it has too much countryside but because it is in a liquidity trap. The chancellor rejects&#xa0;Thatcherite monetarism \u2013 pumping real money into the real economy \u2013 in favour of socialist centralism. George Osborne is trying to nationalise both the planning system and the housing market, and he wants to initiate grand projects which he seems to regard as not public spending, largely because he says so. He is all for deficit finance, so long as it is on projects for which the government can claim credit.</p> <p>The future prosperity of Britain does not lie in more power for the man in Whitehall. Shades of Silkingrad \u2013 what locals called Stevenage in 1946 in a fit of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">new-town blues</a> \u2013 hover over every central planning \"initiative\". Yet again this week ministers were murmuring of the need for new eco-cities, for something big and headline grabbing. The \"Shard mentality\" \u2013 that only something big and ordained by ministers can make a difference \u2013 is what enervated and impoverished urban Britain in the past half century. While Europe's provincial cities raced ahead, Britain's languished under the cosh of Westminster contempt.</p> <p>There is no tiger of growth straining at the leash inside the depths of the planning system. It is a myth, a fiction, a silly excuse. There is, instead, a tedious inflation of central regulation, which the government seems reluctant to combat. And there is no money. The chancellor refuses the one sure remedy to all this: to put his credit on the line and reflate the economy.</p>",
  "<p>The advisers to the royal family are facing a real dilemma over Prince Harry's naked pictures. Dare they make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about The Sun publishing one of the intimate photos?</p> <p>We already know that the Palace aides regarded the publication of the Las Vegas hotel room pictures as intrusive because their lawyers fired off a note to editors warning them against using them on the grounds they invaded the prince's privacy.</p> <p>But, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/06/press-prince-harry-naked-photos\">as last night's PCC statement made clear,</a> without a formal complaint from the Palace it can do nothing. Not only would it be \"inappropriate\", as it said, but it would be unprecedented for the commission to investigate a privacy matter without the wronged party making a complaint himself.</p> <p>If the Palace don't complain, it will be open season on Harry, and possibly other members of the royal family, because they will be viewed as having let The Sun get away with it.</p> <p>On the next occasion (and there always is a next occasion), the Daily Mail, say, or the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star and all their Sunday stablemates, will be desperate to publish.</p> <p>They will argue that if The Sun could stick two fingers up to the Palace without being punished then why should they not follow suit?</p> <p>Yet, should the Palace complain, then it faces the outside possibility, and gross embarrassment, of its complaint not being upheld. The Sun will surely advance the twin justifications it has already made - first, about there being a genuine public interest, and second, about it having been seen so widely on the net that it was effectively in the public domain.</p> <p>On the other hand, should the PCC find against The Sun, then its editor, Dominic Mohan, and its publisher, Rupert Murdoch, are unlikely to take the matter lying down.</p> <p>Murdoch has made much of it being a press freedom issue and is hardly going to tamely accept a censure from a body that, to all intents and purposes, is a busted flush anyway.</p> <p>There would undoubtedly be a split in the newspaper ranks too, between those who view publication as meretricious and those who believe it to have been warranted.</p> <p>Then, of course, there are the 3,800 members of the public who took the trouble to complain to the PCC. What faith will they have in press self-regulation should they be knocked back?</p> <p>Finally, given that the Palace employed their lawyers, Harbottle &amp; Lewis, would it take the legal route? In its warning letter, the law firm said there was no justification under English law to publish and that \"the only possible reason for publication of the photographs is one of prurience and nothing more\". In spite of that, I cannot imagine the Palace launching legal action against The Sun.</p> <p>In truth, and this is a sobering thought as the Leveson inquiry ponders the future form of press regulation, Murdoch looks to have won this battle already.</p> <p><em>Full PCC statement</em> <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=Nzk5NQ==\">here</a></p>",
  "<p>He has been called, inevitably, the British \"blade runner\", but that is to do a disservice to a sprinting talent who has burst out of the blocks in the last 12 months, leaving the competition in his wake.</p> <p>Jonnie Peacock, the T44 100m sprinter who takes on Oscar Pistorius and Brazil's Alan Oliveira on Thursday night, deserves to be judged on his own talent, not compared to someone else's. The sprinter was on few radars until relatively close to these home games. Only 15 when Pistorius cruised to victory in 2008 in Beijing, Peacock was inspired to start taking the track seriously and since his 100m debut at the London disability athletics challenge in 2009 his improvement has been rapid.</p> <p>Now 19, Peacock has taken almost a second off his time in 12 months.</p> <p>He took part in his first international meet in May this year, coming first in the T43/44 100m at the Paralympic orld cup in Manchester.</p> <p>In July he beat the world record, running 10.85, 0.06 faster than the previous T44 record set in 2007 by the American 2004 champion, Marlon Shirley, and better than the 10.91 mark set by Pistorius, a T43 (the classification for athletes with double amputations below the knee) sprinter, five years ago.</p> <p>Cambridge\u2013born Peacock had to have his right leg amputated below the knee after contracting a form of meningitis at the age of five. He started athletics almost accidentally, after asking about disability sport at the hospital that fitted his prosthetic leg in his teens with the aim of joining a football team. The experts pointed him to a Paralympic talent day in Mile End in London and at a subsequent five-month intensive programme he found himself in a bidding war between wheelchair tennis, shooting and athletics. In a pre-Games interview he said: \"Obviously I picked athletics because it's the best event. I just love sprinting because it's so raw. Literally from here to here, how fast can you go? You don't pace yourself, just go nuts. Pure speed. I love it.\"</p> <p>Peacock, competing in his first Paralympics, talked of his pride at simply making the team.</p> <p>\"To be part of a home Paralympics \u2013 I'm so proud,\" he said. \"To be part of the Paralympic movement at the moment \u2013 it's getting better day by day.\"</p> <p>Peacock, a charmer well aware of his talents, is one of many Paralympians in these games who defies people watching him to judge him on his disability, rather than the raw ability he demonstrates.</p> <p>\"When I was 13-14 I used to think, why me, I wish I had two legs,\" he said. \"But I wouldn't wish for a second now that I had two legs. I wouldn't have the opportunities I have had [\u2026] I wouldn't change it for a second.\"</p>",
  "<p>As acts of self-indulgence go, Jeremy Hunt's final gambit as culture secretary was better than his critics might have expected.

Mr Hunt always insisted that philanthropy on the American model could sustain the arts in England. If anyone could make it work, then Sir Peter might be that person.</p> <p>The problem is less the man (although he has dubious form on the question of the BBC licence fee), but the job he is being asked to do. Arts funded through individuals' random generosity or corporate brand-building, or, sometimes, status-seeking conspicuous consumption, does produce work of exceptional quality, as anyone who listens to the relay of New York's Metropolitan Opera on BBC Radio 3 on a Saturday evening knows.</p> <p>What philanthropy is much less good at doing is new or experimental work, and the arts beyond the country's principal cities \u2013 precisely the kind of thing that ACE has supported so successfully. The contrast between the vibrancy of British theatre \u2013 where the facility to experiment without immediate fear of the market occasionally sparks great commercial successes such as War Horse \u2013 and the deadening flatness of much of what fills the American stage is instructive.</p> <p>Dame Liz has made the 30% cuts demanded by the coalition, and is still working on slashing back office costs by a full half, while assuming <a href=\"http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/27032012-museum-sector-laments-forgan-exit\" title=\"\">new responsibilities for museums</a> and libraries.

  "<p>On the dusty, narrow Route de la Combe d'Ire leading up to the Alpine beauty spot celebrated in local guidebooks as a tourist must-see, a sign reads \"Dangerous Road\" in French, English and German.</p> <p>For the British holidaymakers who ventured up this single lane of ragged asphalt on a sunny late afternoon on Wednesday \u2013 and the ill-fated French cyclist who followed moments later \u2013 the warning was to prove prophetically true in ways nobody could have imagined.</p> <p>On Thursday, this picturesque corner of France where the cows outnumber local people by two to one was in a state of profound shock at its transformation from rural idyll to international crime scene. \"Nothing happens here. Nothing,\" said one local woman, holding her face in her hands, before turning away visibly upset.</p> <p>Chevaline may be in the guidebooks, but few in the outside world will have heard of it until this week. The hamlet, population 150, puts the somnolence into sleepy. Just off the district road that flanks Lake Annecy, visitors, even those armed with maps and guides, have to go looking for it. La Route de la Combe d'Ire, which twists and turns from the lush fields below up into the forested mountains, requires extraordinary curiosity.</p> <p>In winter, this is ski territory. In summer, it is a magnet for hikers, cyclists who like a challenge and paragliders who throw themselves off the surrounding mountains to swirl and swoop like modern-day Icaruses high over the water.</p> <p>Nobody knows what drew the British family to this particular spot on that particular day. Police say they were wearing \"city clothes\" and certainly were not dressed for serious walking. Perhaps, police officers suggested, they had fancied the idea of a \"pleasant stroll\" in the woods.</p> <p>\"Just because they weren't dressed for hiking doesn't mean they weren't going for a family walk with the children. It's a lovely, agreeable spot,\" said public prosecutor Eric Maillaud with a certain insistence.</p> <p>The family had set off sometime on Wednesday from Le Solitaire du Lac, a summer camping ground surrounded by grazing Abondance cows, for which the Haute Savoie is famous, where they had booked a family caravan, complete with rust-coloured awning, from 3 September for what detectives described as a \"short break\".</p> <p>The adults chatted in English with fellow campers; the girls played outside. They were, to all appearances, a perfectly normal family enjoying a perfectly ordinary late summer holiday.</p> <p>Police said there were bags and suitcases in their BMW estate car when they left, but they were certainly planning on returning and the caravan, which was neat and tidy, showed no signs of being abandoned.</p> <p>Some time on Wednesday, the family left the campsite and drove along the busy two lane route that follows the western perimeter of Lake Annecy, France's second largest lake whose breathtaking beauty has earned its reputation as the \"Venice of the Alps\".</p> <p>From the moment they turned off the winding route around the lake into the hills, shortly after 3pm, however, what happened becomes as hazy as the ethereal mist rising off the vast lake on Thursday yesterday morning.</p> <p>Less than 24 hours after the gruesome discovery of four dead bodies, a critically injured girl and a terrified four-year-old at the top of the Combe d'Ire, a posse of local gendarmes stood guard by the \"Dangerous Road\". At the Saint-Jorioz campsite, the atmosphere had lost something of its bucolic charm as staff attempted to keep out the nosy and inquisitive. \"Sorry, you can't come in. Sorry, we can't say anything. Sorry,\" said a French girl on the gate.</p> <p>It was hoped the press conference at the Palais de Justice in Annecy, just 10 miles as the crow flies, but considerably longer by road, might clear the fog of rumour that had the family gunned down by drug barons or on the orders of mafia dons, or victims of a rabid madman picking off English tourists. But police and prosecutor stuck to the facts.</p> <p>\"If we had found something suspicious in the car, I can tell you I would not tell you,\" said Lt Col Beno\u00eet Vinnemann, head of the local gendarmerie.</p> <p>Maillaud went through what was known step by step, by turns impatient and incredulous at journalists' demands for the most minute detail.</p> <p>\"A British cyclist was making his way up the road around 3.50pm. There was a climb so he was going at his own pace when he was overtaken by another cyclist. He carried on up the hill and arrived at a forest parking spot popular with holidaymakers as the start for forest walks and hikes. When he arrived he found a vehicle, a powerful BMW family car, with the motor still running. The first thing he saw was a little girl by the car, clearly still alive. He went to her aid and put her in the rescue position then alerted the emergency services.</p> <p>\"He then saw the cyclist that had passed him on the ground, clearly dead. The cyclist's bike was abandoned a little way away. He broke the driver's side window \u2013 it was a British car so this was the right hand window \u2013 to cut the ignition. When he did so he saw three dead people in the car \u2013 one man in the driver's seat and two women behind, one of them a certain age and one younger.\"</p> <p>The British cyclist, a former member of the RAF was \"as you can imagine, profoundly shocked\".</p> <p>\"It was he who found the little girl first. She had suffered very serious head fractures from being beaten very badly and had been shot in the shoulder. She was hit extremely violently,\" Maillaud said.</p> <p>Both he and the gendarmes, who immediately sealed off the area until a forensics squad arrived from Paris, insisted they had no idea a second child was still in the car. \"We didn't touch the bodies, and this enabled the second girl to hide. There was nothing that led us to believe there was anyone else in the car apart from the three dead people.</p> <p>\"It was only when a neighbour at the camping site who had spoken to the family and told investigators there were two children and not one, we were alerted. In any case there was only one car seat in the vehicle. It wasn't until around 23.00 we became aware there was a second child.</p> <p>\"She was hiding under the legs, under the skirt and amid the bags of the women in the back. She was completely invisible and completely silent.\"</p> <p>Terrorised and unable to tell helpers from attackers, Maillaud said, she had remained paralysed with fear and mute.</p> <p>\"She was clearly happy when she was taken into the arms of the gendarme who brought her out of the car. She smiled and started to speak in English. He spoke back to her in English. Almost straight away she asked where was her family,\" Maillaud continued.</p> <p>Lt Col Bertrand Fran\u00e7ois, of the Haute Savoie gendarmerie, added: \"We did not search for survivors because there was never any indication there was a living person in that car. The girl was small and hidden and did not show up on a heat detector.\"</p> <p>While refusing to speculate, Maillaud admitted that the modus operandi of the killer had been \"strange\".</p> <p>The gunman had used a semi-automatic pistol, requiring the trigger to be pulled for each shot, and not a shotgun as previously reported. The car had not been sprayed with bullets, but the killer had specifically targeted the windows, leaving the bodywork unscratched. The driver, the elderly woman in the rear of the car \u2013 thought to be the children's grandmother \u2013 and the passing cyclist, who appears to have had no connection with the family, had all died from shots to the head. It was not yet known how the younger woman \u2013 believed to be the children's mother \u2013 had died.</p> <p>There was no evidence of theft and no obvious motive. \"At the moment we know strictly nothing,\" Maillaud said. \"All hypotheses are being explored but right now we have no idea. It's impossible to say who was killed first or what exactly happened.\"</p> <p>Vinnemann said the beauty spot at the top of Route de la Combe d'Ire was not known as a haunt for delinquents or drug dealers, nor was there a problem with guns in the area.</p> <p>\"We have a profusion of ideas and lots of hypotheses, all of which have to be looked at. We don't, at the moment, have any leads,\" Vinnemann said. \"I have been a gendarme for a long time and have seen some things, but I have never come across anything like this.\"</p> <p>Maillaud insisted he wanted to \"stick to the facts\", but allowed himself a moment of pessimism.</p> <p>\"My biggest worry is that we will not find the killers and we will never know,\" he said, adding that one of his principle concerns was for the two orphaned girls.</p> <p>\"They are now our greatest concern. Clearly we will try to speak to them but we will have to do so gently, with care and humanity. Can you imagine? That four-year-old child sat silent and still for eight hours next to a dead body. I don't know how many four-year-olds any of you know, but just imagine that.\"</p>",

I always had a kind of funny voice and it never occurred to me that I could sing. I went to college and sang around a bunch of musician friends because I had been taking piano lessons since I was seven, so I kind of gravitated towards musicians. I started forming bands and writing songs just for fun and then I really got into it and got attached to it. Then a friend of mine asked me to be a singer in his jazz band. He gave me all these jazz CDs and I studied all these different singers and I kind of taught myself how to sing for a gig, but I didn't take it seriously until later. I was really awkward. I was just doing it for fun.</p> <p><strong>With that in mind, were you surprised&#xa0;at the success of I&#xa0;Try and&#xa0;your first album?</strong></p> <p>By the time I did my first album I had done a lot of singing and performing, but I was surprised by the success of I&#xa0;Try specifically. I thought the chorus was too wordy <strong><i>(2)</i></strong> and I didn't think people would remember it. I didn't realise it would be that much of a big deal.</p> <p><strong>In 2001, way before Twitter hashtags and all that, you wore a dress to the MTV VMAs bearing the slogan \"My New Album Drops Sept 18 2001. Buy It\" <i>(3)</i>. How did that go down?</strong></p> <p>A lot of people got really upset about it. I read this article in the LA Times where the writer used it to talk about how artists would use these award shows to promote their albums! What do you think everyone's doing there? It's all about helping sell your records.</p> <p><strong>Do you still have it? </strong></p> <p>It's in the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.</p> <p><strong>You also pre-empted Christina Aguilera by forgetting the lyrics to the&#xa0;national anthem at an American football game and getting booed. They're quite tricky, aren't they? </strong></p> <p>I just forgot. I know the national anthem! I was in my home town and all&#xa0;my relatives were there and it just flew out of my head. I skipped the entire first section. It was my own version, basically.</p> <p><strong>You were on Bravo's Celebrity Poker Showdown. What's your technique? </strong></p> <p>I've been playing for a while and I love it, but I'm not very good. I wouldn't advertise my technique, because it doesn't work. Sometimes I'd do really well and other times I'd be really bad. I&#xa0;think I'm too easy to figure out. If I get a good hand I just go, \"Awesome!\"</p> <p><strong>You're joining pop luminaries Blue, Geri Halliwell and Alexandra Burke for a Children In Need special that involves you appearing in Thriller the musical. Are you excited about that?</strong></p> <p>Yeah I'm very excited. I'm just learning all the words and stuff. I'm doing a Michael Jackson song but I can't say much about it. I haven't heard much about a storyline or anything yet. I think it might be happening in December.</p> <p><strong>Are you a fan of Geri Halliwell?</strong></p> <p>Oh yeah, I've always liked her. The Spice Girls were everywhere. I always liked Geri and I liked Posh a lot.</p> <p><strong>Do you still own a bronze statue of yourself naked? </strong></p> <p>Yes. It's in my garage.</p> <p><strong>Why is it hidden away?</strong></p> <p>I don't have a proper fountain in my garden yet. I'm going to do it for sure.</p> <p><strong>It needs a fountain?</strong></p> <p>[Laughs] The water comes out of my hair.</p> <p><strong>But where does the hose go up, Macy?</strong></p> <p>Where does it go up? [Laughs] That's for me to know.</p> <p><strong>Do you still have your own clothing label?</strong></p> <p>It's interesting you brought that up because we're working on it now. We've been developing it for quite some time.</p> <p><strong>Will there still be a line called Humps for voluptuous women?</strong></p> <p>Yes, that's what we're doing. Modern fashion excludes a lot of different shaped women and shopping is really challenging if you're not a small girl. A lot of designers don't even make over a size 8. They don't want that size representing their clothing, which is really insulting and silly because most women are not a size 6. I'm excited about it. It's really for myself and my friends and just to have clothes available for you is great.</p> <p><strong>You're quite tall aren't you?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I'm 6ft.</p> <p><strong>Not that I'm a woman or that this is a competition, but I'm 6ft 7in.</strong></p> <p>Are you married?</p> <p><strong>I'm not, no.</strong></p> <p>Oh great.</p> <p><strong>Shall we get married?</strong></p> <p>Yeah. I need someone tall. I see really tall guys with short girls and I'm like \"what?\"</p> <p><strong>How was filming The Paperboy? Were you there when Nicole Kidman took a wee on Zac Efron <i>(4)</i>?</strong></p> <p>I was not. I missed that one. It was awesome working with that cast of people. Really legendary actors, and being around that calibre of people was inspiring. I learned a lot.</p> <p><strong>What do you enjoy about acting?</strong></p> <p>Erm, it's a challenge for me. I'm not close to mastering it, so I enjoy getting better at it. It's a good exercise for my brain and it's refreshing. I really like the studying for it and getting into character.</p> <p><strong>How did you decide which songs appeared on your recent covers album, er, Covered <i>(5)</i>? </strong></p> <p>Mostly it was lyrics for me. Songs that I&#xa0;felt I could translate and I could sing it and mean it. I'm a fan of all those songs and I particularly wanted to do songs that were more rock songs. I'm a huge rock'n'roll fan and I didn't want to just do old soul songs or anything that people would expect, or that would be easy.</p> <p><strong>Has Thom Yorke heard your interpretation of Creep?</strong></p> <p>I don't know. I saw him in an airport lounge once and I talked to him and I&#xa0;told him I did it, but he probably hears that everyday. He said: \"Wow, I'll&#xa0;check it out.\" That's all he said, so I'm not sure if he's heard it.</p> <p><strong>People can get quite precious about people covering their favourite songs can't they?</strong></p> <p>Oh yeah, I think some people do. I do too. I think some songs shouldn't be done over.</p> <p><strong>With that in mind, you've covered Stevie Wonder's Talking Book to celebrate its 40th anniversary, haven't you? </strong></p> <p>Yeah. I still worry about whether people actually want to hear my version of it, but it's actually really beautiful. The songs are definitely different from the originals and it's a new take on it. It's something I really love and I wanted to try. I don't think anyone's done a remake of a full album yet. We didn't do the arrangements exactly but the songs are in the same order. It's one of my favourite albums of all time.</p> <h2>Foot notes</h2> <p>(1) In 2003, Macy showed MTV around her six-bedroom LA home, with its own basketball court.</p> <p>(2) \"I try to say goodbye and I choke / Try to walk away and I stumble / Though I try to hide it, it's clear / My world crumbles when you are not here\"</p> <p>(3) Macy's second album The Id sold 1m copies, a sixth of her debut album's sales</p> <p>(4) In Lee Daniels' new film, Charlotte (Kidman) pees on Jack (Efron), after he's stung by a jellyfish.</p> <p>(5) It features covers of songs by the likes of My Chemical Romance and Arcade Fire.</p>",
  "<p>The trouble with the Arab Spring is that people who have never been to the Middle East think they know it. There is a kind of finality in rolling news footage: a moment caught within a certain political context encourages pundits and casual observers alike to make sweeping assumptions. Movies, however, have always provided, \u00e0 la Cervantes, truth through lies. The new crop of popular films from the Middle East are no different: characters that start out as troubled stereotypes evolve into complex and engaging figures.</p> <p>This is best exemplified in what many consider the most successful Arab film of all time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/14/worldcinema.drama\" title=\"\">The Yacoubian Building,</a> a Middle Eastern Rear Window made in 2006. From the eponymous apartment building's gay newspaper editor to a young woman sexually harassed at work, these characters from Alaa al-Aswany's novel had held sway with audiences in the region ever since the book's publication four years earlier. After over 30 years of Islamic preachers calling for more conservatism in film and an older generation of celebrated Egyptian actresses donning the veil, younger film directors have taken their cue from The Yacoubian Building and rebelled by going inside the home and examining contentious relationships.</p> <p>Viewing patterns have also radically changed the shape of motion pictures in the Middle East. Gone are the grand movie palaces from Cairo to Beirut. Instead, mass audiences follow soap operas and DVDs at home and films now vie for the same TV-watching demographic. Even The Yacoubian Building, denuded of its gay storyline, was reconfigured for Egyptian TV as a drama serial. However its true impact will always be as the film that opened the lid on prostitution, extremism and corruption in Egypt and finally dispelled the notion of the existence of a bland monochrome Muslim culture, deeply religious, submissive and pre-modern.</p> <p>Contemporary Arab movies also prove that no matter what the setting there is a globalised urban popular culture at work. An important football match can bring a teeming city of seven million, such as Cairo, to a standstill. The film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410252/\" title=\"\">One-Zero</a> breaks many taboos because a pop bimbo who can't hold a tune becomes a passionate defender of a her profession \u2013 one that many Muslims consider akin to prostitution. Then there is the choice facing a divorced, 40-year-old, pregnant Coptic Christian who, denied the right to remarry, can either sue the ultra-traditionalist church or convert to Islam. The ability of the downtrodden to claw their way back is what comes through from One-Zero's all-woman creative team. If Tahrir Square proved anything it is that Cairo remains the city of a thousand stories and untold possibilities.</p> <p>And one of them sadly happens to be the revisionism that has been taking place in the Egyptian capital since the revolution. Cairo has the largest and longest-established cinema industry in the Middle East. A noted director was recently prevented from filming in a mosque because it was deemed to be against sharia law. Conversely, Adel Imam, a known Mubarak supporter and actor \"with the plasticine face\" who has appeared in hundreds of films, had his conviction and three-month sentence for blasphemy in movies from over 10 years ago overturned in July. Although one proscription apparently remains in place no matter who's in power: kissing is routinely edited out of 1950s Egyptian movies so they can be broadcast on TV.</p> <p>The current debate about what constitutes \"Arab cinema\" sums up the quandary for local audiences. In the past, they had to endure Orientalist fantasies produced by Hollywood studios. Now a story about oil and sheikhs \u2013 Black Gold, starring Antonio Banderas \u2013 is funded by Emirati money. However, like cinema anywhere, the best films from the region offer daring and artistry. It was too violent in 1976, during the Lebanese civil war, to try making a movie there. Yet <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1726871/\" title=\"\">Stray Bullet</a>, from the production house of Beiruti artists Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige, imitates not only the war's murder and mayhem, the clothes of a bygone era and draconian family tensions, but also&#xa0;the haziness of memory \u2013 the film was shot in 16mm and blown up to grainy effect. This honouring of the past, an ability to face it head on, not censor it, will give will give Arab cinema its true direction.</p> <p>\u2022 Safar: A Journey Through Popular Arab Cinema runs 21\u201327 September 2012 at the ICA, London.

  "<p>Sarah Storey joined the ranks of Britain's greatest ever Paralympians on Thursday, winning her fourth cycling gold medal of the London Games in the women's road race in an utterly imperious ride that saw her finish more than seven minutes ahead of her closest rival.</p> <p>So dominant was the 34-year-old from Cheshire in the 64km race that by the second lap of the Brands Hatch course, having left the women's field far behind her, she caught and passed the peloton of the men's road race, which had started two minutes earlier.</p> <p>Her victory, the 11th gold of a career spanning six Paralympic Games, equals the modern-era records of wheelchair racer Tanni Grey-Thompson and swimmer Dave Roberts. But the cyclist's tally is all the more remarkable given that she began her Paralympics career, as a 14-year-old at the Barcelona Games, as a swimmer, winning two golds and three silvers in her debut appearance in 1992. London is her second Games competing as a cyclist \u2013 she won double gold in Beijing in her track and time trial debut.</p> <p>Speaking immediately after the race, Storey said she was \"just so chuffed\" to have matched in the road racing the two golds she won in the velodrome, after taking time trial gold with an almost equally comfortable win on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"The crowds around the course, and coming into the finish straight every single lap, I wanted to be able to say 'thank you', but obviously I had to keep my head down, make sure I made no mistakes.\"</p> <p>The race \"hurt a lot but it was amazing\", added Storey, who was able to savour her success by free-wheeling across the line.</p> <p>\"The Americans went off to send everyone up the road one at a time. I decided to test some legs. I had a bit of gas to spare, so I dug in \u2013 62km on my own.\"</p> <p>Asked about equalling the records of Roberts and Grey-Thompson, Storey said: \"To be even on the same page \u2026 as Tanni, but to have won 11 and made today a clean sweep for this week is just a dream come true. I can't thank enough people. I'm so proud to be part of such an amazing team and I'm just so pleased to be finished now as well.\"</p> <p>Storey, who competed as Sarah Bailey before her marriage to the cyclist Barney Storey, was born with an underdeveloped left hand. She only narrowly missed selection for the team pursuit squad at the Olympic Games, with whom she has previously won World Cup medals.</p> <p>Together with the gold and silver medals won in the Paralympic velodrome by her husband, who rides as a sighted tandem pilot with Neil Fachie, Storey's latest gold would take the couple on their own to 20th place in the medals table, ahead of South Africa, New Zealand and Mexico.</p> <p>Storey credits her 35-year-old husband, whom she met through the sport in 2004, for much of her cycling success, saying: \"Barney's at the centre of my world, his expertise in cycling is just phenomenal. Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grands prix in Europe.</p> <p>\"Barney's got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered, raw swimmer, he taught me everything.\"</p> <p>Speaking after Storey's time trial victory, which the cyclist said had been inspired by the performances of Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome in the Olympics road race, the Team GB coach Shane Sutton said her achievement was \"right up there\" with the performances of Chris Hoy and Usain Bolt in the earlier Games. \"What she has achieved is incredible. She is as good as any able-bodied cyclist around at the moment.\"</p> <p>He said he would not be surprised if Storey were to qualify for the able-bodied competition in Rio in four years' time, when the women's pursuit team expands from three to four riders.</p>",
  "<p>In the end it was not quite the way the British sailing team had imagined winning its first ever Paralympic medals. A dearth of wind on the Dorset coast meant the team spent the final hours of the six-day regatta holed up in the GB container (some watching the Tom Cruise film Top Gun) rather than charging for the finishing line in Portland Harbour.</p> <p>Not that Helena Lucas was too worried. She was leading the standings and so took gold in the single-person 2.4mR, a huge achievement in the trickiest boat and probably the most competitive of the three Paralympic classes. Lucas, the only woman in the 2.4 fleet, went into the final day with a nine-point cushion after a brilliant regatta.</p> <p>In the Skud-18 class there was a tinge of disappointment for Alexandra Rickham and Niki Birrell, whose hopes of upgrading to silver were thwarted by the becalming. But there was huge sadness and frustration for the Sonar trio of John Robertson, Stephen Thomas and Hannah Stodel, who missed out on bronze following an extraordinary off-the-water dispute between their bosun \u2013 who looks after the boat on land \u2013 and an official over the cleaning of their vessel.</p> <p>The bosun, the double Olympic medallist Simon Hiscocks, had continued to wipe the boat down after being ordered to stop by an official following a race earlier in the week. Though all parties accepted that the wiping down would not improve the performance of the vessel, the Sonar team <a href=\"http://www.sailing.org/uploads/12_Protest_21.pdf\" title=\"\">was penalised by four points</a> because of Hiscocks's refusal to comply with a \"reasonable request\" and cease.</p> <p>It led to the Sonar crew dropping from the bronze medal position to fifth and the lack of racing on Thursday robbed them of the chance of clawing their way back on to the podium. It may not be the end of the matter. Calling it a \"sad day for the sport\", the team said it would try to get the decision reversed. Stephen Parks, ParalympicsGB's sailing team leader, said: \"We will continue to investigate what options are available to rectify this situation.\"</p> <p>Lucas expressed sympathy for the Sonar crew and said it was a shame that her celebrations began in the boat park rather than on the water. \"It would have been brilliant to do one final race. To have celebrated on the water would have been fantastic but it was pretty flat calm out there.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless her win is the high point of a great career in both Olympic and Paralympic sailing. Born without thumbs, the 37-year-old became one of GB's most talented sailors and won a silver medal in the 2006 Olympic test event in Beijing in the Yngling class.</p> <p>By that time she was also competing in the 2.4mR Paralympic class and was disappointed to finish in seventh at the Beijing Paralympics. She was one of the last sailors to be picked for London 2012 and said there was a \"huge sense of relief\" that the years of hard work had paid off.</p> <p>The medals are a vindication of the British sailing team's all-encompassing approach. There was soul-searching after the Paralympic sailors returned from Beijing empty-handed. Since then the Paralympic sailors have lived and trained cheek by jowl with the Olympic squad. Working alongside competitors such as the four-times gold medallist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ainslie\" title=\"\">Ben Ainslie</a> has inspired the six Paralympic sailors \u2013 the same group that failed in Beijing \u2013 on to greater heights.</p> <p>\"All the Olympic guys have been pushing us all the way,\" Lucas said. \"It's been really close racing and great fun to be out there performing on home waters. It's amazing for Paralympic sailing.\" She said she had forgotten that the rest of the fleet were men. \"I am so used to going up against the guys, I forget.\"</p> <p>Both the Olympic and Paralympic events have been judged a great success by council leaders and many local people in Weymouth and Portland. There was concern earlier in the summer that the area might miss out on Olympic fever because, with the best will in the world, sailing does not make the best spectator sport.</p> <p>But during the Olympics tens of thousands of people flocked to this stretch of the Dorset coast (70,000 arrived to watch Ainslie win his gold) and thoroughly enjoyed it.</p> <p>The Paralympic regatta has been a little more low-key. There has been no official spectator park and both sailors and local organisers have been disappointed by the lack of television coverage. But a park overlooking the harbour at Sandsfoot Castle has been commandeered by fans as an unofficial viewing area and a sailing club, the Castle Cove, has opened its doors to family and friends of sailors. As many as 10,000 people have taken part in Paralympic sports on Weymouth Beach arranged by the borough council.</p> <p>The gold and bronze medals mean ParalympicsGB tops the sailing medal table along with Holland, pushing the Australians into third. The Paralympic team has long been overshadowed by its Olympic counterparts. But with Ainslie et al finishing only third in their table last month it could be argued that Lucas and her team-mates have at last out\u2011performed them.</p>",
  "<p>Mario Draghi has done his bit. As promised, the European Central Bank will wade into the financial markets in an attempt to hold together the single currency until the politicians get their act together and agree on steps towards closer political union.</p> <p>That's the good news. The bad news is that the Draghi blueprint will not be enough to save the euro. The impression left by Thursday's announcement on unlimited bond buying was that it was technically sound but based on flawed economics.</p> <p>The ECB will deploy its firepower to bring down interest rates on the borrowings of troubled members of the single currency provided the governments of the supplicant states agree to \"strict and effective\" conditions. Beneath his urbane exterior Draghi is one tough cookie and he has forced his plan through the ECB despite the opposition of the Bundesbank, something that would have been seen as impossible a few months ago.</p> <p>The Germans threw their toys out of the pram after Draghi's announcement, making clear they thought the blueprint could be costly for European \u2013 aka German \u2013 taxpayers. The Bundesbank's Jens Weidmann was a lone voice at the ECB council meeting and Draghi now has the authority to act. Make no mistake, the ECB has very deep pockets.</p> <p>Immediate action is out of the question. The ECB will only move when countries have signed up to their structural adjustment programmes, and that will take time. When the bond buying begins, the ECB will remove money from elsewhere in the system to ensure there is no increase in money supply. This process, known as sterilisation, is a small victory for the Bundesbank.</p> <p>Markets worried that Draghi would deliver less than he has been promising. That he lived up to expectations meant the financial markets rallied, but even before Draghi had finished speaking analysts were expressing doubts both about the mechanics of the plan and the logic behind the strategy.</p> <p>The ECB's president brushed aside questions at his press conference about what he would do if Spain, for example, signed up to \"strict and effective\" conditions to trigger bond buying but then decided the conditions were too difficult to implement. In those circumstances, would the ECB really start selling Spanish bonds at a heavy loss? Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research said this would be like the ECB putting a gun to its own head and pulling the trigger.</p> <p>A bigger problem is the economic thinking behind the plan. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris said on Thursday that Italy's economy will shrink by 2.4% this year. In Spain youth unemployment is more than 50%, the banks are tottering under the weight of bad debts from a bombed-out housing market, and private capital is leaving the country at an alarming rate. Greece's economy is 20% smaller than it was four years ago.</p> <p>Put simply, Greece is in depression, Spain on the brink and Italy heading that way.</p> <p>The \"rescue\" plan involves governments in Rome and Italy driving their economies deeper into depression to reduce the interest rates they pay on their borrowing. The ECB seems to think that the reason investors are giving Italy and Spain the cold shoulder is that they are not cutting hard enough, fast enough. Steeped in economic orthodoxy, Draghi makes George Osborne look like a paid-up member of the Maynard Keynes appreciation society.</p> <p>The reason investors demand high interest rates when they lend to Italy and Spain is their concern about the impact of permanent recession on public finances and banks. A rescue plan that has at its core more demand-destroying measures will do more harm than good.</p> <p>To sum up, Draghi has bought Europe a bit more time. The can has been kicked a few metres down the road. He has done so by incurring the wrath of the Bundesbank and will know that if this fails, there is little more the ECB can do.</p> <p>Fail it almost certainly will, because success means more than knocking half a percentage point off Italian and Spanish bond yields. It means solving the growth and competitiveness problems of the weaker eurozone countries and convincing their increasingly alienated people that Europe has more to offer than endless misery.</p>",
  "<p>A Newcastle businessman who opposes Britain's extradition agreement with the US has begun a private prosecution against two British terror suspects to prevent them being tried in America.</p> <p>Karl Watkin says he intends to prosecute Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan in Britain rather than \"outsource\" the UK's criminal justice system to Washington where US authorities are trying to extradite the pair.</p> <p>Ahmad, 38 and in Long Lartin prison, has been held without charge for longer than any other suspect in the \"war on terror\". His supporters have urged that he be charged in the UK. Earlier this year Labour's justice spokesman, Sadiq Khan, said he should face justice in a British, not an American, court.</p> <p>Watkin, who holds an MBE and works with low carbon technologies, has applied to Westminster magistrates court for the issuing of a summons for the prosecution of Ahmad and Ahsan, whom he accuses of supporting terrorist activity, contrary to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The application is being considered by a district judge.</p> <p>The businessman is also seeking consent from the director of public prosecutions to proceed with a prosecution against Ahmad and Ahsan for alleged breaches of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>Both men are alleged to have had connections to a website which encouraged terrorism and which, though operated from London, was hosted in the US. They deny involvement in terrorism.</p> <p>Both men are on remand in UK jails pending appeals to the grand chamber of the European court of human rights against their extradition to the US. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has so far declined to charge them.</p> <p>Watkin said: \"I don't know whether these men are totally innocent or as guilty as hell \u2013 that's for a court to determine with the benefit of all the evidence \u2013 but as Britons living and working here, having potentially committed serious crimes here, there is no question they should be tried here. The public interest demands it. We do not need to outsource our criminal justice system to America.</p> <p>\"Between them they have spent 14 years in British jails yet have not been charged with breaking any British law \u2026 Justice delayed is justice denied \u2026 So I want to see Ahmad and Ahsan in the dock. Then the British public can hear the case against them and their defence, if they have one.\"</p> <p>Last month the CPS said: \"In relation to Mr Ahmad, the prosecutor received a small number of documents from the Metropolitan police service in 2004 but, on the material provided, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.</p> <p>\"In respect of Mr Ahsan, there has been no investigation in the UK and no evidence has ever been submitted to the CPS team of prosecutors who look at alleged offences in this country.\"</p> <p>Jago Russell, chief executive of Fair Trials International, said: \"Reform of the UK's extradition laws is long overdue. British courts should be trusted with the power to say no where it is obvious that the country asking for extradition is the wrong place for trial.\"</p>",
  "<p>US forces will continue to hold prisoners in Afghanistan even after they transfer their main detention centre to Afghan authorities this week, a report from a rights group said, in a decision likely to anger Kabul officials who believed they had won control of all Afghan detainees.</p> <p>Afghanistan has also created a system of indefinite detention without trial for some inmates transferred from the US system. Afghan lawyers have warned that this is unconstitutional and sets a dangerous precedent for the country's security forces.</p> <p>\"Administrative detention\" is used by US forces when prisoners are deemed a threat but there is not enough evidence for a criminal prosecution. It was needed as grounds to hold some prisoners, Afghan officials said, but may not be limited to those held in the Bagram jail.</p> <p>\"There are some very serious problems about the scope of the [detention],\" said Rachel Reid, regional director at <a href=\"http://www.soros.org/\" title=\"\">Open Society Foundations</a>, which published the <a href=\"http://www.soros.org/reports/remaking-bagram-creation-afghan-internment-regime-and-divide-over-us-detention-power\" title=\"\">Remaking Bagram report</a>.</p> <p>\"There is no time limit on it, there is very little clarity about who they can detain, how long they hold them, what the conditions are and what due process rights they have when they are held,\" she told a news conference in Kabul to launch the report.</p> <p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai had for years demanded control of the prison in Bagram, outside Kabul, arguing that it was a serious violation of Afghan sovereignty to have US soldiers holding Afghans captive in their own country.</p> <p>The US agreed to the transfer in March, to help seal a \"strategic partnership\" deal that lays the foundation for a long-term relationship between the two allies, and a US military presence beyond 2014.</p> <p>But US forces are now apparently at odds with the Afghan government over what the agreement binds them to, the report said. They plan to keep at least two detention blocks in the Bagram jail, as well as continuing to take Afghan prisoners.</p> <p>\"They believe they have a continued authority to capture and detain Afghans on Afghan soil where they need to for security reasons,\" Reid said. Some 600 have been captured since the transfer was agreed, and the terms of their transfer are unclear, she added.</p> <p>The Nato-led coalition said the pact with the Afghan government set a date only for the transfer of existing prisoners, not for all prison facilities, and left US forces with the right \"to continue to capture, process and then transfer detainees\".</p> <p>Afghan officials however see this as a violation of their agreement. \"We cannot allow allies and friendly countries to have detention centres here. This is illegal,\" the report quotes national security advisor Rangin Dadfar Spanta saying.</p> <p>At the time of the signing ceremony more than 3,000 prisoners, most of them Afghans, were being held in the detention centre; they will all be handed over to Afghan authorities by the official transfer on Monday. Around half will face criminal trials, but at least 50 are already in \"administrative detention\" that the government argues is legal under international law.</p> <p>\"The constitution says freedom is the right of every human being, so if we see that a person is detained without any crime, its a violation of his rights,\" said Rohullah Qarizada, president of the Afghan Independent Bar Association, going on to detail at least five articles of the constitution violated by the detention without trial.</p> <p>There are also concerns about the fate of around 50 foreign prisoners held at Bagram. \"Most Afghans do not want the Americans to keep holding these third-country nationals in Afghanistan as if it is some kind of mini-Guant\u00e1namo,\" Reid said. \"They have said very clearly to us that they want the Americans to hand over these non-Afghans to them or take them out of the country.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the biggest scientific research projects in recent years <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/05/genes-genome-junk-dna-encode\" title=\"\">has just unveiled its results</a>. The Encode consortium, consisting of 442 researchers working in 32 institutes around the world, has spent the last five years studying a representative 1% of our genome. The findings may help to revolutionise medicine, but could also provide us with novel ways of tinkering with our minds and bodies.</p> <p>One of the puzzles the researchers hoped to solve was why we have so much DNA. We've known for decades that only a tiny fraction of it, about 2%, are codes for conventional genes (protein-coding segments), the supposed movers and shakers of our cells and bodies. Many scientists thought that the remaining 98% was mostly junk, a bit like all the deleted fragments of documents that clog up your hard disk. The researchers found that it was instead packed full of genetic switches that tell each cell in your body which genes must&#xa0;be switched on or off to make a muscle, skin or nerve cell.</p> <p>The results are likely to have major implications for our understanding of common diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer and even the debilities of old age, such as Alzheimer's disease. These were previously thought to bechiefly caused by defective genes (together with environmental influences, such as smoking), but decades of research have has failed to findenough defects that could account for their prevalence. Today, scientists believe that these diseases are caused not by defective genes, but defective switching: a liver cell may be genetically tripped to stop absorbing blood sugar, thereby causing diabetes; a lung cell may be tripped into generating mutagens that attack its own&#xa0;DNA, causing cancer.</p> <p>That's potentially good news for sufferers because, although it's hard to fix a faulty gene, it may be much easier to flip a genetic switch and return a diseased cell back to its healthy state. Scientists have already developed novel forms of drugs, based on DNA's molecular cousin, RNA, that act like our own genetic switches to manipulate the control panel of our cells. A few of these gene-switch drugs are already in the market, but the Encode project suggests that thousands more await discovery.</p> <p>A new era of gene-switch medicine may be on the horizon, but there are many problems that still have to be overcome. The first is getting the RNA-based gene-switch drugs safely inside the target cells and not into others where they might cause adverse side-effects. But even more of a challenge is to accurately predict the effect of flipping a genetic switch. The thousands identified by Encode are unlikely to work like simple light switches; instead, each switch is connected to many others in a vastly complicated gene circuitboard. Flipping one switch will be more like dropping a stone into a pool: the effects will reverberate through the entire network, and the eventual outcome will not be easy to predict. Systems biology, a new science, is simultaneously trying to unravel the circuit boards to make better predictions.</p> <p>Few doubt that gene switching will provide the medicine of the future, but no one is sure when that future will be realised. When it comes, it will provide opportunities that go well beyond curing disease. Just as the difference between healthy and sick people may be down to gene switching, it seems likely that many of the differences between one person and another \u2013 between us and Usain Bolt, for example \u2013 may be due, similarly, to different patterns of gene switching. The kind of gene-switch&#xa0;medicines that will cure diseases may then be turned to therapies that will allow us all to run sub-10 second 100 metres. Physiology, mood, intelligence, libido, anxiety, appetite may all be fair game for the gene-switch therapeutics of the future.</p> <p>Even the signs and frailties of old age may be kept at bay by a careful manipulation of our gene switches to return them to their youthful state. And what about the differences between us and our closest relatives, which many scientists believe are mostly due to differences in gene switching? Could gene-switch therapy be developed that would allow a chimp to talk? Planet of the Apes may not be so far away.</p> <p>Five years of the Encode project has revealed just 1% of the human gene switches, but the pace of genetics is accelerating so fast that it seems likely that we will know most of them within a decade. That will be far too late to be any threat to Usain Bolt's dominance on the track, but the doping authorities in sport may face significant new challenges in the future.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www3.surrey.ac.uk/qe/\" title=\"\"><em>Johnjoe McFadden</em></a><em> is professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey.

  "<p>For the past three years Ed Neufeldt has been wearing the same green rubber bracelets stamped \"Jobs for America\". He plans to take them off when unemployment in his home town of Elkhart, Indiana, falls below 8%. That day appears, finally, to be approaching \u2013 albeit achingly slowly. \"The whole United States is not doing that good,\" Neufeldt says. \"But here we're better off than we were three years ago.\"</p> <p>Few towns hold as much history for Barack Obama's presidency as Elkhart. This was the city where he fought to establish himself as the candidate of hope and change, first in a bruising encounter with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and then for the presidency. On his road to victory, Obama visited here four times in 15 months, and in February 2009 he chose Elkhart for his first trip outside Washington since his inauguration.</p> <p>Neufeldt, then an unemployed recreational vehicle worker, was thrust into the national spotlight when he was chosen to introduce the newly inaugurated president of the United States at a local rally. \"I am hoping and praying that president Obama will put the people of Elkhart County back to work. The stakes are high,\" Neufeldt said then.</p> <p>\"I promised you back then if I was elected, I would do everything I could to help this community recover, and that's why I'm back here today,\" said Obama as he pushed the American Recovery Act, an $800bn stimulus plan he hoped would get America back to work.</p> <p>Back then unemployment in the area was 18%. Obama charmed the locals, playing basketball with children in the streets and dipping into local diners to the shock and delight of proprietors and patrons alike. And he made big promises.</p> <p>Four years on, Elkhart has gone from a symbol of Obama's message of hope to a perfect example of the biggest hurdle the president faces in his bid for re-election: the gap between empirical measures that show economic recovery, and the pain people continue to feel. That is why Obama will have one clear goal when he delivers his acceptance speech to the Democratic national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday night: spelling out a compelling economic case for giving him four more years.</p> <p>\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" Ronald Reagan famously asked voters in the 1980 campaign. It is the question that looms over the 2012 presidential election, and one which has dogged the Obama campaign this week as they have struggled to come up with a convincing answer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395775428\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/6/1346958633632/US-labour-statistics-001.jpg\" alt=\"US labour statistics\" width=\"460\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US labour statistics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The data suggests the American people are. On Friday, economists expect the latest employment figures to show that the US added another 100,000-plus jobs last month. The US has added jobs every month since October 2010. There are other positive economic signs: car sales are bouncing back, and even the housing market seems on the mend.</p> <p>In Elkhart, too, the numbers say people are far better off than they were when Obama took office. Unemployment in the region is now around 8.9%, and the city, with a population shy of 51,000, is clearly on the mend. Local unemployment is still above the national average, just, but shipments in the RV industry, the area's biggest employer, are nearly back to pre-recession levels after hitting 20 year lows in 2009.</p> <h2>'We're never gonna go under 8% unemployment'</h2> <p>Life has got better, too, for Ed Neufeldt since he introduced the president during his visit. Now 72, Neufeldt is back in work, but things are not good enough for him to contemplate retirement. Once he lived in relative comfort, earning $20 an hour job at Monaco, an RV manufacturer that went bankrupt in 2009. Now he works part-time as a bread truck driver for $9 an hour, and has an evening job cleaning offices for another $11 an hour. It doesn't add up to his pre-recession income. \"I had to work three years for a dime raise,\" he says.</p> <p>\"When I met president Obama I really liked him, but I think because of automation and modern technology we're never gonna go under 8% employment,\" he says.</p> <p>America's midwest and the Great Plains are rebounding from the recession faster than other parts of the country \u2013 helped in large part by the recovery in the auto industry that followed Obama's bailout. The region is home to three swing states \u2013 Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2013 and in all three the economy is pulling, slowly, out of the doldrums.</p> <p>But it's far from assured that Obama can benefit politically from that recovery. In 2008, he became the first Democratic nominee to win Indiana in 44 years. And yet strategists in both parties say Indiana is the state he is least likely to hold on to in 2012.</p> <p>Summer Sellers, 33, is another Elkhart resident who was worse off in 2008. Several stints of unemployment eventually led her to the social media job she has now. And while Sellers admits that the enthusiasm Obama's visits generated in those early visits has faded, she still has hope that the people who voted for him in 2008 will return to the polls to cast a vote for him in November. </p> <p>\"I haven't really heard too much from other people about Obama staying in office versus getting somebody else,\" Sellers said. \" I still have the feeling that people in my generation around here who voted for Obama before will vote for him again.\" </p> <p>The RV museum, Elkhart's museum to the industry that provides two thirds of its jobs, is celebrating 100 years of RV evolution. Visitors walk a road that shows how the industry has developed from a 1913 Earl Travel Trailer, which looks like well-made a camp tent on wheels and is towed by a Model T Ford, past the rather modest RV Mae West used on set and spartan shining silver Airstreams on to today's hi-tech, Wi-Fi ready behemoths.</p> <p>The museum's president, Darryl Searer, gives Obama little credit for Elkhart's turnaround, however. \"I've witnessed four major recessions in my life: this one has lasted the longest,\" he says. \"Why? I think because Washington is not business-friendly.\"</p> <p>Searer sees himself as a political independent. When Obama was elected he was hopeful that something would change. But he says the administration has failed to tackle the housing crisis and is angry that it poured billions into saving the auto industry and other bust businesses that he believes should have been allowed to fail.</p> <p>\"When you reward failure, you just create more failure,\" he says. Elkhart's RV industry has bounced back but at the expense of other areas of the country that have lost market share, he says. It's survival of the fittest.</p> <p>Searer, who says the RV industry has always been sensitive to the economic cycle, also runs Ultra-Fab Products, a parts business he says grew at 30% a year between 2003 and 2008 before the recession hit hard. After a couple of losing years, business is back again, but he doesn't believe Obama's policies have helped. \"It's not because of government. It's because I figured out how to make money,\" he says. He says Obama is \"anti-business\". \"I think everybody here had hope but as time has gone on it just hasn't worked out,\" he says.</p> <h2>'Obama hasn't done a thing for agriculture. I'd give him an F'</h2> <p>It's not just those in the RV industry that are disappointed. At the massive Elkhart County 4-H Fair, attendances are back to levels last seen in 2006. About 250,000 people visited in July to see children show off their prize sheep and cows, enjoy the rides, eat deep-fried Twinkies and other delights and watch '80s rockers Styx and Glenn Campbell on his goodbye tour. </p> <p>But agriculture is in crisis, too. Drought has sent the price of corn rocketing, and Obama's ethanol mandate will mean 40% of this year's crop is turned into fuel, keeping prices high. \"I don't think Obama's done one thing for agriculture,\" says John Hochstetter, a local dairy farmer. He calculates the soaring cost of corn cost him $100,000 extra over July and August. He's not impressed with Mitt Romney, either. \"A country is not a business,\" he says. But as far as Obama is concerned: \"I'd give him an F.\"</p> <p>There are uglier views on Obama at the fair. \"He's not even American. If I had his background, they wouldn't let me even board a plane,\" says one clearly angry lawnmower salesman before refusing to give his name. But mostly Obama's critics are more disappointed than angry. \"A man can only do so much,\" says Phillip Ray, a retired RV industry worker. \"But it's the economy that is going to decide whether he gets re-elected or not whether that's fair or not.\"</p> <p>Douglas Agbetsiafa, a professor of economics at Indiana University, says the turnaround in the region has been \"remarkable.\" Elkhart and the surrounding region was hit harder and faster by the recession than almost any other part of the US, he said.</p> <p>It wasn't until the end of 2010 that recovery really started to take hold, but by then the turnaround was dramatic, Agbetsiafa said. In the last three month of 2010 unemployment dropped from 17% to 13% and has continued to fall sharply ever since. Agbetsiafa says the stimulus money and the car industry bailout \"probably did help, especially in the early stage.\" </p> <p>But it is very difficult to separate out what came from the stimulus and what from the area's historically business friendly policies. Who gets the credit may well ultimately be decided by political persuasion as much as economics, he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This report was produced in conjunction with the Elkhart Truth newspaper. <a href=\"http://www.etruth.com/article/20120906/NEWS01/709069975\">Read Tim Vandenack's report here</a></p>",
  "<p>Somehow, the noise never seems that bad from the actual airport. It certainly doesn't sound bad from Westminster. But in Hounslow, the London borough under the flight path for Heathrow's two runways, the planes loom unfeasibly large as they come in to land, with the background engine noise building up every ninety seconds or so to a conversation-defying eruption.</p> <p>In quieter places a consensus on Heathrow expansion has been steadily moulded by business and aviation executives: via discreet lobbying, a burgeoning file of reports, and conferences from London to Beijing. Backbench Tory MPs and union leaders alike have come out for the cause: warning Britain will lose its predominant place in global aviation, its access to growing markets. London will fall behind Paris, Frankfurt, even the Dutch, without more airport capacity. Foreign firms will relocate; jobs will go. In certain circles, the argument is a no-brainer: David Cameron's awkward pledge notwithstanding, once the Lib Dems are out of the coalition, he should crack on and do the obvious thing: build that third runway.</p> <p>For now it appears that the expansionists' economic arguments have won over the chancellor and very possibly the PM. But while a zealous belief in Cameron's manifesto commitment cost the last transport secretary her job, it may yet prove that Justine Greening, with her visceral grasp of life directly outside Heathrow, was far closer to where this debate ends up.</p> <p>Even if the economic benefits and the aviation's industry's need for more capacity are accepted \u2013 and both are disputed \u2013 the battle will be won or lost again over climate change and noise. Green arguments have fallen so far from the agenda as to prompt the Labour leader Ed Miliband this week to ask: \"But where is the debate about the environment in this?\" Environmental campaigners say they are ready to fight again if plans for the vanquished runway become something more than abstract.</p> <p>In Hounslow the noise is anything but abstract. The deputy leader of the council, Colin Ellar, points out: \"The impact on hundreds of thousands of people is undersold, under-reported, never stated.\" Pollution is one problem. \"But what we would really like is the mitigation of noise.\"</p> <p>Like all on the council, he does not doubt the benefits that the airport brings. \"The last thing we want is to see the airport disappear. It gives a level of prosperity to the area bigger than any other employer.\" He estimates 10,000-15,000 people and their families in each of the five boroughs surrounding Heathrow are directly financially dependent on the airport, either working or pensioners. Other employers are here because of the airport: Glaxo SmithKline, Samsung, with IBM and Cisco in nearby Bedfont Lakes.</p> <p>But, he says, \"What has evolved is a workable situation. We do not want a third runway \u2013 at any cost.\"</p> <p>In the well-insulated civic centre \u2013 as in BAA's head offices \u2013 aircraft noise is shielded out. But in homes and schools it is a very different matter.</p> <p>Students returned last week for the new year at Lampton school, an academy two miles from Heathrow and bang under the flight path to the northern runway. Aircraft noise crashes around the buildings so intensely it is easy initially to mistake where the plane is coming from, but then the pattern unfolds with grim regularity, as flights come in to land across the concrete yard and above the temporary classrooms where many are still taught.</p> <p>Much of the school is double glazed, but not air-conditioned \u2013 making summer months, say staff, a choice between stifling heat or the noise. On the worst affected top floor the science lab has the usual gas taps, plastic skeleton \u2013 and its own experiment in trying to teach children when normal speech becomes inaudible 30-40 times per lesson.</p> <p>In a study area in the sixth-form centre, a small breeze-block construction with open windows, signed in large capitals (bar a missing T) but with no apparent irony is the QUIE ZONE, which for 10 seconds in every 90 is anything but. Rochelle Kahlon, 17, studying for A-levels, shrugs. \"It's quieter here than it is at home.\" Only outsiders are surprised, says classmate Saabah Elahi. Both girls have close family who work at the airport.</p> <p>Ray Whyms, an assistant head teacher, says: \"It is normal for them. But then people get used to prison.\"</p> <p>Incredibly, this school has achieved outstanding pass rates at exams. \"But we don't really know how much better it would be, \" says Whyms. \"The long-term effects are immeasurable or difficult to quantify \u2013 who knows what damage it does.\"</p> <p>Polly Shoebridge, a psychology teacher, says: \"When I first came here I couldn't believe how noisy it was.\" Five years later she is used to it, but says when a plane comes over, \"you just have to stop. You lose five minutes a class.\"</p> <p>BAA has signed up to a scheme that offers free double glazing to mitigate noise. But the council believes it is nowhere near enough \u2013 and particularly for schools whose renovations were lost when Labour's schoolbuilding programme was scrapped by Michael Gove. The cost of properly soundproofing children's classrooms for the borough's 60 schools under the flight path is something Hounslow says it cannot, and should not have to, pay for.</p> <p>Ellar, who lives virtually under the descent to the northern runway, has had the BAA double glazers in. But he points out it depends on individuals to apply, only soundproofs the bedroom rather than all of the house, and does little for those who want to open a window on a summer night. New generations of planes such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are quieter, as well as less polluting, but not enough to ensure a night's sleep.</p> <p>One of Greening's last acts was to publish plans for tougher fines on noisy aircraft, and new ways to measure how noise really impacts people. \"She got it,\" said John Stewart, of local action group HACAN.</p> <p>But now Greening is reshuffled and her long-awaited \"call for evidence\" apparently scrapped. If the Tories' opposition pledge to halt Heathrow expansion wasn't dropped as quickly as the party's natural business and aviation supporters hoped, the wheels are now in motion. Osborne's support for a third runway is an open secret. But Labour found to its cost how politically toxic the third runway was, losing marginal seats and arguably London. Instead, the government is setting up a commission on airport expansion to draw out the electoral sting, led by Howard Davies, an ex-CBI boss and former adviser to climate change \"sceptic\" Nigel Lawson.</p> <p>The phoney war is on: Davies's commission won't reach its conclusions until after 2015, leaving the Tories officially opposed yet privately set to deliver. Yet those within the party \u2013 Zac Goldsmith, who thought Cameron's pledge more than greenwash \u2013 and now Boris Johnson are not playing along, and the PM may yet be forced to make his position clear.</p> <p>Eventually the decision will need to be taken. BAA meanwhile has started drawing up its own review, to demonstrate that the \"do-nothing\" option is also a political choice with economic consequences.</p> <p>Heathrow is full, at the limit of flights it is permitted or can cope with operationally. The pressure on its runways makes it vulnerable to huge disruption from small incidents. While other airports could take more flights, BAA says a sufficiently large hub airport is unique and essential for the airline business: a hub provides enough connecting passengers to make all sorts of flights to and from new destinations viable. That would allow more trade with emerging markets that would provide more jobs and badly needed economic growth. And Britain can only have one hub, they say, and that hub is Heathrow.</p> <p>That orthodoxy is still disputed by some even within aviation, including some regional airports. But most buy the hub logic \u2014 including Johnson, although his derided Thames Estuary plan still looks impossible on many levels. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary claims Stansted is the only feasible place for expansion soon. Gatwick's ban on a new runway expires in 2019 and the blueprints for a second are being refreshed. An unnamed consortium is said to be examining possibilities for a brand new four-runway airport in Oxfordshire, where the prime minister's constituency and his Chipping Norton friends could experience the Heathrow effect for themselves.</p> <p>BAA believes the ground has been covered enough times before to make the course of action obvious. It welcomes the impending Davies commission which, if legitimised in advance by a cross-party consensus, will mean it won't need to face down MPs fearing for their seats. Only, perhaps, environmentalists and the 750,000 people living under the flight path.</p>",
  "<p>Mario Draghi, the ECB president, has announced that the ECB will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/debt-crisis-mario-draghi\" title=\"\">buy unlimited quantities of government debt from troubled countries</a>. The aim in the short term is to resolve the eurozone's debt crisis and the high interest rates faced by debt-ridden giants, Spain and Italy. But will it restore confidence, promote stability and lead to the fiscal and structural reform on which the eurozone's ultimate survival depends? Or will it simply mean that the insolvent countries have a far more lenient creditor in the ECB than the straight-talking Angela Merkel?</p> <p>Draghi emphasised that there will be strict conditions. He rattled off a list of abbreviations such as OMTs (outright monetary transactions, the new phase of bond-buying) and <a href=\"http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm\" title=\"\">EFSF</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Stability_Mechanism\" title=\"\">ESM</a>, which refer to the European bailout funds, the precautionary programmes of which debtor countries would have to meet to receive an OMT. He would also seek IMF \"involvement\" in designing the policy. But under questioning he admitted that such involvement \u2013 and the rules that go with it \u2013 was not automatic. In fact, the ECB would retain its independence and he stressed that the individual countries would have leeway to shape the frameworks proposed for individual states. Nor, when asked about taking on Spanish bank debt in the future, did he rule that out. Draghi must make it clear that the ECB intends to insist on the conditions to reduce countries' debts and deficits introduce structural change. Without such a course, the eurozone will not survive.</p> <p>Such conditions matter. In <a href=\"http://www.politeia.co.uk/publications/tax-and-economy/going-growth-best-course-sustained-economic-recovery\" title=\"\">Going for Growth</a>, a study published by today by Politeia \u2013 of which I am director \u2013 three German economists from the German finance ministry explain that they lead to growth.</p> <p>They consider six economies that emerged in recent decades from similar problems of high public spending and stifled growth. These include Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil. Each followed a three-pronged strategy of fiscal reform, structural change and institutional reform. In Sweden and New Zealand public spending and tax cuts were matched by the privatisation of public enterprises and deregulation of markets. Property rights and public institutions were also strengthened. The same course was also followed in Ireland before, like the UK, it reverted to huge increases in public spending in the last decade.</p> <p>They suggest that there are lessons for the eurozone's crisis countries, which share common problems of high public expenditure and stifled growth. Sound public finances must be reformed \u2013 and this includes curbing spending on the welfare state and public sector employment costs. The functioning of the labour, product, and financial markets must be improved. The institutions which govern the economy must be strengthened, such as the rule of law and the judiciary.</p> <p>These reforms, they say, \"build confidence and stability\" and are the surest way to restore growth. Indeed, short-termism or propping up over-indebted economies with cheap monies exacerbates the problems.</p> <p>Draghi seems to be buying time and engaged in an elaborate exercise of appearing to meet the conflicting demands of creditor and debtor nations. The immediate aims may be met and interest rates for Italy and Spain may fall. But support comes with a price. For Germany, the eurozone's financier, that price has been set out. Countries that want help must downsize levels of debt and public spending. But if the ECB changes the price, there will be a different scenario. Countries, as the Bundesbank head said last week, may get \"hooked\" on ECB aid, delaying the reduction of debt and public spending in crisis countries.</p> <p>Though for Draghi, the euro is a fact and \"irreversible\", he may find that without Germany it will not survive. If so, his famous promise to \"do what it takes to save the euro\" will be empty.</p>",
  "<p>Neurosis makes for good comedy. It certainly isn't doing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/13/control-freak-love-jon-richardson\" title=\"\">Jon Richardson</a>'s career any harm. The <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/8-out-of-10-cats\" title=\"\">8 Out of 10&#xa0;Cats</a> team captain is now taking his fretfulness and borderline <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/11/healthandwellbeing.mentalhealth\" title=\"\">OCD</a> on a national tour, in a show that induces amusement and nervous exhaustion in equal measure. At its best, Richardson's unforgiving self-portrait of a man resentful of others and uneasy in his own skin hits comic heights of peevish discomfort. Elsewhere, rather than laugh, his pessimism and skittish take on the world make me want to lie down in a darkened room.</p> <p>Two hours of Richardson worrying about the pronunciation of \"an onion\" or commentating on a fellow train passenger's packed-lunch technique gives us more insight into his mental state than is probably good for us. It's not just obsessive behaviour we're talking about: it's loneliness, misanthropy and existential angst. \"There's nothing in my life I feel consistently about,\" he complains. He has, however, placed an embargo on addressing the big \"isms\", the things that could save, or destroy, the world \u2013 because his inability to change anything depresses him.</p> <p>That means we stick to routines about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/masterchef\" title=\"\">MasterChef</a> and turning 30. Sometimes, Richardson's comic craft elevates a routine above the status of merely amusing neurosis, as when he suggests to his flatmates that they wash baking trays and glassware separately. (\"This wine tastes a bit \u2026 pork and leeky.\") Occasionally, we get a welcome break from the shtick, as with a not-so-happy-ever-after bout of class warfare between Cinderella and Prince Charming. But for the most part \u2013 and notwithstanding Richardson's perky demeanour \u2013 this is a prolonged exposure to a self-conscious, high-anxiety worldview, which is often funny, but also increasingly claustrophobic.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, has warned he will strip local councils of their planning powers and hand them to a centralised planning inspectorate if they show a record of poor-quality or slow decision making.</p> <p>The threat is designed to force councils living in \"an economic la la land\" to allow more housebuilding in their areas.</p> <p>The inspectorate would be able to override all agreements between councils and developers to reduce affordable homes, making a development more profitable, and hence more likely to be built.</p> <p>Labour described the Treasury-inspired measure, buried in a package of housing announcements to boost growth, as \"a bombshell that threatens local decision making on planning decisions\". Hilary Benn, the shadow communities secretary, said the proposal \u2013 to be included in a fresh planning bill \u2013 was \"a fundamental change that will be met with alarm from across the political spectrum,\" heralding another pitched battle between conservationists and advocates of <em>laissez faire</em> growth.</p> <p>Some builders' groups warned the promise to legislate to make housing developments more profitable from 2013 might actually delay the much-needed surge in housebuilding. Roger Humber, strategic policy adviser to the House Builders Association, said: \"This will not lead to a surge in immediate housebuilding, and will take time to work through.\"</p> <p>The key proposals were disclosed in a Commons written statement, which said: \"We propose to legislate to allow applications to be decided by the Planning Inspectorate if the local authority has a track record of consistently poor performance in the speed or quality of its decisions.\"</p> <p>Legislation, effective from 2013, will also allow any developer that deems a site no longer commercially viable, because of the number of affordable homes required, to appeal to the planning inspectorate with immediate effect. At present a developer cannot appeal against these agreements, under section 106 of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act, until they are five years old. The government was reducing the cut-off point to two years but the latest reforms will make all section 106 agreements open to appeal.</p> <p>Nick Clegg argued that the measures would not have a negative impact because the government would invest an extra \u00a3300m drawn from other departments to help build a further 15,000 affordable homes. Pickles also announced he would rationalise all local and national housebuilding standards by the spring.</p> <p>He would also lower the threshold to allow more commercial and business developments to be deemed major infrastructure projects, and therefore cleared at national level. The system for parliament to authorise big projects is also to be reformed.</p> <p>Facing Labour claims that he was reintroducing just the kind of centralising measures he had attacked under the Labour government, Pickles said: \"This is working hand in hand with local people. There might be an element of muscular localism about this but good local authorities we will work together with. It is only those local authorities who frankly have been dragging their feet and being wholly unrealistic, operating in a kind of economic la la land, we will be dealing with.\"</p> <p>The government claimed the measures were necessary because housebuilding had fallen to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s. It also estimates that nearly 75,000 new homes are stalled because of site \"viability\", with developers unwilling to go ahead because councils in brighter economic times imposed conditions on transport links, shopping or affordable housing that are too onerous.</p> <p>The Treasury desperation to boost house construction, and so help growth, will only have been increased by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/06/oecd-more-rate-cuts-stimulus-recession\" title=\"\">OECD forecasts</a> on Thursday predicting UK growth will contract by 0.7% this year \u2013 a sharp downgrade from its most recent forecast of 0.5% growth.</p> <p>The Local Government Association (LGA) countered that the problem was not the planning system, pointing out that there were already 400,000 planning plots with permission to build. \"At the current rate of construction it would take developers three and a quarter years to clear the backlog by building all of the new homes local authorities have signed off,\" the LGA said.</p> <p>The association said government figures showed that councils were more positive towards development than ever, with the percentage of planning applications being given the green light hitting a 10-year high last year.</p> <p>Other government measures announced include an extra \u00a3280m with a matching contribution from house builders to extend the successful FirstBuy scheme to March 2014, helping an additional 16,500 first-time buyers.</p> <p>Ministers also doubled the size of extensions private homeowners can build to eight metres (26ft) without planning permission for three years. Pickles said extensions could not extend more than halfway down a garden and loft extensions would be limited.</p> <p>Finally, the Treasury published legislation to introduce a debt guarantee scheme worth \u00a310bn to enable housing associations and property management companies to raise debt with a government guarantee where they invest in additional new-build homes.</p>",
  "<h2>Ranvir Singh, chief executive of market analyst RANsquawk</h2> <p>Even by the inscrutable standards of Mario Draghi, the ECB president's speech revealed little of the huge tectonic pressure that has built up under the eurozone's surface.</p> <p>To fly in the face of Germany's wishes will not have been easy. For the Bundesbank, keeping inflation in check is an article of faith. Its president has made no secret of the fact that he regards the ECB plan to buy the debt of the eurozone's weaker members as the road to perdition.</p> <p>But Mr Draghi had left himself little option. Having earlier promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the Euro, the markets had expected nothing less than a definitive rescue plan.</p> <p>The Spanish, French and Italians will be hugely reassured by the prospect of the ECB's firepower being used to keep their borrowing costs in check.</p> <p>But with the Germans deeply concerned about the impact of the ECB writing such vast cheques, the eurozone fault lines could fast become a fracture.</p> <h2>Marie Diron, senior economic adviser, Ernst &amp; Young</h2> <p>One surprising element of this programme is that the ECB will be treated on par with other investors. This departs from what happened in the Greek debt restructuring. It was most likely quite a controversial point within the ECB council and testifies that the majority of ECB council members strongly believe that further debt restructuring can be avoided. Quite a show of confidence in eurozone governments.</p> <h2>Lee McDarby, Investec Corporate Treasury</h2> <p>Despite high expectations of volatility, the market's reaction to this afternoon's aptly named European MOT has been largely muted. GBP/EUR and EUR/USD jockeyed for position either side of 1.26 as Draghi spoke but with no great surprises after this week's leaks the big currency moves have been largely kept in check. As expected full sterilisation, unlimited issuance, equal treatment of creditors and maturities of one to three years have all been confirmed alongside that fact that no specific yield will be targeted.</p> <h2>Currency analyst, DailyFX</h2> <p>The ECB will buy unlimited quantities of securities whose maturities are three years or less, but sterilise (or offset) the bond purchases with sales elsewhere. Will this be effective?</p> <p>We think not. An unlimited sterilised bond-buying programme is nothing more than a version of the Federal Reserve's Operation Twist, and as Goldman Sachs called it yesterday, \"SMP 2.0\". \"SMP 1.0\" was the securities market programme that was in effect in late 2011 and early 2012, which soaked up peripheral debt in the secondary markets. However, just like the longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs 1 and 2), the first iteration of the SMP proved to be ineffective: if they were effective, we wouldn't be discussing the fourth major programme to be announced over the past year.</p> <h2>Sharon Bowles MEP, chair of the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee</h2> <p>As expected, the ECB will buy short-term bonds provided that there is accompanying pressure on politicians to maintain structural changes. I believe it is essential that such conditions are applied, not just for discipline but also because the actions taken by the ECB are not without cost.</p> <p>Opposition to the ECB action is usually made on the ground of monetary financing or inflation. In fact, one of the costs is not so much inflation of consumer prices but long-term lowering of returns to most pensioners and savers, as well as increasing the cost of pension contributions for the working age population.</p> <p>This can, in turn, also negatively affect business competitiveness. These sectors of society are of course already affected as a result of the cycle of stimulus, lowering of interest rates, and quantitative-easing-type measures that have been taken in the US and Europe.</p> <p>I am sure markets will celebrate at some temporary relief, but it is essential to keep up all the measures for stability and reform that are at various stages of implementation and planning, including the banking union proposals.</p>",

Because Gemma Williams, the 27-year-old singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (harp, kora, omnichord, keyboard, harmonium, electric organ, accordion, penny whistle, clarinet, bells, glockenspiel, electric shruti box, recorder and drums, since you asked) bobs her head a lot, and when she was living in an 800-year-old cottage under Totnes Castle one winter she wore loads of woolly jumpers. No prizes for guessing that, as female performers go, she is more <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/bjork\" title=\"\">Bjork</a> than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>Talking of Bs, she collects them \u2013 bees. \"I spent 30 minutes in the backseat of a car on a beautiful starlit night,\" she said of a recent apian adventure, \"hugging my new beehive to my chest. I'd spent the day with powertools making it. I had my ear to the pine and I listened to them humming and telling me their stories as we travelled. It was heavenly.\"</p> <p>She's also into birds, and has written and recorded an album in their honour. The Bird School of Being Human features seven songs, all titled after birds. \"Each song came via a bird that had a story to tell,\" she says. \"A bit like a reverse Disney animation \u2013 rather than anthropomorphising animal characters, these songs are kind of how it might be like if people were aviomorphised, or if the birds were in human bodies. Bird's eye views \u2026 the bird's songs, really.\"</p> <p>Not that Williams/Wooliams is some airy-fairy dreamer. Eccentric, perhaps. But she's lived a life that's full. She grew up in Crawley, \"an incredibly serious\" child prone to \"manic hysteria and hyperactivity\". She was struck down with a \"mystery illness\" and spent most of her young life either flitting in and out of consciousness, having fits or suffering migraines. She discovered a love of singing but couldn't really play music at home because her mum had a rare condition causing an intolerance to repetitive or high-pitched sounds. All of which may explain why, when she was 20, she became a practicing shaman and had something called \"an overnight earth burial\". Or not. She also trained as a maternity nurse and midwife.</p> <p>Wooliams/Williams brings her experiences to bear on The Bird School. It's no cute-fest. Yes, she has a high, hiccupy voice that is as creepy ickle gurl as it's possible to get without it sounding like something from an 18-certificate Disney movie about a homicidal Snow White. And that voice is more often than not draped in the sort of harp glissandos and pretty fantasia that make <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jan/20/mummers-mink-hollow-road\" title=\"\">Mummers</a> resemble Metallica. But there are all manner of electronic textures and droney effects to balance out the sweetness, and the lyrics \u2013 however saccharine they may seem \u2013 address \"passivity and violence, female hysteria and male aggression\".</p> <p>On the opening track, Crow, she sings about building \"a great funeral pyre\" as the music becomes increasingly clanging and industrial. Dove cries out to be described as \"bewitching\", but by Gull she is bemoaning her \"wretched life\". Hummingbird is as solemn as a hymn, with a cacophonous climax. Magpie features acoustic guitar over weird electro noise that could well be a swarm of her beloved bees. Wooliams coos: \"Oh my bonny, bonny boy\". Did we say creepy?</p> <p>Sparrow is the single, and starts with a looped drone of a beat and fuzzy guitar. But Red Kite is the one where the pretty and the piercing are most powerfully juxtaposed. She sounds like a fair maiden from a bygone century, yet she's singing about seeing a photo of her ex-boyfriend on Facebook. And she's not very happy about it (\"You were wearing the very same thing I've been wearing since our last night when you smashed my face in\"). She goes on to say she still dreams about him almost every night, sometimes with \"his fingers around her throat\". At which point you think: should we leave? But there's more. \"What really got me the most was that, darling, I thought you were good.\" Cue free jazz/noise-out ending and a haunting feeling you may find hard to shake.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Strange, elusive, and haunting\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://theirbatedbreath.wordpress.com\" title=\"\">theirbatedbreath</a>.</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Creepy, but in a good way.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Give new meaning to \"the birds and the bees\".</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Provide a particularly suitable soundtrack to sex.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Bird School of Being Human and Sparrow are both released by Robot Elephant next week.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Joanna Newsom, Bjork, Mummers, Hall of Mirrors.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://woodpeckerwooliams.bandcamp.com\" title=\"\">woodpeckerwooliams.bandcamp.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Friday's new band:</strong> Oddience.</p>",

  "<p>A crown court judge who said burglars needed \"a huge amount of courage\" and sending them to prison did little good has triggered an investigation by the Office for Judicial Complaints (OJC).</p> <p>The outspoken comments were made by Judge Peter Bowers at Teesside crown court earlier this week when he spared a 26-year-old, serial burglar from an immediate custodial sentence. The OJC said it was considering complaints it has received.</p> <p>The remarks also prompted David Cameron to condemn those who broke into people's homes. Appearing on ITV's <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/daybreak/\" title=\"\">Daybreak</a> programme, the prime minister said he did not know the details of the case, but continued: \"I am very clear that burglary is not bravery. Burglary is cowardice. Burglary is a hateful crime. People sometimes say it is not a violent crime, but actually if you have been burgled you do feel it was violence.</p> <p>\"I have been burgled twice. You feel completely violated when someone has smashed their way into your house and stolen your possessions \u2026 I am very clear that people who repeatedly burgle should be sent to prison,\" he added.</p> <p>\"That is why this government is actually changing the law to toughen the rules on self-defence against burglars, saying householders have the right to defend themselves.\"</p> <p>The row over the judge's sentencing erupted the day after the government removed Ken Clarke, an advocate for rehabilitation rather than incarceration, from his position as justice secretary.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Bowers gave Richard Rochford, of Redcar, a two-year supervision order with drug rehabilitation and 200 hours unpaid work, as well as a one-year driving ban.</p> <p>Delivering the sentence, he explained that Rochford had acquired a drug habit when previously imprisoned for another offence. \"You've been given an extraordinary chance,\" Bowers said. \"I might get pilloried for it ... It takes a huge amount of courage as far as I can see for somebody to burgle somebody's house. I wouldn't have the nerve. Yet somehow, bolstered by drugs and desperation, you were prepared to do that ...</p> <p>\"I think prison very rarely does anybody any good,\" he said. \"It mostly leaves people the chance to change their own mind if they want to. I don't think anybody would benefit from sending you to prison today. We'd all just feel a bit easier that a burglar had been taken off the streets.\"</p> <p>Rochford should serve a two-and-a-half-year term to satisfy the public, the judge added. But Rochford, the court heard, had rid himself of his drug habit since committing the burglaries in February.</p> <p>\"What you've done since I find rather extraordinary and something which doesn't often happen,\" Bowers said. \"I'm going to take a chance on you, an extraordinary chance, one which I don't often take.</p> <p>\"If I see you across the court again, you start with 30 months for that. I won't take any excuses. But if you turn up, do the right thing, then I'll have done the right thing. You let me down and you let yourself down.\"</p> <p>Judge Bowers was still hearing cases at Teesside crown court on Thursday. David Hines, chairman of the National Victims' Association, said the judge's comments were outrageous. \"What message does this send out to society? The criminal justice system has let the victims down. Burglars are going to believe that judges think they are courageous. I think this judge is on a different wavelength to everyone else.\"</p>",
  "<p>Libya has said it will delay the trial of Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, to gather evidence against him from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/abdullah-al-senussi-lockerbie-libya\" title=\"\">the former spy chief who was extradited to Tripoli</a> earlier this week.</p> <p>Abdullah al-Senussi, Libya's former chief of intelligence, is expected to know the secrets of many former regime figures, including Saif.</p> <p>\"We expect the trial of Saif al-Islam to be delayed a little because Abdullah Senussi will be able to provide new information that can be used in Saif's trial,\" said prosecution spokesman Taha Ba'ara.</p> <p>The interrogation of Senussi has already begun in the Libyan capital amid tight security, with the prime minister, Abdurrahim El Keib, promising to give him a \"fair trial\".</p> <p>But his arrival seems likely to deepen a rift between Libya and the international criminal court (ICC). The two have already clashed over the fate of Saif al-Islam.</p> <p>Both Saif and Senussi were charged by the ICC last year with crimes against humanity, but Libya insists both men will be tried not at The Hague but in Tripoli \u2013 and will face execution if found guilty.</p> <p>The ICC said on Thursday that Libya should hand Senussi over to The Hague, prior to any request by the Libyans to stage their own trial. \"If the Libyan authorities think they can proceed then they have the judicial channel to challenge this,\" said ICC spokeswoman Sonia Robla. \"This is the principle on which the court was built.\"</p> <p>Libya has embarked on a different strategy: in May it hired human-rights lawyer Philippe Sands to make a formal application to the ICC for permission to hold a trial in Libya. Judges at The Hague are not likely to announce a decision before November, but Libya says it will hold Saif's trial this month without waiting for permission.</p> <p>Richard Dicker, head of international justice at Human Rights Watch in New York, said Libya's actions over the two suspects would be the litmus test of its commitment to democracy and the rule of law. \"It's important for Libya's credibility,\" he said. \"If there was a trial and an execution before the (admissibility) challenge, that would fly in the face of Libya's obligations.\"</p> <p>Few tears will be shed in Libya if the country presses ahead with trials and interrogations of Saif and Senussi, who are seen as key players in 40 years of brutal dictatorship. But the ICC is likely to complain to the UN security council, which ordered it into action against the Gaddafi regime last year.</p> <p>\"The crisis will come when and if the ICC judges decide that they should retain jurisdiction and the Libyans refuse to hand them [Saif and Senussi] over,\" said Sir Geoffrey Nice, a war crimes lawyer who prosecuted Serbia's former president, Slobodan Milosevic, \"Having no police force of its own, the ICC will throw up its hands in horror and go to the security council.\"</p>",

There was the time at Roskilde in 1984 when they appeared late and drunk with out-of-tune equipment and played so badly that the police were called to protect them from the crowd. Then there was the show in Boston when they performed for just 20 minutes in between DJ sets. \"The police turned up in the dressing room,\" Sumner remembers, \"and said: 'Do you know there's a fucking riot going down there, man?' There were people throwing stones at us when we came out. I got a phone call the next morning from Mo Ostin, the president of [New Order's US label] Warner Bros: 'What the fuck's going on Bernard?'\"</p> <p>He smiles. \"It's a very Mancunian trait \u2013 don't take yourself too seriously. It was more important for us to have a laugh than have some great career strategy. If we enjoyed what we were doing, <em>that</em> was a great career strategy.\"</p> <p>Few bands have been as mythologised as New Order and their previous incarnation Joy Division \u2013 the members have been played on screen twice, in Anton Corbijn's sombre-hued <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118797/control\" title=\"\">Control</a> and Michael Winterbottom's antic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91616/24.hour.party.people\" title=\"\">24&#xa0;Hour Party People</a> \u2013 while showing so little interest in mythologising themselves. Let others talk about how New Order rebounded from the suicide of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis to become one of the greatest bands of the 80s, or how records such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftJZomwDhxQ\" title=\"\">Blue Monday</a> revolutionised the way rock groups assimilated electronic music. Sumner would rather talk about the time in the studio when, emboldened by MDMA, he performed his own northern version of Donna Summer's orgasmic vocal on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ArZEFwRsY\" title=\"\">Love to Love You Baby</a>. \"It was like: 'Come on love, come on love, oargh, oargh.' But everyone decided it sounded more like I was straining on the toilet.\"</p> <p>The singer's uncommonly cheerful mood is down to the fact that New Order are, once again and most improbably, back from the dead. Barely a year ago, drummer Stephen Morris was telling the Guardian: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/14/new-order-split-peter-hook\" title=\"\">\"There's no future for New Order.\"</a> Yet here they are, amid an ad hoc world tour, a few hours before playing the closing concert of the Olympics in Hyde Park, alongside Blur and the Specials on a bill of bruised but unbowed national treasures. Sumner, a man who once walked around backstage with a sign around his neck that read \"Fuck off, don't ask me any questions\", radiates high spirits and wry amusement. The only smudge on his good mood is the incessant growl of a taxi idling outside the hotel. \"It's a noisy world we live in, isn't it?\" He shouts at the taxi driver and the city in general: \"Shut the fuck up, the lot of you!\"</p> <p>New Order's latest resurrection has been marvellously unexpected, albeit coloured by a significant absence. When bassist Peter Hook quit in 2007, he declared the band over and Sumner formed a new group, Bad Lieutenant. But exactly a year ago came news that New Order would be reuniting, minus Hook but plus long-absent keyboardist Gillian Gilbert, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/06/new-order-reunite-without-peter-hook\" title=\"\">two benefit shows for music video producer Michael Shamberg</a>, who was seriously ill with encephalitis. Those concerts went so well that they led to many more, including this weekend's Bestival. So did they really believe last summer that it was all over?</p> <p>\"Who knows what's around the corner?\" Sumner says, deflecting the question with a bit of <em>qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1</em>. \"I've had moments when I've thought, Fuck them, I've had enough. But once the anger dies down, the clarity pulls through. There comes this point where you've got this weight of history pushing you along, like a flywheel keeps an engine rolling round. You're not willing to give up the past 30 years of hard graft, blood, sweat and tears because someone else has had a tizzy fit, y'know?\"</p> <p>When Sumner is relating a favourite anecdote from the 80s he refers to the absent bassist as \"Hooky\", but in the current context it is always \"someone else\" or \"the other one\". New Order have had rifts before, which is why they have only made three albums in the past 20 years, but all the current members agree this split feels permanent, caused by something more than the usual friction between the emotional bass-player and the drier, more reserved (some say passive-aggressive) singer. When I&#xa0;talk to Phil Cunningham, guitarist in New Order and Bad Lieutenant for more than a decade, he&#xa0;says wearily, \"It's not about Hooky and Bernard. It's Hooky and the rest of&#xa0;the world.\"</p> <p>I suspect that for the famously private Sumner, the last straw has been Hook's public axe-grinding since his departure. His claim that replacement bassist Tom Chapman mimes to backing tracks and his sideswipes at Sumner in his new memoir <a href=\"http://www.peterhook.co.uk/#/news/unknown-pleasures-inside-joy-division-signing-event-tour-dates-announced-oct-2012\" title=\"\">Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division</a> are just the most recent examples. \"He's not been very nice,\" says Sumner with acidic understatement. \"To boil it down to its basic elements, if someone's horrible a lot of the time, you're not sad when they're gone, you're glad. He wasn't happy in the band \u2013 primarily with me but also, it seems, with almost everyone. If you're unhappy, OK, fine, but go away and do something else and don't bitch about us anymore.\"</p> <p>Of course, no outsider can ever know enough to take sides when old friends fall out. A clearly upset and self-questioning Hook told Mojo earlier this year: \"I'm so fucking confused with it all, and so obsessed with it all, I don't know even now what's going on.\" But without doubt his big mistake was believing the band couldn't continue without him, when New Order's very existence is testament to their extraordinary resilience. After Curtis killed himself in 1980, the surviving members of Joy Division swiftly reinvented themselves, with Gilbert (then, as now, Morris's partner) joining on keyboards and Sumner assuming frontman duties. \"I like a challenge. I like learning new skills, because I didn't learn much at school,\" he says. \"And we had no choice. You couldn't just bring in a stranger to take his place. It was Ian Curtis, for God's sake! So it had to be one of us.\"</p> <p>There have been other premature deaths over the years: producer <a href=\"http://www.martinhannett.co.uk/bio.htm\" title=\"\">Martin Hannett in 1991</a>, manager <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/may/21/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Rob Gretton in 1999</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/13/guardianobituaries.media\" title=\"\">Tony Wilson</a>, the quixotic boss of the Factory label whose business instincts lagged some way behind his artistic vision, in 2007. Has Sumner ever felt unlucky? \"No,\" he says, \"I feel lucky it's not me! Perhaps that's the reason we're better behaved than we used to be, because all those people having quite early deaths makes you aware of your own mortality.\"</p> <p>Gilbert is equally matter-of-fact when discussing what kept her out of the band for so long. She took indefinite leave in&#xa0;2001 to care for her and Morris's youngest daughter, Grace, who was diagnosed with the neurological disorder <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Neuromyelitis-optica/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\" title=\"\">transverse myelitis</a>. \"New Order rehearsed at our studio, right next to where we lived, so I could still hear them,\" she says, taking Sumner's place at the pavement table while Morris attends to some last-minute technical emergency in Hyde Park and their eldest daughter Tilly loiters nearby. \"It was horrible for the first year, but I got used to it. I mean, things have to carry on.\"</p> <p>In 2007, just as it was looking as if there would be no band to return to, she developed breast cancer. \"I knew something was going on but when the break-up started I was going through chemotherapy and you just feel like nothing else matters. Now I've come out of that and stepped into this new line-up and we haven't got any of those issues any more.\"</p> <p>Gilbert says she was stunned when the audience at her comeback show in Brussels last September greeted her with chants of \"Gillian! Gillian!\" She generally finds it \"weird\" to be reminded what a powerful grip this band's history exerts on its fans. \"You don't realise you've got that sort of history because you're doing it. It's like when Control was being filmed in Macclesfield, you'd think: Why are they making a film about Joy Division?\"</p> <p>While Control told the story of that band's short life and abrupt demise, 24&#xa0;Hour Party People splashed across the screen the inspirational chaos of Tony Wilson's Factory. <a href=\"http://www.factoryrecords.net/thehacienda/history.htm\" title=\"\">The Hacienda</a>, Wilson and Rob Gretton's audacious attempt to give the city they loved the club of their dreams, became a financial black hole into which years of New Order royalties vanished without trace.</p> <p>\"People say: 'Surely it wasn't like that, they've used a bit of artistic licence,'\" says Sumner. \"But generally it was worse than that. We never got any accounts the whole time we were on Factory, but we didn't ask to see any accounts either. I think we used to get the touring income while they used to waste the record money. But we're not hard done to. I think every day how incredibly lucky it is that I travel around the world playing to thousands of people. Fucking hell, long may I live, y'know? I've been touched by the hand&#xa0;of God.\"</p> <p>If Joy Division's career has the stark precision of a novella, then New Order's reads like a baggy, tragicomic picaresque, studded with arrivals, departures, false endings and sudden twists. \"In Joy Division, we did our learning in private, in dusty rehearsal rooms above pubs,\" says Sumner. \"[New Order] had to learn in public. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRu5CThEmcE\" title=\"\">Hurt</a> [a 1982 B-side] was really just an experiment to learn how to use a synthesizer. Instead of reading the instruction manual, let's write a song with it and, y'know, sell it to people. But when you try to play them live, you're a bit like, 'Oh God, where's the chorus? Oh right, there <em>isn't</em> a chorus.'\" Cunningham says that while rehearsing the 1983 track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG-DYAPusBk\" title=\"\">586</a> for this tour they watched footage of old performances and an aghast Sumner asked, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXl3Qej1tjM\" title=\"\">How did we get away with being so shit</a> and we're still here today?\"</p> <p>This is why, although you can hear New Order's influence in countless bands, nobody uses their career as a blueprint. Like most of Sumner's lyrics, it doesn't make any sense on paper. Their brilliance grew out of flirting with disaster: the awkward experiments that paved the way for stunning breakthroughs, the chaotic concerts that crystallised in moments of wild magic, the puzzlingly opaque lyrics that could be either ridiculous or sublime.</p> <p>One collision of novice synth-tinkering and last-minute lyrical improvisation led to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftJZomwDhxQ\" title=\"\">Blue Monday</a>, their boldest and most beloved song. Sumner tells a very New Order story about being asked, in the 80s, to adapt the song to advertise Sunkist. Gretton, a&#xa0;man of staunch socialist principles, was in hospital and the money was great so they said yes. \"The lyrics were something about when you're drinking in the sun, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tta6bAeN_Tk\" title=\"\">Sunkist is the one</a>,\" says Sumner, laughing. \"I was like, 'Fucking hell, I can't sing that.' So Hooky wrote down \u00a3100,000 on a piece of paper and put it on the mixing desk and said: 'Try singing it now.' So I sang it, and then Rob came out of hospital and was like, 'What have you stupid bastards been doing while I've been in hospital?' and put the kibosh on it straight away.\"</p> <p>So there is no point expecting this strategy-averse band to know where they go from here. Perhaps there'll be a&#xa0;new album or perhaps this is just a cathartic and hard-earned lap of honour. At the moment, it doesn't appear to concern them either way. For the first time in years, they are thoroughly enjoying being in New Order.</p> <p>\"In May, my dad died,\" Gilbert says by way of explanation. \"We'd started up again and my dad thought it was fantastic. He couldn't wait to hear all the stories and where we'd been and it was just like starting in a band again for me. We thought he was going to recover, but he didn't. It was weird because then we were off to do another gig. It's only when you go home and think, God, he's not there anymore, that it affects you. You're not going to be here one day so you should just get on with it and enjoy it. And I think that's what we're doing. We're celebrating our past, because we've gone through a lot. We're celebrating that we're still here.\"</p> <p><em>New Order headline </em><a href=\"http://www.bestival.net/\" title=\"\"><em>Bestival</em></a><em> on Saturday 8 September.</em></p>",

About half of the victims are killed by people known to the child, said Stokes, in murders often witnessed by the child.</p> <p>\"What happened in France is particularly difficult but unfortunately these kinds of murders are not unusual,\" she said. \"Inevitably there is deep trauma and children need good quality care very quickly but if they receive that, and have good alternative care, then they can achieve their potential and beyond.\"</p> <p>Children can sometimes process trauma by automatically filtering it out. \"Often, they literally don't remember something an adult would think is too horrific to be forgotten,\" Stokes said. \"It's important any questioning by the police doesn't ignite memories the child has put in a place where they don't need to be processed.\"</p> <p>The \"overwhelming\" trauma for a child as young as four who has lost her parents is likely to be separation anxiety, she said. \"Added to that is the risk of even deeper trauma from secondary losses,\" she said. \"That can be minimised by recreating a sense of normality for her very quickly. She needs to be back in her own home, in her own bedroom, being looked after by adults she trusts. If she was just about to go to school and was excited about that, then that routine should be maintained.\"</p> <p>Dr Dora Black, a consultant psychiatrist and founder of the Traumatic Stress Clinic in London, agreed. \"What she has experienced has been gruesome but it is sadly not unique. It is not rare for a child to see one parent being murdered \u2013 often by their other parent or step-parent. There are services set up for these children. With skilled, long-term help, there is no reason why this little girl should not recover. Children can go on to have normal lives even with traumatic experiences.\"</p> <p>Black, author of a number of books and papers on bereavement and traumatic bereavement in childhood, including When Father Kills Mother, said the child's trauma must be treated before she is able to start to grieve.</p> <p>\"It's very likely she will suffer severe PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. This will get in the way of mourning, which means the trauma has to be dealt with first. That might take six months of intensive, trauma-focussed CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy], after which she needs to get counselling for bereavement.</p> <p>\"But the thing that will determine more than anything else is quality of alternative care she gets. She needs to be at home with family members or placed with a permanent foster family: moving her around from one foster family to another would be dreadful.\"</p> <p>Black said the girl should see her sister as soon as possible, and that she also needs to be shown her parents' bodies. \"Children as young as four don't understand the difference between life and death,\" Black said. \"She needs to be helped to understand by seeing for herself that her parents no longer move or speak or feel.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's time to deface music! Yes, it's that time of year again. The musically talented and untalented alike have swum upstream (been selected in advance by producers) to spawn (sing a bit on television while people frown/smile at them). </p> <p>Every Saturday night, millions of televisions will blurt the selection of noises, shapes and primary colours that compose Cowell's Cavalcade of Corporate Crooner Culling into the living rooms of the UK. The name of the particular programme has been changed for many reasons, ie x number of factors. During the initial stages of this singing and pointing competition the less-talented among the hopeful masses will be accused of a great many misdeeds.

Additionally these derogatory terms almost universally refer to mental illness in some fashion. </p> <p>During the 2012 <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/sports/\">Paralympics</a>, Channel 4 is showing a programme hosted by comedian <a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-team/presenter=adamhills/\">Adam Hills</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/programme/ry5gz/the-last-leg-with-adam-hills\">The Last Leg with Adam Hills</a>. It's a pun, please don't be wrong-footed. That was another pun (a much worse one). One section of this programme involves Adam discussing with <a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-team/presenter=AlexBrooker/\">Alex Brooker</a> what you can and cannot say about the Paralympics: a frank discussion about the taboos inevitably involved when discussing disability.</p> <p>Primarily their advice revolves around the content of speech. \"Just don't be horrible\" \u2013 a seemingly simple piece of advice that needs to be tattooed backwards across the heads of whoever is writing THOSE comments on YouTube. </p> <p>Hills and Brooker state that you probably will say the wrong thing and not to panic if you do. An example of such a wrong thing is given (source mercifully not provided): \"In the Paralympic equestrian events, is it the horse or the rider who is disabled?\" </p> <p>The point is not to control what you should and shouldn't say but rather to create an environment where people at least think about what they're saying before being horrible or downright offensive. </p> <p>Despite the first paragraph of this blog being about mental illness, I'm not trying to conflate being disabled with being mentally ill. Rather we should note that while people increasingly take care about the language they use to describe the disabled, the same luxury is often not afforded to those with mental illness. </p> <p>You would correctly frown (I don't know how you'd incorrectly frown, possibly a problem with your <a href=\"http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/expression/corrugator.html\">corrugator muscle</a>) about someone with a stubbed toe saying \"I'm a little bit crippled\". But you wouldn't pay the slightest attention to someone tidying their desk saying \"I'm a little bit obsessive compulsive.\" </p> <p>I can almost hear the cries of political correctness gone mad. Except if political correctness really had gone mad, we wouldn't be allowed to use the phrase, political correctness gone mad. Possibly you'd be forced to say political correctness had become a little bit obsessive compulsive. </p> <p>The casual use of language stigmatising mental illness is exceedingly common. <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/stigma\">Stigma</a> can be described as a sign of disgrace setting a person apart from others. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman\">Erving Goffman</a>, defined stigma as, \"the process by which the actions of others spoil normal identity.\" For those with mental illness the stigma experienced can result in a lack of funding for services, difficulty gaining employment, a mortgage or holiday insurance. Ultimately, feelings of stigma cause people to delay seeking help or even deny they have symptoms in the first place. </p> <p>Casual language used to describe mental illness is decidedly negative. He or she is described as going mad, mental or psycho. Media portrayals reinforce this with images of violence and homicide associated with mental ill health. It was rare to see a discussion concerning the recent shootings in Aurora, Denver, without comments about the shooter's mental health status. </p> <p>Even children's television seems to have gotten in on the act. One study in the <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/176/5/440.full\">British Journal of Psychiatry </a>found that out of a sample of one week of children's television, 59 out of 128 programmes contained one or more references to mental illness. Terms like \"crazy\", \"mad\" and \"losing your mind\" were commonly used to denote losing control. Six characters were identified as being consistently portrayed as mentally ill. These characters were almost totally devoid of positive characteristics. I'm not sure if one of these was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)\">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>. Why would a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge\">porifera</a> even need trousers? Some sort of <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/body_dysmorphic_disorder\">body dysmorphia</a> ? </p> <p>The sign \"You don't have to be crazy to work here but it helps\" has become so common that it's a clich\u00e9. People describing themselves as \"a bit mad\" usually mean that they've worn a sparkly hat at some point. Terms like mentalist, psycho, bonkers, insane and barking are thrown around like loose pennies in a conversational washing machine. Look at Terry, the mentalist. He's bonkers. He's so drunk he's gone outside to punch the thunder for annoying the moon. Mad! </p> <p>An argument could be made that these terms, while technically describing mental illness are not being used to specifically refer to mental illness. Rather they are referring to behaviour which they consider a little out of the ordinary. We can refer to this argument as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic/2011/oct/19/ricky-gervais-mong-twitter\">Gervais's Gambit</a>. The problem is that if this language is making people with mental illness feel stigmatised, ashamed and isolated then the amount of thought behind it as it is used casually is largely irrelevant. </p> <p>If you are so attached to using a word you don't want to put any thought behind it before you use it that's fine. I am more than happy for you to take your dictionary on a romantic weekend away if you promise to use your technical definitions in private without hurting anyone. \"But nobody I know has complained about me using this language.\" Well no, perhaps the people you know with mental illness are too worried you'll call them crazy and laugh at their inability to sing. </p> <p>And you will know somebody with mental illness. With estimates of one in four (most likely higher) people being affected it would defy statistics if you didn't. And only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics\">Benjamin Disraeli </a>is allowed to defy statistics. <br> Ultimately people are not going to stop using these terms stigmatising mental illness. It could be argued that at least one comment I've made during this article does just that. They are as entrenched in language as the saying of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lol\">\"lol\"</a> is instead of actually laughing. As a side note, shouldn't people who say lol instead of laughing, write it as lolol to describe laughing? </p> <p>Like the thought that should go into that distracting parody of text speak, it would be enough that people thought about what they are trying to express and whom they will hurt. Especially as it's likely to be someone close to them. You can still make your jokes and use the words, but consider whether another word might do and who you may hurt beforehand. Perhaps then we can move towards a frank and honest dialogue about mental illness and away from the disgrace and stigma. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists </a>along with mental health charities<a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\"> Mind </a>and <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org/\">Rethink Mental Illness </a>have produced a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlL53AyQzP4\">video</a> explaining more about mental illness discrimination and how you can support the proposed mental health (discrimination) bill. </p> <p>That and some consideration before you describe your busy weekend as mental, would go some way to reduce mental illness stigma. I don't think I'm crazy to think that would be a good thing.</p> <p><em>Dave Steele's inanity (I said INANITY!) can be further witnessed via his Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hullodave\">@hullodave</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Last month, Professor Gary Slapper rounded on those who reckon law is boring to study, delivering a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/06/studying-law-boring-gary-slapper\" title=\"\">memorable tribute</a> to a \"spellbindingly vivid and varied subject\" that \"governs everything from the embryo to exhumation.\" Of course, the road to becoming a lawyer can also be not-so-glamorous at times, especially at the vocational training stage of the Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL), Legal Practice Course (LPC) and Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC), where students are required to absorb vast amounts of often fairly dry information in a short timescale. As they do so, the spirits of even the most committed can begin to flag \u2013 with some giving up on their lawyer dreams altogether. Here's how to make it through to the fun bit of actually practising as a solicitor or barrister.</p> <h2>Law school is neither a sprint nor a marathon <br></h2> <p>Instead, it's \"more like an 800 metre race\", says trainee-to-be Laurence Mills, who studied history and politics at Oxford before heading to the College of Law's Moorgate branch to do the GDL. Mills believes that the key to cracking arguably the most challenging of the postgraduate legal courses, the GDL, is, on one hand, \"not exhausting yourself by working seven days a week\", but on the other, \"using time outside class to consolidate knowledge\". He adds: \"It's not a particularly glamorous course, so get in, get the job done and get out.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the LPC, Dr Philip Roberts, head of programme development at Kaplan Law School, recommends a similar strategy. \"It is a very intensive course, and some of the ways of studying that students may have developed as undergraduates \u2013 for example, leaving things to the last minute and then working all night to finish an essay \u2013 can cause them problems,\" he says.</p> <p>To succeed, Roberts advises students to \"see this year as the first year of their professional lives\".</p> <h2>Be strategic <br></h2> <p>With its advocacy component and associated inns of court dinners, the BPTC is widely regarded as sexier than the GDL and LPC courses. But the tricky drafting and opinion writing components that students must complete, alongside hefty procedural law modules, make it just as challenging.</p> <p>Given the extra-curricular commitments, such as mooting, that prospective barristers are expected to fulfil in addition to their study, doing well on the BPTC requires a degree of strategising, suggests Jack Harris, a City Law School alumni who'll commence pupillage next year at a leading Bristol barristers' chambers. He advises:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Look at what you have to do. Look at why you have to do it. Are you going to be assessed on it? And how extensively? Find the quickest route to completing the work in a way which means you have learned what you need to learn. If you won't be assessed on the evolution and history of rule, and don't think it will help your understanding of the rule proper, yet find a large chunk of your reading is devoted to this topic: skip it.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Never lose sight of the end game <br></h2> <p>Most students go to law school with the express intention of gaining a training contract or pupillage. Yet a surprising number neglect to pay sufficient time to the task of applying for jobs, losing themselves instead in the quest to score top grades. In reality there's not a lot of point getting full marks on the LPC or BPTC if you've got no job to go to at the end of it, as David Carter, recruitment partner at top City law firm Ashurst, hints:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I would say that a portion of time should really be spent on the steps to be taken after law school \u2014 it is a vocational course after all. I would hope that this training contract hunt would not be at the expense of achieving top results, but if the endpoint is a training contract and a few marks less, then so be it. Please note that the best students manage to encompass excellence in all respects and that is who we look for.\"</p> </blockquote> <h2>Don't be too cool for school <br></h2> <p>With swarms of friends made at university, students often begin their vocational legal study minded not to make a huge effort to socialise with their peers. It's a mistake, says LPC graduate Cat Pond, who's currently working as a paralegal at Constituency Management Group. \"Make allies in your class,\" urges Pond. \"Not only will you have someone to drink with but they may very well end up being a better teacher than the one actually hired by your college. Law students are surprisingly great at tutoring each other, and if you find yourself baffled by promissory estoppel in land law class then chances are your mate across the room may be an expert.\"</p> <h2>Blog with care<br></h2> <p>There's a growing blogging scene among law students, be it via more traditional Wordpress sites, Tumblr blogs or simple Twitter accounts and community Facebook pages. Participation in these mediums is a great way for students to enrich their law school experiences \u2013 and forge useful contacts \u2013 by engaging with practising lawyers, although it's unlikely to land them a job directly. As Stephanie Wookey, a pupil barrister at 2 Dr Johnson's Chambers, puts it: \"If you know more about Pussy Riot than particulars of claims, you won't be in a position to commence any formal training at a law firm or barristers' chambers.\"</p> <p>Most importantly, blogging future lawyers must remember that they're expected to exercise good judgment about what they write. Embarking on an \"I HATE LAW SCHOOL\" rant on a public Facebook page, for example, is highly unadvisable. As is sending an ex-professional footballer a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/21/man-racially-abused-collymore-twitter-spared-prison\" title=\"\">series of racist tweets</a>.</p> <h2>Take time out to prevent yourself from spiralling into madness <br></h2> <p>The aforementioned social media moments of madness could perhaps have been avoided if the law students in question had been exposed to the \"<a href=\"http://www.law.berkeley.edu/mindfulness.htm\" title=\"\">Mindfulness in Law</a>\" initiative recently launched by top US law school Berkeley. Implemented with a view to combating the intense stress of law school, the scheme focuses on \"exploring the benefits of meditation to legal education and law practice\". It's an approach that Westminster Law School academic Professor John Flood would like to see adopted by law schools in the UK. \"Law is one of the most stressful subjects to study. It's disorientating, apparently irrational at times, doesn't seem to be about justice, and disconnected from real life. These are some of the feelings that students have,\" he says.</p> <p>In the meantime, Flood encourages UK law students to take pro-active steps of their own to keep themselves in good mental shape, recommending Eugen Herrigel's Zen and the Art of Archery, and Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance as a way of \"thinking about law, creating empathy and coping with the great stresses of studying law\".</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012 to remove the reference to the law firm Laurence Mills is set to train with, which he had requested that we did not name</p> <p><em>Alex Aldridge is the editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.legalcheek.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Legal Cheek</em></a></p>",

  "<p>The big news this week comes via the doors of the beauty mothership, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/feb/06/brief-history-of-estee-lauder\">Est\u00e9e Lauder</a>. Granddaughter Aerin Lauder this week launches her own beauty line, and my, isn't it pretty? Aerin spent 20 years working for the company set up by her grandmother, most recently as creative director of brands, which put her in a perfect position to pave the way for her own empire. Kicking the Aerin brand off with beauty makes perfect sense, given the family background, but expect to see all sorts of other lifestyle bits and bobs \u2013 fabrics, footwear, sunglasses \u2013 are set to follow next year. The idea of a lifestyle brand feels a bit American, white-picket fences and a house full of neatly arranged flowers, but I love reading <a href=\"http://www.realsimple.com/\">Real Simple</a> magazine (\"Five new uses for ice cubes\", \"I store my tablecloths in length order\"), so maybe this is what I secretly aspire to.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395760788\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/6/1346939630308/Aerin-2---Anna-Chesters-c-008.jpg\" alt=\"Aerin 2 - Anna Chesters col\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Very smart \u2026 Aerin's Autumn Weekday kit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>But back to Aerin beauty. It's a cleverly edited capsule collection. Made up of just five multitasking products and a set of sturdy but sensibly sized brushes, the collection is aimed at busy women who want good quality but fuss-free makeup. Yes, similar products may be available elsewhere, but here they are all together, laid out in front of you in a simple, this-is-all-you-need-to-look-lovely way. The compact is somewhere between a foundation and a concealer (and comes in six shades), there's a gorgeous lip and cheek cr\u00e8me that gives a nice flush of colour, and the lip conditioner is thick and glossy. With a hand and body cream, and an illuminating powder to finish the collection, it really is a great selection of makeup basics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395760789\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/6/1346939735821/Aerin-3---Anna-Chesters-c-007.jpg\" alt=\"Aerin 3 - Anna Chesters col\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">And relax \u2026 Aerin's Weekend set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>As well as this Essentials collection, Aerin also launches an autumn collection.

  "<p>For the man who truly believes he would look as good in powder-blue nylon trunks as Daniel Craig did as he emerged from the Caribbean in Casino Royale comes a unique opportunity \u2013 you can buy the very pair.</p> <p>It was announced on Thursday that the trunks, size large, are being sold as part of a <a href=\"http://www.christies.com/sales/50-years-of-james-bond-september-2012/sale-info.aspx\" title=\"\">James Bond charity auction</a> to mark the 50th anniversary of the 007 film franchise. From costumes to cufflinks to the six-litre Aston Martin used in Quantum of Solace, 50 lots are to be sold by Christie's both online and at an invitation-only evening sale.</p> <p>Christie's director Nicolette Tomkinson said the aim was to offer a broad spectrum of prices \u2013 \"we hope to make memorabilia from the 23 Bond films accessible to all\".</p> <p>Certainly there is much for Bond fans to go goggle-eyed over: for example, the rubber suction pads that Sean Connery strapped to his knees and hands when he scaled the sheer face of Blofeld's volcano lair in You Only Live Twice. Admittedly they look like sink plungers fastened to bits of carpet but they are accompanied by a fibreglass shotgun from Tiger Tanaka's ninja training school.</p> <p>The \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000 valuation for a small pretend circuit board in the sale may raise eyebrows, but it was used as the Solex Agitator stolen by Scaramanga in The Man with the Golden Gun \u2013 a device so powerful it could harness the sun's energy. Also up for sale is his belt with its gold (not real) buckle, which has space for two gold (not real) bullets.</p> <p>The sale includes something related to every film \u2013 if not props, costumes or clapperboards then a first-edition book or poster.</p> <p>From Goldfinger there are props from the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach, including the scorecard that Goldfinger uses when he is cheating at cards, an ashtray and the Do Not Disturb sign that Bond puts on a door as he discovers Jill Masterson helping her boss cheat.</p> <p>Tarot cards first used by Solitaire in what looks like Mr Big's reception in Live And Let Die are also in the sale, with an estimate of \u00a3800 to \u00a31,200.</p> <p>Some of the lots have been donated. Timothy Dalton has offered the fawn gaberdine suit that he wore as Bond when he was in Tangiers, stalking General Pushkin in The Living Daylights.</p> <p>Other costumes in the sale include the silk wrap dress worn by Jinx (Halle Berry) in Die Another Day, which she removes before diving backwards into the sea to escape the gene therapy clinic guards, and the black velvet three-piece dinner suit worn by the psychopath Le Chiffre in Casino Royale.</p> <p>The memorabilia come from the archives of EON Productions, makers of the Bond movies. All the proceeds, including those from sales of the catalogue, are going to 12 charities. The online auction, with 40, lots is between 28 September and 8 October, and the evening auction is on 5 October, designated Global James Bond Day as it marks the 50th anniversary of the first screening of Dr No.</p> <p>It is there that the La Perla trunks, one of two pairs bought for the film, will be sold \u2013 but perhaps not modelled.

  "<p>A rash of legal challenges to a core piece of US civil rights legislation is threatening the foundations of nearly half a century of laws to combat racial discrimination.</p> <p>Republican-led state legislatures from Florida and Texas to Alaska have engineered a series of legal showdowns with the federal government over the 1965 Voting Rights Act that, following several court rulings last week, appear likely to end up before a US supreme court which has already hinted it is ready to revisit the heart of the law.</p> <p>Civil rights activists warn that if the supreme court strikes down a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which gives the federal government some control over elections in states with a history of blocking African Americans from voting, then separate legislation affecting discrimination in other areas, such as in employment, education and housing, may also be vulnerable.</p> <p>The moves against the Voting Rights Act also come as Texas and other states separately challenge the legality of racially-based affirmative action programmes in what some lawyers see as a concerted attempt to undermine and even kill off decades of civil rights legislation.</p> <p>The legal assault has zeroed in on a provision of the Voting Rights Act which requires nine states \u2013 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 to seek approval from the US justice department in Washington for changes to voting laws or procedures. Some districts in seven other states are also bound by the legislation.</p> <p>\"There has been a proliferation of cases that aim to take down and rip out this core provision of the Voting Rights Act,\" said Debo Adegbile, acting president and lead counsel of the NAACP legal defence fund, who has argued in the defence of the law at the supreme court. \"I think it's fair to say that the supreme court invited these challenges.\"</p> <p>Several states have taken on the Obama administration over the law with legislation requiring people to produce photo identification to vote, redrawing electoral boundaries and measures limiting voter registration.</p> <p>Obama's justice department has won a series of victories in recent weeks in which federal courts ruled that the changes amounted to racial discrimination and attempts to manipulate elections.</p> <p>Last week, courts in Washington DC separately struck down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/texas-loses-electoral-maps-latinos\">plans by Texas to redraw constituency boundaries</a> because they diminished the impact of a rapidly growing Latino vote and to require photo identification at the polls, which the court said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/texas-battle-voter-id-law\">would discourage minorities from voting</a>.</p> <p>The justice department has won similar victories over changes to election laws and procedures in other states, including Alabama and Florida, and is fighting legislation by South Carolina in a case the Obama administration appears likely to win.</p> <p>But they may prove pyrrhic victories. Several state governments are looking to the conservative-leaning supreme court \u2013 which has already expressed its doubts about racially-based policy \u2013 to challenge the provision of the Voting Rights Act requiring \"pre-clearance\" by the US justice department, known as Section 5.</p> <p>Nathaniel Persily, a Columbia University law professor whose work was cited in earlier supreme court opinion on the issue, said it is only a matter of time before the supreme court strikes at the heart of the Voting Rights Act by limiting the federal government's ability to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>\"The question is not whether Section 5 of the voting rights act will be struck down, but when and how. Will it die a death of a thousand cuts? Or will it be killed with one swift blow?\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said the supreme court hinted at its willingness to declare Section 5 unconstitutional in a 2009 ruling which upheld the Voting Rights Act while laying the seeds of its potential destruction.</p> <p>In that case, officials in Austin, Texas said they should not have to ask Washington's permission to move a polling place from a house to a public school. The supreme court upheld the Voting Rights Act, which was extended for 25 years by large majorities in both houses of Congress in 2006.</p> <p>But the chief justice, John Roberts, raised doubts about whether Section 5 could survive. He said the failure of Congress to update the law to take account of the changes it has brought about \u2013 such as black and white people voting in similar proportions across the south \u2013 raised questions about its constitutionality.</p> <p>\"The south has changed. The evil that Section 5 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for pre-clearance. The statute's coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions,\" Roberts wrote.</p> <p>While flagging up his doubts, Roberts said that \"the importance of the question does not justify our rushing to decide it\" \u2013 a view widely read as encouraging further legal challenges to the law so the supreme court can consider the matter at length.</p> <p>The chief justice's comments opened the floodgates. Since the 2009 ruling there have been more legal challenges to Section 5 than in the previous 44 years of its existence. <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/as-texas-voter-id-law-heads-to-hearing-2413543.html\">Texas</a> and Florida have already said they intend to ask to the supreme court to hear their cases. Two weeks ago,<a href=\"http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/more-alaska-redistricting-litigation-attorney-general-challenges-voting-rights-act-precleara\"> Alaska filed a constitutional challenge</a> to its obligations under Section 5.</p> <p>But the case closest to a hearing is out of an Alabama county, Shelby.</p> <p>The county's legal bills are being paid by the <a href=\"http://www.projectonfairrepresentation.org\">Project on Fair Representation</a>, which describes itself as a legal defence fund fighting \"the creation of racially gerrymandered voting districts\". Its director, Edward Blum, says that Section 5 exceeds Congress's powers under the constitution and that it punishing states for past sins.</p> <p>\"Section 5 was a draconian yet completely necessary provision in 1965 when mostly southern jurisdictions we purposely shutting out blacks from the ballot box. Today, however, Section 5 is no longer a needed remedy and has evolved into a racial gerrymandering tool,\" he said. \"African Americans and Hispanics no longer live in barrios and ghettos. Over the last 40 years, inner city America, which was heavily minority, has emptied out and African Americans and Hispanics live in all corners of these large major metropolitan areas now.\"</p> <p>But Adegbile said that the proliferation of laws being blocked by the justice department and courts under Section 5 is evidence of continued need for the Voting Rights Act. </p> <p>\"Courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents and Democratic presidents are saying these underlying voting changes are discriminatory and will harm minority voters,\" he said. \"What we see is a rash of voting measures targeted at minority voters in a number of places across the country that surprises folks who believed we had moved beyond though practices. I think the average person understands that it seems there's still different ways that you can try to win elections. One is by mobilising your voters. The other is by blocking a certain segment of the electorate and that second approach remains, unfortunately, a technique that is being deployed in too many places around the country.\"</p> <p>The supreme court has also taken up another case, involving race based affirmative action, that potentially has a profound impact on civil rights. Abigail Fisher sued after she was denied a place at the University of Texas claiming that she was discriminated against because she is white.</p> <p>In 2003, a divided supreme court ruled that a student's race could be considered in order to achieve a diverse university student body, but only after attempting to use other means. Fisher argues that Texas law already provides for a diverse admissions policy and therefore race based affirmative action was unnecessary.</p> <p>The Project on Fair Representation is financially backing that legal challenge, too. Blum said that he regards affirmative action based on race as a mistake from the beginning. \"Affirmative action assumed that all African Americans regardless of their family income or their family educational background were deserving of some special help,\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said that if that central part of the Voting Rights Act is struck down then other civil rights legislation is likely to come under legal attack.</p> <p>\"The thing about Section 5 of the voting rights act is that it's been the standard against which all other exercises of federal power in the civil rights realm have been judged. When you're talking about the disabilities act or the age discrimination in employment act or any number of other pieces of legislation, when the courts find problems with those laws they say they're not as good as the voting rights act,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So now the gold standard for civil rights legislation is potentially going to be declared unconstitutional with unclear repercussions for all kinds of other laws.\"</p> <p>Adegbile agrees. \"If the rulings were overly broad, the knock-on effect could be felt in other areas such as employment, education and the like. I think that there are serious threats,\" he said.</p> <p>Blum hopes so, saying that he believes employment laws and public contracting, in which a proportion of government contracts are awarded to minority-owned firms, will be particularly vulnerable to legal challenge.</p> <p>For Adegbile, the looming supreme court battles are a test of where the US stands on civil rights half a century after the laws that changed America.</p> <p>\"Right now we are at a moment where there are competing visions of equality and opportunity in America. One side says that we have to celebrate our progress but recognise that we can do better. The other view is that we should stop talking about our history. We should deny the context, and we should move past all of this as if to pretend that racial discrimination does not continue to exist in America.\"</p>",

Her life is no longer in danger and she is said to be \"recovering slowly\".</p> <p>Detectives say the four-year-old, the only one to escape the massacre unharmed, has been asking for her family. She has been seen by a child psychologist.</p> <p>Four people were killed after a person opened fire with a semi-automatic pistol on a British-registered BMW vehicle in a forest parking spot near Lake Annecy in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie. The killer fired numerous shots, but aimed at the windows of the vehicle.</p> <p>The driver \u2013 an Iraqi-born British national named by French media as Saad al-Hilli, 50, after documents were found in the car \u2013 and an older woman sitting in the rear of the vehicle were shot in the head. A second cyclist who appears to have surprised the killer was also shot in the head. Police said it was not clear how a younger woman sitting in the rear of the vehicle and believed to be the children's mother, had died.</p> <p>A British cyclist who came across the scene was said to be in a state of \"profound shock\". The cyclist, described as a former member of the RAF, came to the rescue of the injured eight-year-old after finding her in a pool of blood near the car. Seeing that she was still breathing, he put her in the recovery position and called the emergency services.</p> <p>Eric Maillaud, the public prosecutor, said: \"A British cyclist was making his way up the road. There was a slope so he was going at his own pace, when he was overtaken by another cyclist. He carried on up the hill and arrived at a forest parking spot popular with holidaymakers as the start for walks and hikes. When he arrived, he found a vehicle, a powerful BMW estate car with the motor still running.</p> <p>\"He saw a little girl by the car still alive. He went to her aid. He then broke the driver's side window \u2013 it was a British car and right-hand drive and he cut the ignition. He saw three dead people in the car; a man in the driver's seat and two women behind.\"</p> <p>He said the elder girl had suffered \"very serious head fractures\".</p> <p>\"She was beaten very badly, mainly to the head and had been shot in the shoulder. She was hit extremely violently.\"</p> <p>Asked why gendarmes at the scene failed to find the second girl for eight hours, Maillaud said it was only when a neighbour at the campsite where the family had been staying a few kilometres away said they had two children that they were alerted.</p> <p>\"We had no idea until we spoke to the neighbours at the camping site that there was a second child in the car.\"</p> <p>He added: \"She was clearly happy to be taken into the arms of the person who brought her out of the car. She smiled and started to speak in English. Almost straight away she asked where were her family.\"</p> <p>Of the younger girl and what she might have seen, the public prosecutor said: \"Can you imagine ... this four-year-old child stayed still and silent next to a dead body for eight hours.\"</p>",
  "<p>Shulamith Firestone was one of the early US radical women's liberationists who provided the theoretical foundation for a second wave of feminism. Along with Kate Millett's Sexual Politics, Betty Friedan's The Second Stage and Jill Johnston's Lesbian Nation, Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution (1970) contributed to a theory of women's oppression and male supremacy that is as relevant today as it was at the time of publication. She has been found dead in her apartment in Manhattan, New York, at the age of 67.</p> <p>Firestone, who was only 25 when the book was published, adapted the theories of Marx and Freud to an analysis of women's oppression. She argued that women occupy a sexual class below that of men, and that gender inequality originates in social structures imposed upon women through their biology \u2013 pregnancy, childbirth, childrearing and so on. Advocating the abolition of the nuclear family in favour of community units in a socialist society, and the abolition of the cultural importance of gender, she challenged the assumption that biology is destiny.</p> <p>Firestone wrote in The Dialectic of Sex: \"The 'natural' is not necessarily a 'human' value. Humanity has begun to transcend nature: we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on grounds of its origins in nature. Indeed, for pragmatic reasons alone it is beginning to look as if we must get rid of it.\"</p> <p>One of six children, she was born Shulamith Bath Shmuel Ben Ari Feuerstein in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, to orthodox Jewish parents. Firestone grew up in St Louis and Kansas City, both in Missouri, and went to Washington University in St Louis.</p> <p>While studying for a fine arts degree at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Firestone, along with Jo Freeman, founded the Westside Group, the predecessor to Chicago Women's Liberation Union. In 1967, at the National Conference for New Politics, members of the women's caucus were refused a platform, and Firestone and feminist comrades who rushed the podium were told: \"Cool down, little girl, we have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\" This prompted her departure from the left.</p> <p>After graduating in 1967, Firestone moved to New York and co-founded New York Radical Women, the city's first women's liberation group. During this time she wrote essays such as Women and the Radical Movement, and The Jeanette Rankin Brigade: Woman Power? (both 1968). Firestone believed the suffrage movement to be a conservative one, and wrote in her 1968 essay The Women's Rights Movement in the USA: New View: \"For what is the vote worth finally if the voter is manipulated? Every husband knows he's not losing a vote, but gaining one.\"</p> <p>In Notes from the First Year New York: The New York Radical Women (1968) she wrote: \"Contrary to what most historians would have us believe, women's rights were never won \u2026 As for sex itself, I would argue that any changes were as a result of male interests and not female. Any benefits for women were accidental.\"</p> <p>In 1969 she founded Redstockings with Ellen Willis and set up the New York Radical Feminists with Anne Koedt.</p> <p>Firestone had a knack for being ahead of her time, and in The Dialectic of Sex she predicted that the technologies of IVF and foetal sex selection would result in further oppression and control of women via their reproductive biology.</p> <p>She withdrew from politics in the early 70s, and moved to New York's East Village, where she concentrated on painting. Firestone was known to have been suffering from mental health problems in the late 80s and did not publish anything until her collection of short stories on poverty, mental illness and psychiatric hospitals, Airless Spaces (1998).</p> <p>Firestone's legacy is her challenge to the left in her refusal to accept that women's liberation should be shelved until after the revolution. \"We shall need a sexual revolution much larger than \u2013 inclusive of \u2013 a socialist one to truly eradicate all class systems.\" Firestone is survived by four of her siblings and her mother.</p> <p>\u2022 Shulamith Firestone, writer, born 7 January 1945; found dead 28 August 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012.

  "<p>A pilot scheme known as Clare's Law, which gives people the right to ask questions about their partner's violent past, has been launched by four police forces as part of a 12-month trial.</p> <p>Clare's Law is named after a Salford mother \u2013 Clare Wood \u2013 who was murdered and set on fire by her abusive partner George Appleton, whom she met on Facebook. Unbeknown to her, Appleton had previous convictions for harassing his girlfriends, including kidnapping his ex-partner at knifepoint.</p> <p>At the inquest into 36-year-old Wood's death, the coroner, Jennifer Leeming, said women in abusive relationships should have the right to know about the violent pasts of the men they were involved with. The police forces involved are Greater Manchester, Wiltshire and Gwent along with Nottinghamshire, following a campaign by Wood's father and family.</p> <p>The pilot offers a formal mechanism for people to inquire whether their partner has a violent or abusive past. Third parties \u2013 such as relatives, neighbours or concerned officials \u2013 can also seek disclosure of information. It was cautiously welcomed by a leading domestic abuse charity in Manchester.</p> <p>Karen Harrison of the Women's Domestic Abuse Helpline said it welcomed anything that brought the issue of domestic abuse into the public eye, even if it only helped a small percentage of women. \"If it saves one life, we've got to welcome it,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Most perpetrators have never been in trouble with the police before and it may give women a false sense of security if they are concerned that something is wrong and make a telephone call and find out there are no previous convictions. I would urge women to go with their gut instinct, talk to agencies like us and discuss their concerns.\"</p> <p>Harrison said that when the pilot ended in 12 months' time, the helpline might no longer exist as it only had funding guaranteed for a few months. \"It concerns me that the resources to support the helpline may not be there,\" she said. \"We might get a phone call from someone in Manchester and the nearest refuge is in Blackburn, but all the woman's support network is in Manchester. It's very difficult.\"</p> <p>With Sarah's Law, which allows people to discover if sex offenders are living in their area, disclosure of information has only been made in around 6% of cases. The helpline receives 5,500 contacts a year from people in Greater Manchester and one of the biggest criticisms of the service is that it is constantly engaged. In Greater Manchester, 14 women have been killed by partners or former partners in recent years.</p> <p>She said: \"We have women locked in the house, who are not allowed out. Some are not treated as humans \u2013 they are sexually assaulted or raped, and when they complain they are told: 'You are my wife, that is what is expected of you.'\"</p> <p>Harrison said one woman had been in touch who had never received a birthday card. Another woman's ribs were cracked, so that the abuse wasn't visible. \"There's one woman in her 70s who has arthritis and her mobility is limited. Her partner kicks her in the knees \u2013 it's horrendous and it's important that people can speak to a human being who actually cares.\"</p> <p>There are victims who are professional women \u2013 even lawyers dealing with family law have been victims of domestic violence, she said. \"Where Clare's Law is going to work is when people have hit rock bottom,\" she added. She also had concerns about women's safety once they had the information about their partner's past.</p> <p>DS Phil Owen of Greater Manchester police admitted it was not a panacea for the \"very heinous crime\" of domestic violence, because it was a complex issue. \"Clearly we are hoping to give some choice to victims about their future,\" he said. \"The scheme allows an individual, whether it be the person or a third party, such as a concerned relative, to ask for disclosure of information.\"</p> <p>The police-led initiative also involves other agencies, such as probation, social services and housing. The police will work with agencies such as Data Protection to ensure human rights are not breached during the process. There will be a number of checks in place to avoid spurious applications for disclosure, he added. \"It gives people information so that they can make an informed choice.\"</p> <p>The Home Office said domestic violence was a \"dreadful crime\" that saw millions of families and women suffer years of abuse, and it was constantly looking at new ways of protecting victims.</p> <p>It has ringfenced \u00a340m of stable funding for domestic and sexual violence support services and helplines until 2015.</p> <p>The Salford MP Hazel Blears, who was Wood's constituency MP, said the scheme did not pretend to be a magic bullet for the issue, but gave people information so that they could make an informed decision. She said she wanted to see it widely publicised, with leaflets and posters in police stations, doctor's surgeries and Sure Start Centres.</p>",

But Vladimir Putin did don white overalls and big black goggles as he took to the skies over northern Siberia in a motorised hang glider to help endangered cranes begin their migration to wintering grounds in Iran and India.</p> <p>Unfortunately no one had told the young birds, who only formed up behind Russia's stunt-loving head of state on his second time in the air. On his first flight Putin was accompanied by only one of the Siberian white cranes.</p> <p>Putin blamed strong winds for the initial failure of the birds to fly with him. But he described the cranes as \"pretty lads\" when journalists asked what he thought of them after landing.</p> <p>The motorised hang glider \u2013 in which he was accompanied by the seasoned pilot Igor Nikitin \u2013 proved a handful. Putin said it was harder to control than a jet fighter.</p> <p>Putin, who is a few days short of his 60th birthday, has spent about a year and a half preparing for the trip with the cranes and received 17 hours of advance tuition on the motorised hang glider.</p> <p>Wednesday's flight took place in Russia's far north, by the banks of the Siberian river Ob, at the site of a project that rears cranes in their traditional nesting grounds. The birds have almost been driven to extinction by hunters targeting them along their migration routes through central Asia.</p> <p>After his flight Putin donated the hang glider, which his press spokesman said he had purchased <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/vladimir-putin-palaces-planes-toilet\" title=\"\">with his own money</a>, to the crane conservation project and shared fish soup and tea prepared over a campfire with the scientists working there, the state-owned paper Rossisskaya Gazeta reported.</p> <p>Putin followed his close encounter with birds with a close encounter with sea life. On his arrival on Thursday at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum in Vladivostok, which Russia is hosting, he visited a new aquarium in the city. Staff pulled an octopus out of its tank, which Putin proceeded to stroke, Interfax reported.</p> <p>The cranes will now remain under the supervision of the presidential administration, which already cultivates Putin's nature-loving credentials by assisting schemes dedicated to preserving polar bears, tigers, leopards and whales in Russia.</p> <p>Shortly after the news of Putin's successful flight was reported by state media, the Kremlin-controlled English language television channel Russia Today broadcast the president's first interview since winning his third term in March.</p> <p>Asked about the rock band Pussy Riot, Putin declined to comment on the severity of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-two-years\" title=\"\">two-year sentence handed down to Maria Alyokhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich</a> for their \"punk prayer\" protest in Moscow's main cathedral, but chose to focus on the \"moral\" aspect of the case.</p> <p>In particular he reminded viewers of the orgy performed by members of the radical art group Voina in Moscow's Biological Museum in 2008 to protest against the election of Dmitry Medvedev, who replaced Putin in the Kremlin for four years, in which Tolokonnikova took part.</p> <p>\"Group sex is better than one-on-one because, as in any sort of collective work, you can shirk off,\" said Putin.</p>",
  "<p>You may have read the headlines this week: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9521877/Abortion-raises-risk-of-premature-birth-next-time.html\" title=\"\">\"Abortion 'raises risk of premature birth next time'\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/women-who-have-abortions-more-likely-to-have-premature-births-in-later-pregnancies-8104824.html\" title=\"\">\"Women who have abortions more likely to have premature births in later pregnancies\"</a>. The stories cover the results of a paper published on the <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/4/e000911.full#aff-2\" title=\"\">BMJ open website</a> examining reproductive outcomes following an induced abortion. Unfortunately, regular BMJ readers might be forgiven for thinking newspapers were engaged in a bad science writing competition, where prizes would be conferred for presenting the headline most likely to misinform and frighten women.</p> <p>What most have failed to make clear is firstly that the risks in all cases remain minimal and secondly that \"induced abortion\" means surgical abortion \u2013 the least common type of abortion, and the type most likely to take place for serious medical reasons in late pregnancy. There was no mention of the alternative to abortion either, which is for women to complete their pregnancy against their will. The likelihood of this affecting women's physical and mental health is very high. Interestingly, another widely reported piece of research, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2195528/Repeated-abortions-raise-risks-future-pregnancies.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">which hit the papers just a week earlier</a>, claims that one termination has no tangible impact, but that three or more can increase the risk of premature birth. The two reports contradict each other, yet each is reported as scientific fact.</p> <p>I've been the media spokeswoman for the pro-choice campaign group Abortion Rights for several years. I'm very used to skewed reporting on abortion. Whenever annual statistics come out, headline writers comb through for the \"shock\" data. We read about \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2080056/Shocking-figures-teenagers-quarter-abortions-Britain.html\" title=\"\">more teen abortions</a>\" while repeat abortions fall, and \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18249026\" title=\"\">more repeat abortions</a>\" when teenagers are actually seeking fewer terminations.</p> <p>The reality is that abortion rates are remarkably stable in the UK. Unsurprising, since unwanted pregnancy is a fact of life in a society where women don't all live in nunneries, and that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is one taken seriously, not on the basis of fleeting fads and trends. The truth is boring and under-reported.</p> <p>As such, perhaps it's not surprising that journalists are drawn towards the opportunity for a shocking, attention-grabbing headline. But there is more at stake than that. A small minority of people in the UK oppose abortion. Most of them express that through the tried and tested method of not having one, and leaving the rest of us alone. A small minority within that group are also committed to a political campaign to criminalise women who make that choice, and doctors who facilitate that choice. Of course however much we might disagree with them, they must have the right to express that opinion and campaign on it.</p> <p>Sadly, there is yet another minority within that minority for whom any and all tactics are acceptable in the crusade to control women's bodies. This group appears to be on the rise, and use tactics suspiciously similar to anti-choice groups in the US. None of these publish their funding information, but it is widely assumed they are funded by church groups; it is likely that individuals donating in church collection trays are not always aware where the money will end up (a recent mass prayer meeting held outside a clinic in Bloomsbury in central London was led by the auxiliary Catholic bishop of Westminster).</p> <p>These groups hold \"vigils\" outside abortion clinics, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/anti-abortion-activism-clinic-vigil\" title=\"\">harassing and intimidating women</a> going in for medical appointments. They have lobbied for and won access to private medical data that could lead to the public identification of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/department-of-health-loses-abortion-secrecy-bid\" title=\"\">women seeking late-term abortions for serious medical reasons</a>. They run fake crisis pregnancy counselling centres, which are in fact fronts to distribute false information in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/02/abortion-pregnancy-counselling-found-wanting\" title=\"\">hope of deterring women from abortion</a>. The group Care was found to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/gay-cure-christian-charity-mps-interns\" title=\"\">funding an estimated 20 interns</a> in the House of Commons. They hit the news when it emerged that alongside their anti-choice campaigning, they also oppose gay rights and believe homosexuality can and should be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/gay-cure-christian-charity-mps-interns\" title=\"\">\"cured\"</a>.</p> <p>So does it come as any surprise to discover these groups also comb through any and all research and data on abortion and repackage it as \"shocking news\" before sending it out in press releases to publications across the country? Of course not.</p> <p>For me this is a matter not only of good journalism, but of human rights. You see I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice. I think every woman should be able to make the choices about what happens to her own body for herself. But in order to make these choices, she needs good, reliable information. The research at the back of these stories is important, and should continue and be available to women and to medical professionals. The sensationalised headlines however are misleading. Journalists should get wise to the anti-choice tactics at play, and endeavour to present an accurate and truly scientific picture of the issue.</p>",

Other donors include Saudi Arabia, which has pledged $3.2bn, the US and the World Bank, which pledged an extra US$400m to its existing $700m programme over the coming two years.</p> <p>It is hoped the emergency funding will help stabilise Yemen's faltering economy and its volatile security situation, which donors described as being on the \"brink of a slide into instability\".</p> <p>\"For the first time ever for Yemen, donors have come together to say in detail what they are going to do to help, how they will do it, and when they will deliver their aid, an effort to which Saudi Arabia has given the most,\" says Alan Duncan, UK international development minister.</p> <p>\"Over the last few months, we've put together a package of support which will underpin the Yemeni economy, direct funds into infrastructure, and will urgently address Yemenis' basic needs, such as healthcare, education and access to sanitation.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/yemen\" title=\"\">Yemen has the highest poverty levels </a>in the Middle East and the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the country has been exacerbated by years of conflict and violence.

  "<p>Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has pushed through a controversial scheme to save the euro, trampling over German opposition.</p> <p>Stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic rallied strongly after the ECB announced that it was prepared to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds to help Europe's struggling periphery, as long as countries agreed to economic reform plans in return.</p> <p>At the same time, the ECB said that the economic outlook for the eurozone had deteriorated. It now expects the eurozone economy to shrink by 0.4% in 2012 and grow by 0.5% in 2013, while inflation rises to 2.6%.</p> <p>Draghi said the vote to start buying the bonds of crisis-hit states in unlimited amounts, in an attempt to bring governments' borrowing costs down, was \"almost unanimous\", with one exception.</p> <p>The scheme has faced furious opposition from German central bank chief Jens Weidmann, who argues that it is tantamount to printing money in order to pay off a country's debt, which is expressly forbidden by the ECB's mandate. He also fears the measures will fuel inflation, ease the pressure on overspending governments to get their finances in order and erode the ECB's independence.</p> <p>Ranvir Singh, chief executive of market analysts RANsquawk, said: \"Even by the inscrutable standards of Mario Draghi, the ECB president's speech revealed little of huge tectonic pressure that has built up under the eurozone's surface. To fly in the face of Germany's wishes will not have been easy. For the Bundesbank, keeping inflation in check is an article of faith. Its president has made no secret of the fact that he regards the ECB plan to buy the debt of the eurozone's weaker members as the road to perdition.\"</p> <p>Draghi said <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html\" title=\"\">the buying-up of bonds, which will be known as outright monetary transactions (OMTs)</a>, would be unlimited and that countries benefiting from the scheme would need to submit to certain conditions. The ECB would seek the involvement of the IMF to design and monitor such programmes. Governments to benefit from the OMT would also have to be attached to a programme with one of the eurozone bailout funds. Draghi said the ECB would stop buying a country's bonds if it failed to comply with the bailout programme.</p> <p>News of the plan sparked a rally in Spanish and Italian government bonds. Equities also strengthened. In London the FTSE 100 was up by more than 2% in late trading, gaining 119 points to 5777, while the Spanish IBEX surged by nearly 5%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones rallied by 230 points, or 2.1%, to 13276.</p> <p>The ECB said it would buy bonds with a residual maturity of one to three years. That means it can buy bonds with a longer maturity, as long as they only have three years remaining until they are paid back.</p> <p>As expected, the ECB said the bond-buying programme would be \"sterilised\". This means the central bank will not increase the money supply as a result of the bond purchases; instead it will take the equivalent amount of money out from other parts of the system.</p>",

There are quite a few of these adapters, including the Trust All-in-1 Card Reader Express (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-All-in-1-Card-Reader-Express/dp/B0025X6DB0/\">\u00a34.99 at Amazon.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>Sadly, the iPad doesn't have either a USB port or an SD slot, but Apple sells the <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MC531ZM/A/apple-ipad-camera-connection-kit\">Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit</a> for \u00a325. This provides two adapters that plug into the iPad's proprietary dock connector. One lets you connect your iPad to a digital camera via a USB cable (not included), while the other has an SD slot. If you can't connect directly to your (I assume, Fujifilm but possibly Olympus) camera then you can try connecting to a USB card adapter. One of the cheapest for your purposes would be a Fujifilm USB XD Card Reader For all XD Cards <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fujifilm-USB-XD-Card-Reader/dp/B00172017W/\">\u00a33.69 from Amazon.co.uk</a> or something similar.</p> <p>I can't guarantee that this reader will work with an iPad. It's a very basic bit of technology, so it really ought to work. However, someone who bought the similar Integral USB 2.0 Single Slot XD Reader (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Integral-USB-Single-Slot-Reader/dp/B001D6G1E4/\">\u00a33.38 from Amazon.co.uk</a>) complains in a Customer Review that: \"It doesn't work with iPad because it requires too much power.\" Perhaps readers can suggest an xD that definitely does work.</p> <p>If you feel like trying a non-Apple branded connector, the Shinntto 2-in-1 Digital Camera Connection Kit provides both the USB port and SD card slot in a single dongle for only <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shinntto-Digital-Camera-Connection-Edition/dp/B005FUQ89W/\">\u00a33.99 at Amazon.co.uk</a>. It's got a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars, so it could save you \u00a321.</p> <h2>Copying photos to a new PC</h2> <p><em>My wife has changed from a Dell running Windows XP to a Dell running Windows 7. I transferred her files using a 16GB USB drive, but I just cannot get any joy with the transfer of her photos. On the XP system, they arranged in folders \u2013 eg, Spain holiday 2011. I have finished up with scores of folders with only two or three pics in each.</em><br><strong>Ernest Farnhill</strong></p> <p>If you are viewing the files and folders in Windows Explorer, then there should not be a problem. First, check that your selected group of folders adds up to less than 16GB by right-clicking and selecting Properties. Next, hold down the right mouse-button, drag the selection to the USB drive, and select Copy Here. It's hard to see how this can go wrong.</p> <p>An alternative is to create a compressed folder on the Windows XP machine and copy her folders of photos into that. When you have 16GB, copy the single compressed file to the USB stick and then to the Windows 7 machine, where you can uncompress it. This ensures that the folder structure and filenames stay the same.</p> <p>Also, Microsoft provides a free utility called <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/products/features/windows-easy-transfer\">Windows Easy Transfer</a>. This lets you select which files and settings you want to migrate and moves them for you. You can find it in Windows 7 by clicking Start and searching for Easy Transfer. You can download the 32-bit Windows XP version to the XP machine from the link above. There's also a four-minute <a href=\"http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/help/videos/transferring-files-and-settings-from-another-pc\">Microsoft video</a> to show you what to do.</p> <p>You might have found the whole process easier if you'd started with Windows Easy Transfer, though it's not really worth it just for the photos\u2026 unless all else fails.</p> <p>I wonder if your wife has organised her photos into albums using some type of cataloguing program. In this case, the real folders on the hard drive may not match the \"virtual folders\" in her software (and perhaps you copied them correctly after all). If so, you should be able to move the photos across by opening the cataloguing program and creating a backup. Install the same cataloguing software on the Windows 7 machine, run it, and choose to restore from the backup. (If there's no backup option, there should be export/import commands that produce the same result.)</p> <p>Incidentally, it's certainly possible to use a 16GB memory stick to do the migration, and Windows Easy Transfer offers this option. However, it's better to do it using an external USB hard drive, and you can now get a 2TB drive for about \u00a385. This is big enough to hold complete copies of both the XP and Windows 7 hard drives, and therefore to provide a backup if one of them fails. If you don't have a back up, recovering lost photos can easily cost 10x or 20x the price.</p> <h2>Bad form</h2> <p><em>We have received, by email, an insurance document for our dog. It has to be printed out and filled in every time we take him to a vet. Rather than do this manually, we'd like to fill it in and just print it off as and when required. We have Office 2010, but every time I attempt to fill in the form, a new page starts. I have forwarded the doc as an attachment. Is there a way to edit it?</em><br><strong>Mike Davenport</strong></p> <p>Although the file you sent is a Microsoft Word document, it doesn't contain any text. Each page is, in fact, an image, which is why there is no way of typing anything into any of the boxes. Even if you save the file in a different format, such as PDF, you still only have image files.</p> <p>There are ways round this. For example, I saved the image as a png file, then loaded it into the free graphics program, <a href=\"http://www.getpaint.net/\">Paint.net</a>. This has an \"insert text\" function \u2013 click the T on the Tools bar \u2013 so you can type in your details, save the result and print it out. Free text fields (such as name and address) are very easy to do, but it requires a bit of practice to get the account numbers lined up in their little boxes. It may be easier if you work with the image at its actual size, or larger.</p> <p>The simpler alternative is just to print out the original document, fill in all the common bits, and make a few photocopies. When you take your dog to a vet, grab a copy and fill in the two remaining blank lines (First date of illness, Brief description of illness) by hand.</p> <p>I assume Argos Pet Insurance scans and files the forms when you send them in. Otherwise there are better ways to collect data, and many large companies use <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/infopath/\">Microsoft InfoPath</a> to create electronic forms. This is part of Microsoft Office. Even one-man bands can do something similar using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/google-d-s/forms/\">Google Forms</a>, which saves data in a Google spreadsheet.</p> <p>Proper online forms can be pre-populated so you don't have to type in the same data over and over again, unless something changes \u2013 you move house, or whatever.

  "<p>King Solomon used them in the construction of the temple that would bear his name, the Phoenicians used them to build their merchant ships and the ancient Egyptians used their resin in the mummification process. But now Lebanon's cedar trees (<em>Cedrus libani</em>), described in the Scriptures as \"the glory of Lebanon\" and by the 19th-century French Romantic poet, Alphonse de Lamartine, as \"the most famous natural monuments in the world\", face a new threat in the form of climate change.</p> <p>Emblazoned on the national flag, currency and the country's national airline, the cedar is the one great unifying emblem of this small Mediterranean nation. Centuries of deforestation have already seen the tree's 500,000 hectares decimated to its current 2,000 hectares, <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/42305/0\" title=\"\">and has been added to the IUCN's red list of threatened species</a>, albeit at the lowest level of threat.</p> <p>The cedars, some up to 3,000 years old and almost all of which are now protected, need a minimum amount of snow and rain for natural regeneration. But global warming has meant Lebanon's cedars being subjected to shorter winters and less snow, and the Lebanese government estimates that snow cover could be cut by 40% by 2040.</p> <p>Dr Nabil Nemer, the head of the agricultural sciences department at <a href=\"http://www.usek.edu.lb/en/\" title=\"\">Lebanon's Holy Spirit University of Kaslik</a>, said that the lack of snow was not the only problem linked to climate change. \"Insects, due to the changing climatic condition, become more active and their development rate is faster thus causing more outbreaks, which weaken the cedar tree making them more susceptible to other diseases and/or insects, which will ultimately kill the trees. At least one insect has been studied and the results showed that outbreaks of this insect are due to climate change, a low period of snow and low humidity in summer. This insect, the <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em>, is a serious cedar tree defoliator.\"</p> <p>But, with sectarian difficulties forever dominating the political agenda, the fight to preserve Lebanon's cedars can be a frustrating one. Nemer, who is also project co-ordinator of Support to Nature Reserves of Lebanon, said that while the Lebanese government was concerned about the threat to its emblem, not enough was being done to stop deforestation and plant new cedars. \"Whether what is being done is enough \u2013 it is enough when you see the number of groups involved and it is not enough when you observe what is done, how it is done and by whom.\"</p> <p>Dr Elsa Sattout, whose PhD entailed a multidisciplinary study of Lebanon's cedar forests, defended the country's approach and noted the cedar is protected by law, but said more could be done.</p> <p>\"There are many reforestation projects undertaken by non-governmental organisations and funded by international agencies, which have and are taking place, but, for me, these could have been more successful.\" Since 2009, for example, Starbucks and the Association for Forest Development and Conservation have partnered to plant several thousand cedars in areas of Lebanon afflicted by forest fires.</p> <p>She also highlighted a mass spraying project against <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em> in a joint effort between the American University of Beirut and the ministries of agriculture and environment.</p> <p>.</p> <p>A spokesman from the country's Lebanese agricultural ministry told the Guardian: \"When, for example, the threat of the <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em> was discovered in the Tannourine nature reserve we had experts from France to assess the danger and they suggested the insecticide to use, which we dropped using helicopters and were successful in drawing an environmental balance \u2013 and keeping the insect at bay. The cedars are our treasure and we need to preserve this treasure for many hundreds and thousands of years to come.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the past month, the Republican party's woman problem has come to the fore. And justifiably so: the party doesn't take too kindly to the needs and rights of women \u2013 or to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/us/politics/todd-akin-provokes-ire-with-legitimate-rape-comment.html\">basic reproductive science</a> \u2013 and it's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57506101/womens-vote-hinges-on-social-issues-pocketbook/\">weighing on Mitt Romney's candidacy</a>.</p> <p>But party leaders' backward ideas aren't limited to controlling women's bodies; they also extend to controlling paychecks. With equal pay activist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lilly-ledbetter-addresses-democratic-national-convention-on-workplace-equality-for-women/2012/09/04/6d3a6f8a-f6fc-11e1-a93b-7185e3f88849_story.html\">Lilly Ledbetter helping kick off</a> the Democratic National Convention this week, it's time voters focused more on this equally important front in the Republican war on women. </p> <p>Nearly 50 years after the passage of the <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/equalcompensation.cfm\">Equal Pay Act</a> \u2013 the civil rights-era law requiring that employers pay women the same as men for performing the same work \u2013 women are still losing out. American women who work full-time, year-round are paid <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-cant-afford-unfair-pay-today\">only 77 cents for every dollar paid</a> to their male counterparts. The <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/mapping-the-glass-ceiling/\">average college-educated man's annual salary maxes out at age 48 at $95,000</a>, whereas the average college-educated woman's does so at $60,000, at age 39. </p> <p>What do Republican party leaders propose we do about this persistent pay gap: a disparity that's unfair on its face and that <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-cant-afford-unfair-pay-today\">costs American families thousands of dollars</a> every year? Nothing. </p> <p>Take the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which makes it easier for women to challenge unequal pay by allowing them more time to file lawsuits against their employers. The act is named after aforementioned Lilly Ledbetter, a former Goodyear Tire manager who sued after finding out she was paid about $13,000 less per year than male colleagues doing the same work. Romney has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/mitt-romney-paul-ryan_n_1773193.html\">characteristically unclear on his stance</a> on the law, but running-mate Paul Ryan voted against the bill in 2009, along with more than 200 other Republican members of Congress. </p> <p>In June, Republicans united to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/politics/senate-republicans-block-pay-equity-bill.html\">block the Paycheck Fairness Act</a>, which would allow for punitive damages for pay discrimination and bar companies from retaliating against workers who inquire about pay disparities or discuss their pay with co-workers. You'd think such a libertarian ideal \u2013 protecting free speech \u2013 would be right up Paul Ryan's alley. But according to the Republican mentality, it seems the right to free speech only counts when it comes to corporate donors and fertilized eggs.</p> <p>Republican leaders aren't just opposed to explicitly pay-oriented policies; they also don't want to allow women with deflated paychecks to access more affordable healthcare. Romney and Ryan want to repeal Obama's healthcare law, which guarantees annual exams for women and mammograms for those over 40 at no additional cost. Ryan also <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/rep-paul-ryan-r-wi-profile.pdf\">voted to defund Planned Parenthood four times</a>, and his budget <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/womens-health-budget-1154.htm\">would eliminate funding for access to birth control</a>, and STD and cancer screenings, for low-income families. </p> <p>It's true that the equal pay laws we already have on the books \u2013 the Equal Pay Act, the Ledbetter Act and Title VII protections \u2013 are solid. But considering the size and persistence of the pay gap, it's clear that existing laws need to be strengthened and enforced, and more protections are needed for those who speak up about basic workplace fairness. </p> <p>Still, Republicans prefer to do nothing.</p> <p>Especially in a down economy, employees are afraid to point out problems at work for fear of being fired or otherwise retaliated against. In many workplaces, discussing pay is taboo; in some, it's grounds for termination.</p> <p>Employees' reticence to assert their rights likely explains why there were fewer cases charging sex-based wage discrimination last year than the year before the Ledbetter Act was signed, and why the wage gap <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/obama-pitches-equal-pay-to-win-women-even-as-charges-drop.html\">was slightly wider in 2010</a> than it was in 2007. Obama's EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) has also brought just six discrimination cases from 2009 to 2011 \u2013 one third the number it handled between 2006 and 2008.</p> <p>Distressingly, the gender pay disparity has barely budged in more than a decade, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-21/equal-pay-plaintiffs-burden-of-proof\">according to Bloomberg BusinessWeek</a>. It was about 40 cents to the dollar in the early 1960s, and narrowed quickly in the 1980s and early 90s. But it has shrunk by only four cents since 1994, and less than one cent since 2005, even as younger women caught up with and surpassed men in education. </p> <p>Republican leaders and their backers in the US Chamber of Commerce claim that laws like the Paycheck Fairness Act <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77069_Page2.html\">would lead to \"frivolous\" lawsuits</a>. But it's the job of the courts, not lobbyists, to decide which lawsuits should be allowed to move forward. Republicans also claim that Democrats were using the act as an election-year ploy to appeal to women. That's not much of an argument: if political opportunism results in better policy platforms and stronger laws, I'm all for it.</p> <p>Of course, the pay gap has a number of causes, and a single new law can't correct them overnight. Women are paid less because of discrimination by employers, because of the fact that women dominate lower-paying \"pink collar\" fields like education, caregiving and social service, and because of a lack of protections for women who take time off to give birth and care for a child. </p> <p>But entrenched problems call for creative solutions. Protecting workers who speak up about pay is one of them, and opening the floodgates to this kind of information-sharing would accelerate progress. Why not also require that employers disclose pay scales to bring transparency to compensation \u2013 which is too often based on biased or arbitrary decisions? </p> <p>The Republican party will have none of it. But as its candidates remain wilfully blind to pay disparities and possible solutions, they're creating a political gender gap that not even <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/ann-romneys-best-moments-2012-republican-national-convention-17101826\">Ann Romney's love</a> can close.</p>",
  "<p>Randu Nzai Ruwa is no stereotypical revolutionary. But the soft-spoken carpenter has a radical idea \u2013 he wants independence for Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, a paradise for visitors where locals live in poverty.</p> <p>Ruwa is the leader of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC), a secessionist group outlawed by the Kenyan government in 2010 but unbanned by the courts in July.</p> <p>He says the government is neglecting the region, and complains that jobs, land and resources go to outsiders from the rest of Kenya, known as <em>wabara</em>. \"We have been made slaves in our own land,\" Ruwa says in a scruffy, noisy room in Mombasa, the country's second-largest city.</p> <p>The movement is just the latest \u2013 in a continent splintered by separatist disputes, some longstanding, others more recent \u2013 to challenge the notoriously arbitrary borders drawn by European colonisers in the 1880s with little regard for ethnicity, culture and religion.</p> <p>From western Sahara and Casamance in west Africa to Puntland in Somalia and Matabeleland in Zimbabwe, Africa has more than 20 independence movements, some of which will have been encouraged by the recent experience of South Sudan, which broke away from Sudan last year.</p> <p>In post-Gaddafi Libya, the east around Benghazi is notably restive. Ethiopia has two long-running separatist movements in Ogaden and Oromia. Zanzibar, merged with Tanganyika almost 50 years ago into Tanzania, is now hearing Islamists call for a referendum on ending the union.</p> <p>Portrayed as a palm-fringed paradise in tourist brochures, Kenya's coast suffers from crippling poverty and unemployment. The region's wealth exacerbates frustrations: tourist resorts bring in millions of dollars each year and Mombasa's port is the gateway to east Africa for goods from around the world.</p> <p>Mombasa and the surrounding region have <a href=\"http://www.mombasainfo.com/about-mombasa/history-culture/history-of-mombasa/\" title=\"\">a distinct heritage</a> garnered from centuries of Arab trade and influence \u2013 the pungent smell of the spices traded centuries ago still perfume the Old Town's narrow winding streets.</p> <p>The Portuguese dominated the region for about 200 years from the late 15th century, before they were overthrown by the Omani Arabs, who then ceded control of the region to the British.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mombasa-Republican-Council-MRC/148508195220835\" title=\"\">council</a>, which says it has more than 2 million members, argues that the British protectorate should never have been integrated into Kenya at independence. Its Kiswahili slogan is <em>\"Pwani si Kenya\"</em> (\"the coast is not Kenya\").</p> <p>Ruwa believes the Mombasa region has a strong case for independence, backed by historical documents. Kenyan authorities say the documents are false.</p> <p>Although most analysts believe secession will never happen, they say Ruwa's movement could play a significant role as Kenya prepares for elections next March, five years after around 1,200 people were killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">in tribal violence after a disputed poll</a>.</p> <p>The organisation wants its supporters to boycott the March vote, and Ruwa says many of its people are losing patience. \"It is like a time bomb,\" he said. \"All the youth want to fight with the government \u2026 We are just cooling them down.\"</p> <p>Suleiman Shahbal, a businessman campaigning for election as Mombasa's governor, acknowledges the appeal of independence. \"A lot of people at the coast feel the electoral process has failed us \u2026 That has led to the frustration that you are now seeing epitomised by the MRC,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the most festering issues is land. Much of the best property at the coast is owned by people from other parts of Kenya \u2013 a result, the MRC says, of land-grabbing by Kenya's first president after independence, Jomo Kenyatta. The group says even the jobs created by the <em>wabara</em>, go to <em>wabara</em>.</p> <p>Kenyan officials have linked the separatists to militant groups such as Somalia's Islamist al-Shabaab. But Ruwa denies the allegations and a November 2011 <a href=\"http://www.kecosce.org/downloads/MRC_Conflict_Assessment_Threats_and_Opportunities_for_Engagement.pdf\" title=\"\">study of the movement</a> (pdf), by a researcher, Paul Goldsmith, found no evidence of an official armed wing \u2013 yet.</p> <p>\"The MRC is not armed but could easily become so in the future,\" Goldsmith wrote, adding there were reports of some units undergoing rudimentary military-style training.</p> <p>He also said some of the <em>wabara</em> were reportedly arming themselves. \"The potential for violence, however, should be viewed as largely independent of the MRC campaign \u2026 engaging the MRC is arguably one of the best opportunities for preventing bloodshed on the coast.\"</p> <p>In Mombasa, tensions are already rising. Take Ali, who is sitting in the shade in the middle of a Mombasa day, killing time because he has no job. \"There are so many people around the coast, especially the tribes of the coast, who are jobless,\" he said, declaring his support for independence. \"If you have 90% jobless, what's next?

Since the company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/12/bloc-liquidation-festival-cancellation\" title=\"\">entered voluntary administration on 10 July</a>, they explained, administrators at Parker Andrews have been investigating the causes of the festival debacle and working out how to \"deal with the fallout in the fairest way possible\".</p> <p>\"Anything we said publicly could have compromised their efforts,\" Base Logic said. \"As much as we wanted to reach out to everyone, we were told time and again that ultimately it would only harm this process.\"</p> <p>Now the investigation is complete, Base Logic said, the causes of the festival chaos are clear. <a href=\"http://www.dummymag.com/news/2012/07/07/bloc-2012\" title=\"\">Weather</a> was not the problem, nor insufficient staff. Base Logic did not oversell the event: Friday's ticket sales were below 16,000, well under the Pleasure Gardens' official capacity of 25,000.</p> <p>The principal issue, Bloc explained, was \"the management of the admission control systems\". Around 9pm, the area \"for queuing before tickets were checked became overcrowded\". Thereafter, the searching lanes were put under \"potentially dangerous pressure\" and at 9:27pm, \"following a breach of these lanes\", ushers stopped scanning tickets. Bloc wanted \"to ease the pressure\" in the queues, but consequently anyone off the street could hustle their way into the grounds. \"We'll never know exactly how many people did this,\" organisers said.</p> <p>These \"failures in admission control\", Base Logic says, were seriously exacerbated by delays, mistakes and unfinished work by the London Pleasure Gardens: \"In the run up to Bloc, much of the site remained unfinished, inaccessible or just closed altogether.\", Even by 6 July, lots of groundwork, venues and general infrastructure remained \"non-completed\", including two major stages. These conditions meant \"much of the festival ended up focused in the north-east corner of the otherwise massive 60,000 square metre site\".</p> <p>London Pleasure Gardens Ltd have since gone into administration, Base Logic observed. \"The venue had originally seemed like the perfect new home for Bloc,\" it said, \"so we're really sorry that everyone was let down \u2026 We cannot stress enough how sorry we are for this. We've learned from these experiences and have humbly taken on board the criticisms leveled at us.\"</p> <p>Ticket-holders can request a refund through their banks, Bloc said, and they have made forms available to facilitate this process. It is not clear whether there will be any future Bloc events: \"Thanks to those of you who have shown love and support,\" they wrote, \"and we hope to be in touch with you again soon.\"</p>",
  "<p>Just off the main road through West Jerusalem toward Bethlehem sits a prime but barren piece of real estate surrounded by luxury flats.</p> <p>It's the site of a future American embassy to Israel that, for nearly two decades, the US Congress has demanded be built immediately. But once American presidents begin navigating the minefield of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they quickly realise they don't need to add to their problems by shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv - a unilateral statement on the status of Jerusalem.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/democrats-forced-to-reverse-platform-language-on-jerusalem/2012/09/05/af23a672-f79d-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_blog.html\">Just how sensitive the issue of Jerusalem is was laid bare at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday</a> when, fearing accusations of not being pro-Israel enough, the party leadership hurriedly revived a clause in the platform from previous years proclaiming the city as the Jewish state's capital when much of the rest of the world withholds recognition. The DNC also said Jerusalem should be an \"undivided city\", while contradicting itself by adding that the issue is subject to negotiation with the Palestinians, who claim occupied East Jerusalem as their own capital.</p> <p>That's exactly what the Democratic party platform said when Barack Obama was elected in 2008. But as president, he has not done any more than his predecessors to act on the vexed issue of the embassy.</p> <p>It's a reflection of the split US stance toward Israel that Congress and political parties are given to highly partisan declarations of support for the Jewish state, driven by domestic politics and a powerful lobby, while presidents are forced to maintain the pretence of neutral arbiter in the diplomatic machinations that have failed to deliver an end to occupation and a free Palestinian state.</p> <p>At the heart of the fuss at the DNC is Israel's demand that the world recognise all of Jerusalem as its capital.</p> <p>Although it's evident that functionally the city is the Jewish state's capital, even close allies such as Britain say that to give formal recognition would be to legitimise the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem when talks with Palestinians are meant to decide its status, even if an agreement looks a distant prospect. So most countries, including the US, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv and generally speak about Jerusalem as the seat of the Israeli government.</p> <p>But the US Congress has taken a contrary position \u2013 in its enthusiasm to be as pro-Israel as possible. In 1995, the Republican-led Congress passed a law requiring the US embassy to be moved to Jerusalem by 1999. President Bill Clinton declined to do so as he attempted to shepherd Yasser Arafat and various Israeli leaders toward a deal. George W Bush attacked Clinton for it.</p> <p>\"As soon as I take office I will begin the process of moving the US ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,\" he told the pro-Israel lobby in 2000.</p> <p>The Republican party election platform made an explicit commitment to move the embassy. But once Bush was in the White House, he, too, failed to make the move.</p> <p>In 2008, as Barack Obama ran for president, the Democratic party platform said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The then presidential candidate said he recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But, like his predecessors, Obama has declined to act on the 1995 law in the face of other Middle Eastern realities, not least the repercussions in a changing Arab world.</p> <p>In July, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not be drawn on what the capital of Israel is. The US state department has for years fought lawsuits over its refusal to enter \"Jerusalem, Israel\" as a place of birth on American passports, even though Congress has passed a law saying it must.</p> <p>Sane diplomatic positions pertain while the future of the city remains unresolved. But now, it's election season \u2013 and what matters is the loyalty test.</p> <p>It's not clear how the routine commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as the Israeli capital got dropped from this year's Democratic party platform, but Obama was worried enough, not least about votes in knife-edge Florida which has a significant Jewish electorate, to intervene and get it reinstated.</p> <p>Mitt Romney \u2013 playing not only to part of the Jewish vote (which will mostly go to Obama), but as much to a larger Christian fundamentalist constituency solid in its support of Israel \u2013 quickly sought to capitalise on the debacle by again suggesting Obama is not truly committed. It's not the first time Romney has played the Jerusalem card. In June, he told CNN he would like to move the US embassy to the city. But the Republican presidential contender tried to give himself an out by saying that he \"would only want to do so and to select the timing in accordance with the government of Israel\". Well, Israel would like it to happen yesterday.</p> <p>If Romney is elected, he's not likely to shift from the position of his three predecessors, which is that it's not in the US's interest to move its embassy to Jerusalem any time soon. Which leaves congressional declarations, party commitments and the fleeting controversy over the Democratic platform as nothing more than noise \u2013 which is all about US politics, not Middle East peace.</p> <p>What that really highlights is the lack of any real discussion in this election of what needs to be done to reach an agreement on Jerusalem and bring about a Palestinian state.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this article will be on for 24 hours and may be turned off overnight</p>",

Barriers, such as a lack of financial incentives, might be to blame for the high turnover rate of senior civil servants he said.</p> <p>Former cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell's long-time mantra that \"to get out is to get on\" was meant to encourage civil servants to get experience of other sectors, which could then be used to enrich the civil service on their return. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/17/civil-servants-life-after-whitehall\" title=\"\">But have those words now taken a more literal turn?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/aug/13/dame-helen-ghosh-head-national-trust\" title=\"\">Dame Helen Ghosh</a> \u2013 one of Whitehall's foremost permanent secretaries \u2013 is moving from the Home Office to be director general of the National Trust in September, after 33 years in the civil service.

  "<p>\"This social phenomenon \u2013 in no way was it ever in existence in the past and in no way will it ever exist again,\" the American rock promoter <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Graham_%28promoter%29\" title=\"\">Bill Graham</a> told filmmaker Tony Palmer in 1975. \"I don't think we'll ever see this again \u2013 the adulation, the massness.\"</p> <p>He was talking about the phenomenon of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/ledzeppelin\" title=\"\">Led Zeppelin</a>, then the biggest band in the world. Coming from a man who, two years later, would suffer a notorious run-in with Led Zeppelin in Oakland, California, these were prescient words. For rock music never has surpassed the \"massness\" Zeppelin then enjoyed, a story told in my new oral history of the group, Trampled Under Foot.</p> <p>\"The legions of disenfranchised young American warriors had no outlet whatsoever,\" says the singer Michael Des Barres, whom Zeppelin signed to their Swan Song label. \"Led Zeppelin came along and gave them a hard-on like they'd never had before. Their lives became three chords and a stadium parking lot. There was no TMZ, no internet. There was just this incantation, this wailing to the gods.\"</p> <p>At a time when rock consists of little more than footnotes to the Big Bang that began with Presley and burned out with Cobain, it's hard to explain the scale of Led Zeppelin's 70s success except by framing it in terms of a kind of cult worship. Their final British gigs \u2013 two shows at Knebworth in 1979 \u2013 were watched by an estimated 200,000 people. But it was in the US where the cult of Zeppelin was at its deepest.</p> <p>\"America fell in love with Led Zeppelin because most people hadn't had the opportunity to see the Beatles,\" says Denny Somach, producer of <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Get-the-Led-Out-p193015/\" title=\"\">Get the Led Out</a>, a long-running Zeppelin segment that is syndicated on classic-rock radio across the States. \"Zeppelin became a religion.\"</p> <p>\"They redefined the 60s in the image of all teenagers for whom hippiedom was a cultural given rather than a historical inevitability,\" wrote Robert Christgau of the Village Voice. \"All the kids forced by economic reality and personal limitation \u2026 to settle for representation of power because the real power their older siblings pretended to was so obviously a hallucination.\"</p> <p>The music had something to do with their success, of course. After suffering critical scorn for much of their existence and then being forgotten for most of the 80s, only now are Zeppelin being embraced by pop snobs as the eclectic and mercurial unit they were. Guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboard player John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham were three of rock's most united, thrilling players, and Robert Plant the most frighteningly exciting hard rock singer who ever shrieked into a microphone.</p> <p>The critics didn't know, but the young boys understood. \"Zeppelin had this exotic otherworldly appeal,\" says Brad Tolinski, author of a forthcoming collection of interviews with Page. \"They took us out of our environment. But unlike prog rock, it had real balls to it.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XMn1a5Kp1No?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XMn1a5Kp1No\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMn1a5Kp1No\">Reading this on a mobile?

The psychic investment in Zeppelin as \"your overlords\" (to quote Immigrant Song) reflected rock's evolution from the boys-next-door Beatles to the orgiastic longhair communion of festivals like Woodstock.</p> <p>\"Led Zeppelin were both dangerous and spiritual,\" notes LA svengali-scenester Kim Fowley, a pal of the band's in their heyday. \"They get you with all that maudlin melancholy acoustic music from Wales, but then they have the Willie-Dixon-derived blues stuff going on at the same time.

Millions were convinced they heard satanic messages recorded backwards on the epic Stairway to Heaven. Jimmy Page's fascination with the writings of Aleister Crowley \u2013 he even bought Crowley's old mansion \u2013 proved irresistible to kids searching for dark magic in their anonymous suburban lives. His beguiling <a href=\"http://bradrants.com/blog/uploaded/BradRants/Images/Misc/ZeppelinFourSymbols.jpg\" title=\"\">ZoSo</a> symbol, seen on the sleeve of the band's huge-selling fourth album in 1971, became an iconic magnet for a generation.</p> <p>\"The children of ZoSo are Zep's legacy,\" wrote Donna Gaines, a sociologist and music writer. \"Mostly white males, non-affluent American kids mixing up the old-school proletariat values of their parents, mass culture, pagan yearnings and 60s hedonism.\"</p> <p>Stoking the mystery was the group's larger-than-life manager Peter Grant, who \u2013 knowing that word-of-mouth was the most potent marketing tool of all \u2013 consistently refused to release singles or allow the band to perform on television. \"[Peter] defended the band as though they were his only children in life,\" recalled the late Ahmet Ertegun, founder of Atlantic Records, the label that signed Zeppelin in 1968. \"He was a sensational manager \u2013 he built an aura of mystique around that group that still exists.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HQmmM_qwG4k?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HQmmM_qwG4k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQmmM_qwG4k\">Reading this on a mobile?

Even then they chose not to ape the social aspirations of their great rivals the Rolling Stones. Where Mick Jagger wanted Princess Lee Radziwill in his dressing room, Zeppelin's idea of glamour was the sixth floor of the Continental Hyatt (or \"Riot\") House on LA's Sunset Strip. Here they held court, mad dogs in the California sun attended by a retinue of drug dealers and underage groupies.</p> <p>\"I'd be on the road writing for the NME, and we'd check into the Hyatt and Zeppelin would be there,\" recalls Mick Farren. \"The whole place was full of the stinkiest fucking groupies. Keith Moon actually blew up hotel rooms, but with Zeppelin it just seemed to be running in semen and beer and unpleasantness.\"</p> <p>Los Angeles was where things began to unravel for Zeppelin and their heavy friends. The sheer depravity of their behaviour in the city \u2013 dangling people over balconies and chaining groupies to radiators \u2013 topped anything British bands had previously perpetrated in America. \"Something about Zeppelin's energy really altered the joie de vivre of the LA rock scene,\" says super-groupie Pamela Des Barres. \"They thought they could get away with anything \u2013 and they could.\"</p> <p>So where do you go from the top of the entertainment mountain? That's right, downhill \u2013 creatively, physically and morally. After 1975's Physical Graffiti, they were never the same creative force. Page sank into heroin addiction, Bonham into the chronic alcoholism that killed him \u2013 and thereby ended the group \u2013 in 1980.</p> <p>The group's last show on US soil followed the incident in Oakland. First a security guard, Jim Matzorkis, was attacked by John Bonham after a perceived slight against Grant's son, then Grant \u2013 aided by John Bindon, a psychopathic actor and semi-gangster recruited to the entourage \u2013 followed up, more brutally. The incident was hushed up, and Zeppelin left the city after charges were brought against four people, including Bonham and Grant.</p> <p>A day later, Robert Plant's five-year-old son Karac died from a respiratory infection, a devastating loss that almost made the singer walk away from music forever.</p> <p>As a narrative, Led Zeppelin's is an old fable: be careful what you wish for, and never fly too close to the sun. Plant survived to tell his tale and to blossom as a solo explorer. Jones always took the mega-success with a pinch of salt anyway. Only Page seems stuck in his past, surviving on a steady diet of awards shows and Classic Rock magazine covers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-cfc3rCQOuU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-cfc3rCQOuU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cfc3rCQOuU\">Reading this on a mobile?

  "<p>So Andy and Tracey Ferrie, the couple held by police for three days after using a shotgun against burglars at their rural home, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/05/couple-shooting-burglary-home-released\" title=\"\">are not to be prosecuted</a>. The tabloids rejoice and Chris Grayling, the new justice secretary, must be quietly relieved not to be drawn into a divisive (and tempting) controversy so early in his cabinet career.</p> <p>Newspapers like the Guardian and their readers tend not to get agitated by such cases, preferring to engage with those where more abstract features of the justice system are at stake \u2013 the rights of asylum seekers (not just a famous Julian Assange), or police abuse of procedure, including the use of firearms, against vulnerable people or suspected criminals.</p> <p>And rightly so. After PC Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter in the case of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor killed during the G20 protests in 2009, it emerged there had been a series of complaints about his behaviour (though most were found unproven). The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had initially declined to prosecute him until the findings of the pathologist Freddy Patel \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/23/tomlinson-pathologist-freddy-patel-struck-off\" title=\"\">who also has past form</a> \u2013 were discredited. Harwood is still a police officer. A thoroughly disquieting case.</p> <p>But, if it is right for the Guardian to be tenacious in such cases, is it wrong for the Daily Mail to be fierce in standing up for people who defend their homes against intruders, often at night in frightening circumstances? I think so. Indeed, I suspect that more people get excited about the unfairness of the Ferries' detention than do about, say, the rights of the Islamist cleric <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/09/abu-qatada-deportation-appeal-rejected\" title=\"\">Abu Qatada</a> not to be deported home to Jordan.</p> <p>The Ferries, who live in an isolated 200-year-old cottage at Welby outside Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, had been burgled several times before.</p> <p>No wonder the vigilante lobby stirs at times like this with complaints that the police are useless and the law biased against the law-abiding. It can feel like that when the cops appear to pick off easy targets to keep up their conviction rates and the CPS seems sloppy or supine.</p> <p>So when masked men burst in last weekend, Andrew Ferrie fired the shotgun, legally owned by his wife and kept in their bedroom, and injured one of the intruders in the hand. At Loughborough magistrates court on Wednesday, the injured man, Daniel Mansell, 33, pleaded guilty to burglary. He too has form for burglary, robbery and witness intimidation \u2013 he was released under probationary supervision last year after serving two years of a six-year sentence for a violent attack. Three other men were arrested.</p> <p>So far I am with the Ferries on this one, relieved only that the use of a weapon was effective, rather than being a prelude to a familiar tragedy in which the victims of a robbery who resist their assailants end up injured or dead. But it's a fine line. Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who fatally shot an intruder in the back as he fled, was jailed for murder, later reduced (rightly) to manslaughter, with five years in jail.</p> <p>Munir Hussain, the Buckinghamshire businessman who chased a burglar who had tied up his family and threatened them with a knife, caught him down the road and beat him with a cricket bat and metal pole. Hussain clearly overdid it. He must have been frightened and angry, but the intruder was no longer in his home. He got two and a half years, later reduced to a one-year suspended sentence. The burglar was not jailed either.</p> <p>David Cameron then promised a review of the law and routinely <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/811069-burglars-forfeit-human-rights\" title=\"\">repeats that pledge</a>.</p> <p>Last year the CPS decided that a Manchester man who fatally stabbed a machete-wielding burglar would not be prosecuted. The tabloids were pleased. But those such as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2198379/I-use-shotgun-burglar-I--law-side.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">the Mail's fiery pundit Simon Heffer</a> who argue that the government should clarify the law through legislation have a point.</p> <p>It's tricky and risky for government. Grayling must be tempted to make his name in tough law-and-order posturing, unlike his predecessor, Ken Clarke, who sensibly wondered why the prison population had almost doubled since he was last home secretary in 1993. It's very expensive, complained Ken, who is also an ex-chancellor.</p> <p>Alas, it doubled because Michael Howard, Tony Blair, David Blunkett and co engaged in a law and order bidding war. Crime has gone down, they all say. And it has, but for more complex reasons than locking up people, many of whom should not be there. It's not a message the tabloids want their readers to understand.</p> <p>Today's lurid reporting of the judge who said <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198621/It-takes-huge-courage-burgle-somebodys-house-What-judge-told-intruder-raided-homes-letting-walk-free-court.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">it must take a desperate kind of courage to burgle a stranger's house</a> illustrates the problem. All the usual media suspects picked up the story with glee and outrage.</p> <p>The Mail's account included comments from outraged victims of burglary. But even that account gives enough information to explain why Judge Peter Bowers said what he said when he gave Richard Rochford a 12-month suspended sentence (plus 200 hours' community service and drug rehabilitation) at Teeside crown court.</p> <p>The accused was an amateur with a drug habit and robbed two unlocked homes while their occupants slept. He had co-operated with police and stopped using drugs, the court heard. \"I think prison rarely does anyone any good,\" said the judge, though the papers note that he is not wholly consistent on this point. Well, that's human nature too, but he's more right than wrong about prison, where rehabilitation programmes become harder the more crowded the system is.</p> <p>Whether he was right to give Rochford a second chance, only time will tell. And we will probably only get to hear about it if he's proved wrong and the law and order tabloids have a chance to get excited all over again.</p> <p>Perhaps the election of police and crime commissioners across England and Wales on 15 November will enhance the quality of debate on this subject. Let's hope so, because respect for the police, their competence and commitment, is currently low in neglected rural areas as well as in some big cities.</p> <p>As French police struggle to solve the murders near smart Annecy in the Alps in the coming days we will get a useful comparator. Here's <a href=\"http://www.bunker8.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cjs/26903.htm\" title=\"\">one analysis</a> which reminds us how different the procedures are in otherwise similar countries. I hope the vigilante lobby is watching because I'm pretty sure our record in solving such murders is better than theirs.</p>",
  "<p>Despite its revival in the media as the potential source of all evil in the business world, corporate culture remains a concept that is difficult to define. The lack of a clear definition means some people use a vague notion of corporate culture as a scapegoat for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bp-oil-spill?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a>, or for potential cases of corruption like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/libor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the Libor scandal</a>.</p> <p>It is important to note that UK corporations may be convicted of manslaughter or even homicide under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/19/contents\" title=\"\">Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007</a>. Specifically, section 8(3)(a) states: <em>\"The jury may also consider the extent to which the evidence shows that there were attitudes, policies, systems or accepted practices within the organisation that were likely to have encouraged any such failure as is mentioned in subsection (2), or to have produced tolerance of it.\"</em></p> <p>The wording of this part of the law perhaps also reflects the way many people perceive the modern corporation. We tend to anthropomorphise businesses, treating them in the same way we treat our friends. If our friends \"betray\" us by not acting in the way we expect of them in terms of loyalty and honesty, we lose trust in them and may even cease to be friends. Similarly, if businesses engage in \"bad\" practices that do not follow some code of conduct that we, as a society, deem appropriate and acceptable, we discontinue our transactions with them.</p> <p>A number of surveys suggest that trust in business has been steadily declining in recent years because of major scandals, such as Enron, and the financial crisis itself. Yet in an era in which humans are for the first time having an adverse affect on the Earth's ecosystem, trust in business is a topic within the broader discussion of whether modern corporations will contribute to a resolution of the planet's most urgent and challenging problems.</p> <p>This is also an era in which the very notion of sustainability for corporations is extending beyond the economic domain; instead becoming the foundation of business models that synergistically generate social and environmental value, as well as economic. It does this by harnessing innovations that address the long-term needs and expectations of numerous stakeholders while trading-off short-term pressures.</p> <p>We would be suspicious of a person who behaves ethically and unethically at the same time, but we should understand that the case is different when we talk about corporations; especially for those that have embarked on a journey to become sustainable. To anthropomorphise corporate cultures \u2013 as we do for legal reasons \u2013 would be equivalent to demanding they do \"good\" things all the time. Yet what we need to accept is that companies, unlike individuals, can be \"good\" and \"bad\" at the same time.</p> <p>For example, there have been serious concerns raised about whether some of PepsiCo's products are linked to obesity and diabetes, yet the company has <a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/06/pepsico-stockholm-industry-water-award/\" title=\"\">cut its global water consumption by 16 billion litres</a> since 2006: an impressive achievement.</p> <p>So, is corporate culture like our friends? Well, in some ways it is. Friendships are based on trust and cultivated over time, requiring effort and investment. The same is true when deciding whether to trust a given corporate culture as a sustainable one. We need to understand that such cultures take time to emerge; they require the establishment of a strong foundation in the form of organisational governance, stakeholder engagement, longer-term horizons, transparency, accountability and trustworthy communication with constituencies.</p> <p>In the same way that our friends' characters evolve, corporate cultures also evolve and adjust, but they are susceptible to more errors, given the tremendous task of embedding and mobilising a diverse community of individuals. Accordingly, I would argue, they are entitled to be given a larger benefit of the doubt; particularly when they make significant effort to rectify past errors. <a href=\"www.globescan.com/commentary-and-analysis/featured-findings/228-positive-ratings-of-bp-as-environmentally-responsible-suggest-its-rehabilitation-is-underway.html\">Public opinion data</a> from GlobalScan suggests BP is gaining back some of its environmental reputation as a result of its response to the Deepwater Horizon spill.</p> <p>Of course, not all businesses are capable of establishing sustainable corporate cultures that allow us to trust them fully to be \"good\" all or even most of the time. But then again, we do get to choose who to trust as our friends, don't we? Even if they sometimes make mistakes.</p> <p><em>Ioannis Ioannou is assistant professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at London Business School</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>News International is trying to have a phone-hacking damages case involving Elle Macpherson's former adviser thrown out of court, 18 months after her claim was launched.</p> <p>Mary-Ellen Field, who acted as the model's financial adviser, faces a legal battle against the publisher of the now defunct News of the World, with a hearing listed for October.</p> <p>News International is applying for a summary judgment against Field and will argue for her case to be struck out on the grounds it has no legal merit.</p> <p>The move comes despite repeated claims by Field, unchallenged in public, that her life was destroyed after her phone was allegedly hacked by the News of the World.</p> <p>It is believed to be the first time News International has tried to have one of the numerous damages lawsuits relating to phone hacking struck out rather than settled. This could indicate a change in tack by News International parent company News Corporation, which has seen costs relating to the phone-hacking scandal, including legal bills, rise to $224m (\u00a3140m).</p> <p>Field's civil lawsuit for invasion of privacy was originally lodged in March 2011 but is awaiting a full trial date along with at least 50 other cases being managed by the high court judge, Mr Justice Vos.</p> <p>News International has decided it is going to challenge Field's case on the grounds that there is not enough evidence to substantiate her claims.</p> <p>News International and Field declined to comment.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/evidence/?witness=mary-ellen-field\" title=\"\">evidence to the Leveson inquiry</a>, Field said her reputation was \"trashed\" after MacPherson said she had leaked stories to the press.</p> <p>She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/22/leveson-inquiry-elle-macpherson-former-adviser\" title=\"\">recalled how in 2005</a> the model became concerned that Field was leaking stories to the press, although she denied this. Macpherson then proposed that Field go to rehab to treat an alcohol problem, even though she told the model that she hardly drank. However, Field agreed to go into rehab, believing she would lose her job if she did not.</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson, after hearing her evidence, said that \"all one can say is that you've correctly described your own position\" and that what had happened was \"not your fault\" and that she was \"collateral damage\".</p> <p>Field was one of more than 60 individuals who took legal action against News International last year in the first tranche of cases presided over by Vos at the high court.</p> <p>Almost all were settled, including claims by actors Jude Law and Steve Coogan, singer Charlotte Church, former deputy prime minister John Prescott, Sara Payne, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah, and Shaun Russell, whose wife and daughter were bludgeoned to death in a country lane in 1996.</p> <p>Field's case and that of Nicola Phillips, assistant to PR man Max Clifford, were held over for the second tranche of civil phone hacking cases, which now include at least 50 claims due to be heard next year.</p>",
  "<p>By the time the train arrived in Manchester at 5.50pm on Wednesday \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.africaexpress.co.uk/\" title=\"\">a collective of more than 80 musicians</a> on board their own specially chartered vehicle \u2013 one anxiety was that the evening's show would be too slick an affair. Previous Africa Express performances, dating back to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/sep/01/africa-express-glastonbury-video-2007\" title=\"\">a famous appearance at Glastonbury in 2007</a>, have been one-offs, whereas this time, the mutating cast of characters involved were on a proper tour, albeit one involving a novel form of transport between shows. This was day four, and as well as gigs in <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2012-09-03/damon-albarn-brings-africa-express-to-middlesborugh/\" title=\"\">Middlesbrough</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/9523652/Africa-Express-The-Arches-Glasgow-review.html\" title=\"\">Glasgow</a>, there'd been pop-up performances, including one on the platform of <a href=\"http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/carlisle-station-gig-for-damon-albarn-s-africa-express-1.987684?referrerPath=home\" title=\"\">Carlisle station</a> to an audience of startled tea-time commuters. It's not every day that the likes of Damon Albarn, Baaba Maal, Tony Allen, Carl Bar\u00e2t, Rokia Traor\u00e9 and the emerging Congolese star <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/26/jupiter-bokondji-africa-express-congo\" title=\"\">Jupiter Bokondji</a> descend anywhere to play a gig together, let alone one where the acts are half-hanging out of a locomotive carriage.</p> <p>Of course, with such a setup \u2013 and less than an hour and a half between arrival at Manchester's Victoria station and doors opening at the Ritz \u2013 there would always be room for improvisation and surprises. The four-hour show began with the Malian guitarist <a href=\"http://www.afelbocoum.com/\" title=\"\">Afel Boucoum</a> easing everyone into proceedings, before he was joined by Albarn, one of the founding figures of the enterprise. He discussed the distressing political situation in Mali briefly, but thereafter there were no messages or hectoring from the stage, simply a succession of different permutations of acts: the new singer <a href=\"http://www.kylalagrange.com/gb/home/\" title=\"\">Kyla La Grange</a> with Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, ngoni player <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/bassekoukouyate\" title=\"\">Bassekou Kouyat\u00e9</a> and producer Richard Russell, for instance; or former Libertines member Bar\u00e2t with Jon McClure of <a href=\"http://www.iamreverend.com/\" title=\"\">Reverend and the Makers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amadou-mariam.com/\" title=\"\">Amadou Bagayoko</a>, the latter striking Jimi Hendrix-style poses on a thrilling cover of the Clash's Train in Vain; or Albarn with former Fela Kuti drummer Allen for a version of an old Wings song \u2013 as if things couldn't be stranger.</p> <p>It became a bit like the musical equivalent of fantasy football: the South African <a href=\"http://www.spoekmathambo.com/\" title=\"\">Spoek Mathambo</a> has released a cover of Joy Division's Control, and here was that band's Peter Hook joining him on stage. With his bass, as ever, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peterhook.jpg\" title=\"\">slung so as to scrape his knees</a>, Hook might be instantly recognisable, but there was no emphasis on star power, making it very different from a normal gig; and in its first couple of hours it felt a bit stop-start. But like a train, it built up an unstoppable momentum, taking the crowd on a true journey.</p> <p>\u2022 The Guardian is the tour's media partner.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Recent comment and news - see the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/teacher-network/2012/jul/21/secret-teacher-behaviour-management\">Secret Teacher</a> and the Guardian story on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/25/primary-school-suspensions-assaults-rises \">levels of school exclusions</a> - has made me realise how stuck the debate on developing children's good behaviour in schools has become. </p> <p>Teachers are judged by how strict they are. Everyone who has been to school thinks they are an expert and many policies are based on half-baked ideas about emotional intelligence and reptile brains.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a00192714/school-exclusion-statistics-for-200910\">thousands of children</a> are not going to school, teachers are under <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/inthenews/a00200711/great-teachers-could-become-master-teachers\">increasing pressure</a> to command their students to behave, and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13176049\">parents are blamed</a> for not being good role models.</p> <p>I am reminded of my first job as a teacher working in a school in an area of severe economic deprivation. After four or five years I'd learned a wide range of behaviour management strategies based on rewarding good behaviour and punishing bad. I used stickers, golden time, time out, three strikes, red and yellow cards. This worked quite well with most of the children, however there were some who continued to disrupt my class and challenge my teaching. In particular one boy (I'll call him Kyle) was really difficult to reach. I tried everything I knew but things got worse, including his violence to teaching staff and children. The situation became so bad it looked as if he would have to be excluded.</p> <p>This is a familiar situation in many schools, where excluding children becomes almost obligatory to protect the staff and other students and is reflected in the consistent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jul/25/primary-school-suspensions-assaults-rises\">levels of temporary and permanent exclusions</a> in English primary schools.</p> <p>Once I'd run out of ideas with Kyle all I could do was repeat my repertoire. This was even less successful second time round and he had to be removed from class more often, giving us respite in the short term but doing little to change things for the better. I realised the strategies I was using put Kyle and others like him in a position where they required continuous direction from adults. As a result, children saw themselves as helpless, as the victims of their own behaviour. I could hear them saying things like, \"I can't help it, I'm just naughty\".</p> <p>In the end I was stuck. Not willing to give up on Kyle and with the unfailing support of my headteacher (who had never excluded a child) I decided to try a completely different approach. </p> <p>A couple of years before, I'd met <a href=\"http://solution-support.co.uk/\">Geoff James</a>, a local authority specialist support teacher who was looking into behaviour support for his PhD. We invited him into school to work with me and Kyle. </p> <p>Geoff was working with children at high risk of permanent exclusion, using an inquiry-based approach focused towards solutions rather than problems. Originally developed by Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg for family support, the approach had a clear structure and Geoff advised me to start by talking to Kyle about something he was already doing successfully. Here's an example of one of our conversations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Tell me about something that's going well for you Kyle?\" <br>\"Football\"<br>\"How come it's going well?\"<br>\"Because I practice every day.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We continued this problem-free talk for a while, with me giving Kyle feedback on his strengths and qualities, \"it seems like you keep practicing even when you're tired. Is that right?\"</p> <p>I then used this platform of success-talk to widen the conversation to include school. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"What's your best hope for school Kyle?\"<br>\"To be friends with the others in class so I can play football with them.\"<br>\"On a scale, where 10 is you playing football with the others and 1 is you not playing with them at all, where are you right now?\"<br>\"3\"<br>\"Where would you like to be?\"<br>\"10\"<br>\"Suppose you were at 10, what would people notice about you that was different?\"<br>\"Me and the other children would be smiling and enjoying ourselves.\"<br>\"And how might that happen?\"<br>\"I'd notice if I was getting angry and stop myself blowing up by walking away.\"<br>\"What would you do if you were in class \u2013 where would you go?\"<br>\"Under the table.\"<br>\"Mmm, that might distract other children, do you think?\"<br>\"Yeah. What about if the table was just outside the classroom?\"<br>I said it would be alright if I knew he was safe there. \"When would you come back into class?\"<br>\"When I stop being angry.\"<br>\"How long would that take?\"<br>\"About five minutes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Kyle was as good as his word. Over the next few weeks whenever he started to get angry he would leave the classroom and sit under the table. I let everyone know this was agreed and they left him alone. In often less than five minutes, he would come back into class to work. We continued to meet fairly regularly and when things went wrong - which they did occasionally - I'd ask him what he might do to make them better.</p> <p>Working in this way with Kyle transformed our relationship. We learned to work together and to trust each other. Kyle began to relax in class and became more focused on his learning. The other children relaxed too and Kyle's violent outbursts disappeared. He started going out to play and eat his lunch and play football with the other children. A big change. In two months he didn't stand out from his classmates at all. </p> <p>Was this remarkable change permanent? Kyle is 17 now, I am still in touch with him and I know he is doing fantastically well at A level. </p> <p>Since that time with Kyle, 10 years ago, I've been using this solution focused approach in my classroom and it works time and time again, with all kinds of children, with all kinds of background, in all kinds of situations. Similarly, Geoff has continued to use the approach in educational support services with amazing success.</p> <p>Kyle's case is evidence of an approach to children's behaviour that recognises the child as a reflective and resourceful agent of change. In my experience this approach can be more effective than problem focused methods. It's more effective at keeping children in school, at reducing stress in children and adults, and in developing successful learners. It can also be a lot cheaper.</p> <p>Maybe now is the time to rethink our attitudes towards 'good' and 'bad' children and to utilise approaches like this based on evidence of improved outcomes. We shouldn't give up on thousands of children who don't respond well to what we've done in the past. We can work in new ways that support them and help them be the best they can become.</p> <p><em>Tim Taylor is a primary school teacher working in east of England and editor of <a href=\"http://www.mantleoftheexpert.com/\">Mantle of the Expert</a>.</em></p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.solution-support.co.uk\">Dr Geoff James</a> is a specialist support teacher working for a local authority school support service.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>The nationalist victor in the Quebec elections was preparing for government on Thursday under the shadow of a police investigation into the murder of a man at the party that celebrated her win.</p> <p>More details were emerging about the background of Richard Henry Bain, the 62-year-old who was due to make his first court appearance in Montreal in connection with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-elections-parti-quebecois-minority?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">gun attack on Tuesday night</a>.</p> <p>Chaos broke out at the Metropolis concert hall minutes after Pauline Marois, the leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, had begun her victory speech. One man died and another was critically injured \u2013 both were outside and were shot as the gunman tried to enter the hall. Marois was bundled off stage by her bodyguards.</p> <p>A vigil was held on Wednesday night outside the hall, in memory of the man who died. The tragedy has diverted attention away from the substance of the result, which put Marois at the head of what will almost certainly be a weak, minority administration.</p> <p>Marois come to power at the end of a divisive election campaign. But while the PQ fought partly on a platform based on sovereignty for Quebec and the primacy of the French language, the election also took place against the backdrop of ongoing student protests against tuition fee hikes.</p> <p>The election came after months of unrest, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/23/montreal-protesters-tuition-fees-bill-78\" title=\"\">striking students clashed with riot police on an almost daily basis</a>.</p> <p>Marois said she intends to stick by her campaign promise to reverse the tuition fee rises and abolish Law 78, a hated piece of legislation that places restrictions on the right to protest. Speaking at a press conference in Montreal on Wednesday, she said: \"My government will cancel fees rise by decree. Law 78 will therefore no longer be needed. I intend to propose its repeal and I am convinced that the opposition parties will agree. We will then have a summit on higher education.\"</p> <p>Though this is a huge victory for the student movement, it remains to be seen whether she will be able to form a coalition or convince the opposition to respect these promises.</p> <p>Her PQ party only beat the Liberals by a thin margin of 30,000 votes, with 54 candidates elected out of 125, on 32% of the popular vote. She will form a cabinet and lead a minority government at the National Assembly in the next two weeks, but it will be one of the weakest provincial governments in Canada, dashing her party's hopes for an independence referendum for Quebec any time soon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after a humiliating defeat in his own district, former Liberal party leader Jean Charest announced to Quebec's parliament that he was resigning from politics. \"I will leave my job in the next few days. After 28 years of public life, it is time for me to take another step, turn the page,\" he said, his voice choking with emotion.</p> <p>Charest's resignation set social media alight with students and supporters of the Quebec \"printemps erable\" seeing it as the definitive sign that students had won the battle against the tuition fee hike, or at least that they would hold important political leverage after taking down two education ministers and the prime minister.</p> <p>J\u00e9r\u00e9mie B\u00e9dard-Wien, the finance secretary of Classe, the militant student organisation at the forefront of the strike, told the Guardian that the student movement was celebrating three major victories: the cancellation of the tuition hikes, the repeal of Law 78 and the resignation of Charest.</p> <p>B\u00e9dard-Wien said the victory was the result of \"a wave of popular mobilisation that happened through the spring\". He expressed confidence that Marois would keep her promises because \"the PQ fears further strikes\".</p> <p>But he said the struggle against tuition hikes was not over. \"In the next few months, students will have to face a proposed indexation of tuition fees to the cost of living, a measure which does not take into account the reality of students. This vision runs counter to ours and we can expect further mobilisation, further strikes and further direct action.\"</p> <p>As well as the repeal of measures linked to the tuition fee rises, Marois plans to prevent construction firms convicted of corruption from getting contracts, to expand affordable daycare services for old people, increase the royalties on natural resources, as well as expand the reach of Law 101, the language law that asserts the dominance of French in the province and which deeply disturbs the minority English-speaking community in Quebec. Marois insisted she would \"protect\" Anglophone residents in Quebec.</p> <p>At her press conference, Marois expressed sympathy for the family of the man who was killed at her victory rally. But she denied it was linked to the divisiveness of her campaign. \"A man is dead for no reason. Madness has struck,\" she said. Visibly shaken by the fatal shooting that interrupted her victory speech the night before, Marois said: \"Quebec is a non-violent society. A single act of madness cannot erase this fact.\"</p> <p>Marois called it an isolated incident that did not represent the Quebecois people or bear any relation to the tone and style of her campaign. She urged people not to jump to conclusions, and said: \"This is a probably the case of someone with grave mental health issues.\"</p> <p>Police said Bain, 62, was from near Mont Tremblant, a small town in the Laurentian mountains about 80 miles north-west of Montreal. It was not clear whether he was an English or French speaker \u2013 an important detail after a bitter election campaign fought on cultural and language issues. There are reports that, when he was arrested, he declared: \"The Anglophones are waking up.\"</p> <p>Marois said she did not fear for her own security after being taken backstage where she could see a fire and an injured man, but rather worried what would happen if the crowd in the concert hall brimming with enthusiasm suddenly panicked. \"I asked my bodyguard to be back on stage because I was afraid for the crowd \u2013 we were so many in the meeting. I asked them to go outside slowly.\"</p> <p>The dead man was named as Denis Blanchette, 48, a lighting technician who was smoking in the alleyway outside the hall, waiting for the event to end so he could take down the rig. He was shot as the gunman opened fire outside.</p> <p>David Courage, 27, a musician, was shot and critically injured. Police dragged him inside the hall to treat him. Witnesses say after the two were shot, the gunman's weapon jammed and he was tackled by police.</p> <p>Local media in Montreal identified Bain as the <a href=\"http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Election+night+shooting+suspect+keen+expand+Laurentian+fishing+camp/7194966/story.html#ixzz25ebrLvIm\" title=\"\">owner of a fishing camp on the shores of Lake Wade in La Conception</a>, near Mont Tremblant in the Laurentian mountains. The camp offers fishing, helicopter trips and truck rides.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Even after the taunts and threats for appearing on TV, and whispered criticism of \"immodest\" outfits, the attack on actor sisters Areza and Tamana, and their friend Benafsha, came as a surprise.</p> <p>The trio were minutes from moving out of a neighbourhood in which conservative locals had made them feel unwelcome, walking to meet a minivan full of their possessions, when six men surrounded them in a lane, lined with high-walled compounds. They left Benafsha bleeding to death outside a mosque with stab wounds, and the injured sisters desperately seeking help.</p> <p>\"I didn't see the TV programme, I just heard the local boys saying that one of them played a role with boys,\" said Yaqin Ali Khalili, owner of a shop that the women frequented. \"The hatred of the people here is the reason she was killed, I am 100% sure,\" he added.</p> <p>Word travels fast in Kabul, and in a couple of days other actresses were being intimidated. One prominent young actress, Sahar Parniyan, received death threats and has gone into hiding. On the rare occasions she still ventures out she has to wear the burqas she used to despise. \"The threats were in calls at midnight, or 2am when I was deep asleep, using very bad words and repeating 'you will be next for assassination',\" Parniyan told the Guardian in an interview at a secret location. \"I cannot continue my life as an actress in Afghanistan, although I love my job. The Taliban are against women, but so are other groups \u2026 Afghanistan is not made for women, whether actresses or not.\"</p> <p>The killing and death threats have fuelled fears that conservative pressures are shrinking opportunities for women in public roles.</p> <p>Tamana had performed in the Emrooz television show, which sparked the most recent abuse, and her sister Areza had taken at least one small role, using the screen name Sadaf, in a popular satirical series, The Ministry, in which Parniyan also acts, according to its director. But although they survived the assault that killed their friend, they are now awaiting another kind of punishment.</p> <p>After a few hours in hospital for treatment, they were taken to prison, where they face intrusive virginity tests and possible charges of prostitution or collusion in the attack. \"We have already sent them to the forensic office to do an examination, to make clear whether these girls are having illegal relations with anyone,\" said prosecutor Ghulam Dastegir Hedayat, responsible for western Kabul, where the killing took place.</p> <p>Acting is controversial for women in Afghanistan, tied up in many minds \u2013 as it once was in the west \u2013 with prejudices. \"She was quite silent, but a good girl,\" Parniyan said of Areza, whom she met during filming for The Ministry. \"In the eyes of society though, she was a bad girl, and I am a bad girl too.\"</p> <p>Perhaps because of this, the sisters hid their part-time careers. \"They told us they did laundry in the city. We didn't know they were actresses,\" said Nasreen Amaninejad, mother of the family who rented them the room in Karte Seh. But the three women were vulnerable without any known male relatives. The sisters are orphans from the north. Benafsha was divorced and had apparently severed contact with her birth family, and the one she married into. No one has been in touch about her death, police and prosecutors say.</p> <p>\"Women living in a house together without male relatives is very unusual and the police and neighbours all seem to imagine that in a situation like that they are running a brothel,\" said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. \"We came across quite a few cases where behaviour that the police didn't approve of seems to have turned into a crime and a long prison sentence. And certainly any woman who is not under the control of or vouched for by a husband or male family member is deemed immoral.\"</p> <p>The sisters, instead of seeing their attackers jailed, may face years in prison for \"moral crimes\". While police and prosecutors claimed the women were not attacked for being actors, they suggested the assault was prompted by their work and living arrangements. \"The result of our investigation is that she was not killed because they work in television, the six people who killed her were threatening the group one or two days before with the aim of getting them to agree to illegal relations,\" said Hedayat, the prosecutor.</p> <p>A senior police officer involved in the case also believed the women were probably attacked for refusing sex, and pointed to their lack of education as evidence they were prostitutes \u2013 even though he is a commander in a force where more than three-quarters of new recruits are illiterate. \"To feed themselves they have to find money. Where do they get it from?\" said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"This wasn't a people's attack on them, it was just something between some groups and the women \u2026 when there is a request to the females and they refuse, this kind of thing happens.\"</p>",
  "<p>Flannery O'Connor's stories plough a straight and often gory furrow from individual pride to disaster. Writing the way she did \"because (not though) I am a Catholic\", she described A Good Man is Hard to Find, the first of her two story collections, as \"nine stories about original sin, with my compliments\". This religious flavour, coupled with the great economy of her prose, and a tendency to focus on two characters inextricably and antagonistically tied to one another, might have made parables of her stories. But the unruly life she invests them with, not to mention her deliciously skewed sense of humour, stops them attaining the clearly defined edges of the purely instructional. \"As with the work of any profound artist,\" <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1979/may/03/flannery-oconnors-gifts/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">Robert Towers</a> notes, \"an element of the mysterious \u2013 of the unspoken, the unacknowledged \u2013 hangs like a shining mist over all that has been consciously intended and consciously achieved.\"</p> <p>The English professor <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/19/local/me-passings19.1\" title=\"\">Walter Sullivan</a> once compiled a bloody catalogue. Of the 19 stories published in O'Connor's short lifetime (she died from a kidney infection in 1964 at the age of 39, having been diagnosed with lupus in 1950), nine end in one or multiple violent deaths, three in physical assault, one in arson, and two in theft. O'Connor's tongue was in her cheek when she said, \"I can't write about anything subtle\", but she knew a good joke has its roots in the truth. Her stories are baldly dramatic, and the Georgia she creates on the page \u2013 as individual a landscape as any in fiction \u2013 is summoned with few, very bold strokes. The sun is \"a huge red ball \u2026 drenched in blood\", a \"furious white blister\", a \"white hole like an opening for the wind to escape through in a sky a little darker than itself\". The \"fat yellow moon\" is seen in the branches of a fig tree \"as if it were going to roost there with the chickens\". O'Connor so loads her brush with pathetic fallacy that her landscape is alive, the scene nearly always hemmed in by lines of watching trees or woods that gape \"like a dark open mouth\".</p> <p>The figures she plants in this landscape \u2013farmhands, conmen, embittered intellectuals, bigots, Bible salesmen and killers \u2013 are equally vivid, and the situations they encounter yet more so. Speaking of the disjunction between her Catholic convictions and what she saw as her largely godless readership, O'Connor wrote that \"[w]hen you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little and use more normal means of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock \u2013 to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures.\" The most famous example of this approach, O'Connor's quintessential story, is \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" (1953), in which a family encounter the gang of an escaped convict, The Misfit, in the Georgia backwoods. As O'Connor has it, the story's meaning resides in a moment of grace enacted when the grandmother, up until the conclusion of the story solely foolish and self-serving, touches The Misfit's shoulder and tells him,</p> <blockquote> 'Why you're one of my babies. You're one of my own children!' She reached out and touched him on the shoulder. The Misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. </blockquote> <p>It's an indelible moment, yet despite O'Connor's own explanation it is interpretable in many different ways. O'Connor's ability to create characters and situations that resonate as powerfully as they do results in meanings that, as she herself acknowledged, ramify beyond authorial intention. A parable only possesses its surface meaning and actual meaning, but O'Connor's most accomplished stories can seem to point in all sorts of directions at once. Elizabeth Bishop succinctly captured this paradoxical trait when she pointed out that \"[y]ou'd have to call 'A Good Man is Hard t\u00dfo Find' a 'funny' story even though six people are killed in it\".</p> <p>But if the potential meanings of O'Connor's stories are numerous and plastic, their internal logic is singular and concrete. O'Connor is so sedulous an observer of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun\" title=\"\">Chekhov's gun rule</a> that if a family discusses a newspaper story about a killer on the loose, there is no doubt that he'll massacre them; if a bull is roaming the fields, its horn will soon be buried in someone's gut (\"Greenleaf\"); if a grandfather has bred his own obstinacy into a beloved granddaughter, he will beat her to death when she is obstinate towards him (\"A View of the Woods\"). The inexorability of O'Connor's plots can, as in these cases, invest her stories with the awful power of Greek tragedy, and indeed before giving readings of \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" she'd say that, \"like the Greeks you should know what is going to happen in this story so that any element of suspense in it will be transferred from its surface to its interior\". If someone's first experience of O'Connor was \"The Displaced Person\" (1954), at the denouement of which three people passively watch a tractor roll down a slope and crush a fourth, the event would be unexpected and shocking. But the story is arguably more powerful when a familiarity with O'Connor's work makes this ending an awaited inevitability. The tangible menace that her stories exude isn't about \"what\", but \"when\".</p> <p>When her control is less certain, as in \"A Stroke of Good Fortune\" (1949) or \"A Late Encounter with the Enemy\" (1953), such an approach can seem a gimmick, calamity arriving like the punchline to a poor joke. Failures like this explain why some critics consider O'Connor's art brilliant but narrow and predictable. But such instances are in the minority, and the late stories \"Revelation\" (1964) and \"Parker's Back\" (1965), suggest her talent was only deepening as her life ended. It's tempting to wonder what she might have done with more time, not least to see how the \"Christ-haunted\" South of her fiction would have been altered by the Civil Rights Act, passed a month before she died. Her position on race was ambivalent, but I tend to agree with Hilton Als that she was \"not romantic enough to take Faulkner's Disney view of blacks \u2013 as the fulcrum of integrity and compassion. She didn't use them as vessels of sympathy or scorn; she simply \u2013 and complexly \u2013 drew from life\". That same collision of the simple and the complex is what lies at the heart of her best work, a tight compact of the bold, the startling, and the mysterious.</p> <p><strong>Next:</strong> Frank O'Connor</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday I watched Evgenii Shvetcov from Russia win the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/04/paralympics-2012-paul-blake-silver?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Men's 400M T36</a>, narrowly beating the man I was cheering on \u2013 Team GB's Paul Blake \u2013 into second place. But any disappointment I felt suddenly disappeared when, seconds after crossing the finish line, Shvetcov looked into the TV camera and used sign language to communicate a message to people watching back home.</p> <p>This may seem disloyal to these shores, but if I'd known Shvetcov was deaf, I'd have been cheering him on from the start. There are deaf athletes who have competed in the Olympics and Paralympics at London 2012, but they're few and far between. Another separate disability is required for them to compete in the Paralympics because, remarkably, there is no category for deaf athletes.</p> <p>In this country, deaf athletes have for a few years now been the poor cousins in funding terms. The Guardian's Datablog identified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jul/26/london-2012-olympics-money\" title=\"\">total spending of \u00a311bn</a> on London 2012 (\u00a39bn from the government, and \u00a32bn budgeted by Locog), while UK Sport has been spending more than \u00a3100m per annum on Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes. In the context of those sums, \u00a342,000 seems minuscule, but it's the amount of funding that <a href=\"http://www.uksport.gov.uk/news/1991/\" title=\"\">UK Deaf Sport used to receive annually</a> from the government. When this sum was withdrawn in 2008, with then sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe claiming this was to focus funding on athletes competing in the Beijing and London games, it <a href=\"http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/living/sport/uk-deaf-sport-in-funding-crisis\" title=\"\">put deaf athletes' participation</a> in the Taipei Deaflympics 2009 in jeopardy.</p> <p>If you're wondering what the Deaflympics are, then take a look at Tuesday's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/09/what_are_the_deaflympics.html\" title=\"\">BBC Ouch! interview</a> with Craig Crowley, the president of the International Committee of Sport for the Deaf. As the name implies, the Deaflympics are for deaf athletes; they were first held in 1924. Not only do the Deaflympics use adapted technology to suit deaf people (think visual cues, like a light being used instead of a starting gun, or a referee's whistle being replaced by a flag), sign language is the prime method of communication among the majority of athletes and spectators. Crucially, the Deaflympics bring together athletes who have faced similar communication barriers, and allow them to compete on a level playing field.</p> <p>While the Olympics and Paralympics enjoy massive funding, the Deaflympics has a much lower mainstream profile. The games in Tapei in 2009 were a success, but in 2011, disaster struck when the 17th Winter Deaflympics in Slovakia was cancelled at the last minute, with the sole organiser <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/deaflympics-the-rubbish-tycoon-and-the-games-that-were-dumped-2266957.html\" title=\"\">accused of embezzling \u00a311m</a>.</p> <p>There are hopes that the upcoming 2015 and 2017 winter and summer games will get the Deaflympics back on track, but on the biggest stage of all, at London 2012, deaf athletes have once again been mere spectators. When you see the success of team games featuring blind athletes or wheelchair users, it's hard not to wonder why we can't watch, for example, teams of deaf football and hockey players competing against one another. Deaf footballer Claire Stancliffe told me: \"We missed out on London 2012 in many ways. The facilities are fantastic, the support for GB athletes was out of this world and it was an opportunity for deaf sports to be showcased to millions. It would have changed people's perceptions.\"</p> <p>Crowley has pointed out that since 2001, Paralympians have enjoyed access to the same venues, transportation and technology as Olympians. However, Deaflympians have not been offered the same opportunity. He <a href=\"http://limpingchicken.com/2012/07/17/craig-crowley-mbe-my-personal-thoughts-about-the-olympic-paralympic-games-in-london-2012/\" title=\"\">has also gone on record</a> as saying that he believes \"the only way to gain visibility for deaf athletes is to work alongside the Olympics and Paralympics\", and he hopes that deaf sport \"will be the surprise\" of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. However, the process towards achieving some level of deaf sports at those games is complex. For example, Crowley told me, because the International Paralympic Committee has \"no mechanism to bring in a new disability, they would need to add a new classification to allow for deaf athletes\".</p> <p>In the meantime, the scarcity of deaf athletes at the games represents a massive missed opportunity. <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/athlete/tan-laurentia-5503261/\" title=\"\">One of the rare exceptions is Laurentia Tan</a>, a profoundly deaf equestrian and London 2012 Paralympic Games silver and bronze medal winner who also has cerebral palsy. However, another athlete I saw showed how deafness isn't taken into consideration at the games. The British athlete Olivia Breen, who has cerebral palsy and came fifth overall <a href=\"http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/other-sport/athletics/breen-delighted-with-fifth-spot-1-4218860\" title=\"\">in the 100m T38</a>, also wears hearing aids. When she didn't hear a false start being called in the first round, the rest of the field stopped, but she continued sprinting to the end of the track. Fortunately, the race was postponed for an hour to enable her to recover before running again, but it's hard to imagine this happening at a Games that included deaf athletes and was more aware of their needs.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, we've seen triumphs by sports men and women from across the world, from a wide range of backgrounds, of abilities and disabilities. Let's hope by the time the next Games come along, more athletes with signing hands, hearing aids and amazing lipreading skills are able to write \u2013 or sign \u2013 their own compelling narratives for the world to see.</p>",

Functional layouts</strong> </p> <p>To Western audiences, accustomed to more art-directed and visually rich, interactive websites, these sites can appear to be quite spartan and text-driven.</p> <p>However, this predominance of text over richer content is already present <a href=\"http://en.kiosko.net/jp/np/asahi_shimbun.html\">in their print versions</a>, and there are other sectors which thrive in more <a href=\"http://www.sal.ne.jp/\">creative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hokusai.gr.jp/\">artistic</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ffffff.jp/\">subtle</a> designs \u2013 overall the Japanese feel perfectly comfortable with mostly text news information. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988344\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347297861494/print-asahi.png\" alt=\"Asahi newspaper screenshot\" width=\"460\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front page of the Asahi newspaper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>Japanese news sites predominantly carry only headlines, date of publication and an icon that marks the type of content.

From WAP to app</strong></p> <p>Japan was a world leader in the development of the mobile platform under WAP, and these sites are clearly optimised for fast rendering in smaller screens for quickly jumping between links. All three papers have mobile optimised versions, and they also offer apps for mobile, tablet and Facebook, along with Kindle versions and special packages (included as bundles with some mobile operators), as well as having premium services. </p> <p>If we pick one example per site:<br>- <a href=\"http://premium.yomiuri.co.jp/html/pc/index.html\">Yomiuri premium</a>: a paying service with exclusive features like mobile alerts, scrapbook to read later, storing by news by keyword, exclusive offers to subscribers.</p> <p>- <a href=\"http://www.mainichi.co.jp/tap-i/about/\">Mainichi tap-i</a>: an app with selected content laid out in a visually rich magazine-style layout for tablets and apps, on both iOS and Android platforms.</p> <p>- <a href=\"http://digital.asahi.com/info/functions/index.html\">Asahi</a> this page details all of the different combinations of content and platform to choose from \u2013 they're all paid-for, customised options. </p> <p>As for the Guardian, it currently offers a mobile version, and a suite of apps from an iPad version to crossword apps across mobile platforms, as well as some apps for smart TVs.</p> <p><strong>3. Regional focus</strong><br>Perhaps the feature I find most interesting is their emphasis on breakdown of news by region (<a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/e-japan/\">Yomiuri</a>, <a href=\"http://mytown.asahi.com/\">Asahi</a>, <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/area/\">Mainichi</a>). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009623304/Aviary_mainichi-jp_region.png\" alt=\"Mainichi region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mainichi regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as the print newspapers have customised content and sections for each of Japan's 47 prefectures, their websites feature a 'region tab' very prominently in the top menu which directs users to a map 'chooser' for the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988347\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009653012/Aviary_mytown-asahi-com_region.png\" alt=\"Asahi region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"227\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asahi regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This seems like a good solution to manage local within a national scope and reflects the population's trust in the media to keep them informed of the events in their everyday life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009678344/Aviary_yomiuri-co-jp_regions.png\" alt=\"Yomiuri region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"524\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yomiuri regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, they all offer a more concise, less cluttered version of their news in English for an international audience (<a href=\"http://ajw.asahi.com/\">Asahi</a>, <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/english/\">Mainichi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/\">Yomiuri</a>). </p> <p>Recently, the Guardian experimented with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local\">hyperlocal sections</a> and has some keywords for cities and counties.</p> <p><strong>4. Advertorials</strong></p> <p>A quite unique characteristic of Japanese websites is the greater mixture of sponsored and editorial content. </p> <p>Sprinkled throughout the page and not confined to the now-increasingly invisible right hand column or the bottom of the page, they appear in the middle of the content, in between headlines and sometimes without special typography or colours to make them stand out from the editorial content, although many are marked with \"<em>PR</em>\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347299156136/yomiuri-ads.png\" alt=\"yomiuri site ad regions\" width=\"460\" height=\"1670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biggest ad blocks on the home page of yomiuri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>This is in line with Japanese society where it's not rare to see, for instance, consecrated actors or singers advertising products as a launchpad for their latest artistic endeavours. </p> <p>The Guardian has a promo column for commercial content and Google's AdSense, as well as microsites for sponsored content and badges for sponsored sections or series.</p> <p><strong>5. The science bit</strong></p> <p>Although relatively up-to-date, these sites err on the side of caution: <br></p> <ul> <li>No HTML5 tags or features seem to be present</li> <li>URLs are alphanumeric and therefore SEO-poor</li> <li>jQuery is used for interactivity, although an older version (1.4) </li> <li>There are hardly any \"interactives\" to speak of. </li> <li>Social sharing and user registration exist, but they don't seem to be given special prominence </li> <li>Scripts and stylesheets don't seem to be merged together and they are placed at the top of the page </li> <li>The column layout is liquid, but not responsive at breakpoints. </li> </ul> <p>The Mainich, which is the only one of the three that has been rebuilt and redesigned recently, is the more up-to-date, with HTML5 tags, jQuery 1.7, although no asynchronous or delayed loading of scripts, no spriting of icons, nor much dynamic AJAX functionality present in any of them. </p> <p>In terms of page weight, although all three average one megabyte, interestingly Mainichi is the loser here, serving only around one tenth of its content from the browser cache.</p> <h2>In conclusion</h2> <p>Although many of the most recent innovations don't seem to be present in the top three general news online Japanese media, maybe the fast load and the speed of Japanese networks means that those are not priorities for them. </p> <p>As for multiplatform, they take a wide approach with the creation of native or web apps and special deals with other media and technology industries.</p> <p>This reflects the current trend where news businesses are leaving the rigid framework of the website and their curators to be ubiquitous in a plethora of digital environments: social, tablet, TV, mobile, outdoor displays and who could tell where next.</p> <p><sub><em>Background image: Mituskoshi, 2004 \u24b8 <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=akira+yamaguchi\">Akira Yamaguchi</a>.</em></sub></p>",
  "<p>Last year, the Bahraini government praised the findings of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) into institutional failures that caused the death of 35 individuals between 14 February and 15 April 2011. It committed to the professionalisation of the police force and the introduction of greater accountability for those charged with torture. Ten months on, the BICI's recommendations read as a hollow reminder that little progress has been made. On Tuesday, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/bahrain-upholds-sentences-uprising-leaders\" title=\"\">announcement</a> was made that the convictions of 20 prominent dissidents were being upheld, despite widespread condemnation over the politicised nature of the judicial process.</p> <p>Practical attempts to address the most heinous allegations have been minimal. Instead, implementation efforts have been carefully orientated towards international allies, hiring western advisers to legitimise the reform process and send a message to the world that action is being taken. A number of prominent British establishment figures have risen to the occasion.</p> <p>John Yates, the former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, was hired last December to overhaul Bahrain's police service in line with international human rights standards. Since then, he has become the de facto security spokesperson for the Bahrain government. In April, when the Bahrain Formula One grand prix took place against a backdrop of heated protest, Yates appeared across international news outlets defending the stuttering reform process and framing the unrest as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/11/bahrain-grand-prix-fia-ecclestone\" title=\"\">\"criminal acts\"</a> against \"unarmed police\".</p> <p>The few reforms announced to the public wither in the face of basic scrutiny. In April, Yates announced that he was hiring 500 community police officers to improve relations with the public. However, far from extending an olive branch to a suspicious citizenry, the police continue to make extensive use of <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Bahrain-TearGas-Aug2012-small.pdf\" title=\"\">teargas as well as shotguns</a> in the name of crowd control.</p> <p>So why was the commissioner hired, if not for his ability to implement genuine reforms? It's possible the Bahraini government saw him as part of a package. Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the London School of Economics, told me that Yates was seen as a key to \"the highest levels of government\", although British ministers insist there was <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120222/text/120222w0001.htm\" title=\"\">no contact</a> over Yates's appointment, reports suggest he has since enjoyed an unprecedented degree of contact with British officials. In June, he <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-bahrain-7901942.html\" title=\"\">accompanied interior minister Lt Gen Sheikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa</a> to diplomatic engagements in London, even meeting with junior Foreign Office minister Lord Howell.</p> <p>A number of similarly well-connected <a href=\"http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/487751\" title=\"\">British lawyers</a> were also hired between December 2011 and March 2012 to advise on institutional reforms that would pave the way for the enactment of BICI's recommendations. This included advising on measures to improve accountability, including the creation of a national body to investigate police officers responsible for torture, death or mistreatment of civilians.</p> <p>Among their number was Sir Daniel Bethlehem, a former Foreign Office legal adviser who had left the government's service in May 2011, returning to practise at his chambers in late September. As with Yates, the involvement of Britons as advisers has resulted in few tangible changes at institutional level. Despite extensive documentation of state-led human rights abuses, only five low-level personnel have been imprisoned, taking the rap for what the BICI called \"systematic \u2026 mistreatment which \u2026 amounted to torture.\" The gulf between Bahraini rhetoric surrounding the lawyers' appointment and their practical achievements reinforces an impression that they too have been hired as the publicly acceptable face of a reform process that is going nowhere.</p> <p>The British government has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/17/bahrain-crackdown-uk-arms-sales\" title=\"\">supplied the security forces of Bahrain</a> with crowd control weapons and British advisers have been co-opted into the abortive reform process. But British involvement doesn't there, our oldest institutions <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/62734/response/169486/attach/3/20110421%20RFI%20Doshi%20RMAS%20Bahraini%20Trg%20Final%20Response.pdf\" title=\"\">continue to train</a> a steady stream of Bahraini nationals for active service. According to The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, this training comes at a high cost to the British state. Although it costs \u00a378,000 to train a single recruit, Bahrain only pays \u00a348,400 an individual. The Ministry of Defence has therefore subsidised Bahraini military training with at least \u00a3380,000 in the past three years alone.</p> <p>But for a government committed to boosting ties with a <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/62734/response/169486/attach/3/20110421%20RFI%20Doshi%20RMAS%20Bahraini%20Trg%20Final%20Response.pdf\" title=\"\">\"key defence ally\"</a>, this will be seen as a small price to pay. As former regional partners such as Egypt undergo their own political struggles, British officials place an increasingly high premium on alliances based on trust and deep historical roots. The price for this co-operation is complicity in the slow and steady crackdown on the human rights that Britain purports to defend.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012. It originally stated that Sir Daniel Bethlehem travelled to Bahrain in April. This has now been corrected. It was further amended on 11 September 2012 to clarify the advisory role that Sir Daniel Bethlehem played</p>",

We will all share in the responsibility if we continue to keep schtum.&#xa0;</p> <p>Discussion about injunctions was largely absent from the inquiry. Everyone was no doubt bored of hearing about them following the injunction spring, but, the absence was probably because it was thought that the issue of injunctions had been satisfactorily addressed by the master of the rolls report on superinjunctions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In reality the procedure and law set out in that report, while well intentioned, isn't quite fit for purpose. That is because it legitimises the fuelling of publicity which in turn creates irreversible intrusion and mischief. It removes the ability to retain the very thing the injunction is supposed to protect, namely privacy. The report favours the granting of anonymity injunctions but not superinjunctions (other than in exceptional circumstances, for extremely limited periods of time).</p> <p>However anonymity is the very thing that it won't achieve if the courts and parties do what the report tells them to do. For allowing the publication of the fact that an injunction has been granted, together with basic facts about the specific case (facts which often go well beyond what can really be described as basic) creates publicity and hysteria about who the person seeking the injunction is, and also encourages online speculation fuelled by those in the know (probably started by mischievous journalists). Not to mention that all of these things actually increase the costs massively.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is important to understand that the courts are required to give practical protection to privacy rights, but, if we are being totally honest currently they are not. They are still trying to appease the tabloids but they shouldn't because the tabloids have been disingenuous and have skilfully manoeuvred the process and law into a position where in many cases it isn't fit for purpose. &#xa0;</p> <p>With all the talk of protecting privacy rights during the inquiry many have forgotten a fundamental fact, which is that only practical pre-publication protection can do it properly. This requires both injunctions and advance notification of a story. Post-publication remedies such as monetary damages are not much use to the person whose privacy rights have been invaded, other than to provide (often minor) financial compensation for the wrong.</p> <p>Let's go back just a couple of years: injunctions worked because none of the papers could drum up a furore about yet another rich or famous person having obtained an injunction. Why? Because they couldn't even mention it existed. That's an important fact to remember, and that is why the tabloids wanted the position changed.</p> <p>Even if there was online speculation it was minimal and lacked credibility. It is the hysteria created by the media which leads to the speculation and mass interest online, and, to the outing or even false outing of individuals.</p> <p>Without blanket media coverage of the existence of an injunction there will be less speculation and no credibility given to the rumours online. I would go so far as saying online rumours get online in the first place because someone from the journalist's camp leaked it.</p> <p>Now, before those who have hijacked for their own purposes the freedom of expression lobby's legitimate concerns about censorship get all hot and bothered, we are only talking here about restricting publication of the fact of an injunction where a court has found there to be no, or insufficient, public interest to justify intrusion into a private life. That seems a pretty reasonable prospect to me.</p> <p>Just because someone was the national team captain, or the national team manager, did we really need to know alleged details about their private lives which would otherwise be prohibited if they weren't in the national team?</p> <p>I believe not and I know that there are a great number of people out there who agree with me. I accept that some people like reading about such goings on, but that doesn't justify such intrusions into the lives of not only the person who seeks an injunction, but importantly the members of their family.</p> <p>I argue that in all cases the family is worse off by public exposure of private information and ridicule in the press. Ask the majority of family members who it has happened to and I would expect that even if they hadn't known about the allegations beforehand they would almost unanimously have preferred them not to have been disclosed in the press.</p> <p>Did we really need to see Harry's bum in order to discuss whether or not his security team should also have nannying in its job description? Of course we didn't. And it's clear that many people agree with me despite the conditioning the tabloids have put them through over the last few years. Why else would so many have complained to the Press Complaints Commission?</p> <p>Also, isn't there something particularly wrong and distasteful about kiss-and-tells and similar types of arrangement with the tabloids? By this I mean the payment of money to someone (usually an unknown) for a story about something private which is only of interest to the tabloid because it relates to a well-known person. This, I argue, should rarely, unless there is a particularly strong and legitimate public interest argument, be afforded much weight by the courts.</p> <p>It seems obvious, to me at least, that the only true protection against invasions of privacy can be found prepublication. After the private information has entered into the public domain it can rarely be made private again. No amount of compensation will make it private again. Once you accept that premise, which I argue is the only logical one to make, then it must be the function of the court to provide real and practical protection, not something half-baked that doesn't do what it says on the tin.&#xa0;</p> <p>The courts must act now. Lord Justice Leveson should not ignore or avoid the issue of pre-publication protection, your MPs must not be allowed to give in to the press when it comes to crunch time, and serious media publishers must not let the lowest common denominators in the press distort and dictate policy. We should all accept that the path we have recently started down is the wrong one because we were expertly manoeuvred down it by a few self-interested and powerful tabloids who were out of control, wanted rid of privacy law completely, and probably thought they were above the law if all else failed. We have seen what such unfettered power can lead to, so we must do something to curtail it.</p> <p>So what I am arguing is for the media to give timely prior notification to the individuals concerned of an intended story containing private information, and also for an injunction system which doesn't permit mischief by encouraging publicity. Don't call it a superinjunction if it has become such a dirty phrase, simply call it an injunction, for that is all it would truly be. What exists now is something that can work, but only when the tabloids want it to work, so we have to find a workable solution which provides safeguards for legitimate freedom of expression which is truly in the public interest, while keeping what should be private actually private.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Gideon Benaim is a partner at Michael Simkins LLP and specialises in reputation protection</em></p>",
  "<p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/voluntary-sector-network/poll/2012/jul/31/charities-advertising-asa-shocking?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the Advertising Standards Authority </a> released a report with the not-so-shocking revelation that charity adverts in particular go too far when it comes to shocking. It's a debate that gets recycled on average at least twice a year, as one particularly \"hard-hitting\" charity flirts with the fine line between a reality check and content that is just downright distasteful. One week, it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/feb/16/peta-vegan-sex-ad\" title=\"\">Peta</a> using basement-level, misogynistic, crude humour to promote veganism; the next, it's a certificate 18 viral from<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/28/unwatchable-congo-rape-short-film\" title=\"\"> Save the Congo</a> that would probably make even the most ardent Saw fans turn away in revulsion.</p> <p>For me, I think the tired debate has become a futile, perpetual cycle that we're not going to break out of any time soon, because we are asking the wrong questions. Whenever you ask if the line has been crossed, it creates a clear divide between right and wrong \u2013 and, therefore, charities will continue to be edgy in an attempt to grab your attention, regardless of any ASA sanctions, fines or bans.</p> <p>The idea of shock tactics stems from the notion that a short, sharp shock can be effective in affecting behaviour in a positive way. But what happens when you're receiving a short, sharp shock every single day? You eventually become numb to the effects and the shock value becomes null and void. More importantly for marketers, the cut-through disappears.</p> <p>Brendan Gormley, chief executive at the <a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a>, last year warned of the danger that the persistent use of shock tactics could amount to little more than a \"race to the bottom\". Particularly with the likes of Peta's often crazed obsession with attention-seeking and headline-making, it's difficult to argue that it is any more than just that. It makes you wonder what exactly the nadir will be.</p> <p>What frustrates me is that I feel charities are getting away from what their ultimate goal should be. Like any good business (let's be clear, charities are, and have to be run like businesses in order to function), charities need to raise donations, raise awareness and compel people to act. To do those things, you need to grab attention initially, of course, but you then need to actually do something once you have a captive audience.</p> <p>If all you're doing is shocking people, how many of them are you actually moving to make a donation or engage? And how many of them are you purely upsetting and unsettling by placing these adverts before the watershed? You have to make sure that a shock propels people into action rather than just leaving them with a bad taste in their mouths.</p> <p>What's similarly frustrating is the lack of creative flair behind these adverts. We ad-men often yearn for a challenger-brand client, willing to approach a new campaign with an open mind and be creative. More often than not, we bemoan the great creative ideas that are left on the cutting room floor in favour of safe, conventional 30-second spots that may have all the key messages, but offer little in the way of persuasion for consumers to act upon.</p> <p>Charities, however, want to grab your attention. They want to be disruptive, they want to go against the grain and, theoretically, they don't want to be formulaic. Yet, collectively, we as an industry have become lazy. In the absence of inspired creative work, shock tactics appear to be an easy fallback. What's more worrying is that \"heads-turned\" seems to be an acceptable measure of success these days. Surely it should be donations raised and actions instigated on which we can evaluate campaigns?</p> <p>It's not to say shock doesn't have a place within advertising, but those that use shock effectively are thus drowned out by the overbearing noise around them. For example <a href=\"http://www.womensaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Women's Aid</a>, in my opinion, manages to tow a tasteful line with a range of effective campaigns that make people stop and think about an issue where the biggest barrier to action is an unwillingness or inability for it to be confronted. It's sad to think how its cut-through is diluted by an obnoxious \"competitor\", screaming loudly for attention like an infant.</p> <p>I think surely the time has come to stop going round in circles and for those of us in advertising to take responsibility for what we put out there. Not out of some moral duty, but for the sake of our own integrity. With new channels and possibilities opening up to us all the time, there's arguably never been a greater opportunity to create something wonderful, to create true popular culture. Great advertising in action is a joy to behold, despite the tattered reputation of the medium.

  "<p>If I had a pound for every time I've heard a politician or government official urging me to \"do the right thing\" I would be a rich man. Do you save enough for your pension, drink within the official guidelines, volunteer in your community, try to cut your carbon footprint, maintain your body mass index below 25? If we all did the right thing in these, and many other ways, life would be a lot easier for policy makers. But unfortunately a lot of us don't.</p> <p>Governments have traditionally used a combination of three kinds of tool to get us to do the right thing: legislation, financial carrots or sticks, and education. We are encouraged not to drink and drive by laws against it and penalties for getting caught. We are discouraged from driving into central London by the congestion charge and encouraged to insulate our homes with subsidies. We are told about the dangers of smoking, unprotected sex and eating an unhealthy diet in various government advertising campaigns.</p> <p>There are big success stories in government attempts to change the behaviour of the population as a whole. Sixty years ago nearly three quarters of us were smokers, today it is less than a quarter. When seat belts were introduced we were reluctant to wear them, but now we do so without thinking. It used to be normal to drink and drive, but the roadside breathalyser and penalties have changed our attitudes and behaviour.</p> <p>These changes in our behaviour resulted from a mixture of legislation, education and in the case of tobacco, taxation, although the precise contribution of each is not known.</p> <p>But in recent years a new fashion has emerged, drawing on research in behavioural sciences, especially in psychology, behavioural economics and behavioural biology. The central idea is that many of our moment-to-moments decisions are made on autopilot, without much conscious reflection. By tapping into our semi-automatic decision-making, we can be subtly persuaded to change our behaviour and do the right thing. </p> <p>The book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780141040011/nudge-improving-decisions-about-health-wealth-and-happiness\">Nudge</a>, by Chicago academics Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein has caught the eye of politicians, as has Robert Cialdini's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780061241895/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion\">Influence</a>, in which he analyses how were are persuaded to buy stuff by subtle psychological manipulation.</p> <p>Pensions are a classic example. If the default for a pension scheme is \"opt in\", far more people pay into the scheme than if the default is \"opt out\". Apparently we tend to accept the default without really bothering to think too much about an active choice.</p> <p>There are now numerous documented examples of where \"nudging\" can contribute to getting people to do the right thing. It is attractive to politicians because it is a light touch approach that avoids the heavy hand of regulation and the nanny state. The <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/behavioural-insights-team\">Behavioural Insights Team</a> (or \"nudge unit\") in the Cabinet Office is encouraging government departments to use nudging to achieve policy objectives such as getting people to pay their road tax or reduce their carbon footprint. The team is not taking it for granted that nudging works: they are setting up randomised control trials to find out.</p> <p>Here are a couple of examples of where nudging has an effect. If householders' energy bills indicate their energy consumption relative to others in the street, together with tips for reducing energy use, people reduce their consumption by a few percent. In another study at Newcastle University people were about twice as likely to clear up their rubbish in a cafeteria if the sign encouraging them to do so had a pair of eyes on it than if it had a bunch of flowers.</p> <p>Although nudging is a relatively new idea, the notion of using insights from behavioural science to get people to do the right thing is not. More than 50 years ago the American psychologist B F Skinner wrote a Utopian novel, Walden Two, about a community in which everyone did the right thing as a result of \"behavioural engineering\". Many commentators were horrified at the implications of Skinner's vision for freedom of choice. Similar ethical questions could be asked about any measures that get us to change our behaviour by working through our subconscious.</p> <p>But how useful is nudging for tackling society's hardest problems? It is one thing for marketeers to persuade us to buy the latest gadget, this season's fashions, or a new beauty product. Here subtle psychological ploys are working alongside our own wish for immediate gratification. It is quite another to persuade us to do things that have a long-term benefits to us, such as losing weight, or a benefit to future generations, such as reducing our environmental footprint. </p> <p>When the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee looked into this last year, it concluded that soft approaches such as nudging are not, on their own, enough. The Committee looked at two challenges in particular: obesity and transport. </p> <p>Some experts estimate that the adverse health consequences of obesity could cripple the NHS if nothing is done to get people to lose weight. There is no magic bullet for fixing the obesity epidemic, now affecting about a quarter of the UK population, but the select committee's report concluded that the huge change in behaviour needed will not be achieved by nudging alone. </p> <p>Likewise, persuading us to leave our cars in the garage and take public transport, walk or get on our bikes requires a massive shove rather than a nudge.</p> <p>Although governments are reluctant to be more interventionist, a recent Mori survey of 18,600 people in 24 countries showed surprisingly high levels of support for regulations and other strong measures to tackle the major problems facing society. </p> <p>The behavioural sciences have an important role to play, but our understanding of how to persuade people to change their behaviour is still rudimentary. In the mean time, tough problems will need tough action from government.</p>",
  "<p>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial,*</strong> is taken from the conclusion of the chapter written by <strong>Harry Evans</strong>.</p> <p>The 84-year-old former editor of the Sunday Times and The Times - and now editor-at-large with Reuters - calls for self-regulation (or, maybe not - see comments) and explains why decisions on what to publish must satisfy public interest tests... </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395756985\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346916823963/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In our outrage over hacking and other offences, it is important not to rush to legislation that might impede legitimate journalism. Imagine if there had been a loosely-worded statute that impeded or killed The Guardian or the bloggers.</p> <p>I'd much sooner see a really strong press commission of some kind, with the power to summon journalists, with the power to issue subpoenas, with the power to fine, with the power to publicise the offenders, with the power to insist on corrections. </p> <p>In that situation, whoever's the head of it - whether it's a judge or a very distinguished ombudsman journalist - you've got the flexibility, case by case, which you can't get when you lay down the law in cold print.</p> <p>The performance of the tabloids is generally distinct from what we call \"the qualities\" \u2013 the elitist' press is another term \u2013 that exhibit more restraint and a more consistent concern with policy. </p> <p>In the tabloids, at elections, ingenuity is all too often expended to ensure that information favourable to a party the newspaper opposes is distorted in content and presentation so as to become an emotionally charged negative. Attacks on persons, rather than policies, are often propagated without much regard for privacy, or truth, and all too often with ingenious malice.</p> <p>The arguments for pluralism seem to me to have become irresistible in the light of how Rupert Murdoch has, for 30 years, deployed all the News International newspapers to hammer home his personal preferences. All the politicians run scared. </p> <p>It isn't that these newspapers uncover serious abuses of power by diligent fact-based investigation so much as their capacity to present personalities in an unfavourable light. </p> <p>The editors of The Sun, the News of the World-as-was, and the editors of The Times and Sunday Times may have substantive or subtle differences of opinion, but in general elections they march to the same drum, and the drummer is Murdoch.</p> <h2>What is the public interest?</h2> <p>What interests the public is not necessarily in the public interest. The mass is undoubtedly interested in the sex lives of the rich and famous and if they are not available, then, the sex lives of anyone will do. </p> <p>Judges wielding wide-ranging super-injunctions have clearly not been impressed by the public interest argument that free expression in a democratic society (article 10 of the human rights act) overrides everyone's right to his or her private and family life, home and correspondence (article 8).</p> <p>The commonest excuse for intrusion, of course, is that the purveyor is exposing hypocrisy \u2013 typically a self-appointed moral arbiter conducting a contradictory private life. Normally that defence for exposure is itself no more than hypocrisy on stilts, but I can imagine cases where the public interest would not only justify an invasion of privacy but even demand it. </p> <p>For instance, in the bitter battles in the US over legalising gay marriage, it would matter if the virulent homophobia of a legislator was just a cover for his own sexual preference...</p> <p>The most agile public interest argument I have heard in Britain to justify intrusions is that the sex gossip helps to keep the red-tops in business. The economic vitality of the tabloids, it is said, is in the public interest since along with the sleaze which produces circulation and revenues; they quite often expose wrongdoing. </p> <p>So what kind of wrongdoing is against the public interest? Article 8 concedes that intrusion might be justified when in the interests of national security (a concealed jihadist, say) or the economic well-being of the country (a speculative scheme to weaken sterling), or for \"the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\".</p> <p>These are fairly wide-ranging exclusions. They would certainly seem to justify a breach of private trust if the press were revealing negligence in, say, the manufacture of a dangerous drug. </p> <p>But look at the history of the thalidomide disaster. Two laws were invoked to justify suppression: the law of confidence to keep the manufacturers' documents secret, and the law of contempt.</p> <p>It is, of course, easier to say what is not in the public interest as what is. In<br>editing contentious stories, my test was: is this information, on balance, likely to advance human well-being? </p> <p>Perhaps Lord Justice Leveson will achieve something more precise as a result of the inquiry. But one has to be ultra-cautious in the way an accumulation of cases congeals against a clear public interest, as it has done, I think, in the rash of super-injunctions banning information for all time. </p> <p>Again, by the 1970s, so many more cases in Britain had been decided on arguments about property than about personal rights that there was a bias in the precedents against human rights and in favour of commercial rights \u2013 basically in favour of power against individuals.</p> <p>Notoriously, in 1975, the courts sought to stop the Sunday Times continuing serialisation of the diaries of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crossman\">Richard Crossman</a> [a Labour cabinet minister in the 1960s] on the grounds that it was not in the public interest for the public to know too much about how they were governed. </p> <p>The judge, in the first instance, asserted the power of the cabinet secretary to scrutinise and censor the reporting of any discussion where this reporting revealed how policy was being formed or executed. </p> <p>Even when the courts finally allowed publication, it was not on grounds of the people's right to know, but because diaries of a decade before had become \"history\".</p> <p>What intrusions might an investigative press justify in the public interest? Circumstances must decide an editor. The public damage expected to be<br>revealed ought ideally to be proportionate to the intrusion. </p> <p>For instance, I thought our reporter on the trail of the car insurance swindler <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Savundra\">Emil Savundra</a> was justified in ringing a doorbell at 10pm in Zurich. The Swiss authorities thought not.</p> <p>In editing contentious stories, I always asked myself a simple question. Are we ready, on publication, to describe the steps we took to make our revelations? If we cannot, we should not take them. </p> <p>Had the public been told, in the phone hacking scandal, how the information was obtained, would it have festered so long?</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Ray Snoddy</strong> questions the need for the Leveson inquiry, contending that it was an outrageous piece of political expediency by the prime minister</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, will be published by Abramis on 17 September.

  "<p>David Cameron and Nick Clegg have announced a package of measures designed to boost the housing industry and growth through an injection of cash, looser planning laws and the lifting of requirements for developers to build affordable homes.</p> <p>Downing Street claimed the measures, arguably the coalition's fourth attempt to boost house-building, would create up to 70,000 new homes, including affordable housing, opportunities for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder, 140 000 jobs and a boost to the construction sector.</p> <p>The package includes a \u00a340bn guarantee for major infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn guarantees for new homes.</p> <p>In a bid to unblock the barriers to house-building at a time of pent-up demand, the package includes a promise to allow developers to renegotiate agreements with local councils so they need not build as many affordable homes for a temporary period. The Treasury will provide an extra \u00a3300m cash from under-spending in other departments, designed to boost affordable housing directly, and so make up any shortfall.</p> <p>Developers claim over-onerous agreements imposed by councils prevent them going ahead with projects even when they have planning permission. Developers that have not pressed ahead with a project despite five years of permission will be able to appeal to the planning inspectorate to lift the conditions.</p> <p>Cameron told Daybreak the move was about confidence.</p> <p>\"Frankly we had a situation where the lenders did not want to lend so the builders could not build and the buyers could not buy,\" he said. \"We are talking today about 140,000 jobs provided by building an extra 70,000 houses.\"</p> <p>Clegg said the government was telling private house builders: \"If you are finding it too expensive to raise money yourself to put shovels in the ground to employ on construction sites and build homes for private rent and to build affordable homes we are going to make it cheaper for you to do so\".</p> <p>Clegg claimed the measures could unlock 75,000 homes that are currently stalled, as well as seeing the construction of 15,000 new affordable homes, and bring further empty homes back into use.</p> <p>Ministers are publishing legislation for government guarantees of up to \u00a340bn of major infrastructure projects and up to \u00a310bn of new homes. The infrastructure (financial assistance) bill will include guaranteeing the debt of housing associations and private sector developers.</p> <p>The government warned it would put councils into \"special measures\" if they failed to respond speedily to planning permission requests. More applications will be put into a fast-track process.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/david-cameron-planning-laws-growth-plan\" title=\"\">size of domestic and business home extensions will be extended</a> before full planning permission is required.</p> <p>In a bid to assist with mortgages, the government will help 16,500 first-time buyers with a \u00a3280m extension of the \"FirstBuy\" scheme, which offers aspiring homeowners a much-needed deposit and a first step on the housing ladder.</p> <p>Cameron said : \"The measures announced today show this government is serious about rolling its sleeves up and doing all it can to kickstart the economy. Some of the proposals are controversial; others have been a long time in coming. But along with our housing strategy, they provide a comprehensive plan to unleash one of the biggest home building programmes this country has seen in a generation. That means more investment around the country; more jobs for our people; and more young families able to realise their dreams and get on the housing ladder.\"</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the measures were not adequate to the task.</p> <p>\"We need to get Britain building again, but the government has slashed the housing budget and the number of affordable homes being built is down by 68%.</p> <p>\"The fundamental problem is not the planning system or Section 106 agreements for much-needed affordable housing, it is the lack of confidence and demand in the economy, slashed public investment and the government's failing economic plan.</p> <p>\"If ministers really want to help homeowners and small firms, why don't they listen to our idea to cut VAT to 5% on home improvements, repairs and maintenance?\"</p>",
  "<p>Film and entertainment giant Disney has threatened an independent British production company with legal action, claiming it is misleading consumers with a series of budget family DVDs which appear to be copycat versions of Disney's own popular animated films.</p> <p>The Brighton-based firm, Brightspark Production Ltd, recently launched Braver, which Disney said was similar to its blockbuster Brave in more than just its title.</p> <p>It has complained that the graphics and artwork, including a red-haired princess in a green dress on the cover of the 45-minute \"cartoon fairytale\", closely resemble that of its own.</p> <p>Disney has pointed to further DVDs which it also claims infringe its copyright: Tangled up, which compares with its Tangled; The Frog Princess as opposed to Disney's The Princess and the Frog; and Little Cars as opposed to the Disney film Cars.</p> <p>Disney's film Brave tells the story of Princess Merida who overcomes a curse after refusing to marry a suitor chosen by her parents, while in Braver Princess Angela is kidnapped in a forest after being put under a spell.</p> <p>Unlike its cut-price rival, the 93-minute Disney/Pixar film has topped the UK film charts grossing \u00a318m at the box office as of last weekend. The DVD will go on sale in the UK in November.</p> <p>Disney has this week written to Brightspark asking it to withdraw the DVDs or face litigation. The films are widely available in Sainsbury's and Tesco supermarkets (and online) for about \u00a33 each. They are also on sale through Amazon and HMV (Braver will not be available until December), although the former makes it clear to shoppers that they are not Disney merchandise.</p> <p>Some film fans said the Brightspark DVDs were good value for money, but others expressed their disappointment with the DVDs on film websites.</p> <p>On Lovefilm, Richv from Barnsley said of Braver: \"The contents bore NO relation to the actual film, in fact I would say the packaging is meant to fool you into thinking you were buying the soon to be released 'Brave'. Stylistically I would say this was made about 20 years ago, very cheaply.\"</p> <p>Disney said in a statement: \"People place great trust in the quality and creativity of Disney, and when it appears that another company is causing confusion among Disney consumers we will act to protect ourselves and the consumer. Disney believes Brightspark has demonstrated a pattern of misleading consumers with numerous releases that confuse and undermine the trust those consumers have in Disney.\"</p> <p>Brightspark's Tangled Up has also drawn consumer criticism.

A man was found dead in the driver's seat and a second girl, believed to be six or seven, was discovered lying injured on the road near the BMW people carrier.

He is presumed to be a victim and was accompanied by two women and two little girls.

Police say there are still no clues as to the motive for the killings and no arrests have yet been made.</p> <p>Maillaud said 15 cartridges were found around the car, suggesting all the gunshots had come from outside the car, and an automatic pistol appeared to have been used but no weapon has been found.</p> <p>He described the discovery as being like a scene from a film: \"We don't know who could have done this. We have no idea.\"</p> <p>The alarm was raised shortly after the shootings by a second cyclist \u2013 reported to be British \u2013 who discovered the girl lying seriously injured in front of the BMW in a secluded car park near the village of Chevaline, close to Lake Annecy. He was in a state of shock afterwards but told police officers he had been overtaken on the path by the cyclist who he then discovered lying dead near the car.</p> <p>Police said a man \"dressed in cycling gear\" was found near the car and his bicycle was found close by. He was identified by police after his wife, worried when he did not return from his cycle ride, went a to a local police station with a photograph of him. The elder girl found near the car had been beaten and suffered a fractured skull, said Maillaud. She was taken by helicopter to Grenoble hospital, where he said she \"seems to be pulling through\".</p> <p>Explaining the failure to discover the four-year old earlier, Lieutenant Colonel Benoit Vinnemann said: \"We had instructions not to enter the car and not to move the bodies. Firemen, technicians and doctors all looked into the car through the holes in the windows but none of them saw the girl. She didn't budge. She stayed under the legs of her mother \u2026 She was so close to her mother they appeared as one mass.\"</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We are aware of the reports of the shooting and we are looking into these urgently.\"</p> <p>The area around the car park was sealed off and 60 gendarmes were searching for evidence and combing the forest for possible perpetrators.</p> <p>The local Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper said Chevaline residents had reported seeing a car leaving the village at high speed late on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>With a population of little more than 200, Chevaline lies within the boundaries of one of France's largest national parks, the Parc Naturel R\u00e9gional du Massif des Bauges.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are coming here to spend holidays and use the lake because we have a beautiful landscape,\" Leila Lamnaouer, a French journalist, told Sky News. \"A lot of English people live here because they love the place.\"</p> <p>The newspaper L'Essor Savoyard reported that residents had been left shocked by the attacks, saying that the region was usually quiet.</p> <p>The mayor, Didier Berthollet, told the newspaper that the forest road where the car was found was popular with walkers.</p>",
  "<p>There should be no sentiment about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrewlansley\" title=\"\">Andrew Lansley's departure as health secretary</a>, no matter how hard he worked, how gutted he is to lose the Tory health brief after nine years or how much he cared about the health service. By every measure of high political office, he was a disaster and he deserved to be sacked.</p> <p>As a strategist, he failed to look for the most pragmatic way to achieve his desired outcome. He simply would not recognise that taking a wrecking ball to NHS structures \u2013 at a time of intense financial stress, rising demand and the necessity for widespread changes to clinical practice \u2013 was foolish. He compounded this mistake by imposing a structure that resembles a London tube map. Compare that with Michael Gove's pragmatic approach of bending the existing academy programme to his will.</p> <p>As a politician, Lansley managed to turn virtually every interest group against him, gave the opposition almost limitless opportunities to attack and lost the confidence of the public. He was so inept that even after the extraordinary spectacle of \"the pause\" \u2013 when the government just about managed to get the policy back into some sort of order \u2013 he again careered into a political ditch as it went through the Lords. Sharp, charming health minister Earl Howe had to tow him out.</p> <p>Lansley was a shocking communicator, from ill-tempered media interviews to the hectoring tone he adopted with the professions. His idea of consultation was to repeat what he had said in the hope that this time you would finally concede he was right. Ridiculing managers as \"bureaucrats\" was just one indicator of his ineptitude \u2013 alienating with a single word the very people who had to implement his reforms.</p> <p>So what has he left for Jeremy Hunt? The new secretary of state has arrived at a particularly sensitive time. The <a href=\"http://mandate.dh.gov.uk/2012/07/04/mandate-consultation/\" title=\"\">mandate with which parliament will lay down its priorities for 2013-15</a> and beyond is out for consultation until 26 September.</p> <p>This will set the boundary between the political influence of ministers and the operational independence of the NHS commissioning board. Lansley had promised to take the politics out of the day to day running of the NHS. Now Hunt has to decide how he will interpret that. Having just taken on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19472688\" title=\"\">\"the biggest privilege of my life\"</a>, Hunt may be surprised at just how little direct control of the NHS is envisaged for him.</p> <p>It is tempting to construe Lansley's departure as further strengthening the already near-omnipotent position of Sir David Nicholson, the commissioning board chief executive, but that does not necessarily follow. Hunt will not be there simply to provide a more credible front for Lansley's reforms; he will want to be seen to set his own priorities. He can be expected to champion choice, and may well energise the use of private sector providers. He will also want to stamp out local fires on care rationing.</p> <p>He can be expected to be pragmatic. While Lansley revelled in the detail, Hunt will want to focus on what works and what can be achieved.</p> <p>A serious concern is that his priorities may be short term and election focused. On reconfiguration, for example, Lansley eventually came round to the need to concentrate some services in fewer, high quality centres.</p> <p>Pushing through such changes is essential if the NHS is to have a hope of maintaining quality while finding savings, but it will require strong political nerves and an acceptance of how crucial these changes are to the health service's future. The temptation for Hunt to stall on these changes until after 2015 will be strong. (He has done the usual constituency campaigning to protect local services, in his case Haslemere hospital and the Royal Surrey A&amp;E, although, of course, it does not necessarily follow that he will adopt the same approach nationally.)</p> <p>As the tunnel of public sector cuts gets ever longer, he will be needing to balance the great pressure in healthcare with the crisis in social care. Under Hunt, the NHS budget could get more permeable, moving money across to social services under the guise of integrated care.</p> <p>And finally there is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust\" title=\"\">Francis inquiry</a> (into deaths at Stafford hospital), now reporting in October. In the absence of any stronger indication of his likely response, it is worth noting that as shadow minister for the disabled he <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-06-11b.597.0&amp;s=social+care+speaker%3A11859#g599.1\" title=\"\">expressed concern about the detrimental impact of bureaucracy and regulation</a> on providers. There is a grave risk of the government over-reacting to the Francis inquiry. It will be to the benefit of the NHS and patients if he keeps his questioning approach to regulation to the fore when deciding his response.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails on the future of the health sector.</strong></p>",
  "<p>As a new political season resumes at Westminster, a succession of disastrous growth figures, an unwillingness to amend the deficit reduction programme despite a faltering economy, and a series of botched decisions on Heathrow and student visas add to the sense of a government that is losing its grip on events. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-david-cameron-conservatives\" title=\"\">Tuesday's reshuffle</a> looks more like a desperate attempt to shore up the prime minister's authority with the right of his party than establishing a serious strategy for government. At long last, Labour is able to shape the political agenda, shifting the terms of the economic policy debate from reducing public debt, to reinvigorating UK growth. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has been widely praised for leading the attack on George Osborne's ill-timed austerity programme.</p> <p>Yet Labour should remember that it is during periods of greatest political momentum when the hard thinking and strategic heavy lifting of opposition must be done. Rising disillusionment with the coalition, augmented by Labour's markedly improved poll ratings, mean that pressure will grow on the party to stake out a plausible and credible economic alternative, and for the \"two Eds\" \u2013 Miliband and Balls \u2013 the clock is ticking.</p> <p>One obstacle standing in the way of progress is disagreement among senior figures about the nature of New Labour's economic legacy. On one side, those loyal to Blair and Brown insist the party's track record on the economy was one of historic success, certainly between 1997 and the onset of the global crisis in 2007-8. On the other hand, Labour's leader, Ed Miliband, has presented a challenging critique of the neoliberal economic model over which New Labour presided, urging \"a fairer and more responsible capitalism\". In truth, this amounts to a difference of emphasis rather than a philosophical chasm, but it hinders Labour's efforts to develop a more compelling economic story.</p> <p>The truth about Labour's record in government is inevitably more complex than what passes for political debate at Westminster. For much of the party's 13 years in power, rising growth, low inflation, and record levels of employment were matched by sharp improvements in productivity: an <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/events/event.asp?id=145\" title=\"\">average annual rise of 2.8% between 1997 and the start of the 2008 recession</a>, according to Dan Corry and John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics. The claim that New Labour entered into a \"Faustian pact\" with the financial markets, engineering a period of growth built on rising public and private sector debt, ought to be seriously addressed, but ignores substantial progress beyond the growth of financial services.</p> <p>Indeed, sustained investment in skills, science, research and development, and public infrastructure encouraged strong performance in high-value manufacturing sectors far removed from financial markets in the UK, including pharmaceuticals and aerospace. The regional growth divide was narrowing sharply by the mid-2000s. And as the banking crisis unfolded in 2007-8, the Labour government's interventions were purposeful and decisive, leading the Nobel prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman, to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13krugman.html\" title=\"\">offer high praise for Gordon Brown's leadership</a>. So airbrushing away 13 years of relatively successful economic management seems unwarranted.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Labour ought to be candid about where it went wrong in seeking to win back voters' trust. The \"light-touch\" regulatory regime practised in the UK banking sector was blind to concerns about the resilience of British banks in the advent of global shocks. Indeed, New Labour embraced a view about the stability of markets which led George Bush's economic adviser, Robert Lucas, to remark in 2005 that, \"for all practical purposes \u2026 the central problem of depression prevention has been solved\". This now appears utterly misconceived. Labour's sanguine view about the near certainty of sustained growth in the world economy meant it relied on too optimistic assumptions about tax receipts, running a modest deficit in the mid-2000s when a surplus would have been more prudent. The fragility of the UK tax base, and the refusal to strengthen tax revenues through additional levies on wealth, capital, and property, was a primary cause of the current crisis in Britain's public finances.</p> <p>Of course in one sense, few voters in 2015 will care much about what happened in an era of politics that now feels like the distant past. But to frame a credible economic strategy, Labour has to learn deeper lessons about its period in power. Clarity about its legacy will enable the party to move on in addressing the economic challenges of the future.</p> <p>It is all too apparent that George Osborne's \"plan A\" amounts to little more than a rehashed 1980s neoliberal agenda of deregulation and labour market \"flexibility\", epitomised by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/may/21/adrain-beecroft-report-consumer-confidence\" title=\"\">Beecroft report</a>'s assault on the rights of employees, and Britain's historic equality legislation. The quest for a permanently smaller state is both ill-conceived and irrelevant to Britain's economic predicament.</p> <p>Labour must confront a fundamental question about the nature of British capitalism \u2013 not just how to kickstart growth in the economy, but how to shift the distribution of the gains from growth to middle and low-waged workers. There are measures that might be adopted to raise the minimum wage, encouraging a \"living wage\" across the public and private sectors. Nonetheless, low wages are primarily structural, sustained by casualised, \"flexible\" and low-skilled sectors of the labour market. Labour's industrial policy and \"new growth model\" to be debated at a Policy Network conference today need to focus not only on fashionable \"high-tech\" manufacturing and \"low-carbon\" industries, but sectors such as retail, hospitality, and social care, as the Resolution Foundation's Gavin Kelly recently highlighted. It is vital to increase demand for skills, while investing in the productive potential of low-wage workers.</p> <p>At the same time, it is clear that only systemic institutional reforms will reverse the low wage, low skill, low productivity \"equilibrium\" in the British economy. This was an opportunity missed during the New Labour years, but it is a challenge the party must now take on.</p>",
  "<p>\"From the beginning,\" writes Tony Fletcher, \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/smiths\" title=\"\">the Smiths</a> sensed greatness, and to realise that greatness meant a refusal to accept confinement to the margins.\"</p> <p>The point is undeniably true, in so many ways. When the Mancunian guitar player Johnny Marr called at the home of Steven Morrissey in May 1982 and began writing songs with him, their sights were fixed on reference points altogether loftier than those of the alternative-rock milieu they quickly transcended. Marr's view of the world was shaped by the Rolling Stones, Phil Spector, and the classic songwriting duo Lieber &amp; Stoller. Morrissey added such literary touchstones as Oscar Wilde, and the playwright and screenwriter Shelagh Delaney \u2013 as well as an array of opinions and lifestyle choices that embodied a radical break with the go-for-it, consumerist attitudes of the 1980s: vegetarianism, a biting hatred of the Thatcher government and a sense that the singer \u2013 who spent the band's career and beyond claiming to be celibate \u2013 was somehow proud to be always in the grip of some malady or other.</p> <p>They soon realised how good they were: indeed, at 25 years' distance, the richness of their songs and their breathtaking consistency suggests a place just down from the Beatles. But their career prospects were always held in check by a problem that grew worse as their success increased: Morrissey's refusal to employ a manager or submit to the standard promotional grind, both of which were at odds with his almost pathological griping about chart&#xa0;positions, radio play and the esteem in which they were or were not&#xa0;held by their record company, Rough Trade.</p> <p>As he seemed to see it, if the Smiths were commercial underachievers, it was always someone else's fault \u2013 but if you refuse to make videos, blow out TV appearances at a moment's notice and cancel European tours in the airport departure lounge, then \"the margins\" are something you will never quite escape. Moreover, without a big figure to oversee the business side of their lives, any comparable group would have probably buckled, something beautifully captured in one Marr quote: \"I've never met anyone who thinks that the 23-year-old guitar player of a really big band should be the manager.\"</p> <p>All this defines the essential plotline of <em>A Light Never Goes Out</em>, the story of the Smiths told over nearly 700 pages by a former biographer of REM and of the Who drummer Keith Moon, on the basis of interviews with just about every surviving participant in the Smiths' story \u2013 apart from drummer Mike Joyce and, somewhat inevitably, Morrissey himself. The singer's autobiography is published later this year, and it will be interesting to see how his telling of these tales differs from what Fletcher has amassed: as the story winds on, a chain of no-shows, fits of pique and self-sabotage that reaches its denouement with an episode from April 1987, just prior to the band's formal break-up.</p> <p>A video was due to be filmed in London's Battersea, which would boost the Smiths' fast-rising profile in the US. Three of the Smiths turned up, but Morrissey hid away in his flat in Knightsbridge. Fletcher is the first writer to have got the full story, thanks to the American video director Tamra Davis, who was part of the three-person deputation sent to try and convince him to change his mind. She gives Fletcher a simple anecdote that captures the moment at which the band began to break up: \"I remember very distinctly that I had no idea if Morrissey was standing behind that door laughing at the three of us pleading with him, or crying \u2026 Johnny was like, 'That's it. The band is over' \u2026 And he walks away.\" The crucial moment came later, at a meal Marr organised for the Smiths in a Notting Hill fish and chip restaurant. As the Smiths' bassist Andy Rourke later acknowledged, there was something grimly fitting in the fact that a group so synonymous with northern grit effectively \"broke up in a chippy\".</p> <p>Such material highlights the extent to which Fletcher has done his research, though it also underlines a tension familiar to anyone who owns more than a handful of rock books. Very few musicians have stories the content of which matches the drama and excitement of the best pop music, and in the Smiths' case, behind truly amazing songs lay lives often defined by ordinary things. Their happiness on tour depended on a dependable supply of egg and chips. By way of a nod to rock excess, Rourke had a heroin problem, but when he was temporarily sacked from the group, he claimed that Morrissey did the deed via a note left on the windscreen of his car, parked in a side-street in Altrincham.</p> <p>The main onus on anyone writing about the Smiths, then, is the necessity of evoking the magical singularity of their music, but Fletcher's book doesn't manage the trick. He's too fond of the rock-hack vernacular, so that records are rated by \"fans and critics alike\", and music leans towards \"the jazz arena\" rather than jazz itself. A group so steeped in literature has long deserved the attention of someone with at least the ambition to be a prose stylist; in the same sense, there is something maddening about music so lithe and lyrical being described in prose that often falls flat. And on at least two occasions, Fletcher belly flops: there's a very clunky evocation of the moors murders, and one borderline unforgivable occasion when he describes the Smiths' native Manchester as the \"Lancashire capital\".</p> <p>If Fletcher's writing can be disappointingly tepid, the same applies to the book that has until now been the only serious Smiths biography on the market \u2013 <em>Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance</em> by the prolific music biographer Johnny Rogan (Omnibus, \u00a314.95), first published in 1992. It has now been updated \u2013 chiefly with revelations gleaned from the mid-1990s court case focused on one of the most remarkable aspects of the Smiths' affairs: that while Morrissey and Marr received 40% each of the proceeds from performing and recording, Rourke and Joyce were paid a mere 10% apiece (Rourke settled out of court for \u00a383,000; Joyce went all the way, and was awarded around \u00a31m).</p> <p>Like Fletcher's book only more so, Rogan's is a (qualified) victory of research rather than literary panache, built on a great mountain of facts and testimony, and slowed by the rock-book convention of writing about every Smiths album by using a pedestrian track-by-track breakdown. That said, there is a lot to feast on, particularly Rogan's fond recounting of Morrissey and Marr's family roots in Ireland and their upbringing in the Mancunian-Irish community, a background they shared with Rourke and Joyce. If their music always fizzed with a vivid sense of Englishness, it was perhaps because they at least partly saw their home country through the eyes of their immigrant parents.</p> <p>The best Smiths book remains the comparatively brief <em>The Smiths:</em> <em>Songs that Saved Your Life</em>, by the music writer Simon Goddard, the definitive version of which was published in 2004. Inspired by Ian Macdonald's Beatles book <em>Revolution in the Head</em>, it was built around a simple idea: taking all of the Smiths' songs and telling their story. In his <em>Mozipedia: The Encyclopedia of Morrissey and The Smiths (</em>Ebury Press, \u00a314.99<em>)</em>, now published in paperback, Goddard widens his previous book's mixture of detail and passionate celebration to Morrissey's entire aesthetic universe, arranged in alphabetical order. There are entries for Alan Bennett, the New York Dolls, the Kray twins \u2013 and Dirk Bogarde, on whom Morrissey apparently dwelled in 1994, imagining being able to \"live in a mansion flat in Chelsea and see nobody, which would be a perfect life\".</p> <p>Reading that sentence, I imagine an irate knock at the door, another engagement cancelled, and I think of those uncharacteristically inelegant lines from \"What Difference Does It Make?\", a top 20 hit in 1984: \"Oh, I'm too tired / I'm so sick and tired / And I'm feeling very sick and ill today.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day eight: 6 September</strong></h2> <p>There may have been a brief look at South Africa's Oscar Pistorius during the Olympic Games, but the Blade Runner really comes into his own today. The T44 100m (9.58pm) is one of the highlight events of the entire Games and should see Pistorius pushed all the way to retain his gold medal. Great Britain's Jonnie Peacock is the fastest man on the track, but the USA's Jerome Singleton and South Africa's Arnu Fourie are not far behind. This race should be a little closer than Usain Bolt's romp to gold. GB's Libby Clegg and Hannah Cockroft are also in action today, racing in the T12 200m (semi-finals 12.41pm, finals 7.42pm) and the T34 200m (round 11.47am, final 8.12pm).</p> <h2>Athletics</h2> <p>10:00 Men's 200m -

  "<p>You would expect the families of the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/aurora-shooting\" title=\"\">recent Aurora shootings</a> to be angry and distressed. However, five weeks after the horrific events that led to the deaths of 12 people, the most recent recipient of the families' anger was something of a surprise, as they publicly criticised those managing the <a href=\"https://givingfirst.org/index.php?action=dynamic&amp;cmsID=36&amp;section=content\" title=\"\">victim relief fund</a>.</p> <p>During their press conference on Tuesday, Tom Teves, father of Alex Teves, 24, who was killed during the shootings, read a statement that was scathing of the management of the Aurora Victim Relief Fund. He said the fund organisers had used 'the names and faces of our loved ones, supposedly on their behalf' to raise more than $5m. Ten non-profits in the Aurora area have had funds directed to them, he went on, when the families were \"certain that everyone who donated their hard-earned wages intended for 100% of the donations to go directly to the victims \u2026 Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.\"</p> <p>Establishing disaster or victim relief funds are by necessity conducted in difficult circumstances and in a hurry, to maximise public interest and then disperse funds as quickly as possible. However, aside from their view of their treatment at the hands of trustees of the relief fund (who have since announced that victims will receive all the money donated), the Aurora families' anger may have been further exacerbated by other instances of online fundraising in the wake of the disaster, where some enterprising families and friends of victims took proceedings into their own hands.</p> <p>Petra Anderson's sister featured in a video on crowdfunding site <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/\" title=\"\">Indiegogo</a> calling out directly for funds to support her medical costs, along with those of those of her mother, who also required cancer treatment. The appeal raised \u00a3265,000.</p> <p>The parents and friend of another victim, Farrah Soudani, also set up a crowdfunding campaign for her on crowdfunding site<a href=\"http://www.gofundme.com/\" title=\"\"> GoFundMe</a>, which raised $170,000. However, independently of this, Farrah's older brother also set up his own website, which \u2013 with other fundraising efforts \u2013 has also reportedly raised over $95,000. The two sides have now fallen out over how the money will be administered but, as Tom Teves might say, at least the money is in their hands.</p> <p>Stepping back from the Aurora tragedy, these sites point to a wider trend \u2013 particularly in the US \u2013 of individuals using new technologies to call out directly for funds for self-identified need, for an ever-widening range of activity. As an online donor, you can give directly to a homeless person, help a teenager to go on an international cheerleading trip, or even support women who want to augment their breasts.</p> <p>As individuals are using publicly available channels to call out to meet their self-expressed need, this presents new questions for the online donor. Whereas before you may have given to a charity working to address a cause you care about, you now have more personalised options.</p> <p>Do you donate to an animal rescue charity? Or pay directly for a dog's medical bills? Do you contribute to a hardship fund, or give directly to a family who say they need a car to get around more easily? Do you support cystic fibrosis research, or fund a new lung for somebody in need? The people who have donated to these projects have clearly made up their minds, deciding that they would rather give directly to a personal case instead of to a charity intermediary addressing the underlying cause.</p> <p>At base level, most of these examples underline some pretty core fundraising principles: if you have an emotionally powerful \"ask\", good reach and an easy mechanism for giving, you can raise money (the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/karen-klein-bus-monitor-bullied-online-campaign\" title=\"\">Karen Klein story</a> is perhaps the most powerful example of this).</p> <p>Beyond that, though, there are some more compelling questions. Why have these sites been started? Is the visibility of where your money goes the driving force behind their growth, or does it touch at all upon mistrust of charities? Each of these sites incurs payment costs (publicly stated), but are these more palatable than payments to charities for open appeals with unknown administration costs? Are charities alive to the potential threat of these new channels to hoover up their online donors? Or can they harness them to raise awareness of people within their networks who could benefit? And what of the potential for fraud? How do you know that the money you donate is used for the cause you think you're giving to?</p> <p>As existing sites gain more reach, and if more of these trends travel across the Atlantic, we'll surely find out. It will be interesting to see how charities and online donors respond.</p> <p><em>Andy Hamflett is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.spring-giving.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Spring Giving</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Benita Veliz, a young Hispanic \"Dreamer\" from San Antonio in Texas, struck a blow for immigrant rights when she became the first undocumented person to address a national political convention.</p> <p>Veliz \u2013 Benny to friends \u2013 openly and unashamedly proclaimed her unauthorised status in front of millions of American TV viewers. She told them she was brought to the US from Mexico as a child and has lived here ever since.</p> <p>She graduated at the top of her class aged 16 and went on to earn a double major four years later. \"I know I have something to contribute to the economy and my country, and I feel just as American as any of my friends or neighbours.\"</p> <p>In 2009 Veliz came close to being deported back to Mexico after she came into the Texas authorities' purview for a minor traffic violation. \"I've had to live almost my entire life knowing I could be deported because of the way I came here,\" she told the convention.</p> <p>Veliz is one of thousands of Hispanics aged 15 to 30 who will be able to take advantage of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/obama-stop-deportation-undocumented-immigrants\">executive order declared by President Obama in June</a>. The deferred action order, dubbed \"dream relief\", will allow young undocumented immigrants to put off the threat of deportation for two years to allow them to pursue studies and work opportunities.</p> <p>\"President Obama fought for the Dream Act to help people like me,\" said Velix, who is now studying at St Mary's university in San Antonio. \"When Congress refused to support it, he didn't give up.\"</p> <p>Veliz's audacious appearance in front of millions of Americans is the most high-profile example yet of a growing determination on the part of young undocumented Hispanics to come out of the shadows and announce themselves as a proud part of the American family. Some 11 million people are living in America without permission, about 60% of whom are of Mexican origin.</p> <p>Her address is the second time in two days that the Texan city of San Antonio, the seventh most populous city in the US, was put on the map at the convention. On Tuesday the city's mayor, Julian Castro, delivered the keynote speech.</p> <p>The euphoria among immigrant groups surrounding Veliz's address was dampened a little by news out of Arizona that broke just a couple of hours earlier. A federal judge gave the green light to the most controversial part of the notorious SB 1070 law \u2013 the clause dubbed the \"show me your papers\" provision \u2013 that instructs police to investigate the immigration status of anyone they deem suspicious of being undocumented who they come across in the course of other policing matters.</p> <p>SB 1070 was signed into law in 2010 but quickly put on ice following legal challenges that pushed the law up to the US supreme court. It unleashed a storm of hostile measures directed against undocumented immigrants that swept across Southern legislatures.</p> <p>Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah all scrambled to follow Arizona's example. In turn, those anti-illegal immigration laws provided the inspiration for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential challenger, who advocated the \"self-deportation\" of millions of people.</p> <p>It is not known precisely when the \"show me your papers\" law will now come into effect in Arizona, but it is expected to be within the next two weeks. When SB 1070 was first introduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/hispanics-flee-arizona-immigration-law\">it led to virtual panic </a>among unauthorised Hispanic families, with thousands fleeing the state.</p>",
  "<p>Patrons in a packed Arthur Ashe stadium rose to acclaim the departure of Andy Roddick, from the tournament and the game, after a typically combative struggle, losing in three and a quarter hours to Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro.</p> <p>The score, 6-7, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4, accurately told the story of the roller-coaster exit, Roddick starting in a blaze when the notoriously slow-to-engage Argentinian was unfocused, followed by the inevitable decline on tired legs before one last burst at the end, something typical to remember him by.</p> <p>He cried on court, uncontrollably, and spoke eloquently and candidly about his 13 years in tennis. \"I haven't always been easy on you guys,\" he said in scatter-gun reference to fans, journalists and opponents, the latter of whom have felt the more relevant point of his sword on court, \"but I have loved every minute of it.\"</p> <p>When he faced the media a little while later, the respected octogenarian writer Bud Collins asked for colleagues to break protocol and give Roddick a round of applause. The response was instantaneous and loud.</p> <p>\"Thanks, Bud,\" Roddick said.Asked what was his most rewarding experience, he said: \"I was consistent and I don't feel like I left a lot on the table on a daily basis. When I look back, that's what I'm proud of.\"</p> <p>Del Potro, in halting English, was equally heartfelt: \"It was really tough moment for me and for him, also. Last point of his life. The crowd was amazing for both players. I really enjoyed in that way, but it wasn't easy for me to play. I had to close the match with my serve.\"</p> <p>The result might have been predictable but it was nonetheless engrossing for that. Roddick, the last American to win a slam title, here in 2003, will be missed and there is a sense that, just turned 30, he is leaving too early.</p> <p>Injuries and indifferent form have plagued him for the past couple of years and when he started losing to players he previously would have beaten easily, doubt entered his tennis. And Roddick was never one to harbour self-doubt.</p> <p>Elsewhere the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, was glad of an easy afternoon's work when Stanislas Wawrinka retired for health reasons when trailing 6-4, 6-1, 3-1 after a little over an hour and a half. The Serb has cruised through this tournament almost unnoticed, having given up only 20 games in his four matches on the way to the quarter-finals, where he will meet Del Potro.</p>"
