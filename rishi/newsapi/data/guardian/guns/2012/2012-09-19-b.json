  "<p>At one time, between the ages of seven and 12, I believe I was among the south-east's foremost creme brulee experts. In the 80s and early 90s, it seemed to be on every dessert menu \u2013 and if it was there, I had to have it. But, even at that age, I recognised that not all brulees were created equal. The best had a crisp shell that shattered satisfyingly under my spoon and a rich, smooth layer of custard beneath with just a whisper of vanilla. Any softness on the top, or graininess in the custard was not tolerated \u2013 although, as a professional, I always cleaned the dish regardless.</p> <p>Great was my childish joy when I learned that this dish <a href=\"http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodpuddings.html#brulee\">was in fact British</a> \u2013 the usual story attributes it to Trinity College in Cambridge, which boasts a dedicated branding iron in the shape of the college crest. But in fact, Jane Grigson, suspicious of the late date (1860s) given for this event in Florence White's <em>Good Things in England</em>, uncovered a trail of recipes leading back to a 17th century manuscript book. As she notes, \"custards made from eggs and cream were a European commonplace\" at the time, so it would be pitifully jingoistic to try and claim the entire thing for Queen and country \u2013 but perhaps we might take the credit for the inspired addition of the caramel. Which, I think you'll agree, is what really makes the dish.</p> <h2>Cream and eggs: dairy to dream</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348067938278/Mrs-Raffald-recipe-creme--002.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs Raffald recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mrs Raffald recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the name suggests, dairy of some sort is the key ingredient of creme brulee. Claire Clark, in her book <em>Indulge</em>, and Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham in <em>The Prawn Cocktail Years</em> use double cream, which makes sense, as this is to be a thick custard. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/chefs/mary-berry/creme-brulee-recipe\">Mary Berry goes for single instead</a> in her <em>Traditional Puddings and Desserts</em>, and <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> a mixture of whipping cream and milk. Heston Blumenthal sticks with just milk. Claire's brulee has the best texture \u2013 firm, yet not in the least rubbery: Mary's is (I hate to say it) slightly too liquid, while Heston's, perhaps because of the vast number of egg yolks he puts in, is solid, but rather jellied. Larousse I will deal with later.</p> <p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2003/sep/27/foodanddrink.shopping\">Heston's brulee</a> is so rich with eggs that I can't face going back for a second spoonful, an unprecedented occurrence. I think I could probably manage a good half of Claire's, despite the nine yolks she puts in there \u2013 like Lindsey and Simon's, it's eggy, but not overpoweringly sweet. I prefer the creamier, lighter flavour of Mary's brulee though, so I decide to reduce the number of yolks and see whether I can achieve the same texture without such richness \u2013 3 seems about right for 300ml of cream.</p> <p><a href=\"http://neilcooksgrigson.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/291-burnt-cream-or-creme-brulee.html\">Elizabeth Raffald's 1769 recipe</a>, reproduced in Jane Grigson's <em>English Food</em>, uses egg whites as well as yolks, beaten separately and added to the custard along with a spoonful of flour. This gives her custard more body, but a slightly off-putting paste-like texture and colour. </p> <h2>The sugar</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466907\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348069151159/Mary-Berry-recipe-creme-b-002.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Berry recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Berry recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone but Larousse uses caster sugar in their custards (they go for icing sugar, possibly because it dissolves more easily, but it doesn't seem to make much difference in their case). Mary and Larousse switch to demerara to top the brulees however, which I like \u2013 the slightly larger grains might not melt to such a smooth, mirror-like consistency but they stay nicely crunchy and give the top a distinctive burnt toffee flavour. I need a happy medium between Heston's sickly 60g and Simon and Lindsey's parsimonious 1 tbsp \u2013 after a little experimentation, 15g for this amount of cream seems to work well.</p> <h2>The flavourings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466908\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348069432354/Heston-Blumenthal-recipe--002.jpg\" alt=\"Heston Blumenthal recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heston Blumenthal recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vanilla is, of course, the usual choice here. Heston's three pods seem excessive - he claims he serves this dish in espresso cups, but it's so intensely flavoured that a teaspoon would seem a more appropriate vehicle. Mrs Raffald uses lemon peel and orange flower water, both of which are rather nice as ideas \u2013 but have no place in the classic brulee. Heston suggests jasmine tea, infused in the hot milk before it's strained on to the egg yolks \u2013 also pleasant, although it does give the custard a slightly strange brownish tinge.</p> <h2>The method</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466909\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348069525694/Claire-Clark-recipe-creme-002.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Clark recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Clark recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the recipes I try \u2013 Claire Clark, Heston, Mary Berry \u2013 involve pouring hot milk or cream on to egg yolks and sugar, mixing them together and then sticking the resulting custard in the oven for half an hour. I can't believe how easy it is: had I known creme brulee was so quick, I'd have gorged myself silly long ago. But Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham have other ideas: \"it seems that creme brulee is made differently these days,\" they write disapprovingly. \"Once upon a time one was instructed to make the custard in the traditional way, cooked very gently in a pan until thick.\"</p> <p>Of course, they say, it's easier to control the cooking time if one takes the easy way out, but \"it does not give the same texture as the stove-top method\". For their recipe, then, I heat the cream with a vanilla pod, leave it to infuse for a while, then pour it on to the egg yolks and sugar and return the whole lot to a pan and heat until it thickens \"to an almost jelly-like consistency\", rather like in Mrs Raffald's recipe. This is then ready to chill. Simon and Lindsey describe the results as \"voluptuous\" but I think I prefer the light wobbliness of the baked versions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466910\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348069612174/Simon-Hopkinson-and-Linds-002.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Larousse pique my interest by not bothering to heat the cream before whisking it into the eggs \u2013 according to the instructions, which I re-read several times in the light of subsequent events, the whole lot goes into the oven cold. After 30 minutes (no leeway given here) they come out, the consistency of creme anglaise. Nor do they thicken at all during chilling. I suspect a step may have been missed out of the English translation \u2013 unless anyone can throw any light on this unusual method?</p> <h2>Baking and bruleeing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466911\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348069333483/Larousse-Gastronomiques-r-002.jpg\" alt=\"Larousse Gastronomique's recipe creme brulee\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larousse Gastronomique's recipe creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of those brulees which make it into the oven, temperatures range from 160C from Mary Berry to 100C for Larousse's culinary disaster. Claire Clark's 150C, with a cold water bain marie, as opposed to the hot specified by Mary and Heston, seems to work perfectly. I'm not quite sure why Mary butters her ramekins either \u2013 she seems a practical lady, so perhaps it makes them easier to clean?</p> <p>Mary, Larousse and Mrs Raffald call for the brulees to be grilled, but if you have a blowtorch, it's much easier to control the heat \u2013 and, because it's quicker, you won't have to wait for the custard to cool again before serving (the cool creaminess beneath the crunchy topping being surely one of the glories of this inspired dish.) Simon and Lindsey reckon spraying the sugar with water helps the caramelisation process, but I find exactly the opposite. I blame the blowtorch.</p> <h2>Perfect creme brulee</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396466912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348068201371/Felicitys-perfect-creme-b-006.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect creme brulee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect creme brulee. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For some reason, a bowl of custard isn't seen as an appropriate dessert for a grown adult \u2013 but scorch the top and give it a French name, and it's suddenly all sophisticated. Good served with banana, nevertheless.</p> <p>Makes 2</p> <p><strong>300ml double cream<br>1 vanilla pod<br>3 egg yolks<br>15g caster sugar<br>1 tbsp demerara sugar</strong><br> <br>1. Preheat the oven to 150C and put 2 small ovenproof ramekins in a baking tin. Pour the cream into a small, heavy-based pan and slit the vanilla pod in half lengthways. Scrape out the seeds and put the pod and the seeds into the pan with the cream. Bring to the boil over a medium-low heat.<br> <br>2. Meanwhile put the yolks and caster sugar into a medium-sized heatproof bowl and stir until just combined. When the cream begins to boil, remove the vanilla pod and then pour the cream on to the yolk and sugar mix, stirring constantly to mix.</p> <p>3. Divide the mixture between the ramekins and pour cold water into the tin until it comes two-thirds of the way up the ramekins. Bake for about 40 minutes until the custard is set \u2013 it should only wobble faintly when shaken. Cool and then chill until cold.<br> <br>4. Scatter the tops of the cold brulees with demerara sugar, and use a blowtorch or hot grill to caramelise the tops \u2013 if using a grill, you may need to put them back in the fridge for half an hour before serving to cool down again.</p> <p>Creme brulee or burnt cream \u2013 where do you stand on its origins? Would you <a href=\"http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Creme-Brulee-Origins\">claim it for Spain</a> instead \u2013 or even, as Julia Child insists, Creole Louisiana? Should they be strongly flavoured or sumptuously plain, and which other classic desserts are surprisingly easy to make?</p>",

But Martin, his wife told the Guardian, will battle on for the right to die.</p> <p>\"He is adamant \u2013 he has been since he had his stroke,\" said his wife, who asked to be called Felicity. \"What he wants has never changed.\"</p> <p>Martin, 47, spends his days lying on a specially adapted bed in the converted garage of the house they share. He can communicate only by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/18/man-in-assisted-suicide-case?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">picking out letters on a computer screen with his eyes</a>, which a disembodied voice turns into words and phrases. He watches videos of Cornish lighthouses, remembering the helicopter trip of a lifetime he once made to Wolf Rock off Land's End. The rest of the time he watches rugby, steam trains and action films. \"He is just into RoboCop,\" said his wife. \"He used to be an action man. He was always up and ready to go.\"</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/18/man-in-assisted-suicide-case?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">an interview with the Guardian last year</a>, prior to the high court case, Martin described his life as \"garbage\". Asked what he wanted, he replied \"death\".</p> <p>Martin wants to be able to go to Dignitas in Switzerland, where he could legally be given a lethal cocktail of drugs to end his life. But Felicity, a nurse by training, says she will not and cannot help him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/aug/18/assisted-suicide-could-be-legalised\" title=\"\">The case prepared by Leigh Day, Martin's lawyers, asked the court to rule that professional people \u2013 lawyers, doctors and carers \u2013 should be allowed to help him make his final journey</a>. In the case brought in 2009 by Debbie Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis, the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, gave an assurance that her husband, Omar Puente, was unlikely to face prosecution if he helped her travel to Dignitas. But Starmer's concession on family members does not extend to paid professional helpers, the court decided in Martin's case.</p> <p>Rosa Curling of Leigh Day said they would argue in the appeal that the lower court was wrong. \"If you are a professional who helps somebody like Martin, there is a real risk you will be prosecuted. That can't be right,\" she said.</p> <p>The case is different from that brought by Nicklinson, whose widow Jane also says she wishes to appeal. Nicklinson's lawyers argued that a doctor who gave him a lethal drug in the UK should not be prosecuted for murder. The judges said that was an issue for parliament and not the courts.</p> <p>There was one positive element in the judgment. The court ruled that if Martin were to refuse food and drink, he could legally be given pain relief and sedatives by doctors. That, said Felicity, \"has given him some sort of peace. He hasn't changed, but there is a calmness in him now, knowing that he could stop eating and drinking. But it is not the nicest way to end your life for the family or for Martin. It is quite a long-winded and horrible thing.\"</p> <p>She accepts there are some people with locked-in syndrome who would not want to die. \"But for some people it is intolerable to live the life that you hate,\" she said. \"You don't have control over what you do; you can't even scratch an itch. I don't think people realise the devastating effects it has on the person and the family. It is unimaginable.\"</p> <p>When she talks about the impact of the strain and the distress on the family, Felicity begins to cry. Martin has to have 24-hour care, which means sharing their home and their lives with strangers, she says. She has to go out to work part-time to pay the bills. Martin, a proud man, has been stripped of his dignity. He has mood swings and can be angry and then tearful. \"Crying is something he never used to do. He was quite a butch man before, but he can get so frustrated,\" she said. He is not the man she used to know \u2013 that man died four years ago, she says, when he had his massive brainstem stroke.</p> <p>But she does not want to lose him. \"I don't want him to die, but I have to respect his wishes,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Cohabiting couples are for the first time as likely to have children as those who marry, according to a report on changing family relationships in the UK published on Thursday.</p> <p>Cohabitation is increasingly seen as an alternative for long-term relationships and raising children, rather than as a \"trial run\" before marriage, the study commissioned by the Co-operative's new family law service suggests.</p> <p>A significant proportion of those who have not married, however, are unaware of their rights because the law has failed to keep up with social change, Christina Blacklaws, of the Co-operative Legal Services, warns.</p> <p>The evidence of shifting parenting patterns emerges in data extracted from the 2001 and 2011 censuses. It has been assembled by Dr Esm\u00e9e Hanna and Dr David Grainger, both of Leeds University, who specialise in family relationship changes over time.</p> <p>Their research reveals a 34% increase in the number of cohabiting couples with dependent children in the 10 years to 2011. Over that period, the total number of cohabiting families with dependent children \u2013 those aged under 18 \u2013 increased by 292,000, while the number of married couples with dependent children fell by 319,000.</p> <p>Last year, 38% of cohabiting couples were parents \u2013 the same percentage as married couples with children. Of live births in 2010, 31% were to women cohabiting with but not married to their partner \u2013 up from 25% in 2001. There are still more married couples with children than cohabiting couples with children in the UK.</p> <p>The rapid changes are reflected in a survey commissioned for the report showing that 52% believe marriage is not important providing that parents are in a committed relationship. Only 27%, according to the survey of more than 2,000 adults carried out by YouGov, take the more traditional view that couples should be married before having children.</p> <p>Despite increasing social acceptance, the report acknowledges that cohabiting couple families continue to be less stable than married couple families. A higher proportion of all family breakdowns involve young children from unmarried parents, the research reveals.</p> <p>There is also substantial confusion over the legal rights of cohabiting couples as compared to married couples. Of adults questioned, over a quarter, 26%, believe cohabiting couples have the same rights as married couples when it comes to child custody, 22% when it comes to property and 21% when it comes to finances.</p> <p>Hanna and Grainger commented: \"Part of the decline in marriage in recent years can perhaps be explained by the increase in cohabitation as a family format, with ever more couples choosing to live together. And as the number of cohabiting couples increases, they are increasingly seen as a socially legitimate family environment for childbearing.\"</p> <p>Blacklaws, who is director of family law at the Co-operative Legal Services, said: \"Although many people still believe they have rights as common-law spouses, there is no such status in law. As a result, some cohabiting families may find themselves facing real difficulties should they split up, particularly when there are children involved.</p> <p>\"It is clear that this area of family law is in urgent need of an overhaul. However, in the meantime, people need to think carefully about how they protect themselves and their families \u2013 preferably by reaching and signing agreements about what would happen if you did split up. This could save a huge amount of cost and heartache if the worst happens.\"</p>",
  "<p>The United Kingdom's record of slowly improving judicial diversity has been dealt a severe blow by a comparative European report revealing that only Azerbaijan and Armenia employ fewer female professional judges. Despite what the study describes as a gradual \"feminisation of the judiciary resulting in a near gender equality\" across the continent and its eastern borders, only 23% of judges in England and Wales and 21% of judges in Scotland are women.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/evaluation/2012/Rapport_en.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> released on Thursday by the Council of Europe examines the \"efficiency and quality of European justice systems\". It will be considered at a conference in Vienna attended by the UK's new justice minister, Jeremy Wright, and other national justice ministers.</p> <p>The Council of Europe, which oversees the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, has 47 members among which are Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Iceland and Switzerland as well as the EU's constituent states. The 442-page report examines numerous aspects of judicial and court operations, noting that supreme court judges in England and Wales are among the highest paid, earning \u20ac243,190 (\u00a3197,750) a year. Only their counterparts in Ireland, on \u20ac257,872, and Switzerland, \u20ac264,000, are better paid. In Albania, the highest judges of the land have to sustain their intellectual rigour on only \u20ac14,700 a year. Judges are also far rarer in the UK than in other states. England and Wales have only 3.6 professional judges per 100,000people; only Scotland and Wales have fewer. (That is likely to be a reflection of the UK's extensive reliance on lay magistrates.) In central Europe, judges are thick on the ground: there are nearly 50 members of the judiciary per 100,000 people.</p> <p>England and Wales emerges as by far the most generous jurisdiction in terms of the average amount of legal aid allocated per case, \u20ac3,551, in 2010. The nearest other states came to it were Ireland, \u20ac1,351, and Austria, \u20ac1,029. The UK government has slashed back legal aid spending on civil cases by \u00a3350m since then; the savings are due to come into effect next year.</p> <p>But it is the detailed, comparative statistics on gender equality on the bench that will make most embarrassing reading for the Ministry of Justice. Women predominate in places such as Slovenia where they constitute 78% of judges, in Greece where they make up 65% and France where they are 64%.</p> <p>By comparison, less than a quarter of the professional bench in the UK are female. That proportion is only lower in Armenia, slightly fewer than 23%, and Azerbaijan, where the figure is just 9%.</p> <p>\"From a general point of view, it is possible to see a feminisation of the judiciary resulting in a near gender equality, with an average for all states or entities of 52% men and 48% women,\" the Council of Europe report states.</p> <p>\"However, to make equality between women and men a reality in practice, some additional efforts are needed: among the responding states, a general trend of decrease in the percentage of women judges in comparison with men judges as one moves up the judicial hierarchy should be noted.\"</p> <p>Only last week the MoJ released a report entitled <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/policy/moj/improving-judicial-diversity-judicial-diversity-taskforce-annual-report\" title=\"\">Improving Judicial Diversity</a> praising its judicial diversity taskforce for implementing \"20 of the 53 recommendations\" made by Lady Neuberger on how to encourage more women to enter the profession.</p> <p>In March, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/28/select-committee-seeks-diverse-judiciary\" title=\"\">House of Lords constitution committee published a report </a>proposing that targets to appoint more judges from among women and members of the ethnic minorities should be considered if the judiciary does not make itself more diverse within the next five years.</p> <p>The crime and courts bill, currently before parliament, introduces a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/19/tie-break-diversity-judges-ken-clarke\">tie-breaker principle</a> that where two judicial candidates of equal merit the one from a less represented group on the bench may be selected.</p> <p>An MoJ spokesperson said: \"Becoming a judge must be, and must be seen to be, open to everyone with the right skills and qualities - and progress is being made.</p> <p>\"However, progress has been slow which is why we are making further changes. The crime and courts bill will introduce flexible working at the high court and above, to open up judicial careers to those with caring responsibilities.

There was nothing exceptional about the summons to a burglary that they received on that morning, no indication of the gun and grenade attack that lay in stall; but then of course it was never likely that the sort of twisted mind that could want to draw officers into harm's way would provide a tip-off. Such things are mercifully rare \u2013 until Tuesday only seven officers had been shot dead in the line of duty in Britain over two decades \u2013 yet they can and do happen sometimes. As well as encountering the occasional real-life horror, the police routinely have to overcome the demons of the imagination about what lurks round the corner. That requires courage of a sort that few other professions demand.</p> <p>There will be specific questions about whether any undue operational risks were run on Tuesday, and the grieving families of the two women will be naturally anxious to know about whether the Greater Manchester force did all that it could to take precautions against \u2013 and alert its members about \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/police-officers-gun-grenade-attack\" title=\"\">fugitive who was at large</a> in the area. Aside from underlining how much respect officers deserve, however, the implications of this terrible strike of lightning for wider policing policy are less clear.

We can only hope that the new breed of <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/\" title=\"\">elected police chiefs</a> who will be voted in for the first time this autumn will demonstrate the same sort of judgment in a crisis.</p> <p>There has been much wrong with policing in the past, and it is dangerous to imagine that bad practice has been banished from policing present. But even those who rarely or never call on the service directly rely upon its work in keeping society safe. The best tribute to Ms Bone and Ms Hughes is to reflect upon that, and most especially the role of the community strain of policing which they embodied.</p> <p>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be opened to comments</p>",
  "<p>Ken Clarke has blamed Tony Blair's \"disastrous war on terror\" for the need to introduce secret courts to protect sensitive intelligence material.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/justice-and-security-bill-on-track\" title=\"\">Guardian article</a>, the former justice secretary says that armed conflicts begun under Blair have prompted a rise in compensation cases from former detainees who allegemistreatment.</p> <p>The intervention by Clarke highlights Tory divisions over Afghanistan and Iraq after military action was launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Clarke voted against the Iraq war in 2003 while David Cameron voted in favour.</p> <p>Clarke uses language that is unlikely ever to be used by the prime minister. \"Most people are aware that Tony Blair's disastrous war on terror has resulted in a substantial rise in individuals, often former detainees, bringing compensation cases against the UK government alleging mistreatment,\" he writes.</p> <p>Clarke brands critics of the government's justice and security bill, which will usher in secret courts, as \"reactionary parts of the human rights lobby\". He says it is necessary to introduce the new measures to ensure intelligence material can be admitted as evidence without risk of exposing it to the public domain.</p> <p>Under Clarke's plans such intelligence would be heard by a judge but not by claimants or their lawyers. The judge would in effect be obliged to obey a minister's request for information to be kept secret on grounds of \"national security\".</p> <p>The bill was drawn up after the court of appeal agreed to disclose CIA information which showed that MI5 and MI6 knew Binyam Mohamed, a British resident was abused and subjected to inhuman treatment while held as a terror suspect. It was also prompted by UK citizens suing the government for compensation after being held in Guantanamo Bay.</p> <p>Ministers, including Clarke, argue that the bill \u2013 pressed for by MI5, MI6 and the US government specifically to stop the kind of disclosures about their activities made in the Mohamed and other civil cases \u2013 would not be used as a cover up.</p> <p>The bill does not mark a \"shady move\" by the state to \"cloak the dark forces lurking deep within government,\" Clarke writes. \"Far from extending secrecy, allowing cover-ups or switching off the lights, done right, this bill will for the first time extend justice into the most secret activities of the UK state.\"</p> <p>Clarke rallies to the defence of the plans after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/secret-justice-back-to-black\" title=\"\">Guardian reported</a> that he would no longer be responsible for the justice and security bill after his demotion in the recent cabinet reshuffle. He will in fact retain control of the bill, allowing his successor Chris Grayling to focus on a more traditional Tory law and order agenda.</p> <p>Clarke writes: \"My new title of minister without portfolio has given my activities an amusing air of mystery. But still I was surprised to see that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/secret-justice-back-to-black\" title=\"\">Monday's Guardian editorial</a> stripped me of future responsibility for what the more reactionary parts of the human rights lobby have nicknamed my 'secret courts' bill.\"</p> <p>He says he supports the changes because he is an instinctive liberal. \"A stalwart supporter of the British judiciary who are the best in the world. In my opinion it is a travesty that they can't give judgment in the very cases which raise the most serious questions about the way we are governed and the nature of our democracy.</p> <p>\"The result is that we have no answers to shocking allegations made against British agents. And we are potentially putting the taxpayer in the situation of paying out significant sums to individuals who could be linked to terrorism simply because crucial evidence cannot be brought before a judge.\"</p> <p>Clarke insists there will be safeguards to ensure there is no \"mission creep\". He writes: \"The judge and not the executive will have to take the key decisions about whether a closed hearing is justified. Even if they do allow a closed hearing in principle they will retain the power to order the government to disclose material, or to remove it entirely from the courtroom because it is prejudicial or not in fact national security sensitive at all. Clearly, any suggestion that these closed hearings would make anything secret which is in the public domain now is emphatically wrong.\"</p> <p>The intervention by the former justice secretary comes as the Liberal Democrat leadership braces itself for a backlash at next week's conference in Brighton. The latest conference agenda, published on Wednesday, reveals an attempt to quash a motion calling for the withdrawal of and opposition to the justice and security bill.</p> <p>An amendment, to be moved by the LibDem peer Lord Marks, has now been tabled backing the bill which echoes the government line. It says only that secret hearings should be used as a \"last resort\" and \"to the bare minimum necessary to safeguard national security\".</p>",
  "<p>Amid fears of a falling marriage rate, Iranian authorities are taking the unusual step of preparing the ground to give permission for the country's first spouse-finding website.</p> <p>Iran has widespread online censorship and access to social networking websites, including Facebook and Twitter, as well as dating forums is blocked, but sports and youth minister, Mohammad Abbasi, has announced that spouse-finding websites might soon be authorised.</p> <p>\"It's the ministry for culture and Islamic guidance that is in charge of granting permissions to websites,\" Abbasi told reporters on Tuesday, according to the conservative news website <a href=\"http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/244195/society/family\">Khabaronline.ir</a>.</p> <p>\"When the new marriage law is ratified, the ministry of sports and youth will hold talks with the cultural ministry in order to give permissions to spouse-finding websites,\" he added. </p> <p>The minister warned that people are marrying and divorcing later in certain parts of the country, including the capital Tehran. </p> <p>\"To tackle this problem, we have to find new ways and use all our opportunities to promote a long-lasting and easy marriage,\" he said.</p> <p>Other unprecedented news surrounding marriage and family in Iran includes a decision in July by the government to slash the country's birth-control programmes after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-07-29/iran-baby-boom/56576830/1\">attacked family planning policies</a> and said the population should go up to 200 million. </p> <p>In January, Iran <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/05/iran-clamps-down-internet-use\">stepped up its clampdown on the internet</a> by introducing draconian rules on cybercafes and preparations to launch a national internet.</p> <p>The new measures, imposed by the police, required cafe owners to check the identity cards of their customers before providing services. </p> <p>\"Internet cafes are required to write down the forename, surname, name of the father, national identification number, postcode and telephone number of each customer,\" said an Iranian police statement at the time. </p> <p>More than 5m websites are filtered in Iran, but many Iranians access blocked addresses with help from proxy websites or virtual private network services. </p> <p>An Iranian official said last year that more than 17 million Iranians have Facebook accounts, although the site remains blocked in Iran.</p>",
  "<p>The French state-owned rail company SNCF will start phasing out its Rail Europe brands on Thursday as it launches a pan-European website as part of what should be a simpler booking process for passengers wishing to travel across the continent.</p> <p>While rail remains at the heart of the SNCF business, the extension of the French Voyages-sncf.com brand across Europe and the imminent launch of new apps and associated sites, underlines the company's move to become a broader transport and travel provider.</p> <p>Passengers are expected to benefit from a swifter, more extensive, booking system. But the increased investment in online booking is also a defensive move given concern that internet companies such as Google could usurp the online sales market.</p> <p>SNCF president's, Guillaume Pepy, recently said the interests of consumers and the travel industry could be undermined by apparently neutral, but dominant, search engines that might control information and potentially charge operators.</p> <p>The launch of Google Flight, in particular, which has some element of paid inclusion in its search results, has implications that alarm the French rail operators.</p> <p>Yves Tyrode, managing director of Voyages-sncf.com, which recorded sales of \u20ac3.3bn in 2011, said that its own relaunch and online innovation would allow the firm \"to become a key player in e-travel in the face of worldwide competition by powerful stakeholders\".</p> <p>The company will also launch a site early in 2013 that will combine different forms of transport between any two fixed points, allowing customers to book cars and purchase travel options, including rail tickets and flights from more than 180 European airlines.</p> <p>Barbara Dalibard, head of SNCF voyages, said there was still work to be done integrating the rail ticketing systems before the full goal was achieved: \"We need to make sure our customers can travel from the north of Europe to the south on one standard ticket.\"</p> <p>E-ticketing, via the 4.5m mobile apps so far downloaded, is expected to expand out across the continent from France's high-speed network.</p> <p>Customers outside Europe will continue to be directed to websites with the Rail Europe brand.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Robshaw has already learned to expect the unexpected as England's captain, but he found himself in uncharted territory in the Forest of Dean on Wednesday. When the Rugby Football Union chose Drybrook RFC in Gloucestershire as the venue for its latest kit launch it never imagined the specially invited audience would include a member of the local pigeon racing club and a representative of the Wild Oats morris dancing troupe.</p> <p>To Robshaw's credit he did not bat an eyelid at his gloriously incongruous surroundings, which is one reason why Stuart Lancaster picked him as captain in the first place. In just over six weeks' time England will be commencing the autumn Test series, and learning how to make pigeons fly home faster will not be pivotal to beating the Wallabies, Springboks and All Blacks in November and December.</p> <p>Robshaw is also fully aware England cannot afford to start slowly or blame injuries for a sluggish return if they wish to secure a top-four ranking and a more favourable World Cup pool draw on home soil in 2015. It is now looking probable that Ben Foden will miss some or all of his country's four autumn Tests with an ankle problem and Tom Croft, Ben Youngs and Alex Corbisiero are among those yet to play so far this season.</p> <p>If England want to challenge the southern hemisphere's finest consistently, Robshaw insists they must rise above such inconveniences. \"We're not going to use anything like that as an excuse,\" said the Harlequins captain. \"It is about winning \u2026 that's what we're judged on. The end goal is the 2015 World Cup and we all know where we want to be then. But it's also about the here and now. We want to go out and hopefully win every game.</p> <p>\"Of course the likes of Ben Foden and Tom Croft would be massive losses, but it gives an opportunity to other players to come in. We have to have faith that those who come in are not just going to do a good job but a great job. If you look at New Zealand, they have world-class players even if they have to go two players deep. That's where you want to be as a national side, having two or three quality players in every position who will hopefully exceed all expectations.\"</p> <p>Robshaw also spoke pertinently and sensibly about the dangers of being a well-known sportsman in the public eye, following the weekend incident in which Chris Ashton suffered facial cuts while on an evening out in London. Both England and Ashton's club, Saracens, have absolved the winger of any blame and Robshaw believes it would be seriously counter-productive if rugby players were encouraged never to venture beyond their own living rooms.</p> <p>\"We're out there in the spotlight and, unfortunately, that brings good and bad things,\" said Robshaw, whose table-topping Harlequins side play Leicester on Saturday. \"We have to be sensible about managing it but if you isolate players it's not good for the game. There are some incidents you can't control but as rugby players we need to be seen. It's what people love about the sport.</p> <p>\"You don't want to be locked away at home and not be able to go out. You've got to be able to relax. Hopefully this was a minor incident which won't happen again.\"</p> <p>The only risk to Robshaw was being speared by an autograph hunter's pen as Drybrook residents took the rare opportunity to mix with their heroes. For keen students of kit fashion, England have reverted to basics in their choice of gear after parting company with the long-time kit supplier Nike and signing a four-year deal with Canterbury.</p> <p>The clean-looking white shirt will please traditionalists, as will the decision to revert to the old-school dark blue socks with white tops worn by the 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning team. The slogan \"England Connected\" has been sewn into the lining to reflect the management's desire for the team to unite all sections of the game.</p> <p>The black change shirt which ruffled feathers in New Zealand has also been ditched in favour of a colour officially described as regal purple.</p> <p>Some onlookers argued it was more a case of magenta or cerise but the Arsenal-supporting Robshaw, predictably, is a fan. It could be that the jersey also proves popular with members of the RFU council. If you are prone to spilling red wine down your front, this is definitely the shirt for you.</p>",
  "<p>The US justice department's inspector general has cleared the attorney general, Eric Holder, of Republican accusations he had prior knowledge of a botched operation that shipped hundreds of weapons to Mexican drug cartels that were later used in killings.</p> <p>But a senior official resigned and another took retirement after they and others were strongly criticised in inspector general Michael Horowitz's <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/2012/s1209.pdf\">report which lays out</a> a \"pattern of serious failures\" over the operation, called Fast and Furious. Agents lost about 2,000 guns, mostly AK-47s, in a failed attempt to track their route to drug cartels. </p> <p>The report, published on Wednesday, recommended disciplinary action against 14 officials, including the head of the justice department's criminal division, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer \u00ba an Obama administration appointee.</p> <p>The secretive \"gun walking\" operation, run by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms (ATF) and US attorney's office in Arizona, drew attention in Washington when two of the weapons were linked to the killing of a US border patrol agent, Brian Terry, in a gun fight with drug traffickers two years ago. Hundreds of the guns also turned up at Mexican crime scenes.</p> <p>Republican in Congress have attempted to use criticism of Fast and Furious to unseat Holder on the grounds he has covered up his knowledge of the operation. The House of Representatives found him in contempt of Congress in June for failing to hand over documents &#xa0;to lengthy and often testy committee hearings \u2013 a first for a sitting member of a president's cabinet.</p> <p>The operation is also at the heart of conspiracy theories among some gun rights advocates of a plot to curb weapons sales. The National Rifle Association called Fast and Furious another \"Watergate\" and alleged that the Obama administration let the guns be shipped to Mexico in order to boost statistics on illegal weapons smuggling and introduce tighter gun control.</p> <p>But the 470-page justice department internal probe, which was partly redacted for public release, concluded that the \"gun walking\" operation was more incompetence than conspiracy, and dismissed Republican accusations that Holder knew of it beforehand.</p> <p>Holder greeted the report by saying it cleared his name and pointing the finger at his critics in Congress.</p> <p>\"It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations \u2013 accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion,\" he said. \"I hope today's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed.\"</p> <p>But Republican congressman Darrel Issa, who has led an increasingly bitter campaign against Holder with hearings in Congress, said Holder should take responsibility for the criticisms of the justice department over Fast and Furious.</p> <p>\"Contrary to the denials of the attorney general and his political defenders in Congress, the investigation found that information in wiretap applications approved by senior justice department officials in Washington did contain red flags showing reckless tactics and faults attorney general Eric Holder's inner circle for their conduct,\" he said. \"It's time for President Obama to step in and provide accountability for officials at both the department of justice and ATF who failed to do their jobs.|\"</p> <p>The inspector general was, however, sharply critical of the conduct of the operation and an earlier one, Wide Receiver, during George W Bush's presidency which involved about 400 guns.</p> <p>The report said that Fast and Furious began as an \"important and promising investigation\" of the flow of weapons from American gun shops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/us-guns-mexico-drug-cartels \">across the border to Mexican cartels</a> but quickly got out of hand resulting in the \"extraordinary\" situation of the US authorities spending more than a year watching gun smugglers buy nearly 2,000 firearms for $1.5m while doing nothing about it.</p> <p>\"There were&#xa0;no arrests or indictments in the case until it was learned that two weapons&#xa0;found at the scene of customs and border protection agent Brian Terry's December 14, 2010, murder had been purchased by an Operation Fast and Furious subject who agents had identified in November 2009, and who had bought the two guns found at scene in January 2010,\" the report said. </p> <p>\"We concluded that the individuals at ATF and the US attorney's office responsible for Operation Fast and Furious failed to conduct the investigation with the urgency, oversight, and attention to public safety that was required by an investigation that involved such extraordinary and consequential firearms trafficking activity.\"</p> <p>The report identified a number of problems including lack of sufficient oversight and inadequate attention to the dangers to the public which amounted to \"a disregard for the safety of individuals in the United States and Mexico\"; the inappropriate use of informants, some of whom were being tracked by another US agency because they were drug smuggling; and failure to take on board the international consequences of permitting guns to be smuggled to Mexico where they were used to murder people.</p> <p>The report recommends disciplinary action against several people in part because Fast and Furious was permitted to go ahead even though there had been deep concerns about a similar operation under the Bush administration, Wide Receiver.</p> <p>It criticises Breuer and one of his aides, Jason Weinstein, for failing to notify Holder and other senior justice department officials about the existence of Wide Receiver when Fast and Furious came under question.</p> <p>The report said Weinstein should have recognised that Fast and Furious replicated Wide Receiver and put a stop to it. Weinstein told Fox News that he resigned so as not to \"distract\" from the justice department's work but he disputed the report's finding, calling them deeply flawed.</p> <p>Breuer raised questions about Wide Receiver at the time but said he had no knowledge of Fast and Furious until it was already under way. He acknowledged that he should have done more to ensure that the earlier \"gun walking\" operation was not repeated.</p> <p>The report is also strongly critical of the head of the ATF, Kenneth Melson, who resigned last year over the investigation and moved to another justice department post. He retired on Wednesday, as the report was released. &#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Picture it: US federal prosecutors and agents, deeply frustrated over an inability to stem violence related to the drug trade and Mexican cartels, decide to pursue a bold strategy to go after arms trafficking on the US-Mexican border.</p> <p>Under the plan, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will permit known gun traffickers to make \"straw purchases\" \u2013 legal purchases of firearms in significant quantities to be resold to criminals on the other side of the border. This sort of purchase-monitoring had been used before, but the existing law enforcement policy was to intercept the arms shipments shortly after purchase or transfer. Under the new approach, the guns will \"walk\" \u2013 into the hands of the cartel buyers, allowing investigators to identify how the firearms were being paid for and transported to Mexico \u2013 and set up major prosecutions of the cartels in the future.</p> <p>But the more significant busts never come. Instead, more than 2,000 firearms \u2013 mostly AK-47 style rifles and FN Herstal 5.7mm caliber pistols \u2013 flow across the border into the hands of the cartels. No arrests or indictments are made. The agents on the ground start complaining. The guns start showing up at crime scenes in Mexico. </p> <p>Only when gunman use the weapons to murder a federal law enforcement agent, US Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry, does the program get shut down and arrests of the \"little fish\" suspects occur.</p> <p>If you read this scenario in a thriller novel, you would probably toss the book away halfway through, dismissing the agents' and prosecutors' foolishness on a grand scale as too implausible. But that is indeed what occurred in \"Operation Fast and Furious\", a deadly scandal of egregiously reckless judgment in federal law enforcement that has received far too little attention from the media in the United States.</p> <p>Since the story broke in early 2011, most of the parties involved, including US Attorney General Eric Holder and other department of justice (DOJ) officials, have reserved comment or offered few details, citing an ongoing investigation by the DOJ's office of inspector general (OIG). After 19 months, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/operation-fast-and-furious-report\">OIG completed and released its report</a>, recommended that the justice department take disciplinary action against 14 current and former officials from the department and ATF.</p> <p>The initial headlines <a href=\"http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/19/13966068-investigation-finds-no-evidence-ag-eric-holder-knew-of-fast-and-furious-gun-running-sting\">shouted that the IG report had exonerated Holder</a>. That's one interpretation. But the portrait the report paints of Holder's management is deeply disturbing. Time and again, information and warnings about the operation's enormous risks flow from Arizona to Washington \u2026 and suddenly, mysteriously, stop just short of Holder.</p> <p>The inspector general's report concludes that they can find no evidence Holder knew about Fast and Furious until well after Terry's death, but \u2026 well, the circumstances of Holder being so out of the loop, so in the dark about a major operation certainly appear unusual, perhaps to the point of straining credulity. The report states: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We found it troubling that a case of this magnitude and that affected Mexico so significantly was not directly briefed to the Attorney General. We would usually expect such information to come to the Attorney General through the Office of the Deputy Attorney General \u2026 [Holder] was not told in December 2010 about the connection between the firearms found at the scene of the shooting and Operation Fast and Furious. Both Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler and Counsel to the Attorney General and Deputy Chief of Staff Wilkinson were aware of this significant and troubling information by December 17, 2010, but did not believe the information was sufficiently important to alert the Attorney General about it or to make any further inquiry regarding this development.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not \"sufficiently important\"? Baffling. Maddening. Some might even say, \"implausible\".</p> <p>Repeatedly, everyone under Holder seems to do everything possible to make sure he isn't informed about an operation that, in the words of the IG report, failed \"to adequately consider the risk to public safety in the United States and Mexico\". In fact, information about the program went all the way to Holder's office \u2013 but somehow, the memos, emails and other communications never reached the man himself. It's as if he wasn't there. From the IOG report, again:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As we describe below, we identified information regarding Operation Fast and Furious that reached the Office of the Attorney General in 2010 but not Attorney General Holder himself.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well. If you're wondering if this is covered by some sort of obscure procedure or rules, it isn't:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Holder] should have been informed by no later than December 17, 2010, that two firearms recovered at the Terry murder scene were linked to an ATF firearms trafficking investigation \u2026 We found that although [Holder's then deputy-chief-of-staff Monty] Wilkinson forwarded to Holder during the afternoon of December 15 three emails from the US Attorney's Office providing further details about the shooting and law enforcement efforts to find and arrest the suspects, he did not notify the Attorney General of the revelation that two weapons found at the murder scene were linked to a suspect in an ATF firearms trafficking investigation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A suspicious mind could look at this strange pattern of underling, after deputy, after staffer <em>not</em> mentioning critical information, and information getting all the way to Holder's office but not being seen by the AG himself, and conclude Holder's staffers were keeping him in the dark. Would that be to preserve his \"plausible deniability\"? Another conclusion might be that someone just wasn't honest with the inspector general.</p> <p>We now know that the best that can be said about Holder is that he was oblivious to a major, exceptionally dangerous operation going on within his organization. And the most generous interpretation of that is that he had staffed his office with professionals who had epically flawed judgment in deciding what the nation's top law-enforcement officer needed to know.</p> <p>There are still some big questions that remain \u2013 including whether this should stand as the final investigation of the subject; and whether it is appropriate for a government official assigned to sniff out mismanagement, corruption, and cover-ups to be reporting to the exact officials he's investigating.</p> <p>A serious question for partisans of the left is whether they would accept a Bush or Romney administration's justice department investigating itself \u2013 particularly <em>after</em> the president chose to assert executive privilege over documents that Congress believes relate to the operation. Senator Jon Cornyn (Republican, Texas) asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Today's report contains page after page of redacted information and does not reflect well on an administration that pledged to be the most transparent in US history. I ask the attorney general to set aside his political allegiances and answer this simple question: don't you think the Terry family and the American people deserves answers?\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>In the end, it all felt very different to those delirious scenes back in May when Didier Drogba rolled in the decisive penalty that confirmed Chelsea as champions of Europe. They had led 2-0 on a night when Oscar spectacularly announced his presence at Stamford Bridge, but their first match in defence of the trophy was to finish in disappointment, exacerbated by the clear sense they had contributed to their own downfall.</p> <p>Chelsea certainly did not win the European Cup with the kind of carelessness that preceded both Juventus goals, and it will pain them that the Juve substitute, Fabio Quagliarella, nudged the second of them through Petr Cech's legs after a move that started with Mikel John Obi losing the ball with a sloppy pass.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, John Terry's mistake gave Quagliarella another chance that skimmed off the crossbar and, suddenly, Chelsea were looking vulnerable to the possibility of losing. Chelsea's success in this competition last season was based on their high levels of concentration and organisation but those qualities were not so conspicuous here and as a result, they surrendered the chance to put themselves into a position of strength in Group E.</p> <p>Juventus, to give them their due, were obdurate opponents, playing with the kind of assurance and togetherness that tends to be found in the top European sides, and never losing their focus even after the two goals from Oscar that put Chelsea in command. Yet it was unusual to see Roberto Di Matteo, normally a fierce protector of his own, criticise the players and though he eulogised about Oscar's contribution, the Chelsea manager was entitled to be unhappy about the rate at which they conceded possession.</p> <p>When the disappointment subsides, Chelsea will be hugely encouraged by Oscar's contribution on his first start since his \u00a325m acquisition from Internacional. His second goal was a beauty, a strike of rare finesse that dipped, swerved and looped into the top left-hand corner of Gianluigi Buffon's net, and here was the confirmation that Chelsea have signed a player of rare quality. Audacity, too. There are not many players who would believe they can beat Buffon, one of the more revered goalkeepers of his generation, from such an implausible angle.</p> <p>Oscar's first goal, just after the half-hour, had been accompanied by a decent slice of fortune given the deflection his 25-yard shot, from Eden Hazard's lay-off, took off Leonardo Bonucci to deceive Buffon. What followed, however, was stunning. Ashley Cole played the ball into Oscar's feet, just outside the penalty area, and his first touch was measured to perfection to turn away from both Bonucci and Andrea Pirlo in one movement. The second touch was even better, hooking his foot round the ball for a wonderful goal.</p> <p>Juventus, however, were too worldly to lose direction. After 38 minutes Claudio Marchisio moved infield from the left wing and played a short pass into Arturo Vidal. The striker took a clever touch to move the ball into a shooting position and then drove a diagonal, left-foot effort beyond Cech.</p> <p>Di Matteo will be unhappy that a player with such accuracy was allowed the room to score despite the close proximity of several opponents. It gave Juventus a new sense of belief, ensuring that the second half was suddenly that bit more complicated for Chelsea. After that it was clear the Serie A champions, unbeaten in 42 games domestically, would subject their opponents to some prolonged pressure.</p> <p>For the most part, Cech was well protected. Hazard continued the good form which he has shown so far this season, always wanting the ball and eager to run at opponents. Oscar's showcasing of his talents was not restricted to his goals, with some clever touches and incisive passing also notable. Fernando Torres was a willing runner and when Juventus started to press forward with greater conviction in the second half, there were gaps for Chelsea to exploit on the counterattack.</p> <p>Di Matteo made the point afterwards that he was particularly frustrated because, in attack, Chelsea had looked bright and imaginative. In particular, they will look back on that moment, at 2-1, when Hazard teed up the substitute Juan Mata for a chance that he put into the side-netting.</p> <p>The equaliser came in the next attack, Marchisio capitalising on Mikel's mistake to play Quagliarella behind the defence. Terry had stepped out, trying to catch him offside, and the substitute had the time and space to put the ball beneath Cech.</p> <p>Briefly Chelsea rallied again, but there were no more chances to beat Buffon. Juventus, demonstrating great qualities of perseverance, had deserved their draw.</p>",
  "<p>Police believe grenades allegedly used by Dale Cregan, the main suspect in the murder of two police officers and two other people, came from the former Yugoslavia and were military issue.

In at least four attacks the grenades used were a M75 grenade originating from former Yugoslavia, where it was developed for military use.</p> <p>Part of Greater Manchester police's investigation will be to hunt down the suppliers of the grenades, which at this early stage are believed to have come through organised criminals.</p> <p>Cregan is under suspicion for the murder of two police officers in a gun and grenade attack, and for two other killings, one of which involved a grenade.</p> <p>One senior Metropolitan police source said the use of grenades was unheard of, and a Greater Manchester police spokesperson said Tuesday's attack was the first time their officers had encountered grenades.</p> <p>In the Merseyside incidents the gang involved were hired thugs who staged attacks for crime barons.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2012/03/17/mersey-gun-and-grenade-attack-gang-get-life-behind-bars-for-two-year-merciless-campaign-of-violence-100252-30557294/3/\" title=\"\">According to the Liverpool Echo</a>, over three years, the UK Police National Bomb Data Centre based inside the counter terrorism unit at Scotland Yard, dealt with 14 confirmed incidents involving grenades.</p> <p>Seven of those took place within 10 months on Merseyside at the height of the attacks orchestrated by the gang.</p> <p>Today Merseyside police said the grenade attacks stopped when the gang were arrested.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: \"The use of grenades is rare and there is no intelligence of an increase in their use or availability.\"</p> <p>Police sources said even the accidental recovery of grenades, as in when police raid an address looking for other items, usually involved grenades left over from the second world war.</p> <p>One senior detective source said grenades would be a poor weapons for criminals to use. They are indiscriminate, the attacker has to ensure they are a sufficient distance away not to injure themselves. The source added also the use of grenades would also \"bring the heat down\" from police.</p> <p>In 2003 Merseyside police have a record of a grenade incident in Liverpool city centre, but no details about whether the explosive was military issue or homemade.</p> <p>In February 2011 a former soldier was convicted of trying to murder his wife by planting a stolen grenade in her car outside their Kent home. Nicholas Fabian had stolen the British military issue grenade from a firing range during weapons training. A fly-off lever from the L109 British army issue explosive grenade and safety pin were found by police along with a J-shaped fishing hook on the ground near the car, following the explosion.</p> <p>Examination of the debris suggested the grenade had been strapped to the inside of the driver's side wheel-arch. A nylon line was attached to the grenade pin at one end and the fishing hook at the other.</p> <p>Many Irish gangsters have long standing links with English criminals especially in the north-west of England and Manchester in particular. One Limerick based crime gang runs a major fencing operation selling off high grade stolen goods in the Greater Manchester area as well as running drugs to and from across the Irish Sea.</p> <p>The use of grenades has been seen in the Irish Republic and was seen some years ago in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In 1993 for instance the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force almost shipped into Northern Ireland tonnes of former Warsaw Pact military hardware including semtex explosives, rocket launchers, rifles,machine guns and Soviet-made grenades. MI5 and Special Branch intercepted the first of these shipments via Cleveland in north-east England.</p> <p>Security experts at the time said their importation would have \"tipped the balance of terror\" in the loyalists' favour.</p> <p>Among neo-nazi terror groups the Combat 18 organisation, which had established links with faction of the UDA headed up by Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair had exchanged weapons including grenades with the loyalists. Although it should be pointed out most of Combat 18's bomb attack were of the home made variety and were the work of a number of former British soldiers with neo-nazi sympathies.</p> <p>Most of the standard military grenades imported into the Northern Ireland are believed to have degraded or else been decommisisoned.</p>",
  "<p>After all the trials and tribulations of last season's humiliating Champions League campaign, Manchester United got this year's group stage off to a winning start, although this was a far from convincing performance against a Galatasaray side who were entitled to feel aggrieved they had nothing to show for their efforts.</p> <p>It turned out to be a tense occasion for United and if anything summed their night up it was Nani's dreadful penalty kick, the winger's second-half effort easily saved by Fernando Muslera after he had stepped forward with a total lack of conviction, stopping in the middle of his run- up. United have now missed all three penalties this season \u2013 Robin van Persie and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez are the other guilty men \u2013 and it was easy to imagine Sir Alex Ferguson's 'hairdryer' being put to use afterwards.</p> <p>In the end United were grateful for Michael Carrick's wonderful early goal, which was the midfielder's first in the Champions League since he scored against Wolfsburg three years ago and proved to be enough to vanquish a Galatasaray side who played with attacking abandon throughout. Only the combination of David's de Gea's fine goalkeeping, some generous refereeing and a touch of misfortune in front of goal, prevented Fatih Terim's team from scoring.</p> <p>United, wearing black armbands as a mark of respect to Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes, the two policewomen killed during a gun and grenade attack in Manchester the previous day, were careless in possession, much to Ferguson's annoyance, and looked vulnerable whenever Galatasaray pushed forward. They were also highly fortunate to get away with what was a definite penalty inside the opening minute, when Nemanja Vidic upended Umut Bulut.</p> <p>Wolfgang Stark, the German referee, waved play on and a collective sigh of relief swept around Old Trafford. When Carrick scored six minutes later it should have given a strong United side \u2013 Ferguson made six changes from the team that beat Wigan on Saturday \u2013 a platform to build on but they never looked comfortable and ended up muddling their way through a game that finished with relief as the overriding emotion.</p> <p>Van Persie looked particularly out of sorts and when the Dutchman was booked in the closing stages it was no surprise when his number went up moments later. Darren Fletcher had come on just before and his late cameo provided one of the few positives for United.</p> <p>The Scotland captain has been sidelined for 10 months with ulcerative colitis and there were fears that his career might be over. Fletcher received a huge ovation and, on this evidence, the energy he provides in central midfield will be much needed over the coming months.</p> <p>Although United created chances \u2013 Nemanja Vidic, Nani and Patrice Evra all went close \u2013 they were opened up far too easily at the other end. The warning signs were there in the 10th minute, when Nordin Amrabat escaped on the Galatasaray left and cut inside before curling a right-foot shot that clipped the top of the crossbar.</p> <p>By that point United were ahead through a beautiful goal that illustrated what a graceful player Carrick can be. Picking up possession deep in midfield, he played the ball into Van Persie's feet and continued his run, elegantly striding forward to receive it back from the Dutchman before swapping passes with Shinji Kagawa, slicing open the Galatasaray defence in the process, and leaving him one on one with Muslera.</p> <p>Carrick swayed his hips and danced around the Galatasaray goalkeeper, admirably staying on his feet when he could have gone down, before planting the ball into an empty net.</p> <p>Galatasaray, however, refused to be cowed. Hamit Altintop, whose powerful running was a striking feature all evening, clipped the outside of an upright from a well-worked free-kick towards the end of the first half. United should have put the game to bed early in the second period when Rafael da Silva, gliding forward from right-back, was brought down by Burak Yilmaz in an almost identical position to where Vidic fouled Bulut.</p> <p>Nani placed the ball on the spot and thereafter it was a lesson in how not to take a penalty. He stuttered and telegraphed his intentions, shooting at a comfortable height nowhere near the corner.</p> <p>Back came Galatasaray, Altintop delivering a centre that Selcuk Inan met with a glancing header that flashed past the far upright. Although United were enjoying a greater control of possession, there was always the danger that they would be caught by a Galatasaray counter-attack and so it proved in the 72nd minute, when the visitors broke with alacrity. If the first stop that De Gea made to deny Yilmaz was routine, the flying save that the Spaniard produced to turn Emre Colak's stinging left-footed effort behind was quite spectacular.</p>",
  "<p>Celtic Park can be among the most febrile stadiums in the world but this turned out to be a night for cool heads. Buccaneering attacks were largely absent against a Benfica lineup meriting full respect. Instead, Neil Lennon's side showed daring only towards the close of this goalless draw. There may have been no victory but neither was there disillusionment.</p> <p>It would have been rash for the Celtic players to wallow in the atmosphere, no matter how much the crowd revelled, after a four-year hiatus, in the return of matches with this sort of status. Some of Lennon's squad could be regarded as trainees where events of this sort are concerned. The danger also lay in the risk that Benfica might puncture all the swelling excitement.</p> <p>Rather than taking great strides, Celtic picked their way carefully through the early stages. Even so, this fixture carried such a sense of heritage that it would have been appropriate to broadcast the game in black and white. Benfica have by far the grander history in the European Cup but Celtic at least took that prize on one&#xa0;occasion.</p> <p>There is no scope for romance and Lennon's team strove to check their opponents. The defensive midfielder Victor Wanyama had the important task of checking the progress of Benfica's Pablo Aimar. The Celtic goalkeeper also had to do that in a more alarming incident when he had to pull off a save after Rodrigo broke through and shot in the 31st minute.</p> <p>The stadium may have been in need of a service given the time that has passed since a contest of this sort took place, and the fans did not create the irresistible atmosphere associated with this stadium. Celtic are no longer in an environment where expensive players can be lured. Supporters appreciate that and, before the interval, they were more watchful rather than impassioned.</p> <p>Benfica will be conscious of restrictions but Portugal's population of 10 million is almost double that of Scotland's. Lennon may have been happy enough to watch his men adapt to an occasion on this level. The aim then was for security, with everyone but the lone striker Miku prepared to drop back and create a barrier when needed. Even so, adventure from Celtic was expected at some moment or other.</p> <p>Whatever the tendency to take care in an opening fixture, the encounter did develop a little after the interval. Lennon's side appreciated that a win had to be pursued and Benfica would have wanted to exploit any increase in the space they were allowed. An opening almost did come their way early in the second half following a mistake by the Celtic defender Kelvin Wilson near his 18-yard line but he recovered to stop Rodrigo. Benfica's ambitions were on the rise, as they introduced the dangerous Oscar Cardozo to the&#xa0;attack.</p> <p>Lennon sent on a forward in Gary Hooper to replace the left-back Emilio Izaguirre. It seemed as if Celtic had banked on this late ploy as the best means of snatching a late win. The challenge was great, though, against a purposeful Benfica.</p>",
  "<p>\"No one can read everything. We rely on filters to make sense of the scholarly literature, but the narrow, traditional filters are being swamped. However, the growth of new, online scholarly tools allows us to make new filters; these altmetrics reflect the broad, rapid impact of scholarship in this burgeoning ecosystem. We call for more tools and research based on altmetrics.\"</p> <p>This quote is taken from the introduction to the <a href=\"http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/\" title=\"\">altmetrics manifesto</a>. And the reason it's a manifesto, rather than a mission or vision statement, is arguably because changing the way scholarly impact is measured is going to need something of a revolution \u2013 and no revolution is complete without a manifesto.</p> <p>So why is a revolution needed? Because long before the tools even existed to do anything about it, many in the research community have bemoaned the stranglehold the impact factor of a research paper has held over research funding, careers and reputations. As bloggers Victor Manning and William Gunn wrote: \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/06/mendeley-altmetrics-open-access-publishing\" title=\"\">Influence is only one dimension of importance</a>\". Other bugbears include the slowness of peer review and the fact that impact is not linked to an article, but rather to a journal, as this <a href=\"http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/07/25/altmetrics-trying-to-fill-the-gap/\" title=\"\">blog from the Scholarly Kitchen</a> points out.</p> <p>Now though, the tools exists to consider what other factors may be used to determine importance, and they are being refined daily. Alternative metrics (or altmetrics as they are known) have brought together the tech geeks and the research nerds who are eager to define their own measures of excellence. Though many of the communities they form or join, such as Academia.edu, Mendeley or Total-Impact aren't new, wider changes in the research environment (namely, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/10/uk-open-access-research-debate-round-up\" title=\"\">growing support for open access</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/feb/21/ref2014-what-researchers-concentrating-on?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">policy shifts mandating impact measurement</a>) have given altmetrics a new urgency.</p> <p>But altmetrics are not universally popular. One <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18124111\" title=\"\">commenter on the site writes</a>: \"[Impact factors] can be (and are) manipulated to a certain degree ... but the alt, total, ultimate, mega etc. metrics are far worse because the link to research quality is less direct, and in terms of some of the indicators, like twitter activity, it is non-existent. Moreover, these metrics will be much easier to manipulate\".</p> <p>So what does the future of impact assessment hold? How will these new metrics develop and how are they likely to be adopted by the sector? Perhaps most importantly, will altmetrics address the abuses of impact factors or simply create abuses of their own, particularly when importance is determined through social media influence.</p> <p>Join our live chat, Friday, 21 September at 12 BST, to explore these questions and any others you may have.</p> <p><em>The discussion takes place in the comment threads beneath the blog.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>These are good times for The Celtic Football Club. </strong> Schadenfreude first, as clubs do not exist in a vacuum and this is the way of it, and while the Bhoys set out on a Champions League journey, Rangers are surveying the wreckage of their challenge for the Ramsdens Cup, having last night been knocked out of a competition for clubs outside the top flight by Queen of the South. Still, it allows them to concentrate on the league, which might not be a bad thing.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile despite St Johnstone's Rowan Vine, Basingstoke's second-best footballing export behind Tom Cleverley, putting Celtic to the sword at the weekend, Neil Lennon's team are still well placed in the SPL, a division they're hot favourites to win. </strong> And this Champions League group stage should wipe out their \u00a38m overdraft.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Also, while the Portuguese giants Benfica certainly have the tools to put a stop to Celtic's gallop tonight - they're 11-10 favourites to win this match - history appears to be in the home side's corner. </strong> Benfica might have reached the quarter finals of this competition earlier this year, while Celtic's last appearance at this stage came four years ago, when they ended up bottom of their group. But while Celtic have only made it through the group stage twice in six attempts, those two successful campaigns came when they were drawn alongside Benfica.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Even the head-to-head record points to a home win tonight. </strong> In the 2007/08 Champions League, Celtic lost 1-0 at the Stadium of Light, then won 1-0 at Parkhead. The season before, they won 3-0 in Glasgow, then lost 3-0 in Lisbon. And in the 1969/70 European Cup second round, they won 3-0 at home before losing 3-0 away, only to make it through to the quarter finals on the toss of a coin. It's a record of remarkable symmetry. If Celtic do manage a win tonight, they should probably keep it to one or two goals, because they'll just be setting themselves up for a thrashing in Portugal otherwise.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>But let's not get too carried away. </strong> Meetings with Benfica may have augured well for Celtic in the past, but history counts for little when the whistle goes. And at some point, something has to give. Benfica may be without their suspended pair Luisao and Maxi Pereira, but they're in form, having won their last two games 5-0 and 3-0, while Celtic's casual start to the season is actually their worst for 14 years. Oo-er.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 7.45pm in both the Scottish and Portuguese money.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Celtic:</strong> Forster, Matthews, Lustig, Wilson, Izaguirre, Forrest,<br>Brown, Wanyama, Mulgrew, Commons, Miku.<br>Subs: Zaluska, Ambrose, Nouioui, Rogne, Slane, Watt, Hooper.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Benfica:</strong> Artur Moraes, Almeida, Garay, Jardel, Melgarejo,<br>Matic, Salvio, Perez, Gaitan, Aimar, Rodrigo.<br>Subs: Paulo Lopes, Cardozo, Bruno Cesar, Nolito, Lima, Miguel Vitor, Gomes.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Nicola Rizzoli (Italy)</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The teams are out, the stands are bouncing, the music is blaring ... and we're off!</strong> Celtic kick off. Commons grabs himself a bit of space down the inside left, and looks to float a chip into the top-right corner from the best part of 40 yards. Confident. Over confident, perhaps, but that's better than retreating into one's shell. The ball flies over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> This is a brilliant start by Celtic. The ball's clipped down the inside-left channel. Miku wins a header, knocking the ball back for Commons, who screws a poor first-time effort well wide right of the target. The ball doesn't even go out. Benfica clear. But this is a positive opening salvo from the Scottish champions.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Neil Lennon is sitting in the dugout, arms tightly crossed, with a face on. Is this news?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Space for Mulgrew down the left. His cross is deflected out for a corner on the left. The set piece is sent in deep, forcing Melgarejo to head behind for another corner, this time on the right. Commons puts the ball into the mixer, and there's a wee scramble, Jardel hacking clear from his own six-yard box under pressure from a sea of green. \"Interesting comparison between the leagues in Scotland and England to be made,\" writes Simon McMahon. \"It may be early season but Motherwell, Hibs, St. Mirren and (the world famous) Dundee United are all above Celtic. In England, the top four are in place already. And they used to say the Scottish league was uncompetitive. Maybe rather than being its death knell, the demise of Rangers has breathed new life into the Scottish game?\" Yep, I'd say so. Can't remember the last time the likes of Peterhead, Elgin, East Stirling and Annan were regularly on the back pages. And that's likely to continue for the rest of the season, especially if Rangers can't get their act together away from hope. As for the SPL, it'll still be a fair old surprise if Celtic don't win the league this season. But Motherwell and Dundee United have been fairly consistent for a while now, so hopefully both of them (at least) can give the champions a good run for their money. I'd pay ready cash to see someone outside the Old Firm win the league in Scotland, but the window of opportunity's only going to be open for so long.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Izaguirre clatters into Andre Almeida. For a minute it looks like he's going to be booked for this clumsy, poor-timed episode, but no. Benfica sweep down the other end, winning a free kick 30 yards out on the left. Aimar swings a ball deep towards the far post, but there's too much on it, and it sails out harmlessly for a goal kick. Celtic will be happy enough with this.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Wanyama looks to break down the right, but he's cynically checked by Garay, who cleverly goes down holding his coupon in order to escape any sanction from the referee.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> It's degenerated very quickly into a load of harum-scarum nonsense, this.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Commons loops a long free kick into the Benfica area from a deep position on the left. The ball's headed clear, out to the right, where Forrest takes a touch with a view to skipping past Melgarejo down the wing. Unfortunately, that touch is so strong the ball's in danger of demolishing the stand behind the goal.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Andre Almeida curls in a cross from the right. Lustig does well to head behind for a corner under pressure at the near post from Rodrigo. The corner, from the right, is slipped back down the wing to Salvio, who from the corner of the area hits a first-time shot towards the top-left corner. The ball whips over the crossbar, but wasn't too far away. Celtic were half asleep there.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Gaitan twists and turns down the left and forces a corner off Matthews. The ball's sent in and causes mild panic in the Celtic defence, but Salvio can't control when in a bit of space level with the right-hand post, and the danger is gone. Benfica are beginning to get into this now.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Celtic respond well, through Commons down the right wing. He whips a low cross into the centre, but Miku doesn't bother coming to meet it, and by the time he attacks the ball, Jardel has stepped in the way and is clattered. Free kick to Benfica. If Miku had moved towards the near post, he might have got an effort on target there.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Wanyama is booked for shoving Perez in the back as the Benfica midfielder looks to break into a lot of space down the inside-right channel. He can have no complaints.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> It's tipping down in Glasgow. As far as action goes at the minute, that's your lot.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Beautiful one-touch football between Miku and Commons down the left. The former's set scampering into space by a crisp pass from the latter, but the striker can't return the favour with his low cutback into the area. Benfica clear, but Celtic weren't too far away from opening their opponents up there. Much better; a spark of quality after a few minutes of turgid nonsense.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Garay needlessly clatters into the back of Commons in order to challenge for a high ball the Celtic player was never going to win in a million years. Free kick to Celtic, 30 yards out, down the right. Commons floats a diagonal ball towards Wanyama at the far post, but the big man can't plant the nut on the ball, and it skims off the top of his head, out for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> It's not been particularly good, this game, and the Parkhead faithful have shut their faces as a result. Still, Celtic will be happy enough with the way this has gone so far. Forster hasn't had a save to make, and the team are slowly reacclimatising to this level of football.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> There's me and my big daft mouth. Rodrigo scampers clear into the area down the inside left. Forster is forced to come off his line, and does marvellously well to spread himself in front of the player and get a hand in to guide the ball away. He clatters Rodrigo afterwards, Benfica claiming a penalty, but the referee is having none of it. Superb goalkeeping. Wilson hacks clear.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Izaguirre is booked for a ludicrously late lunge on Salvio down the right. Free kick to Benfica in a dangerous position. Aimar clips it to the near post. Celtic hack clear. The ball breaks to Perez, just outside the D. He takes a touch to set himself, and with little backlift crashes a ball towards the top left. He overcooks the effort, the ball sailing over the bar. But Celtic have suddenly started giving up chances.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> No, this game's really not very interesting. By way of illustration, look what this report's only reader has been up to during the past few minutes. \"The sum of the players shirt numbers for Celtic tonight is 202,\" drones Simon McMahon. \"The numbers go 1,2,3,6,7,8,15,21,23,49,67. If Hooper (88) was playing instead of Miku the total would be nearer 300.\" It's exactly like this.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Izaguirre miscontrols in the middle of his own half, allowing Aimar to saunter forward with the ball. He slides a pass out right to Salvio, who gets a shot away from a tight angle. Forster parries, but it doesn't really matter, as Salvio is rather tightly flagged offside. Celtic are beginning to live very dangerously.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Brown and Wanyama clatter Garay in a pincer movement. A couple of quite subtle fouls, but Wanyama especially wants to watch himself here.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Miku wins a corner for Celtic down the left. Commons sends the ball into an area populated only by the black away shirts of Benfica. The visitors tear forward, five on two, and only a spectacular last-ditch tackle on the halfway line by Wilson, aquaplaning in from deep, saves the day. I'd say Celtic need to hear the half-time whistle in order to regroup.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Benfica flood forward yet again. Commons is extremely fortunate to avoid a booking for a cynical shove on Perez, who was threatening to scamper into dangerous territory. Aimar stands over the free kick. He floats it into the area, where Forster comes out to claim with confidence. Parkhead is pretty quiet at the moment, anxiety having taken over.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Celtic 0-0 Benfica.</strong> Celtic, who were rocking and making lots of individual errors, make it to the break without conceding. Time for Neil Lennon to have a calming word or two. He can do calming words, yes?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ADVERTISEMENT for defunct chain of piss-poor supermarkets:</strong></p> <!-- Block 35 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SuCJ31zagsQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SuCJ31zagsQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>The first sponsors of the Scottish League, unless I'm much mistaken, which in fairness I often am, so don't quote me on that. Check out the trough of raw meat on the 20-second mark. Shops aren't so keen on letting punters finger the chops and sausages these days, are they?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> No changes. It would be nice if this second half was an improvement in terms of drama and/or aesthetics, but Celtic may be happy enough with a point. We'll see.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Matic is booked for planting his elbow on the bridge of Miku's honk. No great intent, as the two went up for a high ball, but clumsy and worthy of punishment.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Mulgrew slides a ball down the inside-left for Commons, who turns on his heels on the edge of the area and has a dig towards the bottom left. The shot's deflected away, but that's a good positive sign for Celtic.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Wanyama really does want to watch himself. He's clattered into the back of Garay, in the manner of a galoot, and concedes another free kick. He's walking a tightrope, albeit not in a particularly elegant fashion.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> From the free kick, a scramble, then a corner. Nobody in a black shirt can get a shot away, but Celtic were at sixes and sevens at the back there, veering at one point towards eight.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Forrest turns on the jets and rocks Melgarejo's boat down the right. He gets to the byline, but his ball inside isn't particularly cultured, and is easily cleared by Jardel.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Izaguirre is hacked down as he scampers along the left-hand touchline. Commons swings the free kick into the area. The ball breaks to Matthews on the edge of the box. He hits a first time shot into the ground, but off a defender for a corner on the left. The ball's swung to the far post, where Lustig heads lamely down and wide right. But this is an improvement from Celtic.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Wilson, under pressure from Rodrigo, chases back after a long ball down the middle. After making two exceptionally clumpish touches, he eventually turns and clears. All's well in the end, but for a second, it looked like the Benfica man was going to zip clear of the lumbering defender.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Aimar is booked for a clumsy late clip on Wanayama. Here's this report's co-author Simon McMahon: \"Your half-time entertainment brought back memories of Dundee United's Uefa Cup run of 1986-87 when we went to the final, beating Barcelona and Borussia Moenchengladbach along the way, proudly displaying the VG logo on our shirts, a chain of small supermarkets almost as piss poor as Fine Fare. Today's equivalent would be something like the Uefa Champions League, sponsored by Lidl.\" Yes, my heart aches for the return of piss-poor sponsors. Chelsea would be so much more loveable if they carried the Londis logo on their shirts.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Benfica step it up a bit, winning a couple of corners down the left, after causing quite the kerfuffle in the Celtic area. The second sees Aimar hit a low dipper towards the near post, Garay stooping to guide a clever header towards the bottom left. Forster does brilliantly to react and shovel the ball out for a third corner. Nothing comes of that, although Celtic make a full-blown 1940s Hollywood melodrama of clearing.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> A couple of changes, one for each side. Benfica swap Aimar for Oscar Cardozo, and then the home side replace Lustig with Rogne.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> A delicious Cryuff Turn by Commons down the left. He's in space, and whips a dangerous low ball towards the near post, where Andre Almeida nearly deflects the ball past his own keeper and into the bottom-left corner. But Artur is all over it. Celtic have shown flashes since the restart, but it's required an opponent to work the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Hooper replaces Izaguirre.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Miku forces a corner down the right. There's another corner, and then nothing. A futile period of pressure.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Bruno Cesar replaces Rodrigo.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Salvio has a dig, cutting in from the right, from 20-plus yards. It flies 20-plus yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Hooper dances around, up and down the left like a cut-price music-hall act, but to little effect. On the touchline, Neil Lennon offers a round of applause.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Benfica step it up a bit. First Bruno Cesar sends a speculative dipping volley just over the bar from 30 yards - it wasn't far from dropping into the top right corner - and then Salvio makes good down the right, cutting back for Gaitan to sidefoot goalwards. His shot is deflected out for a corner, which comes to naught.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> This is opening up a wee bit now. Celtic break upfield. Commons spots Artur miles off his line, and attempts to hoick one home from the halfway line. It's wide left of goal and short of juice. Artur claims.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Salvio sends a ball bounding through the Celtic area from the right. Forster and Wilson are all over the shop, and they nearly let Oscar Cardozo in at the far post. Celtic eventually hack clear in a hot panic.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Miku wheechs down the inside-right channel, looking to make space for a shot but making do with a corner. The ball's hung above the keeper's head, allowing Rogne to come bumbling in like an oaf, conceding a free kick by wiping out three men. Not particularly clever, and it allows Artur to roll around on the floor awhile, eating up minutes more precious to Celtic than they are to Benfica.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Forrest dances into the area down the right. With Melgarejo breathing down his neck, the winger opts to clip over his own heels in search of a penalty. The referee isn't fooled.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Nolito comes on for Gaitan.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Oscar Cardozo looks to chest down a looping ball on the edge of the area, and break into the area down the inside left. But he gets far too much on the nudge forward, and the chance is gone.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Nolito dances right across the front of the Celtic area looking to get a shot away, but Brown is sticking to him, Moe Tucker style, like glue. That's brilliant defensive work by the Celtic captain, who has been everywhere tonight, without executing too many rash tackles either.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Benfica lump a long ball forward. Matthews needlessly flicks a header backwards and out of play to the left of goal. Corner. The ball's flicked to the near post, where Wanyama shoulders it across the face of goal and out of play on the right. From the corner, the ball's worked wide right to Andre Almeida, who whips a cross in from the wing. Oscar Cardozo meets the ball with a powerful header, firing just over the bar. That was so close to a late winner.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> \"Brown has been everywhere tonight, without executing too many rash tackles either.\" That was your crack reporter on 85 minutes. So here he is picking up a yellow for a totally needless clip on Oscar Cardozo, followed by a wanton trundle into his chest. Naughty Scott Brown. Saucy Scott Brown. Pulitzer, please!</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Bruno Cesar is booked for a wild swipe at Brown's ankles. This is ending in scrappy fashion, albeit in an entertaining, old-school way.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Celtic 0-0 Benfica.</strong> Well that wasn't much to write home about. So I won't. That's that!</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>VG &gt; modern-day behemoths like Tesco.</strong> \"Just catching up with the MBM now and and thought I'd let you and the other reader know, as he brought it up, that I was actually at the home legs of Dundee United's quarter, semi and final that year in the UEFA Cup as a star struck 11 year old,\" begins Neil Baxter. \"My dad took me to the quarter (his mate was a scout for United at the time and got us tickets), mainly just to see Barca, then when United unceremoniously humped them out of it, we went back for the semi, then the final, only to see them lose to a young Sven Goran Eriksson's team from Gothenburg. Anyhoo, the reason I'm writing is that I had a programme from the semi final night, got it signed by all the United players, and a couple of Barca players too, with the exception of Lineker, who got a couple of heavies to bundle us obviously threatening autograph hunting children out the way. MArk Hughes was a total gent though, stopped and chatted with us all, signed autographs for everyone. I wonder if the programme would be worth money now, but unfortunately someone stole it years ago.\"</p>",
  "<p>I find myself caught between the need to follow the drone debate and the need to avoid unpleasant memories it stirs. I used drones \u2013 unmanned aerial vehicles \u2013 during the nadir of my military career that was an operational tour in Afghanistan. I remember cuing up a US Predator strike before deciding the computer screen wasn't depicting a Taliban insurgent burying an improvised explosive device in the road; rather, a child playing in the dirt.</p> <p>After returning from Afghanistan at the end of 2009, I left the British army in 2010. I wanted to put as much distance as I could between myself and the UK, leaving to study in America (where I still reside). By doing so, I inadvertently placed myself in the country <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/06/12/154812235/as-drone-strikes-grow-so-do-concerns-over-use\">that is spearheading</a> development in drone technology and use, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/19/aclu-us-drone-programme-court\">highlighted by each report of a drone strike and the usual attendant civilian casualties</a>.</p> <p>Political theorist <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/\">Hannah Arendt</a> described the history of warfare in the 20th century as the growing incapacity of the army to fulfil its basic function: defending the civilian population. My experiences in Afghanistan brought this issue to a head, leaving me unable to avoid the realization that my role as a soldier had changed, in Arendt's words, from \"that of protector into that of a belated and essentially futile avenger\". Our collective actions in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 were, and remain, futile vengeance \u2013 with drones the latest technological advance to empower that flawed strategy.</p> <p>Drones are becoming the preferred instruments of vengeance, and their core purpose is analogous to the changing relationship between civil society and warfare, in which the latter is conducted remotely and at a safe distance so that implementing death and murder becomes increasingly palatable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396402642\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348085581244/jeffreytank_460.jpg\" alt=\"James Jeffrey serving in Iraq, 2004\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author (at far left) as a lieutenant Challenger 2 troop leader in al-Amarah, Iraq, 2004. Photograph: James Jeffrey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Jeffrey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hyperbole? But I was there. I sat in my camouflaged combats and I took the rules of engagement and ethical warfare classes. And frankly, I don't buy much, if any, of it now \u2013 especially concerning drones. Their effectiveness is without question, but there's terrible fallout from their rampant use.</p> <p>Both Pakistan and Yemen are arguably less stable and more hostile to the west as a result of President Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/drone-strikes-international-law-un\">increased reliance on drones</a>. When surveying the poisoned legacy left to the Iraqi people, and what will be left to the Afghan people, it's beyond depressing to hear of the hawks circling around other theatres like Pakistan and Yemen, stoking the flames of interventionism.</p> <p>I fear the folly in which I took part will never end, and society will be irreversibly enmeshed in what George Orwell's 1984 warned of: constant wars against the Other, in order to forge false unity and fealty to the state.</p> <p>It's very easy to kill if you don't view the target as a person. When I went to Iraq as a tank commander in 2004, the fire orders I gave the gunner acknowledged some legitimacy of personhood: \"Coax man, 100 meters front.\" Five years later in Afghanistan, the linguistic corruption that always attends war meant we'd refer to \"hot spots\", \"multiple pax on the ground\" and \"prosecuting a target\", or \"maximising the kill chain\".</p> <p>The Pentagon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/world/20drones.html?pagewanted=all\">operates</a> about 7,000 drones and asked Congress for nearly $5bn for drones in the 2012 budget. Before retiring as air force chief of staff, General Norton Schwartz was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/us/drone-pilots-waiting-for-a-kill-shot-7000-miles-away.html?pagewanted=all\">reported</a> as saying it \"was 'conceivable' drone pilots in the air force would outnumber those in cockpits in the foreseeable future\". That's not a brave new world, far from it.</p> <p>The encroachment of drones into the civilian realm is also gaining momentum. President Obama <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/02/18/US-skies-to-be-opened-to-drones/UPI-63521329602733/\">signed</a> a federal law on 14 February 2012, allowing drones for a variety of commercial uses and for police law enforcement. The skies above may never be the same. As with most of America's darker elements, such as its gun culture, there's profit to be made \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/spy-in-the-sky-is-it-only-a-matter-of-time-before-drone-technology-is-used-in-civil-society-7678950.html\">market</a> for drones is already valued at $5.9bn and is expected to double in 10 years.</p> <p>During my time in Afghanistan, drones were primarily supplied by the US as our drone capability was miniscule in comparison. The British military still relies on US support, only owning about five armed drones. They have been busy, though: as of May 2012, the Ministry of Defence <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/18/british-drones-afghanistan-taliban\">confirmed</a> these had flown a total of 34,750 hours, and fired 281 missiles and laser-guided bombs.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/senior-army-officer-condemns-plans-to-cut-troop-numbers-saying-it-is-not-a-sensible-military-option-7905468.html\">continued cuts</a> to the British army's personnel levels, it isn't hard to envisage drones increasingly replacing boots on the ground. And since the UK already has the world's <a href=\"http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-22/europe/31085971_1_clive-norris-cameras-big-brother-watch\">highest number</a> of CCTV cameras, the intrusion of drones into surveillance Britain doesn't require much imagination.</p> <p>Technological advancements in warfare don't have a good track record in terms of unintended consequences. As Chris Hedges reveals in his book War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, an <a href=\"http://www.martyduren.com/2012/02/12/war-is-a-force-that-gives-us-meaning-by-chris-hedges-book-review/\">estimated</a> 62 million civilians perished in the 20th century's wars \u2013 \"nearly 20 million more than the 43 million military personnel killed\".</p> <p>Will the 21st century repeat such foolish tragedy? Many years still remain. I'd argue we should err on the side of caution and remain immensely wary of drones.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Paul</strong> will be here from around 7.25pm. Meantime, here's Amy Lawrence's match preview:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Roberto Di Matteo wrinkled his nose at the idea that hearing the Champions League anthem will have any special effect as his team begin their title defence. The same cannot be said of Chelsea's opponents, Juventus. The significance of their return to Europe's elite is not something to be taken lightly. The message on the club's official website this week is unashamedly giddy: Europa, siamo tornati! Europe, we're back.</p> <p>Although Juve did make a return to the Champions League four years ago, when they qualified with a third-place domestic finish \u2013 eventually succumbing to Chelsea in the knockout stages, as it happened \u2013 this time is different. This time they are back as Serie A winners, league leaders and Italy's most convincing flagbearers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/18/chelsea-juventus-champions-league\">More...</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech; Ivanovic, David Luiz, Terry, Cole; Ramires, Mikel, Lampard; Hazard, Torres, Oscar<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Turnbull, Romeu, Mata, Moses, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Betrand</p> <p><strong>Juve:</strong> Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Asamoah; Giovinco, Vucinic <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Storari, Lucio, Giaccherini, Quagliarella, Matri, Isla, Marrone</p> <p><strong>Ref:</strong> P Proenca (Portugal)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.42pm: There's some people on the pitch ... they think it's all over ... no, hold on, it's the players and they know the match hasn't even begun.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Juve get the game going and quickly show their intent: crisp passing and swift movement ... until Vidal knocks the ball into touch while seeking Asamoah wide on the right.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Juve give the ball away in midfield and Chelsea sear forward with speed that Juve have so far lacked. Ramires was the principal runner and his burst yields a corner, which Juve cope defend easily.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Juve are looking a little wobbly at the back early doors and Chelsea have now forced a couple of corners without much bother. Lampard sends the latest one and David Luiz leaps highest but a deflection takes the power off his header and it's an easy save for Buffon.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Juve have been behaving like busted dope dealers in the last few minutes, surrendering possession to the boys in blue.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Oscar, making his first start, has had little involvement so far, nor, indeed, has Hazard. Ramires, meanwhile, has been very prominent, doing a mean impression of Yaya Tour\u00e9 so far.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Vucinic is starting to look dangerous for Juve, dropping between Chelsea's defence and midfield to receive the ball and conjure.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> After a decent bout of passing from Chelsea, Lampard flips the ball wide to Ramires, who crosses first time to Torres, who is outnumbered three to one but still does enough to force a corner. Nothing of interest ensues.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> So far this game has been like a cheap imitation of last night's Real-City encounter: more mistakes and far fewer chances, but at least there's a similarly pleasing amount of positivity from both sides.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Torres robs the ball off Pirlo in his own half and gallops forward, but his pass to Hazard is overhit and the momentum is lost.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Good run by Lampard, well found by Cole. Lampard then knocks the ball back to Hazard, whose cross from the left provokes panic in the Juve box, and Chelsea get another corner. Again nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Shoddy by Chelsea! Shoddier by Marchisio! The Italian surged from deep, past the dozing Chelsea players to latch on to a long ball over the top. His attempt to take the ball down on his thigh goes awry, however, and Cech charges off the line to smother his shot.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Chance for Chelsea! Hazard rolled an inviting ball across the face of goal. Ramires collected it seven yards, twice feigned to shoot and then rolled it to Torres, who was marked by two defenders. Why didn't the Brazilian shoot (by) himself?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Chelsea are racking up corners like Marlo Stanfield but making much less profitable use of them.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Dreadful play all round! Ivanovic gave the ball away to Vidal to enable Juve to counter attack quickly. Vidal drew two defenders and then knocked the ball to Vucinic, who has time to size up his options 18 yards from goal ... and then blems the ball badly wide.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Juventus (Oscar 31')</strong> He had been virtually irrelevant to proceedings for most of the match, but Oscar has made his mark, thanks in no small part to a crucial deflection off Bonucci. Hazard cut in from the left before passing to Oscar, who took on touch and then let fly from 25 yards. Buffon would have probably have saved it but Bonucci stuck out a leg to help it into the top corner.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Juventus (Oscar 33')</strong> If his first goal carried a bit of fortune, the second was undeniably superb! With a single touch Oscar controlled a pass and wrongfooted the defence before curling a wonderful shot over Buffon and into the net from 20 yards! Oscar's no slouch.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Juventus try to get back on their feet after those two body blows, and Vidal forges a decent shooting opportunity before tonking the ball over from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-1 Juventus (Vidal 38')</strong> That's another lovely goal. Chelsea have switched off a tad since their second goal and Juve punished them, a quickfire move concluding with Vidal receiving the ball 20 yards out and lashing a low shot into the corner.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> This game looks like coughing up plenty more goals, as Juve look ropy at the back but clever going forward. \"There's got to be some quality headlines tomorrow morning, based on those Chelsea goals: surely time to start a headline contest?\" reckons Andrew McNab before offering this effort: \"Chelsea Number 11 far from statue-esque in Oscar-winning performance.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> That's better from Chelsea: after a sustained spell of keep-ball, Torres rolled the ball smartly into the path of Ramires, whose 16-yard drive from the right was beaten away by Buffon. \"What is strange is about this Chelsea performance is our poor set-pieces, a big change from past seasons where Chelsea were consistently a big threat,\" blubs Luke Garrat. \"Perhaps that is the price for accommodating players such as Hazard, Oscar and Torres for the likes of Drogba, Kalou and Malouda. I'll take Oscar's goal any day though!\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Freekick to Juve 26 yards out, a little to the left. Pirlo stands over it ominously ...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Pirlo curls the freekick wide. In other news, Salomon Kalou's Lille are 3-0 to Bate Borisov at half-time. At home.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> This game could still go either way. Two bolts from the new boy in blue have put Chelsea in front but Juve have proven they are plenty dangerous enough to overturn this deficit and win. By the same token, Chelsea look capable of scoring more. Larks ahead.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> The second half begins where the first left off, with helter-skelter vibe. Chelsea are the first to threaten, Hazard donking a ball towards the back post but it's fractionally too high for Ramires, who can't steer his header on target.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> more decent work by Chelsea, who circulate the ball tidily for two minutes before Ivanovic decides to have a ping: his swirling effort from 25 yards almost finds a way past Buffon. But doesn't.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Bonucci takes down Lampard, giving Chelsea a freekick on the edge of the area, almost dead central ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Lampard curls the freekick around the wall but not past Buffon, who bats it to safety.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> A pause in play as two players receive treatment: Ramires, who was felled by Buffon as the keeper clasped a cross, and Lichtsteiner, who seems to have pulled something.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Hazard shows great speed to beat Barzagi to a through-ball and then darts in front of the defender in an attempt to draw a penalty. Barzagli does touch but the ref rightly rules that the contact was not strong or sinister enough to send the Belgian to the ground, so rejects the appeals for a penalty and orders Hazard to get to his feet.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> has Tito Vilanova taken Barcelona as far as he can? Sprtak Moscow are leading 2-1 at the Nou Camp! And there we were thinking that Zenit St Petersburg were the Russian team to watch this season ...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Giovinco wastes a freekick, wafting the ball high and wide from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> pressure from Juve!

  "<p>My new title of minister without portfolio has given my activities an amusing air of mystery. But still I was surprised to see that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/secret-justice-back-to-black\" title=\"\">Monday's Guardian editorial</a> had stripped me of future responsibility for what the more reactionary parts of the human rights lobby have nicknamed my \"secret courts\" bill. I may now be minister without specific portfolio, but I remain lead minister for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/justice-and-security\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a>.</p> <p>The editorial and other critics continue to suggest that this is some shady move to cloak the dark forces lurking deep in government with more secrecy. But anyone who knows me will know that it is ridiculous to claim I would champion any such move. Far from extending secrecy, allowing coverups or switching off the lights \u2013 all the hyperbole the critics would have you believe \u2013 this bill will for the first time extend civil justice into the most secret activities of the UK state, bringing our security services further into the light and improving their accountability.</p> <p>Most people will be aware that Tony Blair's disastrous \"war on terror\" has resulted in a substantial rise in the number of individuals, often former detainees, bringing compensation cases against the British government alleging mistreatment. But what most people do not know is that these cases almost never reach a conclusion in court.</p> <p>There is a fairly obvious reason for this. No country anywhere in the world allows material that genuinely puts national security at risk into the public domain, and that includes a courtroom. Despite the best efforts of the judiciary, the result is that important evidence does end up being excluded from hearings, and judges can neither uphold nor reject the shocking allegations that have been made.</p> <p>I am a stalwart supporter of the British judiciary who are the best in the world. It is a travesty that they can't give judgment in the very cases which raise the most serious questions about the nature of our democracy.</p> <p>The result is that we have no answers to shocking allegations made against British agents. And we are potentially putting the taxpayer in the situation of paying out significant sums to individuals who could be linked to terrorism simply because crucial evidence cannot be brought before a judge.</p> <p>Now, as the Guardian editorial writers have pointed out, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/secret-justice-back-to-black?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">I am indeed \"instinctively liberal\"</a>. I am a firm believer in open justice, and an opponent of closed justice in any normal circumstances. But I am also an opponent of legal purism, and have no time for institutionalised mythmaking \u2013 whether from the authoritarian right or the liberal left. I am quite convinced that allowing the national security elements of these cases to be heard in strictly limited closed hearings is an improvement on the present situation, which is a judicial vacuum.</p> <p>What we propose is to allow national security material that is currently excluded from court \u2013 and only that material \u2013 to be heard by a judge. Claimants will not be allowed to see the evidence, but an independent advocate will represent their interests and be able to challenge it.</p> <p>The bill contains strong safeguards to ensure that there can be no \"mission creep\" \u2013 no extension of secrecy into other areas or types of evidence \u2013 and that the judge has the ability to ensure the hearing is as fair as possible. Judges and not the executive will have to take the key decisions about whether a closed hearing is justified. They will retain the power to order the government to disclose material, or to remove it entirely from the courtroom because it is prejudicial or not national security-sensitive at all. Clearly, any suggestion that these closed hearings would make anything secret that is in the public domain now is emphatically wrong.</p> <p>It is quite obvious to me that this bill is on the right track: some justice is self-evidently better than none at all. And while it is a sadness that the public debate about national security has become quite so entrenched and predictable, my more recent year or two in government has reminded me that when you're facing fire from both sides, you've probably got it about right.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of messages of condolence for the loss of two constables shot dead in the line of duty are flooding into Greater Manchester police.</p> <p>Officers held a minute's silence on Wednesday in memory of Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23. Some wiped away tears as they stood in silence, heads bowed, in stations across the area.</p> <p>Sir Peter Fahy, Greater Manchester's chief constable, said the messages would be passed on to the officers' families and the outpouring of support would mean a huge amount to them.</p> <p>\"Nicola was our only daughter. She was always happy with life and lived for her family,\" said her parents, Susan and Bryn Hughes. \"She had an infectious personality and sense of humour and was a very caring and loving girl. We cannot express how we feel today except to say we have always been exceedingly proud of Nicola and always will be.\"</p> <p>Bone's lived in Sale with her partner Clare, with whom she was planning a civil partnership, and Clare's daughter Jessie.</p> <p>Her family said in a statement: \"In addition to the kind tribute from the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, may I add that our family have lost a wonderful daughter, sister, partner and parent to Jessie.\"</p> <p>Theresa May, the home secretary, cut short her holiday to fly to Manchester as Fahy said the gangland feud that had killed his officers threatened the lives of their colleagues and dozens of other people. The investigation into the murders of the police officers \u2013 the worst police killings since 1966, when three officers were shot dead in west London \u2013 continued against the backdrop of a criminal feud between two families in north Manchester.</p> <p>It emerged on Wednesday that either Hughes or Bone may have tried to fire her Taser to protect herself as she came under a hail of bullets on Tuesday morning. The force said a Taser was found on the ground out of its holster at the scene.</p> <p>Armed police are patrolling nearby Droylsden and Clayton 24 hours a day, and flashes of violence continued on Wednesday as shots were fired. A major aspect of the inquiry is the \"criminal conspiracy\" that allegedly helped the suspect in the police killings remain hidden for five weeks.</p> <p>Despite a \u00a350,000 reward and 50 armed raids across Greater Manchester, including on the Hattersley estate, Tameside, eastern Manchester, the hunt for Dale Cregan \u2013 who was wanted for the murders of a father and son \u2013 met a wall of silence and fear, and officers failed to apprehend him. Instead, the two female police officers died on Tuesday morning in a grenade and gun attack while answering a call to a burglary in Abbey Gardens on the estate.</p> <p>An hour later Cregan handed himself in at a police station in Hyde. He was being questioned on Wednesday on suspicion of the murders of the police officers and a father and son, David and Mark Short. A second man, 28, was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder the officers.</p> <p>Fahy was defensive when asked at a press conference why two unarmed officers had been sent to an estate that was known to have connections with a wanted fugitive.</p> <p>He said there had been no intelligence to link the address in Abbey Gardens to the hunt for the suspect.</p> <p>\"There were clearly suspicions that he was in the area,\" he said. \"But we have hundreds of incidents every day in that area and it would have been impractical to send armed officers to every one of those.\"</p> <p>The Guardian understands the two individuals who lived in the house in Abbey Gardens are not being treated as suspects. Police have spoken to them, but they have not been arrested and are unlikely to be.</p> <p>Instead it is understood the couple, a 33-year-old man and his girlfriend, may have been held against their will inside the house before the call was made to which PCs Bone and Hughes responded.</p> <p>A measure of the gulf the police have to bridge in their investigation emerged on Wednesday. Youths on the estate where the officers met their deaths were heard laughing and shouting \"Pop, pop\", and on Facebook a \"Dale Cregan for OBE\" page received several anti-police comments before being taken down.</p> <p>The level of fear in and around north Manchester was further illustrated when Fahy revealed that dozens of men, women and children had been issued with Osman warnings, detailing threats to their lives as a result of the feud.</p> <p>Fahy defended the decision to bail Cregan in June after his arrest on suspicion of the murder of Mark Short, 23, who was gunned down in the early hours of the morning on 25 May in the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden.</p> <p>Two months later Short's father, David, was killed at his home in Clayton, a mile away from the Cotton Tree, in a grenade and gun attack. Immediately afterwards police began their manhunt, naming Cregan and issuing the \u00a350,000 reward. Police carried out more than 100 raids \u2013 50 by armed officers \u2013 some of which focused on the Hattersley estate in Tameside.</p> <p>There were reports from the estate this week that while the search continued Cregan was regularly seen drinking in pubs. But these reports could not be verified. Claims that he held a goodbye party in a pub on Monday night were dismissed by a police source.</p> <p>One retired senior officer said such information had to be treated carefully. \"You have to ask how good is the information that he was seen drinking in pubs? There is always a folklore that surrounds these types of people with others claiming to have seen them.\"</p> <p>He said there was no doubt that the manhunt had been intensive and active. \"They will have had intensive coverage of the suspect,\" said the officer. \"They will have used surveillance, looked at his phones, used informants and done all sorts of things including using the reward to draw people out.</p> <p>\"What is certain is that the police were hunting him; they weren't sitting about saying 'let's just wait until he turns up'. They were actively looking for him.</p> <p>\"But if someone in the community has a network that is willing to make him disappear often it's quite hard to find the individual.\"</p> <p>Carl Fellstrom, a journalist and the author of Hoods, the story of the Nottingham-based organised crime family the Gunns, said behind any wall of silence was fear and a failure of trust between the police and the community. It is a double-edged thing,\" he said. \"People are not only fearful \u2013 they also don't trust the police with the information. They are not perceived to be part of the community.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2012. The original located the Hattersley estate, Tameside, in north rather than eastern Manchester. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The UK Independence party could poach enough Tory donors disgruntled with David Cameron's leadership to help it win the 2014 European elections, according to the Ukip leader.</p> <p>Nigel Farage described former supporters of Cameron in the City as \"pretty bloody angry\" with coalition policy, saying his party was close to securing funding to help it gain a lead in the European elections.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian before this week's party conference in Birmingham, Farage, the 48-year-old former commodities dealer who has been Ukip leader twice since 2006, said: \"We are doing OK, but we haven't got the money to compete with the big boys properly. We are that far from raising real money. We are not there yet, but we are very, very close to putting Ukip on to a different level of funding.</p> <p>\"Since David Cameron became leader in 2005, 60% of the money his party has raised came from the City. He has now betrayed the City when in November 2010 his government transferred authority from the City to three new [European] regulatory authorities. The City is pretty bloody angry about it.\"</p> <p>He admits that Ukip's organisation was \"totally shambolic for years and years\" and that it still lacks the funds needed to end its \"country cousin\" status as just another minor party.</p> <p>But buoyed by a midsummer opinion poll that reported a 12% poll share for Ukip \u2013 ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 10% \u2014 Farage, who is an MEP, also hints that a low turnout could even help Ukip's candidate succeed Louise Mensch as MP for Corby in the 15 November byelection. He dismisses most Westminster politicians as mere careerists \u2013 voters don't respect them and they don't respect voters \u2013 but concedes an admiration for Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, whom he regards as honest ministers trying to make a difference. Boris Johnson is \"good fun\". Perhaps he is the Tory leader with whom Ukip could realign the right after 2015, Farage hints.</p> <p>How does he square the success of Team GB at the Olympics with Ukip's hostility to multiculturalism? Easily, replies Farage. The Olympics were brilliant. \"Isn't it exciting, Mr Farage?\" one old lady told him in Kent.</p> <p>As far as Farage is concerned Mo Farah, for example, is British to the core. \"No one is more opposed to multiculturalism than Mo Farah. He's a uniculturalist who says: Listen mate, when I put on that GB shirt I'm proud, very proud.\" Ukip will be after Mo's vote when the time comes, Farage says.</p> <p>A self-styled libertarian and persistent smoker whose conversation is punctuated with boisterous laughter, Farage says: \"I'm very optimistic, I'm very bullish \u2013 always.\" Even after he was injured when his campaign's light aircraft crashed during his 2010 attempt to unseat the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, he bounced back. He resumed the leadership he had briefly passed on to the hapless Lord Pearson despite lingering back trouble.</p> <p>\"I have a clear view up to June 2014 \u2026 to win the [five-yearly] European elections in terms of both votes and seats,\" he says. In the 2009 campaign for the Strasbourg parliament Ukip came second with 2.5 million votes and a 16.5% voter share against Labour's 15.7% (both got 13 seats to the Tories' 26). But, as in previous general elections, Ukip's protest vote fell back sharply \u2013 to 3.1% of the vote against 2.3% in 2005 \u2013 when Cameron entered No 10 two years ago. Farage quit the Tory party after the signing of the Maastricht treaty under John Major in 1992, shortly before he was given the push by the French bank, Credit Lyonnaise, for what he calls unspecified \"insubordination\".</p> <p>He concedes that the British economic recovery, taxes (Ukip favours a flat 31% rate of income tax), red tape and immigration are far higher up voters' priorities than Europe. But gradually \"ordinary decent folk\" have come to realise how much Europe-made law affects their daily lives. That is why libertarians, disaffected shire Tories, \"classical Liberals\" and old Labour voters, frustrated small businessmen and big ones scared of Brussels regulation of the City, are coming across, he says.</p> <p>Farage left Dulwich College at 18 and went straight into the City, not to university. \"I wanted to be a yuppie,\" he recalls and feared he would be too old by 22. He laughs at his youthful excesses in the greedy 80s \u2013 \"totally irresponsible, but it was great fun\". Nowadays a more sombre Farage (he was made a freeman of the City of London in February) favours separating retail and investment banking to prevent another 2008-style crash, while stopping Brussels wrecking what the City still does best, such as insurance.</p> <p>Few party activists seem to dispute his ascendancy over Ukip. But it comes at a price, not just lost earnings (\"no one in British politics has sacrificed as much as I have\") but in widespread resentment in the ranks. When Farage recently floated the idea of dropping Ukip's \u00a3 sign logo he was again accused of high-handed conduct. It's being reviewed, no final decision has been taken, he says.</p> <p>As for accusations that, for all Ukip's attacks on the EU gravy train, the party's MEPs are a byword for wine, women and song, for laziness and supercharged expenses in Brussels and Strasbourg, they produce the only hint of quick temper in an otherwise affable interview. But he quickly admits that some people used Ukip's lax selection process to get to Brussels, then \"letting us down\".</p> <p>To raise the quality of candidates a rule change bans anyone who has been a member of a proscribed organisation such as the BNP (\"we don't want you\") and final candidate lists are drawn up by Ukip's national executive. Just like the major parties, in fact. \"Am I domineering personally, am I intolerant of others? No, I don't think I am.\"</p> <p>He is aware that Ukip is widely seen as a one-tune party and is trying to broaden its policies and appeal. Britain's windfarm policy transfers money from poor to rich, so the Earl of Glasgow gets \u00a3250,000 a year in rent alone, Farage says. \"We can't blame Europe for everything, we'd look obsessive otherwise,\" he adds with a chuckle.</p>",
  "<p>In 2007 the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmenvfru/130/130i.pdf\" title=\"\">Independent Scientific Group</a> reported on TB in cattle (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/16/badger-cull-government-go-ahead?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Starting gun for Britain's badger shoot</a>, 17 September). The two conclusions were that culling badgers could make no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain and that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone. To reach this conclusion took 10 years, cost \u00a350m and was undertaken by six professors and a knight of the realm.</p> <p>A document on the Defra website shows that the recently departed secretary of state, Caroline Spelman, consulted a different set of nine professors (with the exception of Professor Christl Donnelly). This group met with Defra's chief scientific adviser in April 2011. The meeting's conclusion may be summarised thus: after nine years, five years of culling and 4.5 years post cull, there is a 95% probability that the decrease in new outbreaks would be around 16%. In other words, after slaughtering most of the badgers the problem would not be solved, but would be one-sixth smaller.<br><strong>Ivor Annetts</strong><br><em>Tiverton, Devon</em></p> <p>\u2022 So far, small-scale dairy farmers have been put out of business by the uneconomic prices that milk processors and supermarkets pay for their milk. There is now talk of setting up \"super-herds\", where cows will live indoors all their lives in huge, mechanical milk factories. Small-scale dairy farmers, we are told, will soon be only a folk memory. Offering farmers the chance to shoot badgers in order to save their soon-to-be-redundant small outdoor herds is a piece of cynical nonsense on the part of the government.</p> <p>Agribusiness can't wait for these small farmers to go. When the badger culls have failed to stop the spread of bovine TB, as they are bound to, big businesses will sell the advantages of super-herd factories to the public on the basis that their milk comes from nice, clean, TB-free, indoor milk factories. And they won't have to bother about the NFU either.<br><strong>Angela Bogle</strong><br><em>Bakewell, Derbyshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 How will Defra know when 70% of badgers in the trial culling zones have been killed, when they have no way of knowing the total badger population? Even the most recent estimate took place back in 1997 and was based on counting numbers of setts. The slaughter of hundreds of thousands of badgers, described by the leading expert on bovine tuberculosis, <a href=\"http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/fellows-and-staff/fellows/lord-krebs\" title=\"\">Lord Krebs</a>, as crazy, is neither science-led policy-making or likely to help dairy farmers cope with this devastating disease.<br><strong>Ed Bailey</strong><br><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Every reasonable countryman wants healthy wildlife and healthy livestock. At long last we have a minister with the&#xa0;courage of his convictions to tackle the problem.

  "<p>The first clue is a large round hole at ground level in the hedge separating a ploughed field and a beech wood. The second is a neat pair of latrines \u2013 badgers are organised creatures that take their bathroom breaks seriously.</p> <p>A quick scramble through the brambles and the sett is found. It's a yawning hole in a sandy bank, partly hidden by ferns.</p> <p>\"I love the entrances, some of them are so grand,\" says Kayleigh. \"It's amazing to think of the creatures living underneath us. This is gorgeous.\"</p> <p>But this is no carefree nature trek. Kayleigh and her four companions are here, on Wednesday, on serious business: to map out the setts within the badger cull zone so that if \u2013 or when \u2013 the shooting begins, activists know where they need to be to make the job of the marksmen just about impossible. \"We plan to be here with loudhailers, bright lights, high-visibility jackets. They want to try to do the cull quietly. We aren't going to let them,\" says Kayleigh.</p> <p>Reluctantly, she admits the task is tricky. The cull zone is hundreds of square kilometres of fields, woods, hills and valleys in Gloucestershire and Somerset. \"But I'm confident that we'll get enough people out to find out where the culling is taking place and stop it,\" she says.</p> <p>Kayleigh (she does not reveal her full name) seems to be right that something big is stirring in the countryside. It is no &#xa0;surprise to find that people like her \u2013 a veteran of the last badger culling during the Krebs trials which ran from 1998 to 2008 \u2013 are involved. Nor that groups such as the Hunt Saboteurs Association are calling on members to take direct action.</p> <p>But there also seems to be a growing swell of anger from the sort of people who might normally be content just to sign a petition or write a letter to a &#xa0;newspaper.</p> <p>These people, too, seem intent on heading out into the country to take part in disrupting the culls. People from all corners of the UK have promised to be there, at the sites, to stop the shooting. Campaign leaders are trying to set up temporary campsites in the cull zones and are also asking sympathisers to open up spare rooms in their homes to protesters.</p> <p>It also seems clear from the excellent information the activists have that some local farmers and possibly even civil servants opposed to the cull are doing their bit to help by leaking information.</p> <p>\"We're getting interest from people who haven't been involved in animal rights or activism before,\" says Kayleigh. \"They see this cull as morally wrong and illegal and are determined to help stop it.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VtOzbZSVZtU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VtOzbZSVZtU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For now, it is all about careful preparation. Groups and individuals are organising themselves, many under the banner of Stop the Cull, which uses the website badger-killers.co.uk.</p> <p>They are laying down stocks they might need, from loudhailers (and vuvuzelas, the horns that made such a racket at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa) to fireworks and high-powered flashlights.</p> <p>And they are carrying out the painstaking process of making sure they know the location of the setts.</p> <p>As the activists carried on their work a couple of carloads of people set out on reconnaissance in the Somerset part of the zone. Fortified by juice and Bourbon biscuits, Kayleigh and the team start out on a little-used footpath passing through a boggy wood.</p> <p>Three of them, experienced badger trackers, dart off in all directions looking for runs that will lead to them to setts. Two are new to the game and, patiently, are taught what to look out for \u2013 small but clear paths through the undergrowth, snags of fur on fences, those tell-tale latrines.</p> <p>They are also told how to spot evidence that other humans have been looking for setts. Kayleigh says that in readiness for the cull, surveyors have been leaving strands of barbed wire in the woods intending to snag badger fur so they can track the animals.</p> <p>Activists are also told to look out for rocks or stones that seem out of place; the cullers have been planting peanuts, which badgers love, to get the animals used to moving through areas where the marksmen can lie in wait.</p> <p>The group finds footprints in a muddy bank, but they are judged to be deer.</p> <p>The wood doesn't feel \"very badgery\" \u2013 a little too damp \u2013 so the group tramps through a field up to higher, more promising ground.</p> <p>This is Lara's first taste of activism. A volunteer at a rescue centre, she is absolutely opposed to the cull.</p> <p>\"Rather than just sitting around and moaning about it, I wanted to do something to help,\" she says. \"If the cull happens I will be there with these guys.\"</p> <p>Ken, a young care worker who helps elderly people, says that he grew up in a village in Wiltshire and grew disillusioned at the methods farmers were using. \"It seems to be all about shaping the countryside \u2013not to protect it but to maximise their profits,\" he says.</p> <p>Like Lara, he vows to be out at night when the cull begins, doing all he can to stop it. \"I'm still hoping it won't come to that but I will be back here if it does.\"</p> <p>As the team climbs the field they mark down badger runs through the hedges on an Ordnance Survey map. They are keeping everything on paper, fearful that if the information is put on to a computer it could get into the wrong hands and be used by those who wish badgers harm.</p> <p>They exchange stories about badgers \u2013 how some of the creatures' runs have followed the same routes for centuries, how rows of cherry trees sometimes mark the boundary between clan territories because the fruit-loving animals mark out the edge of their areas with their latrines, depositing the cherry&#xa0;stones to root.</p> <p>The discovery of a sett in the beech wood is the highlight of the day. But then comes a low point. A stinking badger corpse lies just 100 metres from the sett, a spent shotgun shell beside it.</p> <p>\"That brings it home to me how important it is to be involved,\" says Lara.</p> <p>A question people such as Lara and Ken will have to face is how far they will go to save the badgers.</p> <p>Kayleigh is coy when asked if she was one of those who cut through traps during the Krebs trial. \"Maybe,\" she says.</p> <p>She is relaxed at the idea of the names, addresses and phone numbers of those involved in the cull, from politicians to those organising the shooting, being published. \"They are involved in something illegal. Why should their identities remain secret?\"</p> <p>Kayleigh also says she is not bothered if more hardline campaigners carry out criminal acts such as sabotaging bank machines of supermarkets that do not come out against the cull, as one group has threatened to do. \"I won't be losing any sleep over that.\"</p> <p>By late afternoon the group calls it a day and head home. Some have long journeys ahead of them. All vow to return this week or at the weekend \u2013 and be ready when the shooting begins.</p>",

  "<p>One in five people living in Germany now comes from an immigrant background, according to figures released on Thursday. They show that the minority community grew by more than 1.3% last year at a time when the overall population is falling.</p> <p>Figures from the German Federal Statistical Office show that the number of people with immigrant backgrounds living in Germany increased by 216,000 from 2010 to 2011. Multiculturalism has been a fiercely controversial topic in Germany in recent years, engendering vigorous debate over the integration of immigrants, many of whom moved to the country in the 1960s as guest workers from Turkey. There are now 16 million people with an immigrant background living in Germany \u2013 19.5% of the country's population.</p> <p>Although Germans have discovered a greater affinity with their minority communities thanks to the exploits of football stars such as Mesut \u00d6zil and Sami Khedira, there have been a growing number of voices challenging the value of multiculturalism. This week, the mayor of Berlin district Neuk\u00f6lln, Heinz Buschkowsky, argues in a new book that multiculturalism has failed.</p> <p>There is some evidence that the most recent rise in immigration has been caused by economic refugees from southern European countries as a result of the euro crisis. But the debate habitually falls back to the integration of the Turkish community, which represents the highest number of immigrants in Europe's biggest economy.</p> <p>\"Many politicians and policymakers see integration politics as a way to create a homogenised society rather than encouraging equal political and social participation for everyone in Germany \u2013 integration is well-intentioned but ill-implemented,\" said G\u00f6k\u00e7e Yurdakul, a social scientist specialising in diversity and social conflicts at Humboldt University in Berlin.</p> <p>The issue has driven a wedge between Germany and Turkey in recent years, most notably when Christian Wulff, the then German president, was told by his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah G\u00fcl, that Germany should be doing more to help Turks integrate into German culture. This followed claims by the German chancellor Angela Merkel that multiculturalism had failed.</p> <p>Some experts disagree, saying integration is already happening at a local level. \"You can see that integration is happening through local initiatives and civil society organisations putting efforts into living together in a diverse society,\" said Yurdakul. However, the efforts were not reflected on a national level and politicians still had a long way to go.</p> <p>\"[These] policies are trying to get people equal access to labour markets, politics, education and healthcare, but on the other hand it's ill-implemented because it's used to restrict immigration in Germany.\"</p> <p>Then there are those held up as successes of integration such as \u00d6zil, who is descended from Turkish immigrants and considered a national hero.</p> <p>Younger people are starting to make an effort to reach out to the Turkish communities to integrate themselves with their neighbours. Marlene Schliepach, 26, is studying to become a kindergarten teacher and started learning Turkish two years ago in an effort to be able to talk to the children she will be caring for.</p> <p>\"I'm learning Turkish because I want to convey to my Turkish students that I, as their teacher, and as a German, value their language,\" she said. \"Lots of teachers want to make them focus on only learning German. But integration has to go both ways.\"</p> <p>Some, such as Tim Panhorst, 27, are learning Turkish because of family connections to the culture, but think it is important for Germans to attempt to reach out. \"I wasn't really learning it from school, but from friends and relatives because my brother is married to a Turkish girl,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But when I meet Turkish people and speak to them in the language, my experience is that they are always glad someone German can. It's always a way of connecting, and in a positive way.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20th September 2012 to correct the figure of 1.3% relating to community growth in the first paragraph.

  "<p>The England team will remember to pack their helmets and they may consider digging out their chest pads after watching Afghanistan take on India here on Wednesday night. India won the game by 23 runs but one or two of their number left the ground chastened, in particular their opening pair.</p> <p>Afghanistan produced the best performance from a non-Test playing nation so far in this tournament, albeit in front of a disappointingly meagre crowd. Their opening bowler Shapoor Zadran, well over 6ft tall, hurried such modern giants as Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, before dismissing them. One ball registered at 93mph, which raised eyebrows, though some of them went northwards while questioning the validity of the radar gun.</p> <p>Without doubt Shapoor is a proper bowler and a fierce competitor. He removed the middle stump of Gambhir via the inside edge of the left-hander's bat, as if he had done something similar many times before. He then produced a beauty to find the outside edge of Sehwag's bat. In both instances the paceman was immediately surrounded by jubilant team-mates revelling in the occasion.</p> <p>In the end India managed a total of 159, but it would have been significantly smaller if Afghanistan had managed to hold their catches. Virat Kohli, who provided the silky backbone to the India innings, was dropped twice. Suresh Raina also enjoyed an escape.</p> <p>There was no questioning the zeal of the Afghan team in the field. They buzzed here and there on a bumpy outfield, hurling the ball at their keeper with a venom that often threatened his well-being. Indeed Mohammad Shahzad had to limp from the field with a damaged knee and be replaced behind the stumps, though he returned with some brio to open the batting.</p> <p>But Afghanistan could not hang on to the ball descending out of the night sky, a ball, incidentally, which was increasingly covered in dew as the game progressed.</p> <p>If Shapoor impressed with his fire, generating steep bounce on occasions, there was pragmatism from the rest of the bowlers, wily seamers, such as Dawrat Zadran, and low-slung off-spinners. Then we discovered batsmen who were sufficiently exhilarating to cause Mahendra Dhoni a few headaches, though no cricketer conceals anxiety as effortlessly as the India captain.</p> <p>Out limped Shahzad to open the batting and soon his leg was better. He produced the \"helicopter\" shot, patented by his hero, Dhoni, behind the stumps. Dhoni could barely conceal a smile; Shahzad beamed jubilantly as the ball sped to the square-leg boundary. He was less effective when the ball came to him at chest height, which will not be lost on England's analysts.</p> <p>From the captain, Nawroz Mangal, there were classic shots on either side of the wicket. Karem Sadeq, a pocket battleship in the middle order, was deft and determined, while Mohammad Nabi struck the ball with immense power when accumulating 31 from 17 balls. England cannot afford to take any of these players lightly, though they may be cheered by a patchy performance from India.</p> <p>Earlier in the day England defeated Pakistan by 15 runs in their final preparation match on a very different surface to the one they can expect to see at the Premadasa Stadium against Afghanistan on Friday.</p> <p>England could only muster 111 on a cloying surface with Luke Wright, now the undisputed No3 \u2013 and a jolly popular one \u2013 scoring 38, which would comfortably be the biggest innings of the match.</p> <p>Yet they defended this total tigerishly with their spinners to the fore, even though Graeme Swann was rested. Danny Briggs was given the new ball, something he has done effectively for Hampshire in the past, and he bowled with maturity in helpful conditions. Samit Patel offered useful support and the out-cricket was disciplined. After warm-up victories against Australia and Pakistan, England may soon be concerned that they are peaking too early.</p> <p>Briggs spoke of the team's burgeoning confidence\" \"It has been a great week of preparation; it's gone as well as it could have done.\" The young left-arm spinner has made a strong case for inclusion in England's best XI, but so much depends on the playing surface.</p> <p>\"We have a lot of options and three main spinners. We could play three, two or one,\" he said.As for Afghanistan Briggs was taking nothing for granted even before their spirited performance against India. \"They've played a lot of Twenty20 cricket coming into this tournament so we can't underestimate them.\"</p>",
  "<p>The gangland feud that killed two unarmed police officers and a father and son is threatening the lives of dozens of other men, women and children, the chief constable of Greater Manchester has warned.</p> <p>Sir Peter Fahy spoke as parts of one of Britain's biggest cities were under the grip of 24-hour armed police patrols after the murder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/police-officers-gun-grenade-attack\" title=\"\">constables Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32</a>, in the worst killings of police officers for five decades.</p> <p>On Wednesday a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/parents-tribute-police-officers-murdered-manchester\" title=\"\">28-year-old man was arrested</a> on suspicion of conspiracy to murder the two PCs. Dale Cregan, 29, who was the subject of a five-week manhunt before handing himself in an hour after the killings, was still being questioned on Wednesday on suspicion of their murders and those of David and Mark Short.</p> <p>Fahy revealed that dozens of people in and around Manchester have been issued with Osman warnings \u2013 detailing threats to their life \u2013 as a result of the vicious feud between two crime families which escalated dramatically on Tuesday with the murders of two of his officers in an apparent ambush.</p> <p>Grenades of the kind used in the fatal attack on Hughes and Bone on the Hattersley estate in Mottram were still in the hands of criminals, the chief constable said, and there were growing fears about public safety.</p> <p>\"We are not confident that we have recovered all of the grenades and the threat is still there,\" he said. \"I would want that to be the message.</p> <p>\"This has been a longstanding criminal feud between different outfits and the threat is very much there.\"</p> <p>Fragments of the grenade used to kill the police officers were still at the crime scene \u2013 a house in Abbey Gardens on the Hattersley estate \u2013 on Wednesday. The firearm used in the fatal shootings has been recovered, Fahy said.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning the two female police officers were sent to part of the estate, unarmed and without backup, to respond to a burglary report where they were killed in a gun and grenade attack.</p> <p>Fahy defended the decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-shootings-suspect-released-bail\" title=\"\">put Cregan on police bail</a> in June following his arrest on suspicion of the murder of Mark Short in May.

Two months later Short's father, David, 46, was murdered a mile away in a grenade and gun attack at his home.</p> <p>His death sparked an unprecedented manhunt by Greater Manchester police, who named Cregan as a suspect. His picture was beamed onto screens at football matches, and officers carried out 50 armed raids \u2013 including on the Hattersley estate \u2013 in their failed hunt.</p> <p>Police were patrolling the Droylsden and Clayton areas of east Manchester as flashes of violence continued on Wednesday, with gunshots fired in the area.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2012.

  "<p>Clothing website Asos has emerged as one of the victors in the fashion wars. Its stellar quarterly growth figures contrasted sharply with the dire fortunes of high street chain French Connection, which now expects to plunge into the red this year.</p> <p>French Connection lost \u00a36.3m in the first six months of the year as shoppers defected to cheaper rivals such as Zara and Primark, as well as Asos, to get the latest catwalk trends at high street prices.</p> <p>With UK like-for-like sales down nearly 10% and a full-year loss now \"highly likely\", the French Connection management team on Wednesday admitted for the first time that the company's prices were too high and that a major shake-up of both its clothing ranges and pricing was now on&#xa0;the cards.</p> <p>Announcing a two-year turnaround plan, operations director Neil Williams conceded that the company's recent collections \"didn't resonate with customers\" and that it needed to respond faster to changing trends if it was to win back its internet-savvy target audience of 25-to-34-year-olds.</p> <p>\"Some of our top end pricing had got away from where the sweet spots are,\" he said. \"There's a price at which people will say 'that's what I'm prepared to pay for a nice French Connection dress or top' and you will see more product clustered around that price point.\"</p> <p>As French Connection's star has waned, Asos's has risen, and that was reflected in their share prices on Thursday: French Connection closed down 8% at 23p while Asos finished up more than 14% at \u00a323.30.</p> <p>Asos, which targets young women looking to emulate the designer looks of celebrities such as Alexa Chung, Tulisa Contostavlos and Kate Moss, reported growth of 31% in the fourth quarter thanks in part to strong trading in overseas markets such as the United States and Australia.</p> <p>The quarterly figures showed a pick-up in UK sales, up 15% compared with 8% in the previous period. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/retailers-point-to-consumer-slowdown\" title=\"\">grim figures from Next last week</a>, chief executive Nick Robertson said he had not detected a slowdown in August and early September, adding: \"August is always a bit slower for us. All the kids are in Ibiza and partying.\"</p> <p>Faced with weak demand for its products, French Connection was forced to discount heavily to clear unsold stock. The retailer has since made changes to its design team: among the initiatives announced was a staff training push to improve customer service.</p> <p>Williams said that the brand was holding its own online but needed to get a better performance out of its shops. The retailer is trying to dispose of 15 loss-making stores.</p> <p>Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders said there was a sense that the French Connection brand had become \"rather stale\" and had \"lost its way\". Online sellers such as Asos have gained market share by providing relatively cheap fast-fashion fixes, Saunders said, adding: \"Against such a vibrant market, French Connection is looking increasingly colourless.\"</p> <p>The challenge faced by French Connection was emphasised by better than expected figures from Spanish fashion juggernaut Inditex. The owner of the Zara chain said profits had jumped 32% to \u20ac944m in the six months to 31 July, with like-for-like sales up 7%. Inditex, whose founder Amancio Ortega is now Spain's richest person and the world's fifth-wealthiest according to the Forbes list of billionaires, was one of the pioneers of the fast fashion retailing model which sees new products flow into store every week to keep shoppers coming back for more.</p> <h2>Tesco boss: apps are the new high street</h2> <p>Tesco boss Philip Clarke has warned that the \"tectonic plates are shifting\" in the retail industry as shoppers increasingly rely on the internet and smartphones. \"People are opting out of stores,\" he said. \"Apps have become the new high street.\"</p> <p>Clarke, speaking at the World Retail Congress, said half the people looking at Tesco's food website were doing so to check prices rather than shop. Since taking charge of the supermarket group last year, Clarke has put the brakes on expansion and focused on revamping stores and investing in new technology. He added on the retailer's new blog Talking Shop that new stores were about \"new customers, not loving the customers we've got\".</p> <p>\"We needed to invest more in our customers, in the stores they are using today with better quality products and more staff. And if we're investing in tomorrow's customers, our money is better spent online because that's where the future growth is,\" he said.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>In order to find one of <a href=\"http://slinkachu.com\" title=\"\">Slinkachu's</a> street installations, look for a man in his early 30s sprawled face down on the pavement with a camera in his hands. He remembers a firefighter who came running, thinking he had keeled over, only to get close and find him photographing a minute figure of a woman looking up at a tiny weight-loss poster. Slinkachu immerses tiny plastic figures in their own worlds of drama. A child skateboards in the curve of a piece of discarded satsuma peel. A man walks up a ladder to a spaceship in the form of a McDonald's burger box.

For his latest exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.andipa.com/index.php\" title=\"\">Global Model Village</a>, he has photographed his scenes in cities around the world including Cape Town, Doha, Berlin and New York. Tiny paddy-field workers toil in the puddles made by a Beijing manhole cover; a couple cower beneath a CCTV camera in Moscow. \"What you think of as being very different types of places [around the world], people experience the same type of things, people understand it,\" he says. \"I guess that's the overarching theme of this collection.\"</p> <p>There is a joy in some of Slinkachu's images - the <a href=\"http://www.unurth.com/Slinkachu-Wet-n-Wild-Italy\" title=\"\">people riding a waterslide</a> into a drain makes me happy to think about how minuscule people would use our world - but they usually tell stories of fear, loneliness and vulnerability. \"It's the melancholy of life, especially city life,\" he says. Barely a centimetre high, the figures can produce a surprisingly magnified emotional reaction. \"I've thought about it quite a lot over the years,\" he says. \"I think it's the same thing you get with animals or babies - they bring out a nurturing side. What I&nbsp;try to do is reflect people's feelings, so&nbsp;they can put themselves into the&nbsp;characters.\"</p> <p>Once Slinkachu has finished photographing his characters, he abandons them to the street. One piece \u2013 a man standing by a cash machine \u2013 survived for about three months. \"I think he must have been just out of the way of the roadsweeper,\" he says. \"Most of the time, I&nbsp;don't check.

  "<p>Since Voltaire and notably since the establishment of a secular republic in 1905, France has regarded religions as systems of belief which can be freely criticised and ridiculed. The entrenched tradition of mocking religions and clerical institutions explains the success of long-living publications such as Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 (a satirical founded in 1915) and Charlie Hebdo (founded in 1969).</p> <p>Charlie Hebdo was launched by a group of \"non-conformists\" who had previously run a monthly called Hara Kiri (whose subtitle read: \"dumb and nasty\").</p> <p>Charlie Hebdo originally featured cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes. It was profoundly irreverent and had a strong leftwing anarchist leaning.</p> <p>Long before the advent of political correctness, it also had a bawdy inclination: the magazine liked to feature naked women and what would be regarded today as sexist jokes.</p> <p>In November 1970, following the death of Charles de Gaulle in his home town of Colombey, Charlie Hebdo produced the nastiest and allegedly one of the most hilarious front covers in the history of the French press.</p> <p>Spoofing the popular media that lamented the loss of a \"great statesman\", the weekly's headline laconically read: \"Tragic ball at Colombey, one dead\". This was too much for the Gaullist interior minister, who banned the publication.</p> <p>Charlie Hebdo had then the wittiest and funniest team of writers and cartoonists. They had no taboos and they relentlessly targeted pompous and reactionary people.</p> <p>They particularly liked to torment the rich, the famous, clergymen, the military and politicians. In the climate of class struggles in 1970s France, Charlie Hebdo offered a generation of youngsters (who often nicked the magazine from newsagents) a memorable take on current affairs.</p> <p>In 1981, \"Charlie\" \u2013 as it is nicknamed \u2013 ceased publication, owing to falling readership. When it was relaunched in 1992, the world had dramatically changed. Few of the historic crew were still present.</p> <p>Philippe Val, the new director, was a stand-up comedian who made a name for himself by singing and telling jokes in front of leftwing audiences in the 1980s.</p> <p>Val changed the style of the publication. He did not hesitate to sack staff members who opposed his views and was often described as \"dictatorial\". Under his leadership, Charlie Hebdo's editorial stance became muddled. Val was involved in high-profile disputes with what he called \"unreconstructed leftists\".</p> <p>He was a staunch supporter of the 2004 law banning the headscarf in state schools and \"Charlie\" became more anti-Islamic than anti-clerical. In 2009, Val was appointed director of France Inter, a public radio station, by Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>The young anarchist comedian and the rebellious spirit of Charlie Hebdo officially died that day.</p> <p>Since Val's departure, Charlie Hebdo has tried to recapture a sense of irreverence that seemed lost. The new director, St\u00e9phane Charbonnier, known as Charb, wants to move on and reposition the weekly's editorial line firmly on the left. It is doubtful that he can manage to restore the publication's past glory.</p> <p>Of course people should be entitled to mock Islam and any other religion. However, in the current climate of racial and religious prejudice in Europe, how can these cartoons be helpful? Charlie Hebdo is waging a rearguard battle.</p> <p><em>Philippe Marli\u00e8re is professor of French politics at University College London</em></p>",
  "<p>Republicans have voted down legislation that would have established a $1bn jobs programme to put unemployed veterans back to work as firefighters and police officers and in public work projects.</p> <p>They objected to the cost of the bill, which they said violated spending limits agreed to last year in Congress.</p> <p>Democrats and veterans groups say its cost are fully offset.</p> <p>The bill, which had bipartisan support in the Senate and would have given priority to post-9/11 veterans whose employment prospects are three points below the national average, fell two votes short of the majority of 60 needed to waive Republican objections.</p> <p>After the vote, at midday on Wednesday, Patty Murray, chairman of the Senate veterans affairs committee, accused Senate Republicans of \"shocking and shameful\" obstructive politics.</p> <p>She said: \"At a time when one in four young veterans are unemployed, Republicans should have been able, for just this once, to put aside the politics of obstruction and to help these men and women provide for their families.</p> <p>\"It's unbelievable that even after more than a decade of war many Republicans still will not acknowledge that the treatment of our veterans is a cost of war. Today they voted down a fully paid-for bill that included bipartisan ideas to put veterans in jobs that will allow them to serve their communities. Jobs that would have helped provide veterans with the self-esteem that is so critical to their successful transition home.\"</p> <p>Murray said the bill had been extensively rewritten to include amendments by Republicans \u2013 eight of the 12 provisions in the bill were Republican-originated ideas. She said that the bill had even incorporated most of the provisions of a competing Republican bill, but to no avail.</p> <p>Democratic senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the bill's lead sponsor, said: \"[With] a need so great as unemployed veterans, this is not the time to draw a technical line on the budget.\"</p> <p>Republicans said they agreed with the sentiment to help veterans but said the bill was flawed.</p> <p>Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said the federal government already had six job-training programs for veterans and there was no way to monitor how well they were working. He said that the way forward was not to increase debt.</p> <p>\"We ought to do nothing now that makes the problem worse for our kids and grandkids,\" Coburn told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Supporters modeled their proposal partly after the Civilian Conservation Corp used during the Great Depression to employ people to build parks and build dams. </p> <p>A handful of Republicans joined with Democrats in voting to waive the objection to the bill: senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Maine's Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. The Democrats needed a vote of 60 to go forward with the bill but the final vote was 58 to 40.</p> <p>\"After everything our veterans have done for us, the least we can do is make sure they are afforded every opportunity to thrive here at home,\" Heller said.</p> <p>Minutes before the vote, Murray gave an impassioned speech from the floor, asking for unity to pass the bill which she said \"should not be killed by procedural games\".</p> <p>The vote, postponed from last week because of Republican opposition, was the latest in a series of delays which have hampered the bill's progress. Members of the House are preparing to leave Washington to campaign on their re-election.</p> <p>The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America described the vote as a \"huge disappointment\".</p> <p>Ramsay Sulayman, of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said he was saddened to see \"a very small group of people that are standing for principle to block the bill from even coming to a vote\" on an issue like veteran jobs, which has seen a strong spirit of bipartisan support.</p> <p>\"That's what we object to. If people say 'We don't like the bill' and stand up and get up and vote and go on the record ... that is different. It's sad to see a few people holding a bill to hostage.\"</p> <p>The jobs bill is based on a proposal in President Barack Obama's state of the union address in January.</p> <p>Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate, said the bill had met \"one Republican stall tactic after another\", in a post to his Twitter account last week. He said the tactics marked a \"new low\" for Republicans.</p> <p>Jeff Sessions, the Senate Budget Committee ranking member, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/249477-senate-postpones-vote-on-veterans-jobs-bill-until-next-week\">said he objected to the bill</a> on the grounds it would increase the veterans affairs department budget and would blow though the spending cap lawmakers agreed last year.</p> <p>Democrats argue the bills costs are already covered by plans to collect more than half a billion in unpaid taxes over the next five years, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/congress-feuds-over-jobs-bill-for-veterans/article/2508289#.UFiE5b8RaL\">according to the Washington Examiner</a>.</p> <p>The bill was held up in the Senate last week after filibustering by Rand Paul, the Republican Senator for Kentucky, to gain support for a Pakistani doctor who helped locate Osama Bin Laden.</p> <p>Paul has promised to block Senate action until the doctor, Shakil Afridi, is released from jail. The Pakistani government has said it will not release him. Paul has also called on the Obama administration to cut foreign aid to Pakistan until Afridi is released.</p> <p>Unemployment for the newest generation of veterans, post 9/11, rose to 10.9% in August, a stark contrast to the nation's unemployment rate of 8.1% in the same month. Veterans commonly find work after service in federal, state and local government jobs, a vulnerable sector in the current economy.</p> <p>Younger veterans are especially vulnerable to unemployment after deployment. Around 20% of 18-24-year-old veterans are unemployed.</p>",
  "<p>The conundrum that underlies England's controversial badger cull is that the scientific bedrock of the case both for and against it is the same landmark 10-year trial that began in 1998, the <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/isg/report/final_report.pdf\" title=\"\">Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT)</a>. The opposite conclusions reached by supporters and opponents of the cull come down to a serious difference of interpretation.</p> <p>The scientists who commissioned and ran the trial are, almost without exception, opposed to the cull. Lord Krebs this week called the cull \"a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19623931\" title=\"\">crazy scheme</a>\".

These results, combined with evaluation of alternative culling methods, suggest that badger culling is unlikely to contribute effectively to the control of cattle TB in Britain.\"</p> <p>But on 4 April the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) convened a meeting of 11 top scientists. The <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/atoz/tb/documents/bovinetb-scientificexperts-110404.pdf\" title=\"\">two-page document</a> produced was then used by ministers to justify labelling the cull \"science-led\".</p> <p>The meeting was led by Defra chief vet Nigel Gibbens and chief scientist Bob Watson and, with significant caveats, concluded culling might result in a drop in cattle TB infections somewhere between 3% and 24% in that area, with a central estimate of 12%-16%. The government says this is a big enough benefit to justify the cull, despite it costing farmers more than doing nothing.</p> <p>Opponents highlight those caveats. First, the 10-year trial used cage-trapping and shooting to kill the badgers, but the new culls will employ the cheaper method of free shooting. \"The more a future culling policy deviates from the conditions of the RBCT, the more likely it is that the effects of that policy will differ,\" Defra's panel noted.</p> <p>Second, the scientists noted the risks of not conducting hard, long culls over large areas: 70% of all badgers in at least a 150 sq km area for four successive years. The RBCT had identified a \"perturbation effect\", where badgers fleeing from cull areas increased infections in surrounding areas. \"If culling is not conducted \u2026 according to the minimum criteria, then this could result in a smaller benefit or even a detrimental effect on cattle bTB incidence,\" the panel said. Opponents argue the risks of disruption by protests and lack of co-ordination by large groups of farmers and landowners are high. When asked whether the differences between the RBCT and the government's cull justified calling the latter \"science-led\", Watson told the Guardian the cull was backed by scientific judgement.</p> <p>All sides agree that better biosecurity \u2013 preventing cattle-to-cattle infections \u2013 is crucial and that vaccination would be a better option. But the existing injectable vaccine for badgers is more expensive to administer. An oral badger vaccine, delivered in laced food bait, is stuck in development. Cattle cannot currently be vaccinated as this would mean they could not be distinguished by existing tests from animals with the disease.</p>",
  "<p>When Belle Littenberg was born, American women did not have the right to vote. It was 1914, and women wouldn't be granted suffrage for another <a href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/naw/nawstime.html\">six years</a>. Seventy-three years later, when her granddaughter Chloe was born, it was into a completely different world. The right to vote had been a given for two generations of women now, as had been a list of rights that were lofty dreams when Belle was born.</p> <p>Now, women applied for their own credit cards, went to graduate school en masse, took birth control and had legal abortions. The first year that Chloe was eligible to vote in a presidential primary, she could vote for a woman who had a real chance of becoming the nominee.</p> <p>Thanks in large part to the work of the intervening generation \u2013 of women like Belle's daughters \u2013 the political and cultural lives of women had changed, in some ways, beyond recognition. In this presidential election year, two of those crucial advances \u2013 access to birth control and abortion \u2013 are under threat.</p> <p>In 2012, seemingly every month has brought news of a new piece of state legislation designed to make abortions harder to obtain. The \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/12/14/389157/ohio-heartbeat-bill-will-force-doctors-to-wail-until-a-woman-is-in-mortal-danger-to-justify-an-abortion/?mobile=nc\">Heartbeat Bill</a>\" in Ohio would ban abortion at as early as five weeks, and the Mississippi \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/personhood-campaign-compa_n_1084984.html\">Personhood</a>\" initiative would outlaw abortion, the morning-after pill and even hormonal contraception like the pill and the IUD \u2013 not to mention in vitro fertilization (IVF) fertility treatment. Then there are the mandatory transvaginal ultrasound bills that failed in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-02-22/virginia-governor-mcdonnell-abortion-ultrasound/53213156/1\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/PA-Senator-Counters-Ultrasound-with-Erectile-Bill-143671326.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, but passed and are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/kristof-when-states-abuse-women.html?_r=0\">in effect</a> at this very moment in Texas.</p> <p>These are not bipartisan efforts; they are Republican iniatives, all of them, and the GOP platform this year contains <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/platform-abortion_n_1837571.html\">a plank</a> supporting a constitutional amendment that would ban abortion <em>even in cases of rape, incest and when the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother</em>. To this, Republicans <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/01/republican-plan-redefine-rape-abortion\">have added efforts to redefine rape</a>, which, if successful, would make rape exceptions to abortion bans even harder to navigate.</p> <p>All this, taken with the GOP's blocking of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/06/05/154377271/senate-republicans-block-paycheck-fairness-act\">Paycheck Fairness Act </a>earlier this year, and incessant threats to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/08/06/644611/gop-lawmaker-planned-parenthood-is-getting-wealthy-on-murder-for-hire/\">Planned Parenthood</a> \u2013 which apart from providing low-cost birth control, abortion and sex education also provides life-saving cancer screenings \u2013 a picture starts to emerge. For a woman who was born in 1914, it's a familiar and unwelcome one.</p> <p>As the efforts of both parties suggest, the women's vote will matter this year. It will matter in that women will help decide who wins the White House. But for a woman like Belle, who remembers an America in which women could not vote or have safe legal abortions, it will matter on a political and personal level \u2013 and a philosophical one. What are the consequences for people who denigrate American women and deny them their rights? In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-04-30-black-vote_N.htm\">only 65.7%</a> of eligible women voters went to the polls. In 2012, this year of transvaginal ultrasound laws and all-male contraception hearings, how many American women will sit back in silence on election day?</p> <p>At their convention, Republicans, aware that their legislative efforts have given some women voters pause, went to great pains to explain that <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/08/31/160366695/gop-uses-convention-to-reach-out-to-female-voters\">there is no</a> \"war on women\". We love women, they insisted, assigning <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/ann_romney_love_mitt_please/\">Ann Romney</a> the task of telling the American people just how much. The Democrats also made a play for women's votes at their convention, with appearances from <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/DNC/Events/Nancy-Keenan-at-the-2012-Democratic-National-Convention/C3797180/\">Nancy Keenan</a>, president of <a href=\"http://www.naral.org/\">Naral Pro Choice America</a>, Planned Parenthood president <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/05/planned-parenthood-s-cecile-richards-takes-center-stage-in-charlotte.html\">Cecile Richards</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-2012-sandra-flukes-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-full-text/2012/09/05/891a642a-f7ac-11e1-8253-3f495ae70650_story.html\">Sandra Fluke</a>, the women's rights advocate who was meant to shut up after Rush Limbaugh called her a \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/05/sandra-fluke-speech-_n_1852637.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">slut</a>\", but who has done quite the opposite.</p> <p>For Belle, who remembers a time when women's civic participation was limited by law and by culture, the number of American women who do not vote is distressing. Many of her friends are women who voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 primaries, and in those hot, disappointed days after Clinton conceded her delegates to Barack Obama, several of her friends declared that they if they could not vote for Clinton, they would not vote at all. Belle was not pleased. You have to vote, she told them. Vote because you're an American, and you have a responsibility not just to your country, but to the women who fought to secure you that right.</p> <p>This year, though, Belle's exhortations to her friends have become less about simply exercising the right to suffrage and more about preserving other hard-won rights. She believes that regardless of who they vote for, all women should vote \u2013 but, she tells her friends, we should vote for the party that will do most for women. There's a great deal to be done to ensure that women have all the same opportunities as men, and she knows that the Republicans won't do it.</p> <p>The insults that have been hurled at American women in the last two years, in the form of legislation and in the form of actual slurs \u2013 thanks, Mr Limbaugh \u2013 have made \"women's issues\" central to the national political conversation. But we both reject the term \"women's issues\". We believe that <em>all Americans</em> have a vested interest in creating a country where women are allowed to decide if and when to start a family, and are paid fairly so that they can provide for that family.</p> <p>These aren't women's issues; they are human issues. But to American women, we say what Belle and her friends have been telling each other over the mahjong table ever since Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped aside for Barack Obama: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might not be able to vote for a woman, but you have to vote. For women.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>French embassies and schools around the world have been put on high alert in fear of a backlash after a magazine published cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad and Muslims.</p> <p>Paris has ordered special security measures at official buildings, including diplomatic and consular representations, and instructed those in 20 particularly sensitive countries to close on Friday, the Islamic prayer day.</p> <p>Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister said he was \"concerned\" at the possibility of hostile reactions to the caricatures published in the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.</p> <p>The cartoons, some of which feature Muhammad, come amid continuing protests by Muslims around the globe over an anti-Islam film, Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>The offices of Charlie Hebdo were firebombed last November after it published an edition entitled Charia Hebdo, supposedly guest-edited by Muhammad.</p> <p>On Wednesday, France's prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in a statement: \"In the current climate, the prime minister wishes to stress his disapproval of all excesses and calls on everyone to behave responsibly.\"</p> <p>Questioned on RTL radio, he added: \"We are in a country where the freedom of expression is guaranteed, along with the freedom to caricature.\"</p> <p>Shortly afterwards there were calls for protests against the caricatures and the film in Marseille, Toulouse, Lyon and Paris. Ayrault said a request had been made for police authorisation to hold the demonstration in Paris on Saturday, but that it would be refused. On Sunday, police arrested more than 100 people who had gathered to protest against Innocence of Muslims near the US embassy in the French capital.</p> <p>An Afghan suicide bombing linked to protests about the film killed 12 people on Tuesday.</p> <p>All 75,000 copies of Charlie Hebdo sold out according to the magazine, whose editors are planning to print more on Friday. The magazine's website was unavailable all of Wednesday after it was apparently hacked and closed down.</p> <p>According to L'Express magazine an unnamed association had begun legal proceedings against Charlie Hebdo for incitement to hatred. Dalil Boubakeur, the senior cleric at Paris's biggest mosque, appealed for France's four million Muslims to remain calm.</p> <p>\"It is with astonishment, sadness and concern that I have learned that this publication is risking increasing the current outrage across the Muslim world,\" he said.\"I would appeal to them not to pour oil on the fire.\"</p> <p>The publication of the caricatures, on the front cover, as well as on the inside and back pages of Charlie Hebdo brought widespread condemnation.</p> <p>Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, of Al-Azhar University in Cairo, the highest authority in Sunni Islam, said in a statement that \"inciting hatred in the name of freedom was to be totally rejected\".</p> <p>Essam el-Erian, the acting head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, said the French judiciary should deal with the issue as firmly as it had handled the case against the magazine that published topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge. \"If the case of Kate is a matter of privacy, then the cartoons are an insult to a whole people. The beliefs of others must be respected,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said French law should deal with insults against Islam in the same way as it deals with Holocaust denial. \"If anyone doubts the Holocaust happened, they are imprisoned, yet if anyone insults the prophet, his companions or Islam, the most [France] does is to apologise in two words. It is not fair or logical,\" he said.</p> <p>Richard Prasquier, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, said he disapproved of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons after the killings in the row over the film.</p> <p>\"It is in consideration of those deaths that I disapprove of Charlie Hebdo's initiative,\" he said in a statement. \"To publish caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in these times, in the name of freedom, is an irresponsible kind of panache.\"</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Paris, told French radio the cartoons would \"provoke revulsion among many Muslim believers, who will feel their faith has been insulted\". He added: \"You cannot say anything in the name of freedom of expression\".</p> <p>Outside Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices, the magazine's editor, St\u00e9phane Charbonnier, was unrepentant and denied he was being deliberately provocative. Charbonnier, who drew this week's front page, and two of his fellow cartoonists, have been under police protection since the firebomb attack.</p> <p>\"The freedom of the press, is that a provocation?\" Charbonnier said. \"I'm not asking strict Muslims to read Charlie Hebdo, just like I wouldn't go to a mosque to listen to speeches that go against everything I believe.\"</p> <p>Earlier he had told French journalists the latest caricatures would shock \"only those who will want to be shocked\".</p> <p>Richard Malka, the magazine's lawyer, added: \"We are in a secular country \u2026 the tradition of caricaturing religion goes back more than a century.\"</p> <p>And France's interior minister Manuel Valls, who met Muslim leaders on Wednesday, said caricature was a \"fundamental right\" of freedom of expression. He added that protests that caused public order issues or were aimed a \"sowing hatred\" would not be tolerated.</p> <p>Announcing the security measures, Fabius said he was \"against all provocation\".</p> <p>On Wednesday evening, Egyptian authorities announced they would be ordering French schools and cultural centres to close on Thursday to head off potential trouble.</p> <p>In September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten caused an international storm by publishing 12 cartoons depicting Muhammad. The ensuing protests across the world resulted in more than 100 reported deaths. The Danish embassy in Pakistan was bombed, and Danish embassies in Syria, Lebanon and Iran were set alight.</p> <p>One of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, who uses the name Tignous, defended the drawings. \"It's just a drawing,\" he said. \"It's not a provocation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Call it a retraction of a denial.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Mitt Romney campaign hastily took offline a video of Ann Romney in which she rejected the notion that her husband was unsympathetic to low-income voters.</p> <p>In the interview, with the Denver Fox affiliate, Ann Romney was asked if her husband's secretly recorded comments at a Florida fundraiser didn't express \"any disdain for people who are poor, or who are on entitlement programs\".</p> <p>\"Absolutely not, absolutely not, totally not so,\" Ann Romney replied.</p> <p>The video was temporarily posted to the campaign's YouTube account with the headline \"Ann Romney to FOX31: Mitt Doesn't Disdain the Poor.\"</p> <p>Moments later the video disappeared, but <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/ann-romney-mitt-doesnt-disdain-the-poor\">not before BuzzFeed snagged it</a>.</p> <p>Ann Romney's answer wasn't a bad one (the headline is another story). But her having to face such a question is bad news for the campaign. The interview capped a day in which Mitt Romney's comments that 47% of Americans refuse to \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives\" were played and replayed.</p> <p>Ann Romney herself comes in for brief mention in the fundraiser video \u2013 and her husband isn't much nicer to her than he is to supporters of the president. Asked why he doesn't deploy her more, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" 5juj3p_a2hc&amp;feature=\"player_embedded&quot;&quot;\">Romney replies with a joke that might come off as an insult</a>: \"We use Ann sparingly right now, so that people don't get tired of her.\"</p> <p>In fact the campaign frequently deploys Ann Romney, who has a strong track record at fixing what's broken and tenderizing what's tough. On <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" vtpzq_fo5ao\"\">the campaign bus</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NraMG2zImE&amp;feature=related\">convention dais</a>, she regularly succeeds in translating Romney for Romney, in capturing his best side, his faithfulness and dependability. Unlike her husband, she can make a joke she's told a hundred times sound newly surprising and funny, as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj8xjCf0TeU&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=1m30s\">on Tuesday on Live! with Kelly and Michael</a> when she repeated an anecdote about Romney's reaction to her vow that she was done with politics: \"He kind of laughed and said, 'Do you know what? You say that after every pregnancy.'\"</p> <p>Ann Romney <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-18/michelle-obama-along-with-ann-romney-fuel-husbands-coffers\">has headlined nearly 40 fundraisers this year</a>, reportedly generating millions for the campaign. She is scheduled to speak at a fundraiser in Louisiana on Wednesday. She is billed as the solo host of a major campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday.</p> <p>Before her appearance at the Republican national convention, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156950/americans-christie-ann-romney-positive-light.aspx\">a USA Today/Gallup poll</a> found voters had a favorable opinion of her by a margin of 42-24, although many, 34%, either had not heard of her or had no opinion.</p> <p>The former first lady of Massachusetts has had some slips on the campaign trail. Her explanation of the couples' refusal to release more than two years' worth of tax returns \u2013 actually so far only one year, 2010, plus estimates for 2011 \u2013 was taken as borderline snide. Releasing more information would only provoke more attacks, she told Good Morning America's Robin Roberts.</p> <p>\"We've given all people need to know and understand about our financial situation and how we live our life,\" she said, allowing frustration to creep into her voice. <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/07/ann-romney-tax-returns.php\">Some heard her say \"all you people\"</a>, as if the public were a pestilence.</p> <p>Her attempts to make her husband relatable can backfire. While the young Mitt and Ann Romney may have lived briefly in a basement apartment, her mention of \"a lot of pasta and tuna fish\" in her convention speech felt disingenuous, for the new daughter-in-law of a governor turned cabinet secretary. The scene also fell flat as an evocation of romantic squalor.</p> <p>There are now 48 days until the election. If the Romney camp was ever really worried about \"people getting tired\" of Ann, they can no longer afford to be.</p> <p>Up next, the campaign is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/ann-romney-michelle-obama-may-guest-host-on-good-morning-america/2012/09/18/1ea6bcfe-01bd-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_blog.html\">considering a guest-hosting slot for her on Good Morning America</a> in October.</p>",

  "<p>Conservative bloggers are leading a campaign to discredit the secretly recorded video of Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential candidate's embattled team mounted a determined fightback.</p> <p>The bloggers raised questions about a gap in the secret video recording of Romney's speech to a $50,000-a-head dinner in Florida in May and suggested manipulation. The person who made the recording has not been revealed.</p> <p>David Corn, the reporter on the liberal magazine Mother Jones that posted the video on Monday night, dismissed the attack by the bloggers as a \"smokescreen\" and \"a distraction\".</p> <p>\"Everything that I obtained from the source is posted. There is nothing that is not out there. There is nothing that has been edited or deleted,\" he said.<br>The source said the video was sent in two segments. \"There seemed to be a little gap and I asked the source why. The source said that at the end of the first segment the video timed out or he might have brushed it. He does not know why.</p> <p>\"He turned it back on. He said only one or two minutes elapsed.\"</p> <p>One of the main conservatives that raised the the question of the missing minutes, Joel Pollak, of Breitbart.com, <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/09/19/Mother-Jones-Admits-Romney-Tape-Missing-One-or-Two-Minutes\">wrote that Corn had failed</a> to live up his promise to provide all of the video and \"there is new reason to suspect manipulation\". <br>He added: \"Mother Jones's entire story now deserves to be treated with suspicion, if not contempt.\"</p> <p>Corn said the row over the missing segment is puzzling to him. \"What do the conservative critics think might be on this two minutes that might ameliorate what he said earlier?\" He added that Romney himself has not challenged the gap.</p> <p>The row over the missing segment came as Romney's campaign team sought to regain ground by reframing remarks he made in the video that 47% of Americans are government-dependent. Romney and his team placed his comments in the context of a choice for voters between small government and Barack Obama's \"culture of dependency\".</p> <p>In a bid to turn the tide of damaging headlines over the video, which captured him dismissing 47% of the electorate as victims who were dependent on government, Romney used a USA Today opinion column to claim his belief in free enterprise contrasted with Obama's redistributive tendencies. </p> <p>Obama's supporters are equally determined to exploit the 47% row to the full. The Priorities USA Super Pac released a new television ad titled Doors, using clips from the video which was recorded at a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser for Romney at the home of an investment banker in Florida in May.</p> <p>The Romney team has been on the defensive since the recording's release on Monday. In the video, Romney wrote off the 47% as not being his responsibility.</p> <p>It is too early for polls to show how much damage the secret video has done to the Romney campaign. It could be next week before the polls settle down and offer a clearer indication of the likely election outcome.</p> <p>The latest polls give a mixed view of the race, with some suggesting Obama's post-convention lead has largely evaporated while one by NBC and the Wall Street Journal gave him a five-point national lead. Polls in the swing states show Obama opening up a significant lead in Virginia, a state he had been expected to struggle to hold.</p> <p>The Romney team, in the middle of the candidate's worst week yet, embarked on its fire-fighting effort on Wednesday after a series of frantic conference calls seeking to reassure donors that the campaign remains credible.</p> <p>Matt Rhoades, Romney's campaign manager, issued a \"memo\" \u2013 in reality, a press release \u2013 putting the video in a wider context: the choice facing voters on November 6. </p> <p>\"Mitt Romney's vision for America is an opportunity society, where free people and free enterprise thrive and success is admired and emulated, not attacked. President Obama's vision for America is a government-centered society, where government grows bigger and more active, occupying more of our everyday lives,\" Rhoades wrote.</p> <p>A Republican party spokeswoman summed it up as Romney's view that personal responsibility and hard work will deliver recovery against Obama's belief in redistribution and government dependency.</p> <p>Stephen Hayes, a conservative commentator, lauded the damage-control exercise. \"Romney campaign turning into the skid on the video \u2013 hitting back hard on size/scope of government. Smart move,\" he wrote on Twitter, though adding the caveat \"Will it last?\"</p> <p>The Romney team has been helped by a decision of the liberal magazine Mother Jones, which started the firestorm by releasing excerpts from the secret video on its website on Monday night, to put out the whole 50-minute video out on Tuesday rather than opt for a drip-feed approach.</p> <p>In his USA Today op-ed, Romney focused on the small government versus big government theme. \"My course for the American economy will encourage private investment and personal freedom. Instead of creating a web of dependency, I will pursue policies that grow our economy and lift Americans out of poverty,\" he said.</p> <p>The Romney team is pushing an audio clip from 1998 in which Obama expresses support for redistribution of wealth. Other than on the Drudge Report, which ran the video on Tuesday evening, the clip has failed to gain much traction in the media as it reveals little new about the president's views.</p> <p>The Obama campaign dismissed the audio clip as a sign of desperation on the part of the Romney campaign.</p> <p>Obama used an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on Tuesday to attack Romney over the video. \"One of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country. If you want to be president, you have to work for everyone.\"</p> <p>He added: \"All of us make mistakes. \u2026 What I think people want to make sure of, though, is you're not writing off a big chunk of the country because the way our democracy works.\"</p> <p>RealClearPolitcs, in its average of polls, has Obama at 48% to Romney's 45.4%, suggesting the election is still tight in spite of weeks of gaffes and other setbacks for Romney. An ad blitz by Romney and his supporters and a good performance by the candidate in the first presidential debate with Obama on October 3 in Denver could see the president's lead narrow.</p> <p>A Gallup poll has Obama only 1% ahead, as does AP, suggesting he has lost almost all of his post-convention poll bounce. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has Obama up 5% while Rasmussen puts Romney up 2%.</p> <p>A Quinnipiac poll on behalf of the New York Times and CBS in six swing states has Obama 1% ahead of Romney in Colorado, 6% in Wisconsin and 4% in Virginia. A poll in the Washington Post gives Obama a staggering 8% lead in Virginia, 52% to 44%.</p>",
  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith has been criticised for claiming an independent Scotland would have to raise taxes or cut public services to afford current levels of welfare spending.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister now in charge of the Scottish government's independence policies, accused the work and pensions secretary of \"blatant scaremongering\" and using misleading figures.</p> <p>Duncan Smith told a conference on welfare reform in Glasgow on Wednesday that welfare spending in Scotland was 6% higher per capita compared with the rest of the UK: a cost only affordable because the burden was shared across the UK.</p> <p>He said Scotland's population was also ageing faster, putting greater pressure on pension costs and services for elderly people, including Scotland's free personal care policy. More than 25% of population will be over 65 by 2033, while the UK as a whole would not reach that level until 2050, he said.</p> <p>Speaking before the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion event, Duncan Smith had said: \"If the unthinkable [independence] were to happen, a Scottish government would face a very stark choice of raising taxes or cutting services. This is not scaremongering, its reality.\"</p> <p>He told delegates: \"Together, the UK \u2013 with a broader and more sustainable tax base \u2013 is in a stronger position to tackle these challenges and to maintain public services in the process.</p> <p>\"And just as our welfare union is of considerable benefit to Scotland, by pooling both the resources and risks, we all share in the benefits of a unified UK.\"</p> <p>Sturgeon did not directly dispute his figures but said at \u00a321bn, overall spending on social protection in Scotland, including welfare spending, social exclusion, sickness benefits and pensions, amounted to 40% of Scottish tax revenues last year compared with 42% of tax revenues on similar spending for the UK as a whole.</p> <p>\"This is the height of hypocrisy from a Tory government which is set on dismantling welfare provision as we know it \u2013 and only independence will protect Scots from the savage benefits cuts the Conservatives are now engaged in,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The reality, as opposed to this blatant Tory scaremongering, is that Scotland more than pays its way when it comes to welfare, and an independent Scotland will be well able to afford to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.\"</p> <p>Scottish National party MP Eilidh Whiteford, its work and pensions spokeswoman at Westminster, said that during the previous year, the ratio stood at 42% of total Scottish tax revenues compared with 43% for the UK overall according to the Scottish government's figures.</p> <p>Holyrood figures for the past five years, she said, showed that Scotland had contributed \u00a38.6bn more in tax revenues than was spent in Scotland, equivalent to \u00a31,600 for every person, partly due to North Sea oil and gas revenues.</p> <p>\"Just like Mr Duncan Smith refuses to accept the facts about his damaging tax credit changes, the facts show that he completely wrong on Scotland's welfare spend in comparison to the UK,\" Whiteford said.</p> <p>The figures, drawn from the Scottish government's annual financial survey Government Expenditure and Revenues Scotland, are contested by the UK government. The latter insists that some of its data is extrapolated and is not based on the same accounting measures used by the Treasury.</p> <p>This dispute, which is also touches on tenuous proposals for Scotland to get much greater control over welfare policy while remaining in the UK, raises questions about how an independent Scotland would divide its spending and which areas of welfare it would prioritise.</p> <p>The Scottish government has not yet offered any details on how the welfare system would be restructured or funded, assuming it won the independence referendum in 2014, or whether it would propose sharing some major costs such as national insurance and pensions with the rest of the UK post independence.</p> <p>Following the disclosure that the UK government may cut the link between benefits and inflation, anti-poverty and disability rights campaigners in Scotland attacked Duncan Smith's overall welfare reforms, urging him to rethink his \"disastrous\" changes.</p> <p>John Dickie, Scottish head of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the reforms overall would put another 50,000 children into poverty by 2020.</p> <p>\"The poorest families and children are already bearing the brunt of the UK government's austerity agenda. As one of the richest countries in the world it is beyond belief that the richest get a top rate tax cut while the poorest are being forced into deepening destitution,\" he said.</p> <p>Bill Scott, from Inclusion Scotland, a consortium of organisations of disabled people and disabled individuals, said: \"To add insult to injury those disabled people who manage to hold onto their benefits are being told that they will have to meet the constantly increasing cost of living with no help from the government.</p> <p>\"IDS [Iain Duncan Smith] can freeze benefits but can the government also freeze food, fuel and transport prices? If not can he explain how people already living on a poverty level income can meet these extra costs?\"</p>",
  "<p>The Georgian government has been forced to confront accusations of widespread abuse in the country's prison system after a graphic video showed guards allegedly torturing and sexually assaulting an inmate.</p> <p>Hundreds of people took to the streets of the capital, Tbilisi, to protest against poor prison conditions. The country's prisons minister was forced to resign.</p> <p>Part of the video, aired by the opposition television channel TV9, appeared to show a half-naked man weeping and begging for mercy as two guards kicked and slapped him, before reportedly raping him with a broomstick. A video released on the country's police website showed a longer version of the graphic footage.</p> <p>\"Please don't film this, I will do anything,\" the inmate is reported to have said.</p> <p>President Mikheil Saakashvili called the incident \"a horrific affront to human rights and dignity\" and vowed to bring the guilty to justice. International organisations have long criticised Georgia's prison system for mistreatment of prisoners.</p> <p>Release of the video, coming just two weeks before hotly contested parliamentary elections on 1 October, added to existing tensions as Saakashvili's party was facing its first major challenge, from an opposition bloc led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili.</p> <p>Saakashvili implied the incident had been set up to discredit him. In a statement, he said those who had \"organised, committed and allowed these crimes to happen will be severely punished\".</p> <p>Ivanishvili issued a statement calling for calm and condemning \"these acts of torture by the Georgian government\".</p> <p>\"That such horrible acts occurred just a few kilometres from the presidential palace should be unimaginable, but unfortunately this shows the true nature of our leaders,\" the tycoon said.</p> <p>The prosecutor's office said that 10 prison officials had been arrested and one remained on the run. It also accused two Georgians, Tamaz Tamazashvili and Tamaz Elizbarashvili, who allegedly have ties to Ivanishvili, of handing the video to an unspecified third party.</p> <p>Georgia has one of the highest per capita prison populations in the world, with 538 prisoners for every 100,000 people, a number that has skyrocketed since Saakashvili came to power on promises of bringing law and order and wiping out corruption.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch called on the Georgian government to fully investigate the incident. \"The abuse captured in this footage is profoundly disturbing,\" Giorgi Gogia of Human Rights Watch said. \"The authorities need to ensure full accountability \u2013 including criminal accountability \u2013 for this abuse and take measures to prevent it from ever happening again.\"</p> <p>Khatuna Kalmakhelidze, the prisons minister, issued her resignation, saying she was \"deeply sorry for what happened, regardless of the origin of these events\".</p> <p>\"Our nation is based on the respect of human rights and human dignity and it will get rid of this ugly violence,\" Saakashvili said. He deployed police to jails across the country to replace prison guards as an emergency measure.</p> <p>The 1 October vote is likely to be the biggest challenge to Saakashvili's United National Movement since the Georgian president came to power in the 2003 Rose Revolution that ousted the country's Soviet-era leadership. Ivanishvili, who largely amassed his estimated $6.4bn while working in Russia in the 1990s, emerged from relative isolation to create the Georgia Dream coalition in order to challenge Saakashvili's rule.</p> <p>Once hailed for instituting wide-reaching reforms, Saakashvili has come under increasing criticism for curbing freedoms and squeezing his political opposition.</p>",
  "<p>The safety failures of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club when it hosted the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 at its Hillsborough ground have been chillingly clear since Lord Justice Taylor itemised them in his official report four months after the disaster. Last week, 23 years on, the Hillsborough Independent Panel supported Taylor's conclusions.</p> <p>Professor Phil Scraton, of Queens University Belfast, who wrote most of the report which was unanimously approved by all panel members, presented its findings at Liverpool's Anglican cathedral last week to the families of the 96 people who died. He told them that after previous crushes at Hillsborough throughout the 1980s \"the risks were known and the fatal crush in 1989 was foreseeable\".</p> <p>Now fresh questions are starting to emerge about what the club knew about the safety risks at its ground \u2013 and when.</p> <p>Charles Falconer QC, representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), has called on the director of public prosecutions to investigate charging Sheffield Wednesday, as well as South Yorkshire police, Sheffield city council and the Football Association, with corporate manslaughter.</p> <p>\"Because the risks were known but the club and FA went ahead anyway with hosting the semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, we want the DPP to examine whether their conduct amounts to gross negligence which could be the basis for a manslaughter charge,\" he said.</p> <p>Sheffield Wednesday applied to host the semi-final, which 54,000 people attended, and semi-finals in 1981, 1987 and 1988, despite the club's safety certificate for Hillsborough not having been updated since 1979.</p> <p>There was a serious crush in 1981 on the Leppings Lane terrace in which 38 people were injured. The police moved supporters out, they told the club's then chairman, Bert McGee, to avoid \"a real chance of fatalities\". Shockingly, the panel found in the minutes of a post-match meeting, McGee replied: \"Bollocks \u2013 no one would have been killed.\"</p> <p>Scraton then described how changes to the ground, principally building metal fences running up the Leppings Lane terrace to divide it into separate pens, made \"a demonstrably unsafe terrace dangerous.\"</p> <p>There were crushes and problems with the old, inadequate turnstiles in 1987 and 1988, after which one supporter wrote to the FA saying the Leppings Lane terrace \"will always be a death trap\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, the FA invited Sheffield Wednesday to host the semi-final in 1989, without asking any questions about ground safety, and the club eagerly applied to do so.</p> <h2><strong>Safety breaches</strong></h2> <p>Taylor listed all the club's safety deficiencies and breaches of the Home Office Guide to Safety in Sports Grounds \u2013 known as the Green Guide \u2013 many of which were in the Leppings Lane terrace, which he described as \"unsatisfactory and ill-suited to admit the numbers invited\".</p> <p>Several safety breaches were directly related to the unfolding horror. The seven turnstiles in the Leppings Lane terrace were too few to admit so many supporters \u2013 10,100 from Liverpool \u2013 and there was no way of counting how many were in each of the central pens, which became lethally overcrowded.</p> <p>Hillsborough's overall safe capacity had never been reassessed since 1979; the tunnel that led to the Leppings Lane pens had a gradient of one in six, much steeper than the Green Guide maximum; 40% of fans were too far from the prescribed distance to an exit; the crush barriers were the wrong height and too far apart; and liaison between the club and police on the day \"failed\".</p> <p>Yet despite the 96 deaths, the suffering caused to the bereaved families and traumatised survivors, in the 23 years afterwards Sheffield Wednesday never admitted liability.</p> <p>The families say that as they were trying to cope with their losses the club was unsympathetic, built no decent relationship with them, and treated them with disdain. Not a single director or employee of the club resigned \u2013 even Graham Mackrell, the club secretary whose job included overall responsibility for safety matters, stayed in place.</p> <p>McGee stepped down from the chairmanship of the club in March 1990. He was replaced by Dave Richards, who had not been on the board at the time the disaster happened, but was appointed a director six months later in October 1989. Under his chairmanship, Sheffield Wednesday refused to put up a memorial at Hillsborough for 10 years, until 1999.</p> <p>Margaret Aspinall, the chair of the HFSG, Phil Hammond, the former chair, and Trevor Hicks, the group's president, all of whom lost teenage children at Hillsborough, recall instantly when asked about the memorial that Sheffield Wednesday initially offered them a small plaque, to be attached to a wall, outside some men's toilets.</p> <p>\"You could not get much greater contempt for families trying to deal with the loss of their loved ones,\" says Hicks. \"Sheffield Wednesday's attitude to the families, and failure to put a memorial up for 10 years, was very distressing to us when we were dealing with the loss of our loved ones. Taylor identified their safety failures as contributory causes of the deaths, yet they behaved as if they did think it was the fans' fault. There was no apology.\"</p> <p>Sources close to Richards denied that the families were offered a plaque outside the toilets.</p> <h2><strong>Compensation</strong></h2> <p>When the families and some of those injured sued for the loss they had suffered, Sheffield Wednesday refused to admit liability or pay compensation. In November 1989, South Yorkshire police did offer damages to some, and as Sheffield Wednesday still refused, the police sued the club and the club's engineers, Eastwoods. They claimed the club were liable because of the inability to control the capacities of the Leppings Lane central pens \u2013 \"the main cause of the disaster\", the police argued \u2013 and \"unsafe systems\" of management and escape from Leppings Lane.</p> <p>In October 1990, under Richards's chairmanship, Sheffield Wednesday reached a confidential settlement with the police. The club paid a proportion of the settlement. Claims from the bereaved and injured were settled \"without admission of liability\".</p> <p>The panel report notes that this drew criticism from the families: \"They had wanted South Yorkshire police and Sheffield Wednesday to accept, without ambiguity, their respective responsibilities in causing death and injury.\"</p> <p>That acceptance never came. Although Richards, the directors and Mackrell all knew their safety certificate had been 10 years out of date \u2013 and also knew all the identified safety failures \u2013 the club never actively sought to contradict the false South Yorkshire police stories that supporters themselves had somehow caused the disaster.</p> <p>In fact, that version of Hillsborough, conclusively proven by the panel to be untrue and deliberately disseminated by South Yorkshire police in a determined cover-up campaign, took hold in Sheffield and has been believed by many ever since. Under Richards, Sheffield Wednesday never apologised to the families for their suffering, nor sought to educate the club's own supporters about its failings and the disaster's true causes.</p> <p>Only under the new ownership of the Serbian-US businessman Milan Mandaric, who took over in December 2010, have Sheffield Wednesday finally made an official apology. That was issued last Wednesday, the morning before the report was published, following consultation with Aspinall.</p> <p>Richards stayed on as Sheffield Wednesday chairman until February 2000, shortly after a memorial was finally put up. The club had sunk into debts of \u00a320m, and was facing relegation from the Premier League. Richards left Wednesday three months before they were relegated, to take the job as the first paid chairman of the Premier League. His first salary, as part-time chairman, was \u00a3176,667. He is still the Premier League chairman, representing English football internationally, and is a main board director of the FA. His salary from the Premier League last year was \u00a3347,000.</p> <p>In 2006, while the Hillsborough families were struggling to have anyone in authority hear their campaign for the truth about the disaster to be accepted, Richards was knighted for services to football.</p> <p>This was principally due to him being chairman of the Football Foundation, which gives grants from the Premier League, FA and government to grassroots football facilities and projects.</p> <h2><strong>Distressing</strong></h2> <p>Richards generally does not talk to the press, but via sources this week he said of Hillsborough that he had been there on the day of the disaster and was horrified by seeing it. He said that prompted him to become a director of the club, and seek to improve its approach to safety. He was the chairman when, with grants of public money, the Leppings Lane and Kop terraces were made all-seated following the second Taylor report. Richards has told Premier League staff he was appalled that Sheffield Wednesday had hosted matches for 10 years without an up-to-date safety certificate. However, he has not made that known publicly during the 23 years in which, including under him, the club resisted liability. Richards said he refused to put a memorial up at Hillsborough for 10 years on legal advice. He said he was advised by lawyers that to do so would compromise the club's stance not to admit liability for the disaster. Representatives of Liverpool Football Club and supporters' groups who pressed Sheffield Wednesday during that period to put up a memorial, arguing that its absence was distressing to families and survivors, recall Richards giving a similar answer then.</p> <p>Aspinall said: \"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that after our loved ones died and we were caused so much pain and suffering, the chairman of the club where the disaster happened, which failed to put a memorial up for 10 years and treated the families with contempt, has been knighted for services to football and is the chairman of the Premier League.</p> <p>\"While we have been through 23 years of hell fighting for the truth and justice, a lot of people have done very well after Hillsborough. We never got an apology from one of them. Certainly, Sir Dave Richards should give up his knighthood and resign as the chairman of the Premier League.\"</p> <p>Richards did not respond to that call for his resignation, other than to pass on the name of the law firm which he said gave legal advice not to put up a memorial. Senior sources at Sheffield Wednesday, however, and the panel, said they had handed over all the club's documents relating to Hillsborough, and seen no such legal advice.</p> <p>Falconer said: \"This idea that Sheffield Wednesday putting up a memorial would amount to admitting liability is utter rubbish. It is about showing respect for the victims, and failing to put a memorial up was consistent with how Sheffield Wednesday behaved under Sir Dave Richards: they wanted to reduce their association with the disaster as much as possible.\"</p> <p>None of the directors on the Sheffield Wednesday board at the time of the disaster resigned as a consequence, although in March 1990 McGee stepped down. Keith Addy, a director involved in construction \u2013 whose duties, according to club documents, included \"particular responsibility for ground alterations and improvements\" \u2013 stayed on for almost 20 years, until January 2008.</p> <h2><strong>Honourable</strong></h2> <p>Mackrell, who had been the official designated safety officer for Hillsborough at the time of the disaster, saw Sheffield Wednesday through all the legal processes in which it denied liability, and was promoted, under Richards, to chief executive. He still has high-profile jobs in football, working for the League Managers Association and as a venue director at stadiums hosting matches for European football's governing body, Uefa.</p> <p>In June 1999, Mackrell left Sheffield Wednesday to become the chief executive at West Ham United. Six months later, for the last eight minutes of a League Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa, West Ham fielded a player, Emmanuel Omoyimni, who had not been formally registered by the club. When that administrative error was discovered, Mackrell immediately stepped down from his job. \"I felt the only honourable thing to do was resign,\" he said at the time.</p> <p>Contacted this week about the possibility of the DPP mounting a corporate manslaughter investigation into the failings at Sheffield Wednesday that led to the Hillsborough disaster, Mackrell said: \"I am making no comment.\"</p> <p>When I interviewed him in 2004 for my book The Beautiful Game? Searching for the Soul of Football, Mackrell argued that the police blunder, opening an exit gate to allow a large number of supporters in without closing off the tunnel leading to the Leppings Lane pens, was the disaster's main cause.</p> <p>\"No way would I have any involvement in that whatsoever,\" he said.</p> <p>Mackrell said the changes made to Leppings Lane had happened before he joined the club, and \"other people\" were responsible for them. I asked if he had considered resigning after 96 people died at the ground for which he was the safety officer.</p> <p>\"No, never,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A comprehensive atlas of the adult human brain that reveals the activity of genes across the entire organ has been created by scientists.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.brain-map.org\" title=\"Allen Brain Map\">map</a> was created from genetic analyses of about 900 specific parts of two \"clinically unremarkable\" brains donated by a 24-year-old and 39-year-old man, and half a brain from a third man.</p> <p>Researchers at the <a href=\"http://www.alleninstitute.org/\" title=\"Allen Institute for Brain Science\">Allen Institute for Brain Science</a> in Seattle said the atlas will serve as a baseline against which they and others can compare the genetic activity of diseased brains, and so shed light on factors that underlie neurological and psychiatric conditions.</p> <p>\"The human brain is the most complex structure known to mankind and one of the greatest challenges in modern biology is to understand how it is built and organised,\" said <a href=\"http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/seth-grant%284b4c6fb7-906b-4cd9-84ba-14fc5ac06a32%29.html\" title=\"Seth Grant\">Seth Grant</a>, a professor of molecular neuroscience at Edinburgh University who worked on the map.</p> <p>\"This allows us for the first time to overlay the human genome on to the human brain. It gives us essentially the Rosetta stone for understanding the link between the genome and the brain, and gives us a path forward to decoding how genetic disorders impact and produce brain disease,\" he said.</p> <p>The power of the brain arises from its neural wiring, its variety of cells and structures, and ultimately where and when different genes are switched on and off throughout the 3lb lump of flesh.</p> <p>From more than 100 million measurements on brain pieces, with some only a few cubic millimetres, the scientists found that 84% of all genes are turned on in some part of the organ. Gene activity in next door regions of the cortex, the large wrinkly surface of the brain, was very similar, but distinct from that in lower parts, such as the brain stem.</p> <p>More detailed analysis of the cortex revealed patterns in gene activity that corresponded to regions with specific roles in the brain, such as movement and sensory functions.</p> <p>The atlas revealed no major divide in gene activity on the left and right sides of the brain, suggesting that expertise generally handled by one hemisphere, such as language, comes from more subtle differences than the study could spot.</p> <p>Though both brains came from men of a similar age and ethnicity, the pattern of gene activity was so similar that researchers suspect there may be a common blueprint for the expression of genes in the human brain. Work is now under way on donated tissues from both sexes to check how consistent that genetic blueprint might be among people with healthy brains.</p> <p>Scientists have constructed similar genetic atlases for rodents in the past, but the shortage of donated human brains, coupled with the destructive nature of the tests, and the 1,000-fold increase in size, meant a human equivalent was more of a challenge.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature11405\" title=\"An anatomically comprehensive atlas of  the adult human brain transcriptome \">Nature</a>, the scientists describe how they first scanned the donated brains and then chopped them into tiny pieces.

  "<p>Palestinian leaders have raised the prospect of revoking an historic agreement with Israel amid rising frustration over the lack of progress towards a Palestinian state and growing dissent and protest on the streets.</p> <p>President Mahmoud Abbas is considering cancelling the 1993 Oslo accords, and related economic agreements, according to media reports. The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Palestinian leadership at the weekend, the reports said.</p> <p>The issue has been raised against the backdrop of renewed warnings that a two-state solution to the conflict may no longer be possible.</p> <p>In a speech to be delivered on Thursday, Britain's former foreign secretary David Miliband will say: \"For the first time in a long time there is no 'peace process'.

But he was released on police bail after questioning.</p> <p>Two months later on 10 August Short's father, David, 46, was murdered in a grenade and gun attack at his home.</p> <p>The killing sparked a five-week manhunt involving 50 armed raids and a \u00a350,000 reward. It only ended when Cregan handed himself in on Tuesday, following the fatal shooting of the two officers.</p> <p>Fahy said: \"It is absolutely normal in the course of complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged.</p> <p>\"In those circumstances suspects have to be released on bail as there are strict time limits covering how long suspects can be held in custody without charge. That is exactly what happened in this case.\"</p> <p>Police believe the officers were lured to their deaths on Tuesday morning by a false report of a burglary at a property in Abbey Gardens on the Hattersley estate in Mottram, Greater Manchester.</p> <p>As they arrived at the property the officers came under fire from bullets and a grenade.</p> <p>Cregan, who walked into a police station in Hyde an hour later, is being questioned on suspicion of the murders of the two police officers and the father and son.</p> <p>As the police investigated what they suspected was a \"criminal conspiracy\" to shelter Cregan, Tony Lloyd, Central Manchester MP and Labour candidate for the newly created post of police commissioner, said: \"Those who did know the whereabouts of Cregan will be asking themselves why they did not make that sort of information available to the police. It is as simple as that.\"</p> <p>The worst police killings since three officers were shot in west London in 1966 prompted calls for the death penalty to be restored. \"Bring back hanging,\" Bone's father told the Daily Telegraph. \"Let policemen shoot people on sight. I am just so completely shocked. She was such a lovely girl. I can't even bring myself to think about the wedding.\"</p> <p>Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, also said in the Telegraph it was time to think again of the \"deterrent effect\" of a death sentence. \"I have kept track year by year since the death penalty was suspended then abolished of the number of people who have been killed by persons previously convicted of homicide,\" he writes. \"It has averaged three people a year. About 150 people killed because their killers have been freed to kill again. I think it is time we thought again about the deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows.\"</p>",

  "<p>It was early in the evening, Tuesday night, and my television was humming quietly in the background. I suddenly heard \"suspenden la huelga de maestros\" from the newscaster. It was the awaited signal: classes in Chicago public schools would <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/15224814-418/chicago-public-schools-teachers-strike-over.html\">resume</a> Wednesday morning.</p> <p>For 10 days, the teachers' strike had drawn me into the picket line and massive street demonstrations. We teachers marked ourselves as union members by wearing red shirts. While I was in my crimson Chicago Teachers Union t-shirt at the grocery store, strangers came up to me offering their support. While riding the train into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop\">the Loop</a>, my eyes scanned the seats and aisles for other travelers wearing educator red: any teacher in red was a comrade-in-arms, someone with which to share war stories of 95\u00b0F schoolrooms, kindergarten classes of 40 students, leaking roofs and crazed administrators. </p> <p>In the newspapers were stories of <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2012/sep/12/two-visions-chicagos-schools/\">the personality clash</a> between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the union president, Karen Lewis, sprinkled with quotes from various pundits, foundation spokespersons and public relations professionals. The reality on the picket line was different \u2013 friends and strangers brought us coffee and doughnuts as we teachers expanded our fellowship with each other, amidst the warm support of parents, students, firefighters, police officers, bus drivers and so many others in the community.</p> <p>But for now, the strike is suspended (and hopefully over). Awaiting me are my lesson plans, unit plans and daily plans. I hope that my students have held onto the knowledge that we nurtured before the strike, but I am readying myself to make good whatever's been lost during the strike's duration. In my brain, old habits and daily routines are re-emerging from the most peculiar hibernation of the past week. This morning, there will be the students, many secretly (or perhaps not-so-secretly) glad to be back in the classroom and rescued from boredom.</p> <p>As for the outlined deal, the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/us/vote-scheduled-on-chicago-teachers-contract.html?pagewanted=all\">proposed contract</a> language has some cost-of-living salary increases, some slight changes in benefits and sick days and various other slight changes to clauses involving grievance procedures and office supplies. Most of the feared changes that the board of education was threatening to impose unilaterally have been blunted. But anxieties remain.</p> <p>We still worry about job security. We see public schools across our city drained of resources, set up to fail and eventually closed, with all of the teachers \u2013 good and bad \u2013 laid off. Some of the closed schools become charter schools: private schools financed with public money, churning out private profit. Others become \"turn-around\" schools, reorganized around the latest educational fad. Those who make decisions about closing schools seem to see education as a product, and schools as factories for that product; the true value of schools to their communities and as anchors of stability for their students is overlooked.</p> <p>We worry, too, about the new accountability scheme. Our teaching evaluations will now be based on a point system, and 30% of the points will be, essentially, a randomly generated number. It is called \"value-added-assessment\", and <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/2010/10/dear_deborah_you_asked_what.html\">theoretically</a>, it measures gains students make that can be attributed to a teacher. Districts where this has been tried (in <a href=\"http://www.educationnews.org/articles/research-serious-questions-about-the-tennessee-value-added-assessment-system-.html\">Tennessee</a> and <a href=\"http://gothamschools.org/2010/09/17/wide-margins-of-error-instability-on-citys-value-added-reports/\">New York</a>) have not been able to correlate the numbers generated by value-added-assessment to anything a teacher actually does in the classroom.</p> <p>And we worry about the dignity of the teaching profession. Too many \"educational\" leaders treat teaching as an industrial process rather than as a skilled creative endeavor. Not a single member of the board of education has any experience in the classroom: public education, for them, is a mere hobby. Far removed from the realities of the classroom and the poverty of many of our students, they attempt to reduce teaching to reading from a script and to testing, ignoring the input of real teachers in favor of consultants and cronies.</p> <p>And, of course, there are all of the issues that will never be settled by any labor contract. The politics of education continues to be treacherous for those who have made the commitment to make a career in the classroom. Much of the current national education \"reform\" movement <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/11/must-teachers-and-school-officials-be-foes/a-battle-between-education-and-business-goals\">started right here in Chicago</a>. Perhaps, though, we have now started something new for education in this same city with the stand we took over this strike.</p> <p>In the meantime, Chicago continues to be the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/31/chicago-most-segregated-c_n_1244098.html\">most racially segregated city</a> in our republic, with the most <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/11/segregation_in_urban_schools_salpart/\">segregated schools</a>. Some of us teach under the shadow of grinding poverty and despair. The inequities of class and race (exacerbated by <a href=\"http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-muckrakers/2012/06/author-of-study-highlighting-inequality-in-tif-funded-public-schools-reflects/\">inequities</a> in school funding, even within the same school district) are ever-present in our classrooms.</p> <p>I will set aside my fears for another day. On Wednesday morning, I will be the mathematics teacher my students need. I will be there, ready to cast both a disapproving glare and an encouraging smile. The students have enough worries. My own will have to wait.</p>",
  "<p>Howard Jacobson was in fine, showmanly form last week, reading from and discussing his new novel Zoo Time <a href=\"http://www.ljcc.org.uk/events/genre/52-literary-festival.html\">at the Hampstead &amp; Highgate literary festival</a>. A typically provocative tale of one man's unruly passion for his mother-in-law, it's also a killingly funny portrayal of a literary world on its last legs: with authors being told they should be writing bite-sized smartphone diversions to pass time at bus stops instead of dodo novels; that being in print is yesterday's thinking.</p> <p>The book's chief plaint is not so much that the novel is dying \u2013 although it's clearly not in very good health \u2013 but that people are forgetting how to read. In the context of a public event with a Q&amp;A looming I didn't think Jacobson would dare read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408828687/zoo-time\">Zoo Time</a>'s opening scene, which takes place at a readers' group in Chipping Norton. But of course, with his usual brio, he did. So it was that we heard about his failing fictional protagonist, Guy Ableman, meeting his fictional readers, and facing a series of increasingly obtuse, aggressive questions: why aren't there more characters to identify with? Why does he use the masculine pronoun so often? (Why not \"he stroke she\", or perhaps \"they\"?) Why does he hate children so much? (He doesn't write about children, he offers. \"Precisely!\")</p> <p>After hearing that, Jacobson's readers would surely take care that their own questions were more rather more germane. Wouldn't they? </p> <p>Zoo Time is about a mother-in-law \u2013 but why didn't he write about fathers-in-law, one woman asked, accusingly. One chap took issue with his portrayal of poisonous spiders. Finally, another man wanted to know where the author had found the nerve to steal his daughter's name. Which name was that, Jacobson asked, and from whom did I pinch it? Vanessa, obviously, the man returned, and you know her very well. Vanessa is the name of Ableman's wife, a tall, willowy redhead. The object of identity theft here, it turned out, was Vanessa Feltz. Not that easily confused, you might have thought.</p> <p>Signs are not good, then? Well, if aiming questions wide of the mark is a morbid symptom, then readers, like novels themselves, are taking their time to die. Since I've been attending public readings, there've always been a few people in the audiences grinding very strange axes. Where do you get your ideas from? Why aren't your books more life-affirming? Isn't this domestic comedy really about aliens?</p> <p>Something about the occasion of an author reading seems to set (some) people off. You sort of wonder whether the problem isn't that we don't know how to read anymore, but that we've never known how to behave at author appearances.</p> <p>And you could argue that that's not an entirely bad thing, since reading isn't really a collective experience. There's a joke I've always liked in Peter Carey's novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571216208/my-life-as-a-fake\">My Life as a Fake</a>, describing a minor poet (more than a little reminiscent of Stephen Spender) whose success has rather outrun his talent. He was, says the narrator, very good at \"the social side of literature\" - as in, the irrelevant bit. And much as I enjoy seeing writers in three dimensions at literary festivals, literature is really something meant to be consumed in a quiet corner, on your own.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How best to avoid being bitten by </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQRQ8MXqS10\" title=\"a menacing dog\"><strong>a menacing dog</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>Dogs always think that they live in a pack, and normally all you have to do to subdue a (psychologically undamaged) animal is to assert convincingly that you stand higher in the hierarchy than he does. If baring your teeth, snapping and barking loudly is beyond you, any gadget shop will sell an ultrasonic device that will bark very loudly on your behalf, at a pitch conveniently beyond human, but not canine, hearing. I've seen such an instrument work astonishingly well on&#xa0;a Greek village dog: dog to hangdog in a second.</p> <p><em>Andrew Coulson, Musselburgh, E&#xa0;Lothian</em></p> <p>Resist the temptation to lean forward and make propitiatory noises like \"Good dog\" or \"Nice boy\". Stand stock-still and look away \u2013 some breeds see eye-contact as threatening.</p> <p><em>Helena Newton, Ilford</em></p> <p>Short of carrying a gun, the best way to avoid being bitten by a menacing dog is to remain still and outwardly calm. Keep your hands well up out of the way (perhaps put them in your pockets), and do not make eye contact. Do not shout. It's best not to speak at all, but if you must speak, keep your tone neutral and quiet. Do not threaten the dog with anything you are holding, or wave anything about. Most dog aggression is caused by fear, and an aggressive dog may have been hit numerous times in its short life, so it will interpret any object such as a newspaper being waved about as a threat. Move away from the dog slowly \u2013 usually back the way you came is best, in case the dog imagines it is protecting something ahead of you. Move slowly \u2013 you do not want to trip or fall; if you are going to be bitten, you want it to be on your legs rather than your face or neck.</p> <p><em>Alexandria</em></p> <p><strong> The late Neil Armstrong's voyage of discovery was the longest in history.

  "<p>Of the <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/players\">543 players currently active in Major League Soccer</a>, just under half (48.8%) were born in the United States of America. Given that there are three MLS teams north of the border, you may have thought that Canada might be the second-most represented nationality. However, just 3.9% of MLS players are Canadian. Second place actually belongs to Colombia, with almost one in every twenty MLS players (4.7%).</p> <p>So what has motivated so many Colombians to venture north? The Portland Timbers midfielder Diego Char\u00e1 believes he knows: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"I think it's because Colombian players are able to adapt to various styles of play very well. I have had Colombian players ask me about MLS. They ask about the level of play, and some tell me that they love the speed of play. I tell them it's a very different game than Colombia. It is a lot faster and a lot more physical. I tell them it is a good league.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Alongside good salary packages, the appeal of MLS to Colombians is clear \u2013 in some instances, just being paid on time is enough. In the early 1950s <a href=\"http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/colombia-once-had-a-claim-to-be-the-best-league-in-the-world\">Colombia's domestic league was considered one of the best in the world</a>, earning it the nickname \"El Dorado\" (\"The golden one\"). Today's situation is a stark contrast. The domestic game in Colombia is struggling financially \u2013 <a href=\"http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/sports/22775-colombian-soccer-suffers-from-legacy-of-drug-cartel-involvement.html\">a consequence of attempts to cleanse itself of ill-gotten money</a>.</p> <p>Few clubs illustrate the problem more than Am\u00e9rica De Cali, which has debts of nearly $2m. The club's problems date back to the mid-90s, when it was placed on the infamous <a href=\"http://colombialawbiz.com/2010/04/29/who-is-on-the-\" clinton-list\"-and-can-they-get-removed \">Clinton List</a>). This meant that the club's assets and bank accounts on US soil were frozen, due to suspected links to illegal activities. In a bid to clear to the club's name, <a href=\"http://southamericanfootball.co.uk/news/features/item/269-am%25C3%25A9rica-de-cali-from-curses-copas-and-cocaine-to-clinton-crisis-and-collapse.html\">the Am\u00e9rica de Cali hierarchy recently held discussions over changing the team's name and management</a>.</p> <p>Such financial insecurity has bred uncertainty amongst Colombian players \u2013 as Gavin Wilkinson, the former technical director and now interim head coach of the Portland Timbers, explains: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When Jorge Perlaza first arrived at the club he came to see me around a month in because he hadn't received a paycheck yet. I explained to him the money should already be in his account. At the time I was still using an interpreter. We actually ended up going to the bank across the street to check it was definitely in there.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Perlaza's worries were understandable. In Colombia, players have been known to go unpaid for months. The Timbers defender Hanyer Mosquera, who played for Deportes Quind\u00edo and La Equidad in Colombia, has first-hand experience of this. </p> <p>\"It was an unfortunate experience in that they weren't punctual in their payments at times,\" he said. \"It is very important for me to be able to provide for my family the way they deserve.\" </p> <p>When comparing life as a soccer player in the US and in Colombia, Mosquera's assessment is simple: \"I am happy in both places, but I miss my family obviously. The soccer is the same here and there, so there is not much change. One of my dreams was to be successful in a high-level league outside my country. [MLS] is a league that is well-known, and games are broadcast everywhere.\" </p> <p>Char\u00e1, like Mosquera, is keen to stress that for Colombians it is the play, not the pay, that provides motivation: \"More than [clubs] just paying in full, it's more about a change of culture for me, and learning this style of play.</p> <p>\"For the most part I was treated fairly in Colombia, but going unpaid does happen. The players that want to come over here appreciate knowing they will have financial stability.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396483807\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348068020687/Fredy-Montero-of-the-Seat-004.jpg\" alt=\"Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders. Photograph: George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Holland/  George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When speaking to Colombians about MLS, the speed of play is often mentioned. Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders also admires the opportunity for growth. </p> <p>\"I like how fast the game is here,\" he said. \"The level is good here. The MLS is building a really strong league to develop the young players and the future stars of soccer.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson says of MLS clubs's interest in Colombian players: \"For us, South America has been a good market. We've needed to get players that can maintain their value. With the salary cap system in MLS, if a player is earning $100,000 they need to be a $100-$150,000 player.\" </p> <p>Given that such value for money is a key component of any transfer deal, Real Salt Lake's J\u00e1mison Olave perhaps provides the best example of Colombian value. The former Deportivo Cali man was named MLS defender of the year in 2010. <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/august_12_2010_salary_information__by_club.pdf\">His cost to RSL? A mere $240,000</a>.</p> <p>Now that clubs such as Portland are established in the Colombian marketplace, players like Char\u00e1 are used to provide character references for potential new recruits \u2013 such as Mosquera.</p> <p>\"I knew Diego Char\u00e1 beforehand and I talked to him about joining the Timbers,\" said Mosquera. \"He told me about what a great opportunity the team provides, both professionally and personally. I saw fellow countrymen who were successful here, and that interested me a lot. MLS is an attractive league. There's always talk about the American dream and the peace of mind people have here. It goes beyond the soccer aspect to quality of life, too.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson is keen to stress just how much research was involved prior to his decision to look for players in Colombia. </p> <p>\"Normally I get a good sense of the player and his club, why he's at where he's at,\" he said. \"I think it also helps to know the clubs transaction history: whether the club need the money or not and how that will affect the player's price. I'm not going to say the price on Diego Char\u00e1 was driven up, but Deportes Tolima has a reputation for not being the easiest club to work with, because they don't need the money. With Hanyer Mosquera we knew the club were coming into financial trouble that heated up the pursuit of him and we were able to get him.\" </p> <p>The Timbers also secured loan deals for Sebasti\u00e1n Rinc\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Valencia, despite the latter having a knee injury that would rule him out for six to 12 months. </p> <p>\"He's only 20,\" Wilkinson said of Valencia. \"We believe he has the ability, the talent and the athleticism to make a full recovery and be an impact player for the Portland Timbers.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson says the deal was a chance for the Timbers to show how they operated. </p> <p>\"Yes we could have sent him back and washed our hands of it but I think that sends the wrong message to every other player we're trying to bring into this organization and every player already here. One of the things we'd like to be recognized for is how we treat our players and how professional we are on and off the field. I think Jos\u00e9 is an indication of how we value players in general.\"</p> <p>The work doesn't end when the player arrives at the club. For the Timbers, that's when Beto Angulo enters the fold. </p> <p>\"Beto is a tremendous person,\" Wilkinson said. \"He's a full-time player-relations manager. Beto speaks fluent Spanish and is someone that's helped every Colombian on board. I don't think it's wise to invest money in a player and expect them to play well \u2013 they need to acclimatize be happy at home with their family and feel comfortable.\" </p> <p>Angulo is given a similar endorsement by Char\u00e1 and Mosquera, both of whom have not gone unnoticed by rival clubs since their arrival in Portland. Wilkinson says that any further sale would have to benefit the club as well as the player. </p> <p>\"If we can continue to upgrade the squad by selling player X to bring in Y and Z then we will,\" he said. \"We've had offers from both within the continent and in Europe, but it hasn't made sense. If it makes sense from all angles then we'll consider it more.\"</p> <p>However, despite more Colombians looking to move to MLS, Wilkinson says that the Timbers are not looking to invest in more of Char\u00e1 or Valencia's compatriots. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"We still think you need quality American players to succeed. It's important that when we bring the Colombians in they learn the American culture, I think if you start to get eight or nine Colombians then the locker room becomes a concern, not because they are bad people but because the Colombians no longer have to learn English. The dynamic of a locker room changes, which can be a hard cycle to break. There's very many reasons why we won't continue to add Colombians right now, and if maybe one was good enough, they may replace one we currently have on board.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems fair to suggest, however, that the influx of Colombians to MLS has not reached its peak \u2013 and Wilkinson agrees: \"If you can offer personal growth [and] consistency with pay, its often easier to get a Colombian that has had trouble with their club. So Colombia will be a viable market for MLS clubs for years to come.\" </p> <p>You can bet that the Timbers' MLS rivals will be more than happy to draw from such a deep well of talent.</p>",

The tags on their bandcamp include \"ethereal\", \"dream-pop\", \"shoegaze\" and \"folk\", but really this is indie \u2013 indie at its best, indie like they used to make it, before it became the stomping ground of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q2asc2YFrg\" title=\"\">yobs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/libertines\" title=\"\">cartoon degenerates</a>. This is what the alternative scene was like in the days before Britpop, when it was all waif-like females with soaring voices fronting bands whose object lesson it was to recreate the ambience of an echoey church or, to employ the parlance of the day, a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljnBRQmSXc\" title=\"\">sonic cathedral</a>.</p> <p>Olympic Swimmers formed in 2009, are mates with <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-delgados-mn0000124426\" title=\"\">the Delgados</a> and have played some shows with Idlewild and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/10/new-band-admiral-fallow\" title=\"\">Admiral Fallow</a>, yada yada, blah blah. What you really need to know is that they have an album out called No Flags Will Fly \u2013 which you can stream on their bandcamp and which features songs that veer from mundane to marvellous \u2013 and they are about to release a single titled Knots, one of those little miracles that indie bands chance upon every now and then. Susie Smillie says the lyrics refer to \"the passage of time, the importance of memory as we age, the fear of losing memories of joyful times, of losing people that we love\". But if you expecting some kind of funereal dirge, you might be pleasantly surprised (unless you like funereal dirges). Knots is a charming, chiming thing, a joyous surge that achieves in music how you might feel in sunshine after rain. The voice is a folky warble, not quite the full Liz Fraser, more earthbound than that, although it's well equipped to keep pace with the tremulous guitars and galloping drums as it follows a melody almost as deliriously skipping as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZeC5zOkroQ\" title=\"\">Associates</a>. Of course, it's nowhere near that league, but it's nice to see young people trying.</p> <p>There are other fine moments on the No Flags Will Fly album, such as Where It Snows, which is ghostly and glacial, and Apples and Pears, which is like U2 if they weren't fronted by a preening, pompous oaf. Bricks of Our Building is translucent folkgaze and Game of the Century is soft but electric with choral backing vocals \u2013 excellent stuff, and it makes you wonder how many albums of this quality will fall between the cracks in the wake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/12/mercury-prize-2012-nominations?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the Mercury nominations</a>.

In the main, this is folk-inflected, goth-lite spectral indie: reflective and lustrous when it's good, an average aggregate of proficient musicianship and predictable chord clusters when it's not.

  "<p>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, has moved to reassure Britain that he has no plans to subsume the 27 members of the EU into a single European federal state.</p> <p>Amid British fears that Barroso is harking back to the federalist days of one French predecessor, Jacques Delors, the commission president writes on the Guardian's Comment is Free site that his plans pose no threat to national democracies.</p> <p>Barroso prompted warnings last week from Eurosceptics that Brussels wants to create a United States of Europe when he said in his state of the union address that he would like to create a federation of nation states.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/12/596\" title=\"\">speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg</a>, Barroso said: \"Let's not be afraid of the words: we will need to move towards a federation of nation states. This is what we need. This is our political horizon. This is what must guide our work in the years to come.\"</p> <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence party, joked on Radio 4's the Westminster Hour at the weekend that he would salute Barroso after confirming his party's worst fears about Brussels.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/europe-needs-reform-grow-europeans-happen\" title=\"\">Guardian article, Barroso</a> moves to allay the concerns of Eurosceptics and of pro-Europeans in Britain who felt he was failing to understand British anxieties. He writes: \"I have said that we will need more shared sovereignty in a way that each country and each citizen are better equipped to control their own destiny. This is about the union with the member states, not against the member states. In the age of globalisation, pooled sovereignty means more power, not less.</p> <p>\"So when I call for a federation of nation states, it should not be seen as a threat to national democracies. As a former prime minister of my own country [Portugal], I certainly do not want to see a European superstate. I believe in a Europe where people are proud of their nations but also proud to be European.\"</p> <p>Barroso, who is something of an anglophile and a fan of the Spectator, is understood to be sceptical of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/eu-foreign-defence-policy-overhaul\" title=\"\">German-led plans to create a pan-European foreign policy</a>. Sources say it is \"ironic\" that Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, has drawn up integrationist foreign policy plans with four other EU counterparts when Germany has systematically blocked integrationist measures to deal with the eurozone crisis. One joke doing the rounds in Brussels is that the plans will struggle because Westerwelle is a member of the small Free Democratic party which secured 14.6% of the vote in the last federal elections.</p> <p>The European commission president also uses his article to assure Britain that plans for an enhanced supervision of banks in the 17-strong eurozone will not undermine the single market that applies to all 27 members of the EU. Britain fears that handing supervision for eurozone banks to the European Central Bank could undermine the single market by allowing the eurozone members to \"caucus\" and block proposals by the 10 EU member states outside the euro. The ECB would have a seat, representing the 17 eurozone members on the European Banking Authority in London.</p> <p>Barroso writes: \"The Single Supervisory Mechanism will strengthen and not divide the Single Market. The single rulebook, the substantive rules on bank capital requirements and so on, will be agreed by all 27 member states, with the UK continuing to play a leading role. It is worth remembering that the UK has never been outvoted on a financial markets measure. Better application of the common rules within the Euro area has to be good news for the stability and safety of financial markets across the EU.</p> <p>\"The European Banking Authority, based in London, will keep all its powers to solve disputes and uphold Single Market rules also vis-\u00e0-vis the ECB. There will be changes to the EBA voting system to ensure that decision making is balanced and ensure a fair say for everyone, whether they are in the euro area or not. No one is more committed than the European Commission to making sure no new walls are built in the EU.\"</p>",
  "<p>Although European privacy and data protection laws should have protected the Duchess of Cambridge, who has had her privacy undeniably intruded upon by Closer in France and now Chi in Italy, they clearly have not. On the internet and in the countries (which currently also includes Ireland) where editors choose to pay and display, readers have been able to look at private moments on a private holiday, taken it seems from a public place but one some distance away by a crafty and patient paparazzo. Slam-dunk breach.</p> <p>But that does not mean one has to respond in the courts, and particularly not in the criminal courts where the wronged party, rather than running the litigation, can become \"a victim\", a cog in the criminal justice system, unable to quit. The world's public is perhaps outraged enough already by the intrusion and UK editors have (Ill advisedly? Next time there may be different circumstances) already said that they would not publish such snaps. That is a huge victory already.</p> <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been photographed in their swimwear before, but near a beach and appropriately attired. There were complaints that the pictures showed the duchess topless, enjoying an isolated spot where she and the duke were surrounded by trees rather than sun worshipers (any one of whom could become a \"citizen journalist\" via their mobile phone). As well as the criminal complaint in France in a separate civil case the royal couple will seek to have the offending edition of the French magazine Closer withdrawn.</p> <p>In such cases they will seek the deletion and destruction of the offending photographs. But the French courts can only deal with the distribution of the sneaky snaps in France. No doubt the royal couple hope that the instigation of legal proceedings may deter others from publishing the pictures, although (as they knew) Closer's Italian sister magazine Chi had swiftly published a special edition full of them.</p> <p>The couple have been on a royal tour far away so, no doubt, giving instructions and receiving advice has not been as easy as it might otherwise had been. Their anger is understandable. But one does not always need to act in such haste \u2013 the courts in France and elsewhere give litigants time to consider what they need to do.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace has allowed the lawyers to charge off to seek justice. Heads should roll, or at least injunctions be obtained even if the digital horse has bolted. Modest damages and costs should follow.</p> <p>But what if the foreign media is not cowed? What if the editor (or \"editors\" in Italy) refuses to name the paparazzo? Or claims there <em>is</em> a public interest because the French public has a right to know? That is clearly not a public interest in law yet but the editorial teams in France and Italy are starting to prepare the Article 10 freedom of expression arguments; that the pictures were \"tasteful\", that they portray the couple as \"normal and up-to-date with the times\", that the pictures were not particularly sensationalistic nor damaging to [the duchess's] dignity and \"surely makes her more likable\".</p> <p>But more significantly perhaps the editor of Italian's Chi magazine has already claimed that it was legal in Italy to take photographs on a public thoroughfare and that the photographs could have been taken by a member of the public standing on the road bordering Viscount Linley's chateau where the couple were staying.</p> <p>A name for the paparazzo has been aired in the papers but what if the editor refuses to confirm the identity of the photographer or assert that middlemen were used? Should she be jailed for non-compliance? The French Closer shut down? Jobs lost? The civil claim seeks substantial fines but what if the editor and/or photographer refuse to pay?</p> <p>The problem the royal couple must address is that if the French state gets ever more involved it will have its own agenda which may not be the same as theirs. The politicians in France may relish bullying the press but our royals have been surprisingly tolerant of the media and usually worked with it to promote the \"firm\", the country and the many charities which benefit from their patronage.</p> <p>In addition to the civil fines under France's strict privacy laws the magazine could be fined up to \u20ac45,000 (not a problem \u2013 sales boomed) and its editor given up to a year in prison (a PR disaster for our royal family but possibly happy news for misbehaving French politicians and judges). When identified, the photographer is likely to be charged \u2013 but are they likely to hang around the south of France waiting to be arrested? Will they be a fugitive from justice? An outlaw (so very glamorous)? What if they are jailed?</p> <p>Could this create a precedent that in future a French citizen who takes an intrusive photograph and shares it with their friends (in law, publishing it) is at risk of prison too? Princess Caroline of Monaco is synonymous with privacy. Queen Kate does not want to become associated with oppression of European citizens.</p> <p>Court cases can be over complex, they get hijacked by side issues and confuse otherwise clear cut principles. Plus the cost and delays. Such pictures actually highlight the need for firm regulation in all the various jurisdictions.</p> <p>If the royal family wish to send out a firm message to the press they can look to Ireland, where the photographs have also been published. The Press Council of Ireland, which is recognised in law by the country's Defamation Act 2009, could be asked to adjudicate. One doubts whether any \"public interest\" arguments put forward by the editor in Dublin would find much favour with the ombudsman to the Irish PC. The royals would therefore, cheaply and expeditiously, expect to have the public vindication of their justifiable outrage and a useful independent and democratic \"line in the sand\" for the future. And no risk of brutal cross-examination or judicial heavy-handedness.</p> <p>The royals have won in the court of public opinion already \u2013 they are rightly perceived as the victims of intrusion, full-stop. Inadvertently helping over-eager magistrates to castigate the media and even diminish European freedoms any not be the message they wish to have lingering from their lovely vacation in the French sun. Diana played games with the paparazzi. Maybe they should not.</p> <p><em>Duncan Lamont is a media partner at </em><a href=\"http://www.charlesrussell.co.uk/content.aspx?path=/\" title=\"\"><em>Charles Russell LLP</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>To receive more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>A NEW ERA FOR CHELSEA</h2> <p>Chelsea host Juventus tonight in a match that there is no point previewing. Even bookies can't decide whether the game is more likely to end with a home win, an away win or a volcano erupting on the half-way line and spewing forth hot, molten lava and ginger lollipops. Since Chelsea's preposterous triumph last season, you see, no one knows what to expect from Big Cup any more.</p> <p>Of course, in days gone by Juve knew precisely what to expect from games, but that sort of clairvoyance got them banned from Big Cup and relegated in 2006 and only now are they again a side to be feared for the influence of their players rather than their payers. They're Italian champions, on a 42-match unbeaten domestic run and guided by Antonio Conte, the most ingenious of all the managers in the world who are serving 10-match bans for failing to report match fixing.</p> <p>\"We come full of confidence and pride, we have the will and determination to prove we can do well,\" droned the Juve goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, who will be as intrigued as anyone to watch Chelsea's attempt this season to deviate from a plan that saw them become European champions last term by having one shot on target to every 47 by the opposition.</p> <p>\"I expect a Juve who want to play their game, that is the Conte way,\" explained Roberto Di Matteo, before confirming that unlike last season, Chelsea will try to stop their opponents playing their game instead of relying on freakish cosmic interventions to save them. \"They like to get on the ball and attack but we will try to eliminate the spaces on the pitch and fight back,\" lectured Di Matteo, as England's Brave and Loyal John Terry wondered if this daring new strategy meant he would have to stay on the pitch for 90 minutes, and John Obi Mikel practised his thrilling new trick of passing the ball forward.</p> <p>\u2022 You can follow Manchester United 2-1 Galatasaray, Chelsea 0-0 Juventus and The Queen's Celtic 2-3 Benfica <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\">from 7pm or so here</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"If Real Madrid had been interested, I'd be there.

  "<p>There are several brief matters worth noting today:</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> It seems that a leading Obama official just endorsed the right of Iran to attack the US and Israel:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-official-says-cyberattacks-can-trigger-self-defense-rule/2012/09/18/c2246c1a-0202-11e2-b260-32f4a8db9b7e_story.html\">The Washington Post, today (\"US official says cyberattacks can trigger self-defense rule\")</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Cyberattacks can amount to armed attacks triggering the right of self-defense and are subject to international laws of war, the State Department's top lawyer said Tuesday.</p> <p>\"Spelling out the US government's position on the rules governing cyberwarfare, Harold Koh, the department's legal adviser, said a cyber-operation that results in death, injury or significant destruction would probably be seen as a use of force in violation of international law.</p> <p>\"In the United States' view, any illegal use of force potentially triggers the right of national self-defense, Koh said \u2026</p> <p>\"In our view, there is no threshold for a use of deadly force to qualify as an 'armed attack' that may warrant a forcible response,' he said \u2026 Koh also said that in responding to an attack, an action need not be taken in cyberspace, but it must be a necessary action and one that is proportionate, avoiding harm to civilians.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all\">New York Times, 1 June 2012 (\"Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyberattacks Against Iran\")</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"From his first months in office, President Obama secretly ordered increasingly sophisticated attacks on the computer systems that run Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities, significantly expanding America's first sustained use of cyberweapons, according to participants in the program.</p> <p>\"Mr Obama decided to accelerate the attacks \u2013 begun in the Bush administration and code-named Olympic Games \u2013 even after an element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a programming error that allowed it to escape Iran's Natanz plant and sent it around the world on the Internet. Computer security experts who began studying the worm, which had been developed by the United States and Israel, gave it a name: Stuxnet \u2026</p> <p>\"It appears to be the first time the United States has repeatedly used cyberweapons to cripple another country's infrastructure, achieving, with computer code, what until then could be accomplished only by bombing a country or sending in agents to plant explosives. </p> <p>\"Mr Obama, according to participants in the many Situation Room meetings on Olympic Games, was acutely aware that with every attack he was pushing the United States into new territory, much as his predecessors had with the first use of atomic weapons in the 1940s, of intercontinental missiles in the 1950s and of drones in the past decade.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, Koh's argument would only constitute a defense of Iran's right to attack the US if the rights claimed by the US applied to other countries, so there's nothing to worry about.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Nothing is more consistent than war propaganda, especially the propaganda aimed at the citizenry of a nation at war by its leaders. It simply never changes, no matter the war or the leaders:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/panetta-calls-insider-attacks-on-us-troops-last-gasp-of-frustrated-taliban/2012/09/17/b2c113a4-0090-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_story.html\">Associated Press, Tuesday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday that while he is very concerned about rogue Afghan troops and police turning their guns on US and allied forces, he sees the insider attacks as the 'last gasp' of a Taliban insurgency that has not been able to regain lost ground.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2005-05-30/us/cheney.iraq_1_weapons-inspectors-al-zarqawi-iraq-insurgency?_s=PM:US\">CNN, 20 June 2005</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The insurgency in Iraq is 'in the last throes,' Vice-president Dick Cheney says \u2026 'The level of activity that we see today from a military standpoint, I think, will clearly decline. I think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The year after Cheney's \"last throes\" pronouncement, violence in Iraq had become so pervasive that NBC News <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15921476/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/nbc-label-civil-war-odds-white-house/\">defied the White House to brand it</a> a \"civil war\".

This time, the three-time Pulitzer Prize winner sermonized that the Muslim world must stop spewing so much hate speech.</p> <p>Although Friedman's expertise is often called into question, it is hard to deny that he is an expert in hate speech, given that he produced the last decade's most obscene episode of hate speech when justifying the attack on Iraq on the Charlie Rose Show in 2003 (warning: this should not be viewed during or shortly after a large meal):</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZwFaSpca_3Q?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZwFaSpca_3Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>4)</strong> Here's a fantastic story: public high school students in Kentucky were repeatedly censored by school administrators from writing articles in their high school newspaper about controversial issues, including the bullying faced by gay students and the various difficulties for atheists. In response, the budding high school journalists raised their own funds and began their own independent newspaper, The Red Pen, and then proceeded to write about whatever they wanted, including stories they knew would never be allowed by their administrators. Here is <a href=\"http://www.theredpen.org/mission-2/\">their mission statement</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Whereas, in the interest of democracy and honest expression, responsible students ought to have a voice unrestricted by external control,</p> <p>\"Whereas this voice must be protected, expanded and well-communicated,</p> <p>\"Whereas systems of prior review and administrative regulation of student press do unjustifiably restrict this voice,</p> <p>\"Whereas we, students of Kentucky, wish to create an organization which supports all true journalistic endeavors,</p> <p>\"Whereas good journalism can and will lead to a more just and open society,</p> <p>\"We hereby establish, as an extension of Kentucky's free student press,</p> <p>\"The Red Pen.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(<a href=\"http://www.theredpen.org/2012/05/23/kaleb-fischbach-an-audiovideo-story/\">Here is one example</a> of the type of journalism they then produced: a profile and interview with a high school sophomore transitioning from female to male identity).</p> <p>It <a href=\"http://www.splc.org/news/newsflash.asp?id=2447\">was announced Tuesday</a> that these students \u2013 along with their high school adviser who was reassigned after he defended their rights to publish \u2013 were named as the recipients of the 2012 Courage in Student Journalism Award. That award is given each year for journalistic courage by the Student Press Law Center, the National Scholastic Press Association, and the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University, which underwrites a $500 cash prize plus travel expenses for the winners to travel to the ceremony to accept their award.</p> <p>As it happens, three of those students drove several hours to a speech I gave in Indiana last year in order to interview me about censorship and to get quotes from me that were critical of their school administrators (which I happily provided; I wrote about that encounter <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/30/how_extremism_is_normalized/\">here</a>). I don't think they knew at the time of their plans to start their own paper, but it was obvious then that they were an incredibly resolute and principled group, and the intrepid independence they ended up displaying is truly inspiring. </p> <p>If only our adult establishment press corps displayed the same attributes. That was the same thought I had when I <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/09/harvard-crimson-opposes-quote-approval-134343.html\">recently read</a> that the editors at the Harvard Crimson had <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/4/interview-quote-policy/\">ended the longstanding practice</a> at their college newspaper of allowing college administrators the power of quote approval before including their quotes in articles. Denouncing the practice as \"anti-journalistic\", the student editors explained that stories published pursuant to these quote-approval arrangements \"are ceasing to fulfill their purpose \u2013 to capture and channel the forthright, honest words of Harvard's decision-makers to all those who might be affected by the decisions\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, heralded establishment journalists from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/us/politics/latest-word-on-the-campaign-trail-i-take-it-back.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/vanity-obama-quotes\">Michael Lewis</a> continue to use this same \"anti-journalistic\" practice. It is a sorry state of affairs when high school and college students seem to have a much greater appreciation for the purpose of journalism, and far greater courage and integrity to practice it.</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> Writing in Salon, Matt Stoller <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/14/clintons_no_liberal_hero/\">examines the post-presidential conduct and advocacy of Bill Clinton</a> in order to demonstrate how bizarre it is that Democrats now view him with such affection, even reverence.

  "<p>A major plank of the police inquiry into the fatal shooting of two unarmed officers is whether there was a \"criminal conspiracy\" that helped the suspect in the killings remain hidden for five weeks.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police are determined to bring to justice anyone who played any part in helping to shelter the suspect in the police killings.</p> <p>Despite a \u00a350,000 reward and 50 armed raids across Greater Manchester, including on the Hattersley estate, a five-week hunt for Dale Cregan \u2013 a suspect in the murder of a father and son \u2013 failed to apprehend him.</p> <p>Instead on Tuesday morning the two female police officers, Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, were sent to part of the estate, unarmed and without back-up, to respond to a burglary report, where they were killed in a gun and grenade attack.</p> <p>The chief constable of the Greater Manchester force, Peter Fahy, made clear on Tuesday that there was no intelligence on the address in Abbey Gardens where the officers met their deaths that might have indicated the need for an armed presence.</p> <p>Hours after the officers were fatally shot, Cregan, 29, handed himself in and was being questioned on Wednesday on suspicion of the murder of the officers and the killings of David and Mark Short, a father and son.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the two individuals who lived in the house in Abbey Gardens are not being treated as suspects. Police have spoken to them but they have not been arrested and are unlikely to be.</p> <p>Instead it is understood the pair, a 33-year-old man and his girlfriend, might have been held against their will inside the house before a call was made to which PCs Bone and Hughes responded.</p> <p>A measure of the gulf the police might have to cross in their investigation emerged on Wednesday. Youths in Hattersley were heard laughing and shouting: \"Pop, pop\", and on Facebook a \"Dale Cregan for OBE\" page received several anti-police comments before being taken down.</p> <p>The search for Cregan began five weeks ago and was one of the biggest manhunts in the history of the Greater Manchester force. He had been questioned in June over the murder of Mark Short, 23, who was gunned down in the early hours of the morning on 25 May in the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden.</p> <p>Cregan was released on bail after questioning pending further investigation.</p> <p>Two months later Short's father, David, was killed at his home in Clayton, Manchester \u2013 a mile away from the Cotton Tree \u2013 in a grenade and gun attack, sparking the manhunt.</p> <p>Police offered the \u00a350,000 reward \u2013 hoping it would be a life-changing amount to entice individuals to talk \u2013 and carried out more than 100 raids across Greater Manchester, including 50 with armed officers, during the operation.</p> <p>There were reports from the estate on Tuesday that while this was going on Cregan was regularly seen drinking in pubs. But these reports could not be verified. A police source dismissed one report that he held a goodbye party in a pub on Monday night.</p> <p>One retired senior officer said the issue of individuals on the estate apparently claiming to have seen the fugitive being hunted had to be treated carefully. \"How good is the information that he was seen drinking in pubs?\" he asked.</p> <p>He said there was no doubt that the manhunt had been intensive and active.</p> <p>\"They will have had intensive coverage of the suspect,\" he said. \"They will have used surveillance, looked at his phones, used informants and done all sorts of things including using the reward to draw people out.</p> <p>\"What is certain is that the police were hunting him; they weren't sitting about saying let's just wait until he turns up. They were actively looking for him. But if someone in the community has a network that is willing to make him disappear often it's quite hard to find the individual.\"</p> <p>Journalist Carl Fellstrom, the author of Hoods, the story of the Nottingham-based organised crime family the Gunns, said behind any wall of silence was fear and a failure of trust between the police and the community.</p> <p>\"It is a double-edged thing,\" he said. \"People are not only fearful, they also don't trust the police with the information. They are not perceived to be part of the community.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Cruz' bat ain't Blue</h2> <p>It was after midnight on the East Coast, but very much the thick of prime time on Saturday out in Los Angeles, where there was more<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24815741&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24815741&amp;v=3\"> dramatic wild-card action</a> between the Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals. Behind by a run in the bottom of the ninth inning and down to their final out, LA's Andre Ethier singled to right field. Speedster Dee Gordon pinch ran to distract Cards closer Jason Motte, and almost instantly took off, sliding safely into second. Now the tying run was just 180ft away, with Luis Cruz at the plate. </p> <p>Haven't heard of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-cruz-feelgood-20120915,0,4417463.story?track=rss\">Luis Cruz?</a> Well, you're not alone. He is quartz on a team of precious gems, most of which have failed to shine down the stretch. But without the journeyman Mexican, who until this year had played a grand total of <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cruzlu01.shtml\">56 big-league games</a> over four seasons, and who toiled in the minors for 11 years, the Dodgers would be even more down and out than they've looked. </p> <p>Cruz told the Los Angeles Times: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Sometimes when you're in the minor leagues, you get frustrated, but I never quit. I always thought I could play here. And my dad and my family supported me all the time. And I'm here and very happy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Friday against the Cards there was further proof that Cruz, who has hit over .300 in the past month while the Dodgers have hit .244 collectively, could handle the spotlight when he connected on a huge, go-ahead, three-run homer in <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24777283&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24777283&amp;v=3\">LA's 8-5 victory</a>. Facing Motte a night later, Cruz crushed a game-tying double into the gap in right center field that brought a desperate Dodgers crowd to its feet. </p> <p>The 28-year-old raced home as the winning run after the next batter, Juan Rivera, tapped a ball that fell off the glove of stretching second baseman Daniel Descalso. Just like that, the Cardinals watched a potential two-game lead in the wild-card standings evaporate. I Love LA blared on stadium speakers and Vin Scully seemed pleased in his understated, Scully way. </p> <p>That's the way it's gone down the stretch in 2012, a season shaping up for a spectacular finale thanks to a new playoff system, one that rewards teams that shouldn't be rewarded, but makes up for that silliness by providing division winners the right to avoid a one-game playoff. Seems a reasonable exchange, doesn't it? </p> <p>When it comes to wild-card teams, the Dodgers aren't the only poster children for ballclubs that in no way shape or form should be involved in the fight for the playoffs. However, from here on out, this is the way baseball is going to be, and once you get over the fact that at this stage of the season even the Padres \u2013 yes, the San Diego Padres \u2013 are only six games back of a playoff spot (not that I believe there's a chance), then you can really, really enjoy the magic that's happening around baseball every night in September. </p> <p>The Dodgers, now 1.5 games behind St. Louis in the race for the second NL wild-card spot, have lost <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/2012-schedule-scores.shtml\">18 of their previous 27 games</a> and are still major players in this thing. You want to think that Los Angeles have no chance now that they lost their Cy Young Award winning ace Clayton Kershaw, perhaps for the season, to a hip injury \u2013 joining other Dodgers starting pitchers Chad Billingsley and Ted Lilly on the sideline \u2013 the same way you thought the Giants were done when Melky Cabrera was suspended for 50 games after his positive drug test and that the Orioles were in trouble after Nick Markakis broke a thumb a little over a week ago. The Giants ran away with the NL West sans Cabrera, while the Orioles storied season has continued unabated. </p> <p>In 2012, baseball is much more forgiving than it used to be, and no one it seems is out of it until their elimination number is zero. So even though the Dodgers' pitching staff is a mess, their sticks are silent and they play the Nationals, Reds, the suddenly-scorching-Padres and the improved-Rockies, not to mention their hated rivals, the Giants, to finish out<a href=\"http://www.coolstandings.com/baseball_team.asp?id=LA&amp;sn=2012\"> their schedule</a>, expect LA, like almost everyone else, to be there until the end.</p> <h2>Kicking themselves in the Keystone State</h2> <p>Penna's license plates once read <a href=\"http://www.15q.net/us4/pa85.jpg\">\"You've got a friend in Pennsylvania\"</a>. Actually, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Dodgers have two friends in the Commonwealth \u2013 the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies. Both Keystone clubs have provided a boost to their National League wild-card race rivals recently, dropping key ballgames to lesser opponents, taking a bit of heat off the clubs to their west. </p> <p>Now, this is baseball, and even the Houston Astros, who lost their <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24870845&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24870845&amp;v=3\">100th game on Tuesday</a>, have won 48, meaning that on any given night they are capable of coming up trumps against any and all comers. Still, the Phillies cannot lose three of four contests to the lowly Stros, a team in transition, and expect to make the playoffs. How does a team that put together an improbable 18-6 run then flop in Houston of all places? </p> <p>It wasn't the butler but the bullpen that did it, surrendering late leads not once but twice. The Astros, a team with absolutely nothing to play for, rallied from three runs down in the eighth inning of <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24828525&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24828525&amp;v=3\">Sunday's series finale,</a> putting four on the board to stomp on the Phills' attempt to salvage a series split. The pen, which struggled to bridge from the starters to closer Jonathan Papelbon all season until this late run, reared its ugly head once more, casting doubt on whether they have enough in relief to get beyond the regular season.</p> <p>Philadelphia were also <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24797591&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24797591&amp;v=3\">shut out in the series</a>, with five Astros pitchers stifling a suspect Phillies offense on Saturday. Should they fall short in their better-late-than-never-run towards an unlikely playoff berth, Philadelphia will look back at those games in Houston with regret. </p> <p>Thankfully for Phills fans, their Texas tumble didn't continue in New York, home of the worst home-field advantage in all of baseball. The Mets are 4-22 in games played in Queens in the second half and on Monday, <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24855155&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24855155&amp;v=3\">Cliff Lee beat R.A. Dickey</a> in a marquee matchup to move within four games of the wild-card spot, further frustrating New York's ace in his bid for 20 wins. </p> <p>One more Mets note, because I cannot resist: in the last 133 home innings, the Mets have scored more than one run in a single inning just once. Now that is truly Amazin'. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Pirates continue their second-half tailspin, one that has seen them revert to the sort of play that resulted in 19 consecutive seasons of sub .500 baseball. They took two out of three against the Cubs this weekend but are 2-5 against the NL Central doormats over the past 10 days. This recent skid, despite the hot September of NL MVP candidate Andrew McCutchen, has been all about the Bucs' lack of offense and at one point, they went six straight games without scoring more than three runs. Then on Sunday they busted out for nine runs, only to watch the Cubbies storm back thanks to a <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24831695&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24831695&amp;v=3\">sixth-inning grand slam by Mike Rizzo </a>- a moment described by one Pittsburgh fan as the defining moment of the slump. </p> <p>Even when they win, they lose \u2013 Pittsburgh beat the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24862133&amp;query=%26game_pk%3D319936\">Cubs 3-0 in the series finale on Monday</a>, but thanks to a 3.5 hour rain delay, their game didn't conclude until 1:28AM central time. That means they wouldn't hit the hay back in Pittsburgh until roughly 6AM, which was not exactly ideal considering that they began a key series against playoff rivals Milwaukee on Tuesday. Surprise, the Brew Crew wiped the floor with the zombies 6-0, stealing seven bases while they nodded off in between pitches, further diminishing their playoff hopes, moving to 3.5 games out. The Brewers passed them in the standings and are now just 2.5 games back. </p> <p>The Bucs may be more likely to cobble together that elusive winning season rather than a playoff berth but regardless, 2012 has brought hope to the franchise.</p> <h2>Oh, to be (Cy) young...</h2> <p>With 11 pitchers owning <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/pitching/_/order/false\">ERA's of under 3.00</a>, I thought perhaps that this season may share some characteristics with 1968 \u2013 known to baseball fans and historians as the <a href=\"http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1968.html\">Year of the Pitcher</a>. That was a season when hurlers dominated so thoroughly that the mound was lowered by five inches in 1969, in order to throw a bone to those poor, decrepit hitters. I went over to baseball-reference.com to have a look at what hapened 44 years ago and quickly discovered that my hunch was wildly naive \u2013 2012 doesn't come even close. </p> <p>Back in 1968, the league ERA was an incredible<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/1968-standard-pitching.shtml\"> 2.98,</a> compared to this season's mark of 4.03. There were no fewer than 49 pitchers with ERAs under 3.00 in 1968, and the 49th was future Hall-of-Fame southpaw Steve Carlton. Who won the NL Cy Young that season? <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1968.shtml#NLcya\">Bob Gibson</a>, another hurler bound for Cooperstown, who was 22-9 with a 1.12 ERA with 268 strikeouts! <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mclaide01.shtml\">Denny McClain </a>won the AL award, going 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA. Not bad. </p> <p>The next season, with the mound lowered, hitters were able to scratch an additional .65 runs, and there were just 24 hurlers with sub-3.00 ERAs. </p> <p>So 2012 is certainly nowhere near the Year of the Pitcher II, but it is amazing to contrast this and recent seasons to, say, a year like 2000, when the league ERA was nearly three-quarters of a run higher than it is today and home runs hit their all-time high, 1.17 per game. </p> <p>The pitchers have been wresting back control for several years now, and 2012 has left us with quite the Cy Young Award race in both leagues. This week we look at the NL, where you have <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=dicker.01&amp;t=p&amp;year=\">R.A. Dickey</a>, who once again couldn't get any run support against the Phills on Monday night; <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=kershcl01&amp;t=p&amp;year=2012\">Clayton Kershaw</a>, who may have pitched his last inning of the season;<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=gonzagi01&amp;t=p&amp;year=\"> Gio Gonzalez;</a> and we can even throw in <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=lohseky01&amp;t=p&amp;year=\">Kyle Lohse</a>, because, why not, he's been ridiculous. </p> <p>Wins are valued far less than they once were which is why Kershaw gets a sniff here with just 12 victories. (<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=hernafe02&amp;t=p&amp;year=2010\">Felix Hernandez won it with 13 in 2010</a> but threw 249 innings and was incredible), but in 2012 the competition is probably too stiff for him to win, especially when you consider that Dickey has 18 victories on a losing ballclub, has over 200 ks, just 50 walks as a knuckleball pitcher. Kershaw hasn't gotten much help from his teammates, but still leads the league in strikeouts and WHIP. Gonzalez has 19 wins, but really can't compete with Dickey overall, and the same can be said with Loshe, who is the biggest surprise of the bunch \u2013 he even had an RBI double last night in the Cards' win against Houston. </p> <p>Here's another couple of names for Cy Young \u2013 how about <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kimbrcr01.shtml\">Craig Kimbrel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=chapmar01&amp;t=p&amp;year=2012\">Aroldis Chapman</a>? I posed that to a buddy and he said nobody pays attention to Atlanta unless it's on fire. Chapman hasn't pitched in nearly 20 days, which means he has fallen off the radar a bit, but that isn't really fair. Both players have numbers comparable to <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.shtml#ALcya\">Mariano Rivera in 2005, when he probably should have won the award</a> but when Bartolo Colon got it with his 21 wins and a host of substandard numbers, possibly prompting the backlash against the importance of victories as a viable statistic. </p> <p>Anyway, take a look at all those numbers and let me know who you think should get the plaque \u2013 I'm taking Dickey, go figure. We will cover the AL Cy Young candidates next week.</p> <h2>Brave numbers</h2> <p>Here's a number to chew on \u2013 seven. That's the number of runs that the Atlanta Braves' Kris Medlen has allowed in his <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=medlekr01&amp;t=p&amp;year=\">first nine starts </a>after re-locating from the Braves bullpen. </p> <p>One late night, watching MLB's TV network with one eye and ear open, I heard the chatter about Medlen's inning limit, and how they were able to keep him on the hill late this season by starting him in the bullpen, and that the Nationals should have considered that as an option for Stephen Strasburg, who is now out for 2012. Whoever was saying those wise words gets a gold star \u2013 both pitchers had innings caps while recovering from Tommy John surgery, but now Medlen is on the hill for a streaking Braves team that swept the Nationals this past weekend while Strasburg sits in the dugout, and then sits in the dugout some more. </p> <p>I know that the Nationals are thinking for the long term, and I don't necessarily disagree with shutting him down. However, when you think of the arm that is just sitting there doing nothing while the team heads towards a post-season with a real shot at winning it all, it is just hard to believe. These thoughts are exacerbated when you see what the Braves have done with Medlen, who has faced Washington in two of his previous five starts, allowing just one run in 14 innings, striking out 20 and walking just two batters, picking up two victories. Yes, they are different pitchers, with different styles, that have taken different roads to get where they are today. However, it's got to have Nats fans talking and wondering why their biggest asset is collecting dust. Nats brass should be thankful they play in a medium market \u2013 if this was happening in, say, Boston or New York, there would be rioting in the streets.</p> <h2>Extra Innings</h2> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Here's a good story coming out of that Braves/Nats series this weekend. Washington's Gio Gonzalez, exiting the game on Sunday, tipped his cap to Atlanta's Chipper Jones, who will retire after the season. It was an acknowledgement that came in a game between rivals that could potentially meet in the playoffs, and during a series in which the Nats got swept. After the game he said <a href=\"http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2012/09/17/braves-postgame-quotes-after-sundays-win-over-nats-2/\">(via the AJC):</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Absolutely. I think he's one of the greats to ever play the game, one of the greatest third baseman to ever play it. It was an honor to be on the same field, especially at his house. It's only a sign of respect and a guy who showed me respect by getting in that lineup, [he's] telling me that's how you want it \u2013 I'm going to go at you. The guy scored a run for them. That's the kind of guy you respect 100%.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm a sucker for that kind of class \u2013 great job by Gonzalez. I wonder if he will be as kind to Chipper if they are fighting for a World Series place. </p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Stating the obvious here, but if you're wondering what should you be watching on Wednesday at 8PM EST then wonder no more. Mets vs. Phillies? Yanks vs. Jays? O's vs. M's? No way. It's all about the CBS show, <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/general/blog/eye-on-baseball/20221760/jeff-kent-set-for-wednesdays-survivor-debut\">Survivor Philippines</a>. Why? Well, this season, none other than Jeff Kent will be appearing on the program. That's right, Mr Sunshine himself. The 44-year-old former second baseman, who could find himself in the HOF shortly \u2013 and, who, by the way, made an awful lot of money in his long, fruitful career \u2013 will be taking on the likes of The Facts of Life's Blair Warner in his bid for the $1m prize, not to mention a boatload of newfound credibility. Basically, we are talking about the Super Bowl of reality television here, and so I say: pennant race, shemenant race. For one hour on Wednesday, it's all about Survivor, obviously. </p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Andy Pettitte's return to the mound was <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/44664/pettitte-must-wait-one-more-day\">delayed by a night</a> after the Yankees/Blue Jays game in New York was washed out. New York also got some news regarding Mark Teixeira, and that's that the Yanks' slugging first baseman <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8395150/new-york-yankees-hope-mark-teixeira-returns-end-season\">won't be back into the lineup until late September.</a> Regardless, the Bronx Bombers seem to have weathered the storm, winning four of their last six including winning their series against struggling Tampa Bay. Alex Rodriguez' return to form doesn't hurt \u2013 his OPS over the previous two weeks is approaching 1.000. </p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Toronto Blue Jays' Yunel Escobar was suspended for three games for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/18/yunel-escobar-suspended-toronto-blue-jays-homophobic-slur\">writing an offensive phrase into his eye black</a>.

The victory, which came in five hours and 44, is their 14th win in extra innings, the longest streak since the 1949 Cleveland Indians won 19 in a row.

  "<p>The number of active members of private sector workplace pension schemes has fallen to its lowest level since records began almost 60 years ago, according to official figures.</p> <p>There are now 2.9 million UK workers paying into private sector company pension arrangements, compared with 6.2 million in 1995 and more than 8 million in the late 1960s, the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) said in its <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_279435.pdf\" title=\"ONS: Occupational Pension Schemes  Survey, 2011\">latest annual look at the sector</a>. Even as far back as 1953 the number stood in excess of 3 million.</p> <p>The data comes just days before what is being billed as the biggest change in pensions for more than a century \u2013 the introduction next month of automatic enrolment.</p> <p>This is a system whereby employers will be required by law to pay into a workplace pension for all their eligible staff. The programme, which is being phased in over five years, aims to get up to 11 million more people saving in a workplace scheme, and pensions minister Steve Webb said the ONS data demonstrated the need for such a shake-up.</p> <p>The ONS said that since 1991 there had been a decline in active pension membership \u2013 defined as someone paying into a scheme or having contributions paid in on their behalf \u2013 but this had been \"particularly marked\" in the private sector, where workers are typically either in a final salary or money purchase scheme.</p> <p>By contrast, active membership of public sector schemes has gradually risen from 3.1 million in 1953 to about 5.4 million in 2008-11.</p> <p>Webb said 380,000 workers at the UK's biggest companies would be automatically enrolled into a pension scheme in October, either into their employer's existing scheme or one of several new schemes established to enable auto enrolment, including NEST \u2013 a scheme created by the government. A further 420,000 will be enrolled in November.</p> <p>The fall in the number of people paying into private sector workplace schemes has been largely driven by the mass closure of final salary schemes during the past few years, which has seen many existing staff and new joiners losing the much-coveted benefits. Active membership of such schemes has tumbled from 4.6 million in 2000 to 1.9 million in 2011.</p> <p>However, the ONS survey does not include group personal pensions or stakeholder pensions, which many firms brought in as a replacement for their final salary arrangements, so arguably does not provide the complete picture.</p> <p>Responding to the finding that private scheme membership was higher in the 1950s than now, Ros Altmann, director general of <a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Saga</a> and a leading pensions commentator, said: \"It seems clear workers are valuing pensions less and less. Partly they are complicated, partly there have been lots of scandals, and partly it is the nature of a product that doesn't fit modern-day life.\"</p> <p>Ann Flynn, head of workplace communications at pensions provider <a href=\"http://www.standardlife.co.uk/1/site/uk/home\" title=\"\">Standard Life</a>, said: \"Many people simply aren't saving for their older age. And even those who are saving often aren't keeping track of their savings and saving enough.\"</p> <p>She added: \"However, the good news is that the latest figures from the ONS show that those who are actively saving into a defined contribution [or money purchase] workplace pension are now saving more than last year, and their employers are investing more on their behalf, too.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Services Authority demanded more \"openness\" from Bob Diamond when it approved his appointment as chief executive of Barclays in September 2010.</p> <p>Memos and correspondence published by the Treasury select committee on Wednesday in the wake of Diamond's resignation over the Libor scandal also reveal that the FSA was aware of an investigation into the rigging of the key interest rate when it authorised his promotion.</p> <p>When the \u00a3290m fine for Libor-fixing was announced in June this year, Diamond was not found to be involved. But he left five days later, after Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King intervened to say that regulators had lost confidence in the Barclays boss.</p> <p>One memo released on Wednesday shows that the then-head of the FSA, Hector Sants, told Marcus Agius, who will step down as Barclays chairman next month, that the regulator's attitude towards Diamond could harden once the Libor investigation was completed.</p> <p>The memo was released after Sants wrote to the committee to take issue with Agius's assertion that the Libor affair had not been discussed at the time of Diamond's promotion. \"I specifically made clear that we reserved the right to reassess [Diamond's] suitability in the light of the conclusions reached by this investigation and requested he made this clear to Mr Diamond,\" said Sants in a letter to the committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie.</p> <p>\"I made clear that our concerns about Barclays culture were not some generic observation but specific to Barclays and asked that these concerns be communicated by Mr Agius to Mr Diamond,\" Sants wrote.</p> <p>The FSA's record of Sants's meeting with Agius in September 2010 reveals the Barclays chairman acknowledging that Diamond had lost out on the chief executive role six years earlier, when John Varley won the top job, and that Varley had agreed to be a mentor to his successor before quitting at the end of December 2010.</p> <p>Identifying the executives involved by their initials, the FSA's record of the meeting says: \"JV will \u2026 coach BD in his remaining six months. MA added that whilst BD is very competitive and lost out in the previous CEO selection to JV he suspects we will now see him mature and relaxed given he has now achieved his goal.</p> <p>\"HS explained that the relationship with BD had not reached the level of openness, transparency and willingness to air issues with the FSA [as] has been the case with John Varley. BD therefore needs further development in this area as he steps up to CEO. BD did not disagree with this point in the interview process and undertook to address,\" the memo said.</p> <p>It also shows Sants told Agius of the FSA's concerns about succession planning in Barclays Capital, the investment banking business that Diamond was then running, following Diamond's promotion to the top job.</p> <p>Sants also indicated the regulator was concerned that the division that had raised most alarm bells about risk at Barclays \u2013 the investment bank \u2013 was the one being run by Diamond at the time.</p> <p>\"HS explained the FSA's historical concerns regarding Barclays risk appetite and control framework. He acknowledged the progress made by JV and the work underway addressing the FSA concerns. However at the time of the FSA concerns BD was managing the area within the group where the concerns were foremost therefore it is important that in his new role as CEO he ensure the continued progress of initiatives the group has commenced,\" the memo said.</p> <p>Agius told Sants that Diamond was \"on board\" and that it was the \"collective judgement of the board that BD will rise to these challenges and succeed\".</p>",

  "<p>China has formally implicated disgraced politician Bo Xilai in the scandal over his wife Gu Kailai's murder of a British businessman during the trial of a former police chief.</p> <p>A report from state news agency Xinhua published on Wednesday does not mention Bo by name, but it says that Wang Lijun attempted to tell \"the Chongqing party committee's main responsible person at the time\" that Gu was suspected of killing Neil Heywood. Bo was then the south-western city's Communist party boss.</p> <p>Wang, whom Bo had hired to spearhead an anti-gang crackdown, \"was angrily scolded and hit\" after raising the matter, according to the testimony of another police officer read at the hearings in Chengdu this week.</p> <p>The corruption cases raised by the prosecution also involve businessmen known to be close to Bo.</p> <p>The comments increase the prospect that the former political high-flyer may face criminal charges himself. Until now authorities have shied away from connecting Bo to the case, though accounts of his encounter with Wang had already surfaced. The authorities have not commented on Bo since April when it was announced that he was under an internal Communist party investigation for breaching discipline.</p> <p>The matter is particularly sensitive as China's power transition fast approaches. Bo was once tipped as a contender for top political office and won popular support for campaigns such as the drive against organised crime. But he antagonised many within the party with his ambition and alarmed liberals with his willingness to trample over human rights.</p> <p>But Kerry Brown, an expert on Chinese politics at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute for International Policy, said the party could still deal with Bo's case internally, adding: \"It seems to have been very rigorous in keeping Bo's malfeasance apart from Gu's.</p> <p>\"That kind of story [about the confrontation] was so well known that it was hard not to try to address it.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I can't see any big gains from totally trashing Bo now. Not going for the jugular might be more sensible, particularly at the moment.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/bo-xilai-police-chief-trial\" title=\"\">Wang's trial for defection, accepting bribes, abuse of power and bending the law to selfish ends</a> \u2013 by covering up the murder \u2013 was held at Chengdu intermediate people's court on Monday and Tuesday.</p> <p>According to the Xinhua report, the 52-year-old secretly recorded Gu's confession to murdering Heywood the day after the killing last November, but did not initially act on it.</p> <p>\"After arriving in Chongqing, I would often go to the home of Bogu Kailai. I felt Bogu Kailai was very good to me,\" Xinhua said, citing Wang's testimony. \"At the time, my selfish motives were guiding me. I didn't want to face this case.\"</p> <p>According to Gu's aide Zhang Xiaojun \u2013 also convicted of Heywood's murder \u2013 Wang phoned hours after the body was cremated to utter a coded eight-character message to her: \"It turned into blue smoke, flying away to the west with the cranes.\"</p> <p>But as time went on, Wang felt Gu was turning on him, Xinhua added. As his colleagues became targets of \"illegal investigations\", he began to feel in danger and decided to escape.</p> <p>That triggered his dash to the US consulate in Chengdu, where he told diplomats of his suspicions \u2013 leading to British demands for a reinvestigation of Heywood's death. Within two months, Bo had been ousted and Gu was detained for murder. Last month she received a suspended death sentence.</p> <p>Xinhua said Wang's trial also heard that entrepreneur Xu Ming offered homes worth over 2.85m yuan (\u00a3280,000) to a relative of the former police chief in return for the release of three associates who had been detained in Chongqing. Xu, whose association with Bo stretched over two decades, has not been seen since March and is assumed to be in custody.</p> <p>The former intelligence agent Yu Junshi, another long-term associate of Bo who is thought to have been detained since spring, was cited as renting villas for Wang in exchange for the release of another man.</p>",
  "<p>The race for the South Korean presidency has opened up into a three-way contest after the millionaire software entrepreneur Ahn Cheol-soo declared his candidacy, ending months of speculation about a possible challenge to the country's political status quo.</p> <p>Ahn, a popular independent who left business to become an academic and philanthropist, is expected to mount a strong challenge to the ruling New Frontier party candidate, Park Geun-hye, the daughter of a former South Korean dictator who at one point was expected to win comfortably.</p> <p>Park, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/park-geun-hye-korean-president\" title=\"\">who won her party's endorsement last month, is aiming to become the country's first female president</a>, more than 30 years after her father, Park Chung-hee, was assassinated by his own intelligence chief.</p> <p>Ahn formed his anti-virus software company, Ahnlab, in 1995 and has promised to give up his remaining stake, worth a reported $324m (\u00a3200m), if elected.</p> <p>He told supporters in Seoul he would create jobs for young people neglected by the current president, Lee Myung-bak, and tackle rising inequality in the world's 13th biggest economy.</p> <p>\"The people have expressed their hope for political reform through me. I want to become the person who puts that hope into practice,\" he said.</p> <p>Recent opinion polls also show a sudden rise in support for Moon Jae-in, a human rights lawyer and chief of staff to former president Roh Moo-hyun who was nominated by the main opposition Democratic United party last weekend.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/opinon/2012/09/137_120354.html\" title=\"\">A poll conducted this week showed Moon ahead of Park for the first time</a>, according to the Korea Times; he also defeated Ahn in a hypothetical two-way contest by a healthy margin, the paper reported.</p> <p>Members of Moon's team told the Guardian as recently as last week that they believed Ahn would not run, leaving Moon as Park's sole challenger.</p> <p>A poll earlier this month showed that in a three-way race, Ahn would receive 24.7% of the vote, with Park on 41% and Moon on 19.2%.</p> <p>To avoid splitting the anti-conservative vote in the 19 December election and sending Park to the presidential Blue House, some expect Ahn and Moon to form an alliance, perhaps with one or the other agreeing to fill the less important role of prime minister.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Ahn said it would be inappropriate to speculate about an alliance with Moon at this early stage in the contest.</p> <p>Ahn's status as a political outsider has won him support among younger people and urban workers \u2013 the swing voters who could give him victory in December.</p> <p>He has promised to take on the chaebol, the family conglomerates such as Hyundai and Samsung, that exert huge influence over the South Korean economy.</p> <p>\"I don't think we should be ambivalent about chaebol. We should introduce a 'corporate group law' to ensure they remain competitive but try to minimise their defects and abuses,\" he wrote in a book published earlier this month.</p> <p>Despite his liberal domestic manifesto, Ahn said he would take a tough line against North Korea, with which relations have deteriorated rapidly since Lee was elected in 2007.</p> <p>Ahn, 50, dismissed fears about his lack of political experience. \"Some people ask what makes you think having run a small business prepares you to run an administration at a much bigger scale,\" he said in an interview last year.</p> <p>\"I just laugh when I hear people say that&#xa0;\u2026 I created something from nothing, I've overcome hardship.\"</p> <p>Lee will not run in December's election as the South Korean constitution limits the presidency to a single five-year term.</p>",
  "<p>Veterans groups and Democrats are urging Republican senators to put political bickering aside and stop blocking a bill which would help offset high unemployment rates among veterans.</p> <p>Senators were due to vote on Wednesday on the bill which would cost $1bn over five years to help veterans find employment in public work projects and as police officers and firefighters. It gives priority to the newest generation of veterans, post-9/11, whose employment prospects are almost three percentage points below the national average.</p> <p>Minutes before the vote, Patty Murray, the Democratic senator who introduced the bill, gave an impassioned speech from the floor, asking for unity to pass the bill which she said \"should not be killed by procedural games\".</p> <p>She said \"I urge my colleagues to join with us in waiving this point of order. To join with us in telling our veterans that we are not done investing in their care and benefits \u2013 not by a long shot.\"</p> <p>She said that a vote for the point of order proposed by the Republicans sent a message to veterans telling them: \"We have spent enough on our veterans.\" It would have a long-lasting impact, she said, not only to kill their ability to pass the bill but would also affect other veteran bills to improve mental health care access and to allow those who had lost the ability to have children access to fertility services.</p> <p>She added: \"Join with us in moving forward with a bill that is paid for, that won't add to our deficit, and that shouldn't be killed by procedural games.Join with us in putting veterans above political obstruction, and back to work.\"</p> <p>The vote, postponed from last week because of Republican manoeuvres, is the latest in a series of measures to delay the bill, as members of the House prepare to leave Washington to campaign on their re-election.</p> <p>Such political battles over legislation are not unusual within the current, polarised Congress. The 112th Congress is on course to break records for the least productive body on a generation, passing only 173 laws, below the 906 enacted in what President Harry Truman referred to as the \"Do Nothing\" Congress in 1947-8 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/us/politics/congress-nears-end-of-least-productive-session.html?_r=0\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>But supporters of the veterans bill say the delays in a measure which has bipartisan support, which has been widely rewritten to include Republican amendments and which would benefit those who have risked their lives for the nation, mark a new low for those who have sought to delay it.</p> <p>Democrats and veterans' groups say the bill's costs are fully offset and have accused some Republicans of playing partisan politics at the expense of helping military personnel who struggle to regain employment when they return from deployment.</p> <p>Ramsay Sulayman, of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said he was saddened to see \"a very small group of people that are standing for principle to block the bill from even coming to a vote\" on an issue which he said had seen a strong spirit of bipartisan support.</p> <p>\"That's what we object to\" said Sulayman. \"If people say 'We don't like the bill' and stand up and get up and vote and go on the record \u2026 that is different. It's sad to see a few people holding a bill to hostage.\"</p> <p>Sulayman, a marine corp veteran and reservist, said it appeals to a \"vast majority of the Senate who would want to get it on the floor\".</p> <p>\"Veterans employment was 10.9% in August. It is bad for everyone but there continues to be a disparity for veterans.\"</p> <p>The jobs bill is based on a proposal in President Barack Obama's state of the union address in January.</p> <p>Matt McAlvanah, a spokesman for Murray, said: \"Patty Murray's position is that, with unemployment of young veterans close to 20% and veterans suicide continuing to be epidemic, we cannot put a price on the amount of care we're working to provide veterans.\"</p> <p>The Democrat-sponsored bill has already been extensively rewritten to include amendments by Republicans and has bipartisan support. Eight of the 12 provisions in the bill were Republican originated ideas.</p> <p>Democrats need 60 votes to waive the budget point of order and allow the bill to progress.</p> <p>There are 51 Democrats and two independents likely to vote in its favour. Democrats have also pinned their hopes on a number of Republicans who are strong supporters of veteran issues, including senators Scott Brown, who serves on the US Senate committee on veterans' affairs, and Dean Heller of Nevada, who has introduced two bills to help veterans.</p> <p>Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate, said the bill had met \"one Republican stall tactic after another\", in a post to his Twitter account last week. He said the delaying tactics marked a \"new low\" for Republicans. </p> <p>Jeff Sessions, the Senate budget committee ranking member, said he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/249477-senate-postpones-vote-on-veterans-jobs-bill-until-next-week\">objected to the bill</a> on the grounds it would increase the veterans affairs department budget and would blow though the spending cap lawmakers agreed last year.</p> <p>Democrats argue the bills costs are already covered by plans to collect more than half a billion in unpaid taxes over the next five years, <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/congress-feuds-over-jobs-bill-for-veterans/article/2508289#.UFiE5b8RaL\">according to the Washington Examiner</a>.</p> <p>The bill was held up in the Senate last week after filibustering by Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, to gain support for a Pakistani doctor who helped locate Osama Bin Laden.</p> <p>Paul has promised to block Senate action until the doctor, Shakil Afridi, is released from jail. The Pakistani government has said it will not release him. Paul has also called on the Obama administration to cut foreign aid to Pakistan until Afridi is released.</p>",
  "<p>In Europe, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/debt-crisis\" title=\"\">crisis</a> continues to be felt by many. We are taking important decisions but we have not yet convinced citizens, markets or our international partners. Doubts persist over whether some countries are ready to reform and others are ready to show solidarity.</p> <p>Europe needs a new direction. Europe needs new thinking.</p> <p>This means accepting that we are all in the same boat. We must leave no doubt that we are determined to stick together and reform together to achieve the scale and efficiency needed to be a relevant global player and safeguard our values in a changing world.</p> <p>First, we need growth. In many member states, this means structural reforms that have been postponed for decades. At the European level, we need to be more decisive about breaking down barriers, whether physical, economic or digital. And we need to agree an EU budget adequate to meet the challenges of investment, growth and reform.</p> <p>Reform will only work if it is \u2013 and is seen as being \u2013 fair. In some parts of Europe we are seeing a real social emergency. I do not agree with those who say that the European social model is dead. An effective welfare protection system that helps those in need is not a hindrance to prosperity.</p> <p>Across the EU, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/18/eurozone-crisis-spain-debt?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">reform and consolidation measures are being implemented</a>. Joint financial backstops are being put in place, and the European Central Bank has consistently shown that it stands by the euro. We have a chance this autumn to come to a turning point on Greece. If Greece stands by its commitments it should stay in the euro.</p> <p>The crisis has shown the clear need to complete the economic and monetary union. The stability of the single currency is in the interests of those who use it and those who do not.</p> <p>The crisis has shown that when banks became transnational, rules and oversight remained national. Then when things went wrong, taxpayers had to pick up the bill. This week we have proposed a <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/953\" title=\"\">single supervisory mechanism for the euro area</a>. This is a huge step towards a banking union.</p> <p>This supervisory system in the euro area will be led by the European Central Bank. This is logical. Fourteen of the 17 national supervisors in the euro area today are already central banks, and indeed the UK is moving now to give these tasks to the Bank of England.</p> <p>The single supervisory mechanism will strengthen, not divide, the single market. The single rulebook, the substantive rules on bank capital requirements and so on, will be agreed by all 27 member states, with the UK continuing to play a leading role. It is worth remembering that the UK has never been outvoted on a financial markets measure. Better application of the common rules within the euro area has to be good news for the stability and safety of financial markets across the EU.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.eba.europa.eu/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">European Banking Authority</a>, based in London, will keep all its powers to solve disputes and uphold single market rules also vis-\u00e0-vis the ECB. There will be changes to the EBA voting system to ensure that decision-making is balanced and ensure a fair say for everyone, whether they are in the euro area or not. No one is more committed than the European commission to making sure no new walls are built in the EU.</p> <p>Alongside more integration, we also need more democracy at European level. This is best achieved by a strengthening of the European parliament and the emergence of real European political parties and a real space for a European debate among citizens. This will be helped if all the European political parties present their candidate for the post of commission president at the European parliament elections in 2014.</p> <p>A stronger EU also means having more clout globally. The appalling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/sep/19/syria-crisis-iran-visits-damascus-live\" title=\"\">situation in Syria</a> reminds us that we cannot afford to be bystanders. Standing together brings us greater influence over what happens in our global backyard.</p> <p>I have said that we will need more shared sovereignty in a way that each country and each citizen are better equipped to control their own destiny. This is about the union with the member states, not against the member states. In the age of globalisation pooled sovereignty means more power, not less. So when I call for a federation of nation states, it should not be seen as a threat to national democracies. As a former prime minister of my own country, I certainly do not want to see a European superstate. I believe in a Europe where people are proud of their nations, but also proud to be European.</p> <p>We must concentrate European action on the real issues that matter and must be dealt with at the European level. Proper integration is about taking a fresh look at where is the most appropriate level of action. <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/subsidiarity_en.htm\" title=\"\">Subsidiarity</a> is an essential democratic concept and should be practised.</p> <p>Europe also has to be more democratic. Before the next European parliament elections in June 2014, the commission will present its ideas on the future European union. We will put forward explicit ideas for treaty change so that when people go to the polls they can take an informed view on where they want to see Europe heading.</p> <p>Deeper integration is indispensable for the countries who share the euro as their common currency. It should also be open to \u2013 but not forced on \u2013 other member states. I strongly believe that we must not allow the populists and the nationalists to set a negative agenda on Europe. I urge all those who call themselves Europeans \u2013 not least in the UK \u2013 to stand up and take the initiative.</p> <p>We face enormous challenges. But previous generations have overcome bigger ones. Now it is for this generation to show they are up to the task.</p>",

You only have to look at the American experience. Many colleagues in America are lost without even drawing their gun at close range.\"</p> <p>Orde added that it was the \"clear view of the British police service from top to bottom\" that officers prefer to be unarmed because the public dislike approaching constables bearing weapons.</p> <p>He said minimum use of force and intervention was the \"bedrock\" of Britain's policing model.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that policing was \"a risk business\", adding: \"As we speak, officers will be responding to calls not knowing what they will get to and not knowing exactly what they will be dealing with when they arrive. It's just a harsh fact of policing and, tragically on occasions, things go horribly wrong.\"</p> <p>The opposition is in part philosophical. A regularly armed force is seen as jarring with the British model that officers police by consent and are citizens in uniform.</p> <p>Fahy expressed a similar opinion soon after the shooting: \"We are passionate that the British style of policing is routinely unarmed policing. Sadly, we know from the experience in America and other countries that having armed officers certainly does not mean they do not end up getting shot dead.\"</p> <p>But for some this is not enough. Darren Rathband, the twin brother of PC David Rathband who killed himself 18 months after being blinded by gunman Raoul Moat in July 2010, called on Tuesday for officers to be routinely armed. Rathband, a former Staffordshire police officer now serving in Australia, said: \"It beggars belief. How many officers need to die before the powers realise that it is the 21st century and you cannot fight crime with an outdated piece of plastic and a bit of spray? No job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict. We don't go on jobs where people are happy to see us. I am angry some other families have now lost a daughter, sister, mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner.\"</p> <p>Paul Beshenivsky, the widower of murdered police constable Sharon Beshenivsky, who died in service in 2005, told ITV news the latest killings should \"open the public's eyes\" and reopen the debate about arming officers.</p> <p>He said: \"I think policing, as regarding going to scenes of crimes, should be monitored better, and I think police, in honesty, should be armed, walking into situations that they're not totally aware of.\"</p> <p>Speaking at a central London youth club, Clegg warned against rushing to judge. \"I think it is the kind of thing that you need to look at very carefully and certainly not, even though I know emotions are running high, in an instant way after this terrible, terrible tragedy,\" he said.</p> <p>The Manchester deaths take the number of officers killed this year after a firearms incident to three. PC Ian Dibell was killed by a single bullet wound to the chest after intervening in a dispute while off duty. The incident happened in July in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. The suspected gunman, Peter Reeve, was found dead the next day with a gun.</p> <p>With the exception of Northern Ireland, officers in the UK are not routinely armed. They have to volunteer to carry weapons, and undergo rigorous training and assessment to ensure they are fit to do so.</p> <p>According to the latest figures, a total of 6,653 officers were authorised to carry weapons in 2010-11, a decrease of 326 (5%) on the previous year. There are around 140,000 officers in England and Wales.</p> <p>Specialist firearms officers are available to be deployed, as are armed response vehicles.</p> <p>Police favour the increased issue of stun guns that fire a powerful electric current. Officers are issued with protective vests that stop knives and offer limited protection against low-velocity bullets. More extensive protection against bullets would prove too heavy to wear for a full shift.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police is under investigation over the shooting dead in March of Anthony Grainger, who was unarmed, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p> <p>The reaction to the deaths of Bone and Hughes shows there is still shock attached to the murder of police officers in the line of duty. Guns remain rare on Britain's streets.</p>",
  "<p>Ebook prices in the UK are set to plummet after the European Commission said that four major publishers and Apple \"engaged in a concerted practice\" to raise the price of ebooks, and required them to stop.</p> <p><a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2012:283:0007:0009:EN:PDF\" title=\"\">The EC said in its official journal today [PDF]</a> that it had found in a \"preliminary assessment\" that the publishers Hachette Livre, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Simon &amp; Schuster, and the retailer Apple, had, by \"jointly\" moving to an agency model for ebooks, \"engaged in a concerted practice with the object of raising retail prices of ebooks\" or preventing ebook discounting in Europe, in breach of European law.</p> <p>The agency model \u2013 which has also come under intense scrutiny in America, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/07/ebook-price-fixing-judge-settlement\" title=\"\">the US department of justice has settled with the American publishers HarperCollins, Simon &amp; Schuster and Hachette</a> over alleged ebook price-fixing \u2013 enables publishers, rather than retailers, to set the prices of ebooks. Retailers who have not entered into agency agreements with publishers can set the prices of ebooks themselves, as Sony and Amazon have recently been doing with a swathe of 20p ebooks on sale \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/18/ebook-price-war-discounts?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">a move that has prompted serious concerns from authors</a>.</p> <p>The EC said that while the four publishers and Apple do not agree with its preliminary assessment, they have nonetheless agreed to a range of commitments to address its \"competition concerns\". These agreements will see them terminating agency agreements with Apple, and, for a period of two years, refraining from restricting ebook retailers' ability to reduce the prices of ebooks. The Commission is still investigating the conduct of Pearson, parent company of the publisher Penguin, over the same issue.</p> <p>Philip Jones, editor of book industry magazine the Bookseller, called the agreements \"a major victory for Amazon and its philosophy of low prices\", just as he said the settlements in the US have been.</p> <p>\"It looks to me that we'll see renewed discounting on the big ebooks from the major publishers \u2026 with minimal restraints on what the big e-bookseller can do with price. Good news for ebook readers in search of a bargain, not great news for publishers, and pretty worrying news for high street bookshops,\" he said.</p> <p>Interested third parties now have a month to register \"reasoned\" observations on the EC's proposed commitments for publishers. \"We won't know the impact of this for years, but at least the Commission has given interested parties a month to wail their discontent,\" said Jones.</p> <p>Responding to the announcement, Hachette Livre said in a statement that it \"remains confident that it did not violate the antitrust [monopoly] laws, and has made no admission of liability\".</p> <p>\"Hachette Livre considers that its unilateral decision to enter into agency agreements with Apple and other e-retailers was in the best longer-term interests of the whole book universe including authors, readers and booksellers of all kinds. However, Hachette Livre has decided that the costs, length, and distractions of the proceedings before the European Commission would be too disruptive to its business and to the development of ebook markets in general,\" the publisher said. \"Hachette Livre's main commitment has always been publishing great books and nurturing and supporting its authors and readers. This remains its motivation. Hachette Livre believes that a settlement with the EC is the best way to continue to achieve that goal.\"</p> <p>Macmillian issued a statement saying: \"From the outset, the Holtzbrinck group has strongly denied all charges of collusion in relation to its ebook businesses. That said, we believe it is in the best interests of our European business to proceed towards a settlement and have agreed to this set of draft principles, ready for a period of market consultation.\" HarperCollins said it was \"working with the EC to find a workable solution\". Simon &amp; Schuster and Penguin declined to comment.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Good morning and welcome to game two of day two of the fourth World Twenty20</strong>. The hosts, Sri Lanka, got things underway on Tuesday in romping style, beating Zimbabwe by 82 runs in Hambantota, and now, in group B, it's the turn of the 2010 runners-up, Australia, to show what they can do.</p> <p>But, wait, who's this they're facing. It's only Ireland, folks, a nation that knows how to create a 50-over shock (Pakistan, 2007, England, 2011) and will be looking to do the same over 20 overs in Colombo today.</p> <p>A question: Would it really be a shock if Ireland were to defeat the<br>Aussies? After all, they were ahead of them in the World T20 rankings<br>until very recently (it's now Australia - 9th, Ireland - 10th), and have a side that can undoubtedly play a bit, combining the big-hitting qualities of Paul Sterling and Kevin O'Brien with the exciting spin of George Dockrell. Then there is Will Porterfield and Boyd Rankin, who have just helped Warwickshire to the county championship, and Ed Joyce, who is remains a class act.</p> <p>Saying that, Australia remain a force and will be looking to their likely opening pair of David Werner and Shane Watson to use the batting friendly conditions at the Premadasa Stadium to thwack their side to a decent total. In attack, all eyes will be on the exciting Mitchell Starc, whose pace and swing should be a test for any one.</p> <p>An intriguing battle awaits, then. It all gets going in an hour ...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Ireland have won the toss and decided to bat</strong>. Team news to come....</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Teams are in:</strong><br><strong>Ireland</strong> Will Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien, 5 Gary Wilson (wk), 6 Kevin O'Brien, 7 Trent Johnston, 8 George Dockrell, 9 Nigel Jones, 10 Boyd Rankin, 11 Alex Cusack. <br><strong>Australia</strong> Shane Watson, 2 David Warner, 3 Mike Hussey, 4 George Bailey (capt), 5 Cameron White, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Matthew Wade, 8 Dan Christian, 9 Brad Hogg, 10 Pat Cummins, 11 Mitchell Starc.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.54am: Players out in Colombo. It's a humid, sticky day. That might explain why only 10 people have turned out to watch this. Talk about sparse.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>10.58am: Nationals anthems done, hands shaken, some crazy music now being played over the PA system as Porterfield and Stirling make their way to the middle.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>10.59am: Shane Watson to open the bowling for Australia. Porterfield on strike.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Portferfield c Starc b Watson 0</strong> Blimey, what a start. Watson threw in a short one that Porterfield decided to hook - it caught his top-edge and was taken by Starc at long leg. First-ball, terrible start for the Irish.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1st over: Ireland 4-1 (Stirling 4, Joyce 0)</strong> Well's that some opening. The Ireland captain was caught out first ball, his team then started to play nervously against more short stuff from Watson and almost lost another wicket to a run out before Striling got them off the mark by driving a length ball over extra cover.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Ireland 6-1 (Stirling 5, Joyce 1)</strong> Sterc next up with the new ball for Australia and, bowling over the wicket, has restricted Ireland to a couple of extra runs by bowling a full-ish length. Joyce off the mark with one that was flicked away backward of square.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Ireland 13-1 (Stirling 7, Joyce 6)</strong> First over for Cummins and it's a tad expensive, mainly due to the second ball of the over which had a poor line and allows Joyce to flick one off leg stump to deep square where it just about trickles over the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Stirling c Watson b Sterc 7</strong> Another blow for Ireland as Sterling is taken by Watson at third man. The opener was finding his range but, similar to Porterfield, decided to hook a short, wider one, which sailed to deep and was taken well by Watson as he ran around the delivery.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4th over: Ireland 16-2 (Joyce 8, N O'Brien 0)</strong> Just when it looked as if Ireland were finding their feet after an extremely nervous start, they lost the second of their opening batsman. Credit to Australia who are bowling well and look sharp in the field.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5th over: Ireland 24-2 (Joyce 16, N O'Brien 0)</strong> Pressure on Joyce now to build a score and he'll be pleased to have hit two fours off this over. He pushed Cummins' second ball to mid-on where Watson mis-timed his slide over the ball and allowed it to run underneath his body to the boundary. Joyce then pulled a short ball that was pitched just outside off stump through midwicket for his second boundary of the over. Much better stuff from the Irish.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>We have our first email of the day and it's come from Graham O'Reilly:<br>\"Could anything be sillier than Australia being rated 10th in the world at T20? As the wise man almost said, there are lies, damned lies, statistics and cricket ratings.\"</p> <p>A talking point, certainly.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Joyce c Warner b Maxwell 7</strong> Dear, oh dear, oh dear. Glenn Maxwell has been brought into the attack and with his fifth ball of his first over he's snared Joyce into slapping one over the top. It sailed into the hands of David Warner. The nerves are back.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6th over: Ireland 29-3 (N O'Brien 1, Wilson 4)</strong> Another wicket lost and Ireland look in real trouble. A run-rate of 4.83 sums up the nervousness with which they've played so far. It's been undecisive, sloppy stuff. At least the over ended with Wilson, the next man in, playing a lovely, delicate drive between cover and mid-off for four.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7th over: Ireland 33-3 (N O'Brien 4, Wilson 5)</strong> Dan Christian brought into the attack and it's pretty solid stuff from him. O'Brien gets a couple off a wide-ish ball and another from the next ball playing outside off. Wilson also gets one with a pull shot which, thankfully for Ireland, finds deep square as opposed to the hands of an Aussie fielder.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Wilson lbw b Hogg 5</strong> Brad Hogg brought in and he's snared Wilson with his second ball, a turning delivery that straightens on pitch. Wilson attempted to play across the line. It's plumb.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8th over: Ireland 36-4 (N O'Brien 6, K O'Brien 1)</strong> More woe for Ireland as Hogg makes his experience county. Kevin O'Brien comes in for Wilson and we all know he can hit it around a fair bit. Will have to let a few go if Ireland are to do anything in this match. At least he got off the mark with one that was pushed to covers.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: Ireland 41-4 (N O'Brien 6, K O'Brien 1)</strong> Watson back into the attack and he's restricted the O'Briens to a few tickly singles and one double off the fourth ball from Kevin. Ireland hardly look like a team in a rush to make runs.</p> <p>The highlight of the over had to be this from Bumble: \"I've got an I-pad. My wife's got an I-ron.\" Genius.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>An interesting email from Stephen Pendle:<br>\"Ireland should be ok at 20-20 as most games here are only 70 to 90 minutes long (hurling, football, soccer, rugby)\u2026\u2026\u2026it is all about concentration span. How can one expect a test team like Australia to be able to play when there isn't time to talk about seagulls in the outfield.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>10th over: Ireland 46-4 (N O'Brien 9, K O'Brien 8)</strong> Some decent shots played by the O'Brien brothers off the bowling off Hogg, in particular a sweep from Niall that got him two runs. The O'Briens have 13 runs off 16 balls; the closest thing Ireland have got to a partnership so far today.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>David Sloan has been in touch:<br>\"Re: Graham O'Reilly's comment - I'd have to agree. Australia are a plucky little island nation, but there's no way they should be in the top-10.\" A comment that is looking less smirk-inducing as this match goes on.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12th over: Ireland 62-4 (N O'Brien 14, K O'Brien 19)</strong> Much better stuff from Ireland, and Kevin O'Brien in particular who notches up two fours in two balls off the bowling off Hogg, the second a shot picked from the hands and cut through the off side.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>13th over: Ireland 69-4 (N O'Brien 14, K O'Brien 25)</strong> Christian back on the strike but Kevin O'Brien is the man on the attack, and in more ways than one. He's hit seven off this over, including a four made with a lovely driven shot to mid-off, and also had a word with the umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, about the grief he's been getting off the Aussies, David Warner in particular.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>14th over: Ireland 81-4 (N O'Brien 16, K O'Brien 35)</strong> Kevin O'Brien has definitely found his feet - two more fours from him off the bowling off Starc, the first a pulled shot, the second a baseball-like drive that sailed through the offside. He opened up his stance and just belted that. Great stuff.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! N O'Brien b Watson 20</strong> Watson strikes again, tricking Niall with a slower ball that is missed by a sweep and thuds the wickets. Ireland's best partnership has ended.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! K O'Brien c Wade b Watson 35</strong> Oh that's a huge, huge blow. Kevin O'Brien follows his brother back to the pavilion and having played an exciting innings by nicking a short ball behind him and into the hands off the wicketkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>15th over: Ireland 86-6 (A Cusack 1)</strong> Fantastic over from Watson who takes the wickets off both O'Brien brothers, mixing up the slower stuff with some shorter balls.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>16th over: Ireland 91-6 (A Cusack 3, T Johnston 3)</strong> We're into formality stage now but Hogg will, nevertheless, be peeved at allowing some runs to leak from this over. Only one dot-ball.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>17th over: Ireland 101-6 (A Cusack 8, T Johntson 7)</strong> Cummins back on strike and, as it's been pointed out by the commentary team, facing two Aussies in Cusack and Johnson. The former cracks a lovely four from the second ball, driving a ball outside off on the up. Johnston then got into the act himself, finding the boundary by lifting the ball over Wade's head. Ireland have their century at least now.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Johnston b Starc 7</strong> And another man has gone and Starc has his second wicket of the day with a superb yorker from over the wicket. It slammed the bottom of off stump.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>18th over: Ireland 105-7 (A Cusack 9, Jones 4)</strong> Some more fine bowling from Starc as he chucks in some meaty yorkers. New man Nigel Jones is able to get off the mark, however, making two from the fifth ball with a square drive.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>19th over: Ireland 111-7 (A Cusack 12, Jones 6)</strong> Expensive bowling from Cussack who struggled to find a decent length, particularly to Cummins.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>20th over: Ireland 123-7 (A Cusack 15, Jones 14)</strong> A needlessly expensive final over from the otherwise excellent Watson. A slow, short bouncer allowed Jones to shift one away to square leg for Ireland's first six of the match. He followed that up with a wide outside off and Cusack and Jones were able to make 12 from the over and pad out an otherwise disappointing total from Ireland, one that was beefed up earlier by the O'Brien brothers. This still looks way short however thanks to some aggressive, varied bowling from the Aussies and some big-stage nerves from Ireland. Their innings got of to the worst start when Will Porterfield was caught out in the very first ball of the match. Shane Watson ends with Australia's best figures of 3-26.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>Australia need 124 to win. Back soon.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 5, Watson 1)</strong> A lively start to the Australia innings as Aleem Dar is forced to step in and have a word with the players and tell them to stop the chat - Ireland's wicketkeeper Gary Watson is giving some to David Warner and Shane Watson, no doubt the result of the 'abuse' Ireland were getting from the same pair when they were out in the middle (see pic). Meanwhile, the Aussies start in solid fashion with Warner getting a four from the fifth ball of Boyd Rankin's first over, pulling a shortish delivery towards mid-on.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Warner 5, Watson 3)</strong> Three gone from Trent Johnston's first over of the match with Watson making his mark with a couple of tidy singles.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Australia 21-0 (Warner 6, Watson 10)</strong> This has been a good batting wicket and the Aussies are using it better already than Ireland did, playing the pace from the surface to move the ball around the field, seen best by the four Watson has got off Rankin, deflecting an angled-in ball through fine leg. There is more frustration for Ireland as a leading edge from the man on strike loops over mid-on and to safety. Rankin is having a nightmare - he had bowled four wides in this never-ending over.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4th over: Australia 40-0 (Warner 11, Watson 24)</strong> A terrible start from Johnston as he bowls a wide delivery from his first ball that Warner is able to drive for four. Watson than reaches the boundary himself, pulling a short ball backward of square. Oh, look, another four from Watson, punishing another wide delivery, this time through the off side....and a six! Watson punishes Johnston further with a shot on the leg side. A terrible over for Ireland, letting three fours and a six go. Australia in total, total control.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>5th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 11, Watson 24)</strong> Alex Cusack is brought into the attack and, bowling over the wicket, he is able to curb Australia's flow a little. Three singles and a leg bye given away.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 20, Watson 26)</strong> Bit of excitement in Colombo as 20-year-old George Dockrell is brought into the attack to show off his skillful left-arm spin. He struggles to find his length, though, and Warner is able to knock a full-ish ball at off stump for four. The over ends with the same man getting three runs, this time from a short delivery.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>7th over: Australia 60-0 (Warner 26, Watson 27)</strong> A little bit of history created as Warner becomes the third man in history to score 1,000 runs in Twenty20 cricket with a four flicked backward of square from yet another wide ball. The other men to reach 1,000 runs? Brendon McCullum and some guy called Kevin Pietersen.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Warner c K O'Brien b Dockrell 26</strong> A breakthrough for Ireland as Warner flicks a delivery from Dockrell to the leg side where it is well caught by O'Brien on the dive.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>8th over: Australia 64-1 (Watson 29, Hussey 2)</strong> Mike Hussey comes out to bat for Australia and does not take long getting off the mark, moving a full delivery towards long on.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>9th/10 over: Australia 91-1 (Watson 51, Hussey 7)</strong> Paul Stirling comes back into the attack and becomes the latest man to get smacked around the ground by Watson. Australia's No33 gets a four from an off-spinner that was pitched outside leg-stump and then a six from one that was pitched short. Dockrell then comes into the attack and is also mauled by Watson as he gets another four, stepping back and smashing a short ball over the bowlers head, and another six, this an absolute screamer that sees the ball land in the second tier of the stadium. Watson's gone past 50 and is looking to finish Ireland off on his own.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Watson run out 51</strong> A shame as Australia's man on fire is caught short by Johnston's throw. It was a lazy run by the batsman.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET!! Hussey lbw 10</strong> Another wicket for Kevin O'Brien, catching Hussey with a delivery that shaped back late as Hussey pushed forward.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>11th over: Australia 95-3 (White 1)</strong> A terrific over from Kevin O'Brien, building on his terrific batting display with some decent bowling. Cameron White and George Bailey are now batting for the Aussies.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>12th over: Australia 100-3 (White 4, Bailey 1)</strong> Rankin back into the attack and there's some sloppiness on show as K O'Brien fumbles in the field when a clean pick-up would have given Ireland a run-out chance, and then Rankin himself bowls a wide. There then comes frustration for Ireland as Johnston is unable to hold onto White's drive over the top of the bowler with a diving catch. It was a good effort and did at least prevent a boundary.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>13th over: Australia 103-3 (White 7, Bailey 1)</strong> K O'Brien back in attack but unable to follow his previous blast of an over with another. No boundary's given away, at least, but it's now only a matter of time before Australia wrap this up.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>14th over: Australia 110-3 (White 7, Bailey 6)</strong> A sluggish over ends in style as Bailey pulls a short ball from Rankin away for a four. Getting closer...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>15th over: Australia 121-3 (White 18, Bailey 6)</strong> White picks up where Bailey left off by driving K O'Brien for four on the leg side. He finds the boundary again soon after in the deep. Nearly all over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>16th over: Australia 125-3 (White 22, Bailey 6)</strong> That's it then, Australia beat Ireland by seven wickets, crowning their opening victory of this World Twenty20 in apt style - White lofting a four over the leg side and towards midwicket. It was only a matter of time after the Aussies had started their innings on fire with openers David Warner and Shane Watson picking off Ireland in style. Watson reached 51 before getting out to a lazy run out and that led to a slowing down of the Aussie run rate, but they were never going to be denied and were eventually brought home by Cameron White and George Bailey. Ireland, having made a terrible start and finding themselves at 4-33 at one stage, were soundly beaten. Nerves appeared to get the better off them. They will hope for better in their next Group B match, which is against West Indies on 24 September.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Australia beat Ireland by seven wickets.</strong></p>",

These have the potential to be the biggest ballot victories to date for proponents of same-sex marriage. </p> <p><a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maine_Same-Sex_Marriage_Question,_Question_1_(2012)\">Maine</a> voters are being asked: \"Do you want to allow the State of Maine to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples?\"</p> <p>Question 1, <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maine_Same-Sex_Marriage_Question,_Question_1_%282012%29\">as it is known</a>, comes three years after Maine voters \"vetoed\" a same-sex marriage law passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. The <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/114022/state-states-importance-%20religion.aspx\">veto</a> was surprising because Maine tends to be a liberal state with no deep ties of religion. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/11/same-sex-marriage-amendment-ballots\">Demographic models</a> based on the religiosity of each state suggested that the same-sex marriage amendment should have passed <a href=\"http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg515/scaled.php?%20server=515&amp;filename=picture118.png&amp;res=landing\">in 2009</a> by 6 to 10 points. Polling disagreed, and it was the polling that was correct.</p> <p>This year, demographic models and <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/me-ballot-12-legalize-gay-marriage\">polling</a> agree that same-sex marriage should pass in Maine. Same-sex marriage acceptance is increasing almost everywhere. A presidential election year turnout also tends to be younger and more favorable to a vote supporting same-sex marriage. Depending on whether you believe the pace at which the acceptance of same-sex marriage is increasing more rapidly than before (as some national polls indicate) or at a linear pace, demographics suggest Maine passing same-sex marriage by 12 to 20 points. The last three polls also have same-sex marriage passing by 15 to 22 points.</p> <p>Maryland voters are being asked <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Maryland_Same-Sex_Marriage_Referendum_%282012%29\">via referendum</a> to uphold a same-sex marriage law passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor. The bill promises that religious leaders will not have to perform the ceremonies if they are opposed to them. Maryland is an interesting state, demographically, in that its black voters are more Democratic, but also more <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/101848671/MDfME-Hart-Poll-Memo-1\">socially conservative</a> than white Maryland voters. The fact that white voters only made up 64% of the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#MDP00p1\">2008 electorate</a> would suggest a very tight finish for Maryland's Question 6.</p> <p>Yet, <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/md-ballot-12-repeal-gay-marriage\">polls</a> have Maryland voters approving same-sex marriage by 14 to 20 points. Earlier polls had support for the legislature's actions only leading by single-digits. What happened to provide this sudden jolt in support? Minority, specifically black, voters have grown in their support of same-sex marriage since President Obama announced his backing for gay marriage in May: it seems to be a rare example where the president's bully pulpit has actually worked.</p> <p>The one state where same-sex marriage opponents may be <a href=\"http://poughies.blogspot.com/2011/05/minnesotan-marriage-ban-is-early.html\">heading to victory</a> is Minnesota. The constitutional amendment does not actually mention gay marriage. Instead, <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Minnesota_Same-Sex_Marriage_Amendment_(2012)\">it asks yes or no for a</a> \"Recognition of Marriage Solely Between One Man and One Woman\". Minnesota's amendment is also different in that not only does \"yes\" have to beat \"no\" for the measure to be adopted, but it must also clear 50% of all ballots cast. In other words, a voter who casts neither a yes nor a no vote, but votes in other contests, is in essence casting a no vote.</p> <p>Minnesota is a moderately religious state, but its religious population is largely conservative (see Michele Bachmann). If acceptance for same-sex marriage is increasing at an accelerated rate as compared to previous years, then demographics would suggest the ban's likelihood of surviving is now a toss-up. A linear trend, though, argues that the ban should pass by about 10 points. <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/mn-ballot-12-ban-gay-marriage\">Polling</a> indicates that the correct answer is probably between a toss-up and a 10-point \"win\" for the ban. An average of recent polls puts the \"yes\" side up by 4 points. That's a close race, and given the effect of abstentions, I believe either side could win.</p> <p>Washington's referendum is nearly identical to Maryland's. It's asking voters to uphold an act of the legislature signed by the governor. Like Maryland, the ban has clerical exceptions. A domestic partnership law was upheld by Washingtonians in 2009 by a 7-point margin.</p> <p>Washington state is one of <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Washington_Same-Sex_Marriage_Veto_Referendum,_Referendum_74_%282012%29\">the least religious states</a> in the nation, so you'd expect the law almost certainly to be upheld. Demographic models have same-sex marriage support outscoring opposition by 10 to 20 percentage points. The latest polling matches the modeling and has the same-sex marriage law winning by <a href=\"http://publicola.com/2012/07/24/new-poll-only-eymans-initiative-above-50-percent/\">10</a> to <a href=\"http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/wa-ballot-12-repeal-gay-marriage\">18</a> points.</p> <p>Overall, the picture is rosy for same-sex marriage proponents. It looks likely that same-sex marriage is going to be approved at the ballot box for the first time, on a state-by-state basis.</p> <p>The only cautionary note I would add is that same-sex marriage opposition has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/11/same-sex-marriage-amendment-ballots\">performed 7 percentage points better</a> at the ballot box in past years than polls have estimated. But this opposition \"bonus\" has <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/enten_revisiting_the_maine_mar.php?nr=1\">been waning</a> in recent years. In any case, same-sex marriage approval is ahead by enough points in Maine, Maryland and Washington that the bans would pass even if there is hidden opposition.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/18/kate-william-win-battle-topless-photos\">The court victory secured on behalf of Prince William and his wife</a> certainly doesn't prove that the French privacy law is so good that we should have one here.</p> <p>Just the opposite. Closer magazine's decision to publish a set of blatantly intrusive pictures of the royal couple illustrates the law's weakness as a brake on press misbehaviour.</p> <p>It may be suggested that it is not the law itself that's the problem - it is the insufficiently punitive range of penalties that lead France's celebrity magazine publishers and editors to defy it so regularly.</p> <p>In fact, the potential penalties for offenders - <a href=\"http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/blog-post/2205817/french-privacy-law-media-cynicism-and-the-likely-penalties-for-publishing-the-kate-middleton-pics\">according to Legal Week</a> - are severe: one year in jail and a fine of \u20ac45,000 (\u00a336,000). Corporate offenders, incidentally, could be fined up to \u20ac225,000 (\u00a3180,000).</p> <p>But judges in France don't impose anything like the maximum penalties. My researches suggest that no-one has ever received a jail sentence (which, I understand, would be a suspended anyway). Instead, most offenders are ordered to pay relatively modest fines.</p> <p>Why should that be? Well, it doesn't take a moment to realise that the French judiciary are being pragmatic because, in spite of the law, they value press freedom more than they do privacy.</p> <p>As I note in <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/roy-greenslade-selfregulation-not-law-is-the-way-to-keep-press-in-line-8156554.html\">my London Evening Standard column today</a>, can you imagine the outcry if an editor or photographer was sent to jail for invading someone's privacy?</p> <p>Do we really think it would be a proportionate punishment to imprison an individual - even if he or she lacks manners and morals - for causing another person embarrassment? </p> <p>I do not doubt that some people would be only too delighted to see certain editors doing porridge, but surely they would need to have been guilty of something more venal than publishing a picture of a topless woman?</p> <p>The latest episode of royal intrusion illustrates once again the virtues of self-regulation over the law. At its best, it works.</p> <p>I agree that, as so often, it has been to the benefit of the royal family (though, behind the scenes, the Press Complaints Commission will say that it benefits plenty of celebrities and other people caught up in news stories too).</p> <p>Of course it needs to be improved and, hopefully, Lord Justice Leveson will recommend a better system. It may need some kind statutory backing, but it won't amount to statutory regulation. </p> <p>Whatever the case, as the French experience indicates, a law would never work. Finally, let's not forget the internet. No national law, no European-wide law, is going to prevent the downloading and uploading of material that may well involve privacy intrusions.</p> <p>Perhaps we all need to rethink our attitude to privacy in the digital age. Day by day, whether we like it or not, life is getting more transparent.</p>",
  "<p>China's leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping has weighed in on the country's dispute with Japan by condemning the purchase of contested islands in the East China Sea as a farce, according to state media.</p> <p>The vice-president, expected to take charge when power is handed to a younger generation of leaders this autumn, urged Japan to stop \"wrong behaviours\", official news agency Xinhua added.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/china-japan-row-dispute-islands\" title=\"\">Four days of large-scale and sometimes violent protests in cities across China </a>appeared to have reached their conclusion on Tuesday, the anniversary of the 1931 incident that launched Japan's occupation of northern China. Authorities strengthened their presence in protest areas and made it clear further demonstrations would not be tolerated.</p> <p>The island group, known to China as the Diaoyu and to Japan as the Senkaku, is surrounded by fisheries and environmental resources, but the conflict is also fuelled by historical grievances over Japanese brutality in the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>The Japanese mission sent an email to China-based citizens, saying: \"It seems the protests in front of our embassy have subsided.\" It cited a message from Beijing police urging people not to protest in the embassy district. Beijing government workers cleaned paintbomb stains from around the building, and many Japanese businesses and factories reopened.</p> <p>But China's commerce ministry spokesman, Shen Danyang, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral trade, which exceeded \u00a3210bn last year. \"Japan must take complete responsibility for this,\" he added.</p> <p>Professor Hu Xingdou of the Beijing Institute of Technology warned: \"The Diaoyu island issue cannot be solved in the short term \u2026 it will be an obstacle to the friendship between China and Japan.\" He said he believed this wave of protests had been bigger and more violent than the anti-Japanese demonstrations of 2005.</p> <p>While protesters mostly vented their frustrations on Japanese properties or products \u2013 attacking businesses and smashing up cars \u2013 the Hong Kong government reported an assault against a Japanese couple in its region and urged the public to respect the law.</p> <p>Around 50 protesters in Beijing also attacked the car of US ambassador Gary Locke on Tuesday, said embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse. \"Embassy officials have registered their concern about yesterday's incident with the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs and urged the Chinese government to do everything possible to protect American facilities and personnel,\" he added.</p> <p>The visiting US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, sought to allay Chinese concerns over the US's new focus on the Asia-Pacific region, shortly after meeting Xi on Wednesday.</p> <p>He told young Chinese officers and cadets: \"Our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region is not an attempt to contain China. It is an attempt to engage China and expand its role in the Pacific. It is about creating a new model in the relationship of two Pacific powers.\"</p> <p>Chinese rights groups have reported that a well-known dissident is being held by police after posting comments about the disputed islands last week. Jiao Guobiao, formerly a journalism professor at Peking University, was arrested for incitement to subvert state power.</p> <p>According to the South China Morning Post, Jiao was detained over open letters he posted online to Ma Ying-jeou, president of Taiwan, and the nationalist Tokyo governor, Shintaro Ishihara, whose proposal to buy the Diaoyu islands triggered the Japanese government's purchase.</p> <p>In his letter to Ishihara, Jiao wrote satirically that he would donate money to help Japan buy the Diaoyu islands and even the Zhongnanhai leadership compound in Beijing. His letter to Ma said that if the islands were owned by Beijing, \"they will become another pig sty where it can arbitrarily carry out abuses\"..</p> <p>In Japan, police said they believed a small fire at the gates of a Chinese school in Kobe was set because of the dispute.</p>",
  "<p>Russia has accused the US of using its aid agency in Moscow to covertly influence the country's politics and elections, explaining its decision to expel the mission amid a wider crackdown on the opposition movement.</p> <p>The Russian government has given the US agency for international development (USAid) until 1 October to cease all operations in the country. The agency helps fund a number of pro-democracy and human rights groups that have provoked the Kremlin's wrath amid an unprecedented opposition movement against the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In an uncharacteristically blunt statement, the Russian foreign ministry said that the decision to shut USAid was taken primarily because the agency's work \"does not always correspond to [its] stated goals\".</p> <p>\"This means attempts to exert influence, via the distribution of grants, upon political processes, including elections of various levels and institutions of civil society,\" it said.</p> <p>Putin has accused the US state department of orchestrating the mass protests that have swept Moscow since he announced his intention to run for the presidency again late last year. A main target of his ire has been Golos, an independent election monitoring group that receives the bulk of its funding from USAid and was key in exposing electoral fraud in a December parliamentary vote that helped bring tens of thousands of protesters on to the streets.</p> <p>The foreign ministry also expressed its displeasure with the agency's work in the troubled North Caucasus, a region still wracked by the remnants of a violent Islamist insurgency. \"USAid's activity in the Russian regions, especially the North Caucasus, prompted serious questions, which we warned our American colleagues about repeatedly,\" the statement said.</p> <p>USAid has been operating in Russia since the Soviet Union's collapse, funding groups that have received little or no government support, including medical NGOs devoted to fighting HIV/Aids and tuberculosis and various environmental groups. Yet the bulk of its funding goes to civil society groups focused on building up democracy and human rights in the country, including Golos, human rights NGO Memorial and corruption watchdog Transparency International.</p> <p>Putin has repeatedly criticised groups that receive foreign funding and has accused opposition protesters of acting on orders from Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. The Russian parliament passed a law this summer obliging NGOs that receive foreign grants to publicly brand themselves \"foreign agents\", a term reminiscent of the spy terminology used during the cold war.</p> <p>Grigory Melkonyants, the deputy director of Golos, said it was \"practically impossible\" to get funding from within Russia. \"Supporting human rights \u2013 be it for prisoners, or election monitoring, or anything \u2013 is a very sharp question for our current leadership. Business doesn't want to risk putting money into this,\" he said.</p> <p>Putin has taken great pains to convince the wider Russian population that any criticism of his government is a foreign plot. Russian officials and media have also accused the US of being behind the Arab spring uprisings, including in Egypt, where USAid came under pressure in the wake of Egypt's uprising against former president Hosni Mubarak.</p> <p>The move against USAid was announced by the state department on Tuesday and official state media in Russia remained silent on the issue on Wednesday. An official inside the Obama administration vowed that the US would find ways to continue to fund civil society groups, potentially paving the way for a long stand-off.</p> <p>The Russian government brought immense pressure against the British Council in the wake of the murder of dissident Alexander Litvinenko in London in late 2006 in a tussle that lasted for more than a year.</p> <p>The foreign ministry also said its decision to shut USAid was prompted by the \"maturity\" of its civil society. \"Russian civil society has become entirely mature and does not need 'external leadership',\" it said.</p> <p>Government critics said the move was the latest attempt to put pressure on the opposition. In the past few months, charges have been brought against more than a dozen protesters as well as opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Opposition MP Gennady Gudkov was stripped of his mandate last week. A series of laws that increase fines for protesting and slander have been passed, as well as a bill that critics fear will tighten the government's control over the internet.</p>",
  "<p>Companies are in a bind. The pressure is on them to become sustainable, but they know they can't do it alone. Sure, they can cut energy use, reduce waste, limit water consumption and generally create a spick-and-span, eco-tastic chain of production. But they need consumers on board too. Why? Because a chunk of their environmental impacts occur when their products get into our mitts. And therein lies the bind. We, the consumer, do what we like. We're free to choose. Not that we're beyond being influenced. Make sustainability easy, normal and fun, and we should buy into it. That's the idea, at least.</p> <p>In the third in a series of discussions supported by Unilever, Guardian Sustainable Business gathered together experts to discuss how companies can help make sustainability \"just living\". The panel included Cheryl Hicks, team leader for sustainable lifestyles at UNEP/Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Production and Consumption (CSCP); Freya Williams, group planning director at OgilvyEarth; David Jones, global CEO at Havas and co-founder of One Young World; Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University; Mark Earls, author of Herd; Stefano Giolito, director, sustainability at Unilever; Dr Mark Cobain, global new business director at Unilever.</p> <h2>Moving with the tide</h2> <p>Changing habits isn't easy. That said, the trends augur well for a shift to sustainable living. We, the people, are broadly in favour. Lifestyles with less wastage and lower environmental impacts strike us as, well, not unreasonable. Cheryl Hicks, a sustainable consumption expert, pointed to \"mounting evidence\" of more sustainable ways of living in Europe. The watchwords for future lifestyles are \"efficient\" (ie wasting less), \"different\" (\"a shift in preferences from quantity and ownership to access and quality\") and \"sufficient\" (\"conscious efforts to consume less\").</p> <p>David Jones, chief executive of media group Havas, echoed that optimistic note. Today's youth hold the key, he reckoned. Their desire to change the world and their social media savviness mean they have the desire and, more importantly, the ability to reward sustainable companies. Indeed, it could be said that we're on the verge of a \"generational shift\", where irresponsible become viewed as \"socially unacceptable\". At least, so thinks Freya Williams, director of strategy at OgilvyEarth. Look at NikeFuel. All of a sudden, good living is \"fun, cool and visible\", she observed.</p> <h2>Dos and don'ts</h2> <p>Unilever's Mark Cobain emphasised ease over entertainment. Making sustainability fun is fine; making it easy is essential. Anything that takes undue time or requires extra thought turns online shoppers off, he argued. In other words, the simpler, the better. Similarly, he advocated easing people into new behaviours. Shock doctrine and sustainable living don't mix. It's unrealistic to expect a season car driver to swap their gas-guzzler for a pedal bike. But buy a hybrid or join a car-sharing club \u2013 now that borders on the possible.</p> <p>However, just because the zeitgeist is green, doesn't mean the future will be, too. Some tips on how not to mess it up. First, don't preach. Boring facts about healthy eating have never stopped a child scoffing down a doughnut, suggested Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University. Far better is a systematic approach based on fun, rewards and peer influence, such as the the Food Dudes programme. Secondly, don't price eco-products too high. Making sustainability the expensive option is a ticket to failure, argued Williams. Normalise the price, she insisted. Thirdly, package eco offerings as regular fare. Consumers, by and large, like the mainstream. Niche, we're not so sure about. So best to ditch the \"green\" labels.</p> <h2>Big up brand power</h2> <p>Of course, none of us are really entirely free to choose. We're targeted by messages day in, day out. Like it or not, many of those come from big brands. For individuals to adopt sustainable lifestyles, our good intentions need to be translated into practical actions, says Unilever's Stefano Giolito. Brands embody values and aspirations, so they should do what they do best: make great (and preferably sustainable) products, and then use their brand power to get people using them. The success of such a strategy will be born from marketing simplicity, added Hicks. \"Brand strategists hold the unique skills to distil complex issues and ideas down to something that people will understand, remember, and act upon.\"</p> <h2>Legislating for change </h2> <p>There is another option of course. Regarding the car to bike idea mentioned earlier, legislators could simply issue a blanket ban on the combustion engine, although that's unlikely to happen any time soon. Even so, a case can be made for law-making as the \"fastest and most effective\" towards changing behaviour. David Jones argued exactly that. Consider smoking: \"Who would have though just a decade ago that it would be now illegal to smoke in most bars and restaurants in the major capitals?\" he asked. So too with CFCs and car emissions. \"If you legislate, it works\". But does it? Bangor University's Lowe wondered how you would legislate for a child to like broccoli. Laws are good at stopping us from certain actions, but weak at initiating us in others. Mark Earls, author of the book Herd, points to the example of a tax on fizzy drinks in New York. Such a measure may eventually skew the market towards healthier beverages, \"but it will not work for everyone, nor will its impact be equal in all locations or amongst all demographics\".</p> <p>Other, less blunt tools are needed. Unilever's Mark Cobain had a suggestion. He'd like to see the creation of supportive environments, where sustainable living is easy (easier than unsustainable living, that is). Hicks agreed. She gave the example of sustainable cities. Legislators are important, of course. They set planning rules and CO2 targets. But we need the engineers, designers and architects to put these into effect. Once a sustainable infrastructure is in place, options like public transport or off-peak electricity use become straightforward for Joe Public.</p> <h2>Pulling the celeb card</h2> <p>Like everything else these days, if the sensible stuff (see above) doesn't work, then you can call in a celebrity. Take Matt Damon's work on water conservation. Celebs, like brands, have a massive opportunity to be a positive force of change, said Unilever's Giolito. But fame without feelings may no longer be quite good enough. As Havas's Jones concluded: \"Authenticity is becoming way more important than image\". Proof, indeed, that change is thankfully possible.</p> <p><strong>This article forms part of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><strong>Let's talk sustainable living</strong></a><strong>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><strong>sustainable living</strong></a><strong> mainstream.

  "<p>Scientology's legal representative <a href=\"http://www.scientologynews.org/sites/default/files/1-Jeff-Riffer-Re-David-Miscavige-to-Gaydon-Carter-16-Aug-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">wrote an eight-page letter of complaint to Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter</a> over the magazine's recent Tom Cruise expos\u00e9, calling it \"shoddy\", \"bigoted\" and potentially libellous.</p> <p>In the missive, dated 16 August, Jeffrey K Riffer of Elkins, Kalt, Weintraub, Reuben and Gartside LLP also denied suggestions the organisation's leader, David Miscavige, might have interfered in the Top Gun star's love life since the former was far too busy travelling and being \"the leader of a dynamic global religion expanding across five continents\" to get involved in such minor matters. Vanity Fair's article, written by Maureen Orth and published earlier this month, alleged Scientologist leaders held auditions to find the Top Gun star a new partner in the wake of his split from Nicole Kidman in 2001.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/tom-cruise-wife-audition-claims-denied\" title=\"\"> Cruise has subsequently denied the claims through a lawyer</a>.</p> <p>\"Ms Orth's implications are demonstrably false,\" argued Riffer in his emailed letter. \"If she had considered for a minute the respective travel and work demands placed on both Mr Miscavige and Mr Cruise, she would have dismissed outright this \"third wheel notion\" \u2026 Mr Miscavige is the leader of a dynamic global religion expanding across five continents. His duties are herculean and accomplishments monumental. He is not a 'third wheel' to anything or anyone.\"</p> <p>Vanity Fair's story further alleged that Miscavige's wife Shelly recruited Iranian-born British actor Nazanin Boniadi to date the Oscar-nominated actor in 2004 following an exhaustive month-long process during which the latter thought she was being \"audited\", one of Scientology's essential components, via video interview for a training film. The piece suggests Boniadi was later punished for revealing the relationship to a third party.</p> <p>\"These alleged events never occurred \u2013 and, no credible person has ever said that they did,\" countered Riffer. \"There are no authentic contemporaneous documents evidencing such events (because such events never occurred). To be absolutely clear, Mr Miscavige never videoed auditing sessions, never saw videos of auditing sessions (since there are no videos), never read session reports aloud (since there are no such reports), let alone ever used such information to 'manipulate' anyone.\"</p> <p>Riffer goes on to accuse Carter and Vanity Fair of religious bigotry towards Scientologists and accuses them of ignorance. \"Scientology is a new religion and its beliefs not as well known as those of more ancient history,\" the email continues. \"That does not excuse you or Ms Orth for being ignorant. Rather, it demands you be even more sensitive to finding out what the true beliefs are of Scientology \u2013 which can only be told by the religion itself. Just because you don't think you are bigoted doesn't mean you aren't. Bigotry and ignorance go hand in hand and you are definitely and wilfully ignorant of the actual beliefs of Scientology and the activities of its churches.\"</p> <p>Cruise and Scientology have been in the media spotlight lately due to the former's divorce from actor Katie Holmes and the US box-office success of the Paul Thomas Anderson Oscar contender, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\">The Master</a>, which features a protagonist based on Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard. Anderson has said his film is not about Scientology, but has admitted that Philip Seymour Hoffman's character Lancaster Dodd is partially drawn from Hubbard, as well as other figures.</p> <p>Riffer's letter appears to have been a shot across the bows, as it was sent prior to the Tom Cruise article's publication in the October issue of Vanity Fair earlier this month. It assumes that the magazine \"will not publish anything defamatory\" and hopes \"we will not need to meet at a deposition or in a court\". There is no suggestion that Scientology has in fact taken such legal action in the intermediate period.</p>",
  "<p>Twelve months ago, at the age of 29, I was told I had terminal cancer. The median length of life from diagnosis to death for patients with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmoplastic_small-round-cell_tumor\" title=\"\">desmoplastic small-round-cell tumour</a> is reported in medical literature as 14 months. That technically means my time should be up in October, but I'm doing well and will in all probability survive longer than this.</p> <p>Living with death hanging over me and everything I do while still smiling and staying positive is incredibly difficult. I feel like I'm constantly struggling to push it to the back of my mind but never quite succeeding. In fact, the sad thing is I can't remember what it was like not to have a terminal cancer diagnosis. There are constant reminders, which mean that even if I could forget what is happening to me, I would never be allowed to: the regular visits for follow-up appointments at the hospital; the daily battle to swallow the 12 pills I have to take to keep my symptoms under control; the frequent \"How are you?\" questions that always have a deeper meaning than just a simple enquiry about my welfare.</p> <p>I was always very clear that once I discontinued my <a href=\"http://dying.about.com/od/chronicillnesses/a/Pall_chemo.htm\" title=\"\">palliative chemotherapy</a> in January I wanted to return some normality to my life, for however long that may be. A huge part of this was going back to work. Many people thought I was crazy to contemplate returning to a stressful job as an elderly medicine registrar at a busy district general hospital, but I was determined. And I was completely right to return. </p> <p>Working has given me a focus again, and I think I still have a great deal to give \u2013 probably more than before my own illness. I struggle with fatigue, but this is something I am determined is not going to beat me, so I work three full days a week and put everything into my job that I used to. I would hate to be thought of at work as the poor young dying doctor, much preferring to retain my pre-cancer personality \u2013 the competent, hardworking registrar who gets stuff sorted and cares about her patients.</p> <p>My \"maintaining normality for as long as possible\" mantra also extends to my home life. I still do the housework and the cooking. I sit and watch the soaps in the evening. I enjoy regular Sunday lunches with my family. I swim up to 50 lengths at my local pool. The routine of life goes on and is vital in keeping both myself and my husband on an even keel, although life is also now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/24/bucket-list-what-to-do-before-i-die\" title=\"\">sprinkled with wonderful, invigorating experiences as we work through my bucket list</a>.</p> <p>One coping strategy I have is to live my life on a two-month window. I find it very hard to think any further ahead than this, although sometimes I am forced to. For example, my brother and his wife are expecting their first child in January. Meeting the newest member of our family is a long-term goal that I would dearly love to achieve. Likewise, two of my best friends have just got engaged and are planning summer weddings. I would love to be able to perform bridesmaid and cake-baking duties, but there is a strong possibility I will no longer be here by then. </p> <p>I have a strange response to all this good news. Of course I am ecstatic that these exciting events are happening to the people close to me, but the overwhelming feeling - perhaps self-centredly - is that I am going to miss out on the celebrations. I won't be able to see everyone else's lives flourish, because mine is coming to a premature halt.</p> <p>So we live with \"it\" day in, day out, and try to plough on with life in as positive and happy a way as possible, remembering that in many respects we are blessed and lucky. My husband Chris and I have crammed more activities into the last few months than we have managed in the 10 years of our relationship, and we will continue to live our lives on fast-forward.</p> <p><em>\u2022 If you want to read more about Kate's story, her books The Other Side and The Bright Side <a href=\"http://www.theothersidestory.co.uk\" title=\"\">can be ordered from her website</a>.

  "<p>Toy shops are an intrinsic part of the magic of childhood. Hang on, I'll put that more clearly: toy shops are where the magic of childhood goes to be smothered in a hairy fug of soft toys and stabbed with a million construction toy components. Toy shops are where you first experience the agonising paralysis of overwhelming consumer choice. They're the place that teaches you the existential horror of the mismatch between you and the advertisers' version of what you're supposed to be. They're where you learn the anguish of wanting what you can't have, and the misery of having what doesn't make you happy. And all this watched over by adults who seem to think they're giving you the time of your little life by introducing you to all this awfulness.</p> <p>So there are no tiny tears of woe from me at the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/17/hamleys-toys-sold-to-groupe-ludendo?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Hamleys has been sold to French megacorp Groupe Ludendo</a>. First, because the supposedly quintessentially British retailer has been in overseas hands for years already. And second, because you could dismantle the place and ship every single brick and all the tat inside to new owners on Jupiter, and I still wouldn't feel safe from the pester-power induced by its lust-red awnings. The only problem with Hamleys' new proprietor is that it's not a comically malevolent moustache-twirling dolligarch, because such a terrifying place should by rights have a terrifying individual at its head.</p> <p>Maybe there is an evil genius working behind the scenes at 188-196 Regent Street. That would explain why, until <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/13/hamleys-steps-towards-gender-equality\" title=\"\">December 2011</a>, the toy kingdom operated on <a href=\"http://delilah-mj.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/hamleys-toy-shop-promotes-gender.html\" title=\"\">strict gender segregation</a> lines, with a girls' floor and a boys' floor. Boys were the gender of action and discovery \u2013 science sets, cars, trains and construction. Girls got dolls, beauty (with a Minipops salon to serve their junior vanity) and shrink-and-pink versions of household appliances \u2013 don't you even think of having any ambition beyond the four walls of your house or the skin of your own face, little lady! And as for boys, whoever heard of one of them growing up to take a caring role? Absurd.</p> <p>Hamleys dropped the egregiously prescriptive pink and blue colour scheme; the beauty parlour remains \u2013 and why the hell not when you can rinse a tenner out of parents for a French plait while educating girls in the idea that \"pampering\" is an end in itself? So much of what toy shops flog is about buying rather than playing anyway. Check out Hamleys' predictions for this year's <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/pictures/photos-12164/pictures-hamleys-top-christmas-toys-2012/1\" title=\"\">top Christmas toys</a>, and you'll see a list dominated by pricey novelties: a breakdancing Mickey Mouse, a Barbie with an alarming fragile-looking articulated pony, a baby tablet that shoves \"educational games\" under your baby's nose.</p> <p>All stuff, in other words, that a child can only play with inside the narrow bounds determined by the design of the toy. That's not really play at all \u2013 it's just doing what you're told. These toys are as free-spirited and imaginative as a colour-coded floor shepherding infants to their gender destiny. Rubbish toys offer only fleeting pleasure at the one thing they can do, followed by disappointment when you realise that they only do that one thing, then guilty neglect \u2013 made more stinging because you wanted so badly to love it.</p> <p>I associate Hamleys with the tragedy of misplaced consumer hope more than anywhere else, because Hamleys broke my heart. Me and my sister had saved our money for a visit. We explored the floors in a haze of expectation: this would be magic! This would be wonderful! Dreams would come true here! We left with a wind-up frog that seemed entrancingly lifelike in the shop floor demo, but at home just trundled dully up and down the bathtub until it caught black mould and was banished to the airing cupboard. That's what Hamleys is: not a place of fun and laughter, but a plastic frog rotting next to the boiler. Go on, take your kids. I promise they'll never forget.</p>",

  "<p>Security at French embassies around the world has been reinforced after the Paris-based satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo published cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>Amid continuing protests by Muslims around the globe over a controversial anti-Islam film, French ministers and religious leaders called for restraint, and riot police were posted outside the magazine's offices.</p> <p>French embassies and schools in 20 countries will be temporarily closed on Friday, as a precautionary measure in case of fresh protests after prayers, the foreign ministry said.</p> <p>The offices of Charlie Hebdo were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/french-magazine-bomb-muhammad-cartoon\" title=\"\">firebombed last November after it published an edition entitled Charia Hebdo</a>, supposedly guest-edited by Muhammad.</p> <p>France's prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in a statement: \"In the current climate, the prime minister wishes to stress his disapproval of all excesses and calls on everyone to behave responsibly.\"</p> <p>Questioned on RTL radio, he added: \"We are in a country where the freedom of expression is guaranteed, along with the freedom to caricature. If people really feel their beliefs are offended and think the law has been broken \u2013 and we are in a state where the law must be totally respected \u2014 they can go to the courts.\"</p> <p>He was speaking amid calls for protests in the French capital on Saturday against the film Innocence of Muslims, which has sparked a wave of retaliatory attacks on US and other western embassies around the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/afghanistan-suicide-blast-kills-12\" title=\"\">An Afghan suicide bombing linked to protests about the film killed 12 people on Tuesday</a>, bringing the death toll to more than 30.</p> <p>Ayrault said a request had been made for police authorisation to hold the demonstration, but that it would be refused. On Sunday, police arrested more than 100 people who had gathered to protest near the US embassy in Paris.</p> <p>The publication of the caricatures, on the inside and back page of Charlie Hebdo \u2013 whose website is blocked, for unknown reasons \u2013 brought widespread condemnation.</p> <p>Essam Erian, the acting head of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, said the French judiciary should deal with the issue as firmly as it had handled the case against the magazine that published topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge.</p> <p>\"If the case of Kate (the duchess) is a matter of privacy, then the cartoons are an insult to a whole people. The beliefs of others must be respected,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said that French law should deal with insults against Islam in the same way as it deals with Holocaust denial.</p> <p>\"If anyone doubts the Holocaust happened, they are imprisoned, yet if anyone insults the prophet, his companions or Islam, the most (France) does is to apologise in two words. It is not fair or logical,\" he said.</p> <p>Richard Prasquier, president of the Representative Council for Jewish Institutions, said he disapproved of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons after the killings in the row over the film.</p> <p>\"It is in consideration of those deaths that I disapprove of Charlie Hebdo's initiative,\" he said in a statement. \"To publish caricatures of the prophet Muhammad in these times, in the name of freedom, is an irresponsible kind of panache.\"</p> <p>Dalil Boubakeur, the senior imam at the Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Paris, appealed for France's Muslim community, which is the largest in Europe, to remain calm and not \"throw oil on the fire\".</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, the Catholic Archbishop of Paris, told French radio the cartoons would \"provoke revulsion among many Muslim believers, who will feel their faith has been insulted\". He added: \"You cannot say anything in the name of freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>Laurent Fabius, the minister of foreign affairs, said he was \"against all provocation\".</p> <p>However, Charlie Hebdo's editor, St\u00e9phane Charbonnier, was unrepentant. He said the latest caricatures would shock \"only those who will want to be shocked\".</p> <p>In September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten caused an international storm after publishing 12 cartoons depicting Muhammad.</p> <p>Protests across the world resulted in more than 100 reported deaths.

  "<p>Greater Manchester police have been forced on to the defensive after it emerged that a man suspected of murdering two unarmed police officers in a surprise attack was arrested but released on bail in June.</p> <p>Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, were attending what was believed to be a reported burglary in Hattersley, Tameside, on Tuesday morning when they were fatally injured by gunshots and a grenade blast. Hughes's parents, Susan and Bryn, and her brother Sam paid tribute to their \"very caring and loving girl\".</p> <p>\"Nicola was only 23 years old and had the whole of her life in front of her,\" they said in a statement. \"We cannot express how we feel today except to say we have always been exceedingly proud of Nicola and always will be. She knew she was loved by us all and we shall all miss her dreadfully.\"</p> <p>Police were continuing to question Dale Cregan, 29, on Wednesday. Cregan walked into a police station in nearby Hyde and was arrested on suspicion of the two officers' murders, as well as those of a father and son who died in separate attacks earlier this year.</p> <p>The force has confirmed that Cregan, whose face was plastered across billboards throughout the area during a huge manhunt, had been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of Mark Short, 23, in a pub in Droylsden on 25 May. He was detained at Manchester airport on 12 June after returning from a holiday in Thailand, police said, and was questioned and subsequently released on bail.</p> <p>Short's father, David, was killed at his home in Clayton, Manchester, on 10 August. Two men have been charged with his murder, while four others have been charged with that of his son.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the force's chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, issued a statement defending the decision to bail Cregan. \"It is absolutely normal in the course of complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In those circumstances suspects have to be released on bail as there are strict time limits covering how long suspects can be held in custody without charge. That is exactly what happened in this case.\"</p> <p>The Home Office has said that the home secretary, Theresa May, is on her way to Manchester to meet Fahy.</p> <p>The unprecedented attack \u2013 the first time that two female police officers have been killed in the line of duty \u2013 has prompted calls for the death penalty to be restored. \"Bring back hanging,\" the father of Bone, Paul, told the Daily Telegraph. \"Let policemen shoot people on sight. I am just so completely shocked. She was such a lovely girl. I can't even bring myself to think about the wedding.\" The young constable, who had five years' police service, had been about to enter a civil partnership.</p> <p>Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, also said in the Telegraph it was time to think again of the \"deterrent effect\" of a death sentence. \"I have kept track year by year since the death penalty was suspended then abolished of the number of people who have been killed by persons previously convicted of homicide,\" he writes. \"It has averaged three people a year. About 150 people killed because their killers have been freed to kill again. I think it is time we thought again about the deterrent effect of the shadow of the gallows.\"</p> <p>Bone and Hughes were responding to a routine callout in Hattersley when they were caught in a trap.</p> <p>As they arrived at a property in Abbey Gardens where a burglary had been reported, the officers came under fire from bullets and a grenade.</p> <p>Within an hour, Cregan is believed to have walked into the police station in Hyde.</p> <p>A minute's silence was held by Greater Manchester officers at 11am, including by those at the scene of the attack. With heads bowed, colleagues of the dead women stood behind the police cordon. One could be seen wiping away tears.</p>",
  "<p>Listening to all the gloom and doom on the news these days, I sometimes catch myself actually starting to feel sorry for people living in Europe. Then I tell myself I must be mad. Even with a crisis, Europeans still enjoy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/05/uk-competitive-country-world-economic-forum?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">just about the safest, healthiest and wealthiest lives on the planet</a>.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">UN human development index (HDI)</a>, which measures life expectancy, literacy, education levels and standards of living in a country, six of the 10 most developed nations in the world are in Europe.</p> <p>And when the HDI takes into account inequality, nine out of the 10 best-performing nations are European, proof that the old continent has been the most effective in creating the least stratified societies.</p> <p>I realise the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/greece-coalition-job-cuts-unemployment?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">24% of unemployed Greek citizens</a> might take issue with being told they are lucky to live in Europe. But in 2011, after four years of recession, Greece still had a higher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita\" title=\"\">GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity</a> (PPP) than any country in South America and Africa as well as most of Asia, according to the IMF. None of the much-touted Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has a GDP per capita even close to that of the European \"sick man\".</p> <p>Some suggest Europe is no longer able to compete with the strongest emerging economies. At the World Economic Forum in Davos at the beginning of this year, the prime minister, David Cameron, sounded alarmist tones, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9041076/David-Cameron-Europes-lack-of-competitiveness-is-its-Achilles-heel.html\" title=\"\">saying that</a> \"Europe's lack of competitiveness is its Achilles heel\".</p> <p>But according to a ranking of that same World Economic Forum, six out of the 10 most competitive economies in the world are in Europe. The most competitive of the Brics count is China, at 29.</p> <p>Cheap, easy-to-fire labour isn't the only thing you need to attract investors. It helps when you have quality infrastructure, a transparent and efficient administration, the rule of law and low levels of corruption.</p> <p>Maybe that's why despite all the gloomy news coming out of the eurozone last year, Europe still attracted $426bn in foreign direct investment, compared to the combined $279bn that flowed to the Brics.</p> <p>Countries such as China and India are making laudable progress, but most of their citizens still live in the kind of crippling poverty unimaginable in the EU. The Brics are decades away from catching up with Europe, much less overtaking it. This is no cause to be smug but it is cause for less self-doubt.</p> <p>Also, Europe is often compared with the US and, yes, per capita incomes there are higher than in the EU, but the average Joe isn't necessarily better off in Florida than in Florence.</p> <p>Per capita income doesn't reflect income distribution. If <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/\" title=\"\">Warren Buffett</a> strolled into Stamford Bridge in the middle of a Chelsea game, by average income calculations, everybody in the stadium would be a millionaire.</p> <p>Considering the fact that in the US income distribution is heavily skewered towards a privileged minority, one needs to be particularly careful with the per capita figures in this case.</p> <p>The US offers more opportunity to the gifted, the entrepreneurial and the rich than Europe does. But those who don't fall into those categories are better off here. Were the average American blue-collar worker to see how his German, Dutch or British peers live, and the quality of healthcare and education accessible to them, he might start wondering if his country is indeed \"the greatest nation on earth\", as American politicians love to say. And let's not forget that US national debt is more than 100% of its GDP compared to the 83% for the EU, even with its often derided \"welfare state\".</p> <p>Of course, there are some large territories such as Canada and Australia that also offer a good life, but their relatively small populations (all less than, say, Poland) require they be compared with particular EU countries, and not the whole continent.</p> <p>The level of development Europe has attained is one of humanity's greatest achievements. One of the main reasons for this success is that the continent has been remarkably well governed. In every society, it is those at the top who set the tone and, as someone who grew up in Nigeria, I've seen first-hand how poor governance can rubbish a country and keep it from realising its potential.</p> <p>That's why I appreciate Europe's leaders more than those who have not experienced government elsewhere. I do think it is excellent practice that Europeans constantly complain about their countries and demand improvements to how they function. To do otherwise would be to forgo aspirations to progress.</p> <p>But Europeans should never forget that most people in this world would give anything to be able to live like them. So those who are lucky enough to be citizens of the closest thing to paradise on Earth should be more appreciative of what they have and less depressed about the future of this continent.</p>",
  "<p>Relatives of one of the police officers killed in a gun and grenade attack in Greater Manchester have paid tribute to their \"caring and loving girl\" who was \"always happy with life\" and loved the job that tragically brought her into the line of fire.</p> <p>A day after 23-year-old Nicola Hughes died alongside her 32-year-old colleague, Fiona Bone, in Hattersley, Tameside, her parents, Susan and Bryn, and younger brother Sam said they would always be \"exceedingly proud\" of her.</p> <p>A statement released through Greater Manchester police said: \"Nicola was our only daughter and a beautiful child. She was always happy with life and lived for her family.</p> <p>\"She had an infectious personality and sense of humour and was a very caring and loving girl. When she left the house this morning she was going to the job she loved.</p> <p>\"Nicola always wanted to make a difference and, in doing so, she made such a big difference to everyone she knew. She cared about everyone and especially her colleagues.</p> <p>\"Nicola was only 23 years old and had the whole of her life in front of her. We cannot express how we feel today except to say we have always been exceedingly proud of Nicola and always will be. She knew she was loved by us all and we shall all miss her dreadfully.\"</p> <p>Hughes, a karate fan described as a \"bubbly\" and cheerful \"chatterbox\" by her chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, lived with her mother in the Oldham area. She joined the Greater Manchester force in 2009 and had served all three years of her service in the Tameside division.</p> <p>PC Bone, who had five years' service with the force, was described by Fahy as a calm and gentle woman and appreciated colleague by at an emotional press conference on Tuesday. She had been \"so happy with her partner\", he said, with whom she had been planning a civil partnership. Police said her family were due to fly in to Manchester from the Isle of Man.</p> <p>\"Her fellow officers said that they always loved being partnered off with her as she was always calm, collected and professional, and could defuse situations with her calm, gentle way,\" Fahy said.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.gmp.police.uk\" title=\"\">online book of condolences</a> has attracted more than 2,600 messages, many of them from fellow police officers. Tom McGhie, former chairman of the West Yorkshire Police Federation, wrote: \"My experiences when I was the chairman of West Yorkshire Police Federation at the time that Ian Broadhurst and Sharon Beshenivsky were murdered will live with me for ever. Their sacrifice and those of your colleagues murdered today will never be forgotten. My thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Senior police chiefs are warning against calls for a change in police gun policy to allow more officers to carry arms following the death of two officers in Manchester.</p> <p>Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, died after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/police-officers-gun-grenade-attack\" title=\"\">gun and grenade attack</a> on Tuesday. The horrific nature of the attack and the apparent luring of the officers to their deaths has caused intense debate about safety with relatives of previous victims of gun crime calling for more officers to be armed.</p> <p>The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde, has backed Sir Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, in speaking against officers routinely being armed.</p> <p>Orde said: \"Guns don't necessarily solve the problem. You only have to look at the American experience. Many colleagues in America are lost without even drawing their gun at close ranges.\"</p> <p>Orde added that it was the \"clear view of the British police service from top to bottom\" that officers prefer to be unarmed because the public dislike approaching constables bearing weapons.</p> <p>He said minimum use of force and intervention was the \"bedrock\" of Britain's policing model.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme policing was \"a risk business\", adding: \"As we speak, officers will be responding to calls not knowing what they will get to and not knowing exactly what they will be dealing with when they arrive. It's just a harsh fact of policing and, tragically on occasions, things go horribly wrong.\"</p> <p>The opposition is in part philosophical. A regularly armed force is seen as jarring with the British model that officers police by consent and are citizens in uniform.</p> <p>Fahy expressed a similar opinion soon after the shooting: \"We are passionate that the British style of policing is routinely unarmed policing. Sadly, we know from the experience in America and other countries that having armed officers certainly does not mean they do not end up getting shot dead.\"</p> <p>The Manchester deaths take the number of officers killed this year after a firearms incident to three. PC Ian Dibell was killed by a single bullet wound to the chest after intervening in a dispute while off duty. The incident happened in July in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. The suspected gunman, Peter Reeve, was found dead the next day with a gun.</p> <p>In February, Northumbria PC David Rathband committed suicide, 18 months after being blinded by gunman Raoul Moat in July 2010. After Tuesday's deaths, Rathband's twin brother called for police officers to be routinely armed.</p> <p>\"It beggars belief. How many officers need to die before the powers realise that it is the 21st century and you cannot fight crime with an outdated piece of plastic and a bit of spray?\" asked Darren Rathband, a former Staffordshire police officer now serving in South Australia.</p> <p>\"No job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict. We don't go on jobs where people are happy to see us. I am angry some other families have now lost a daughter, sister, mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner.\"</p> <p>Paul Beshenivsky, the widower of murdered police constable Sharon Beshenivsky, who died in service in 2005, told ITV news the latest killings should \"open the public's eyes\" and reopen the debate about arming officers.</p> <p>He said: \"I think policing, as regarding going to scenes of crimes, should be monitored better, and I think police, in honesty, should be armed, walking into situations that they're not totally aware of. You can't have armed response at every situation, but I think, as an officer being armed, walk into a situation, feeling more comfortable, walking into that situation, thinking, 'I could respond to that situation'.\"</p> <p>With the exception of Northern Ireland, officers in the UK are not routinely armed. They have to volunteer to carry weapons, and undergo rigorous training and assessment to ensure that they are fit to do so.</p> <p>According to the latest figures, in 2010-11 a total of 6,653 officers were authorised to carry weapons, a decrease of 326 (5%) on the previous year. There are around 140,000 officers in England and Wales.</p> <p>Specialist firearms officers are available to be deployed, as are armed response vehicles.</p> <p>Police favour increased issuing of stun guns that fire a powerful electric current. Officers are issued with protective vests that stop knives and offer limited protection against low-velocity bullets. More extensive protection against bullets would prove too heavy to wear for a full shift.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police is under investigation over the shooting dead in March of Anthony Grainger, who was unarmed, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</p> <p>The reaction to the deaths of Bone and Hughes shows there is still shock attached to the murder of police officers in the line of duty. Guns remain a rare commodity on Britain's streets.</p>",
  "<p>If your job search consists only of applying to advertised vacancies, you're likely to be missing out on many other opportunities \u2013 as well as unnecessarily lengthening the process.</p> <p>This type of job seeking \u2013 though it might make you feel you're being proactive \u2013 can only get your application into the same pile as everyone else.

In most cases you won't need to include your CV (although you can include links to your personal site or LinkedIn profile).</p> <p><strong>Delivery is important</strong></p> <p>Letters are almost always opened, making them perhaps a better choice than an email. Alternatively, get inside help. If you already know someone within the company, you can ask them to hand-deliver your letter.</p> <p><strong>Example of a speculative application</strong></p> <p>First line \u2013 introduction and why you are writing. For example: \"I visited your stand at the Expo fair and was very interested to hear of your plans to expand into the Chinese market.\"</p> <p>What you offer (include a relevant achievement if possible): \"Following my graduation, I spent a couple of years in Beijing and Shanghai with the British-Chinese Chamber of Commerce helping to market a range of products. I learned first-hand the particular challenges of this market, but also the strategies that were successful. For example, through one campaign involving trade-fair participation and sponsorship, I helped secure a multi-million pound deal for a medical equipment manufacturer. \"</p> <p>Why you are interested: \"Since that time, I have maintained many links within China, and I'm eager to explore opportunities that would combine my marketing expertise and knowledge of the region.\"</p> <p>Call to action: \"I would be interested to discuss ways in which my skills could help drive your expansion into the Chinese market, and I look forward to hearing from you.\"</p> <p>Yours sincerely (name)</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>If 3D technology is ever going to become mainstream across both television and cinema then film director James Cameron will be one very important person to thank.</p> <p>The multiple Oscar-winner, who brought mega movie hits including The Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Titanic and Avatar to the big screen, is in the vanguard of 3D research and development most recently in sports with plans to shoot the biannual Ryder Cup in 3D and via his recent deep-sea exploration work in the seven-mile-deep Mariana Trench. He is also about to start shooting the next instalment of Avatar, which will of course be in 3D.</p> <p>The 62-year-old Canadian is best known as a director \u2013 he holds the record for the top two highest-grossing films ever with Avatar and Titanic \u2013 but he is also a crusading evangelist for 3D; he is part-owner and co-chairman of the Cameron Pace Group (CPG), a company that builds 3D rigs and 3D cameras both for Cameron's own productions as well as for a host of different broadcasters including National Geographic and ESPN. CPG recently created a China-based subsidiary to bring its expertise in 3D filming and production to one of the fastest-growing 3D markets in the world.</p> <p>\"All things are better in 3D,\" enthused Cameron backstage after a presentation about his dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench delivered at the IBC broadcast technology exhibition in Amsterdam. Navigating to the ocean's floor in a specially designed submersible built over seven years, Cameron filmed in 3D with nano-cameras developed by CPG that can be held in the palm of your hand and are able to withstand pressures of 16,000 psi at 36,000ft underwater. \"What's the point of setting the world's depth record if you don't shoot it in 3D?!\" quipped Cameron. In addition to being a film director and technology pioneer Cameron is also a keen adventurer and is a National Geographic explorer in residence.</p> <p>This month CPG will work for the first time with the UK pay TV operator BSkyB on the Ryder Cup, using 26 3D cameras for the bi-annual event this year staged in Chicago. This follows CPG partnering with ESPN on the Aspen, Co.-staged X Games over a number of years. \"Symbolically the deal with BSkyB shows that we are a go-to partner for Europe as well as in America and the idea is to get close to Sky in the UK and also to Sky in Germany and Italy as they roll out 3D,\" said Cameron.</p> <p>Cameron's allegiance to 3D is unswerving and he believes this style of filming will only increase in popularity among broadcasters because the modern 3D cameras can simultaneously broadcast a 2D feed, if necessary, and also the issue of viewers having to wear cumbersome glasses is close to being resolved. In fact at IBC there were prototypes of glasses-free 3D screens \u2013 TVs, smart phones and tablets \u2013 developed by Dolby Laboratories and Royal Philips Electronics that drew crowds. \"What will cause a breakthrough is the move to TV sets and other devices where you don't need to wear the glasses,\" said Cameron. \"That will cause the (adoption) curve to elbow up.\"</p> <p>Cameron also has a more personal agenda. \"Even a 3D movie like Avatar which is made for the cinema will enjoy the greater part of its lifespan on video seen on the home TV screen,\" said Cameron. \"We can't make movies in 3D fast enough to justify the wide adoption of 3D TVs so in my enlightened self-interest as a film-maker I want to see the broadcaster market expand rapidly so everyone is watching in 3D.\" Cameron believes that TV shows like CSI and Game of Thrones and other glossy TV dramas should all be shot in 3D. The idea is that the more programming there is in 3D, the more incentive there is for the consumer electronics companies to make 3D sets and other devices. \"It's a positive feedback loop,\" he explained.</p> <p>To support his 3D commitment, Cameron is working on three follow-up Avatar movies, all in 3D, of course. In fact, Avatar 2 is set to start shooting this autumn and could be in cinemas by 2015 and yes, Sigourney Weaver, who played the chain-smoking scientist who died at the end of the original Avatar, will be back for Avatar 2. According to Cameron, one of the biggest problems with getting TV productions shot in 3D is the higher cost, but he says that although 3D shoots can be 20% to 30% higher on a single-programme shoot, that for a bigger, multiple-episode TV series these costs fall to only 2% to 3% more than a standard 2D shoot.</p> <p>\"For Avatar there was no additional camera shooting in 3D,\" said Cameron. \"Most of Avatar was one camera or two cameras if we were blowing something up. But most of it was one camera handheld on my shoulder or on a dolly or a steady cam. And that is basically the same way a scripted series is shot: two shots, two overs, two close ups and then you move on.\"</p> <p>Cameron calls TV drama series the \"low-hanging fruit\" for 3D development. \"Where you get into big additional costs in 3D is when you add the visual effects,\" said Cameron citing Martin Scorsese's 3D kids fantasy Hugo and Ang Lee's forthcoming Life of Pi, both of which have lots of computer-generated images or CGI.</p> <p>China is one market where Cameron sees very big 3D potential. CPG has recently opened a China branch for both 3D cinema and TV productions. He says the China business will likely double the size of CPG over the next year because there is such huge demand there, with a new 3D screen cinema opening almost one a day. \"China is adding new TV channels in 3D every day. They want to take 3D to scale as rapidly as we can do it. We've been working to be able to do hundreds of hours of 3D at CPG but now we are working to be able to do 6,000 to 7,000 hours of 3DTV because of China.\" In China, Avatar, Titanic and Transformers \u2013 all in 3D \u2013 are the three highest-grossing titles, said Cameron. \"The Chinese audience loves 3D. They see it as a premium brand and they are very brand conscious now as they flex their economic muscle.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by <strong>Chris Atkins</strong>, the man who made the <em>Starsuckers</em> documentary. His team fed fake celebrity stories to the tabloids, six of which ended up in print.</em></p> <p><em>This is somewhat longer than usual, but the devil really is in the detail of the exchanges at the Leveson inquiry when reporters were questioned about their actions. Atkins begins with the performance of Gordon Smart, who runs The Sun's showbusiness pages, entitled Bizarre...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396361600\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348041842373/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Two of our fake stories appeared without checks in Smart's column - one about film director Guy Ritchie injuring himself while juggling cutlery, and another claiming singer Sarah Harding [of Girls Aloud] was a secret fan of quantum physics. </p> <p>Smart started off bullishly at the inquiry by defending his column: \"I'd like to think that most of the time we get it right. Very occasionally we get it wrong.\"</p> <p>Robert Jay (the inquiry's counsel): \"If you don't know the identity of the source, how are you able to satisfy yourself that the source is reliable?\"</p> <p>Smart: \"I'll always ask where the story comes from\u2026 if it's a ring-in, which sometimes happens \u2013 people with phone tips \u2013 I'll be very rigorous about where they come from and how they have the information... our first obligation is to make sure the story is correct.\"</p> <p>Asked what proportion of his stories were substantiated, Smart said: \"The lead on Bizarre, and the second lead, we'll always make sure they're checked out.\" (The Sarah Harding story was a lead). </p> <p>Jay challenged Smart about the <em>Starsuckers</em> hoaxes: \"Both of these stories ended up in The Sun, although it happened neither was true.\"</p> <p>Smart's response was astonishing: \"Well, I would disagree that they weren't true.\"</p> <p>Watching live online I thought I couldn't be hearing this correctly \u2013 was he going to tell a judge that that the fictional stories I had invented were real? </p> <p>Yes, he was. Smart claimed, on oath, that the two stories were factually true, even though I had made both of them up. He said: \"My member of staff rang the PR and checked it out\u2026 I think I put a call in at the time.\" </p> <p>Dealing with the Guy Ritchie fiction, he argued that such stories about celebrities being silly are so unimportant they aren't worth verifying, despite this being the raison d'\u00eatre of his entire column.</p> <p>Smart said: \"I managed to corroborate the fact that he was drunk and misbehaving, so one or two paragraphs about the juggling cutlery part I thought was really trivial.\"</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson intervened to ask what was on everyone's lips: \"It might be said that the whole thing is trivial and why publish any of it?\"</p> <p>Smart, completely missing Leveson's point, replied: \"I share your frustration, I find it incredible that we're discussing this.\"</p> <p>Leveson: \"Actually, what we're discussing is the suggestion someone deliberately made up a story and phoned you up and then it appeared in the newspaper. I don't think that's entirely trivial. Do you?\"</p> <p>Smart executed what's known in the trade as a reverse ferret: \"No, I don't, and we take it seriously. We called the PR, we checked it out, and he said he had no issue with the story. He said: \"It wouldn't surprise me at all if she had a book like that.\"</p> <p>A PR allowing a bit of free publicity is a long way from the high level of factual rigour that Smart insisted lay behind all his journalism moments earlier.</p> <p>Smart had also previously told the inquiry that he would always call the celebrity if it was a lead story (which the Harding physics tale was). </p> <p>Moving on to the Ritchie story, Smart claimed that he had checked with the restaurant that Ritchie was drunk and misbehaving, but again seemed reticent to check the bit that made it newsworthy \u2013 the juggling of cutlery. Here's the exchange between Smart and Jay:</p> <p>Smart: \"I didn't really want to hassle him [Guy Ritchie] at the time.\"</p> <p>Jay: \"We know the bit about the juggling cutlery was untrue don't we?\"</p> <p>Smart: \"You could argue that, yes.\"</p> <p>Jay: \"You're not saying it is true are you?\"</p> <p>Smart: \"We don't know.\"</p> <p>It's worth pointing out again that I made up the story about Ritchie. He was in that restaurant, but I invented the rest. It wasn't true. Yet Smart continued valiantly to argue on oath that it was.</p> <p>Smart: \"Maybe I'll give Mr Ritchie a ring afterwards and ask what precisely\u2026\"</p> <p>At this point, Lord Justice Leveson, exasperated with this nonsensical argument, cut him off.</p> <p>Leveson: \"It would be quite a remarkable coincidence if Mr Atkins invented a story that sounds bizarre and it happened to be true. That would be remarkable.\"</p> <p>Smart was unrepentant, clearly living in an alternate universe where, if a made-up story gets printed in his newspaper, it magically becomes true: \"It is bizarre. That's the name of the column.\"</p> <p>Despite having an oxymoronic name, it would be wrong to put Gordon Smart in the same bracket as the journalists who hacked phones and bribed policemen. </p> <p>I would suggest that the reason our fabricated stories flew into his column without checks is the sheer volume of material he has to put out. He revealed to the inquiry how much showbiz news he is expected to generate: \"On average, I'll write 10 stories a day, so over a week 60 stories, 3,000 stories a year.\" </p> <p>In his position, I doubt I would have the time to check facts either.</p> <h2>The medical records investigation</h2> <p>The more serious allegations in <em>Starsuckers</em> occurred in the medical records investigation, where reporters from the News of the World, The People and the Sunday Mirror met me to negotiate the purchase of medical records.</p> <p>The Sunday Mirror journalist, Nick Owens, was the reporter who crossed the line the furthest, and in the film can be seen offering me money to get his hands on the medical records of several celebrities. </p> <p>When he appeared at the inquiry, Owens started badly and got steadily worse. David Barr (counsel for the inquiry) was able to refer to the transcript of the secretly filmed meeting between myself and Owens. </p> <p>Barr began at the point where Owens explained to me how the Press Complaints Commission's public interest requirement for health stories could be overridden if the celebrity was famous enough.</p> <p>He told me: \"You take Fern Britton. She's on the front of the papers, she had a gastric band. That was a big story\u2026 because she had said in public many times that she had got a huge keep fit regime and all that shit. Turned out to be wrong. There's a public interest in reporting that story.</p> <p>\"What there probably isn't a public interest in doing is just reporting that someone had a gastric band operation\u2026 Unless they are a massively big name, then you might make a decision.\"</p> <p>Asked by Barr to explain, Owens replied: \"What was happening here was that this was an informal meeting between myself and Mr Atkins and we were discussing information which did not lead to any story being published... I was simply engaging with him and trying to get to the bottom of what it was he had to say.\"</p> <p>Barr: \"At at this stage you are telling Mr Atkins, aren't you, that the public interest doesn't matter if the name is big enough?\"</p> <p>Owens: \"That's not what I was saying to him, that's certainly not the impression I would want to give.\"</p> <p>Barr then questioned Owens on the general point of whether or not he should have even been listening to the confidential medical information, given that none of it had an inherent public interest. </p> <p>During our meeting I read out a list of (fake) operations that high profile celebrities had undertaken. The Data Protection Act is very clear \u2013 even verbally imparting private information constitutes a breach, unless there is an obvious public interest.</p> <p>Barr: \"You thought it was okay to be told what confidential information there might be?\"</p> <p>Owens: \"I thought it was okay to listen to what he had to say... I can't really help listening to what he had to say to me.\"</p> <p>In further testimony, Barr repeatedly quoted Owens's filmed statements to me in which he offered cash to obtain medical records. In response, Owens claimed he was merely conducting a general discussion. </p> <p>Owens then tried a new gambit that was even more ridiculous than his \"general discussions\" defence: \"When you meet people, you have to listen and go along to a certain extent about the things they're saying, just to keep their interest.\"</p> <p>In other words, he began to venture that it was he who was engaged in a fiendishly cunning plan to expose me as someone willing to sell medical records.</p> <p>He told the inquiry: \"As I've made clear in my statement, newspapers do often investigate and expose people that are involved in something we believe to be wrong. </p> <p>\"This was a guy... claiming he was going to get a young lady drunk so he could obtain information from her, and I felt at some point down the line, when I spoke to my news desk, as I've set out in my statement, we may want to expose what this guy was up to.\"</p> <h2>The demolition of an idiotic argument</h2> <p>I'm sure I saw Barr smile at this point, relishing the impending demolition of such an idiotic argument: \"Let's examine that a little bit. You've told us that, in fact, you set off to meet Mr Atkins without talking to your news desk?\"</p> <p>Owens: \"No, I said to them I was off to meet someone.\"</p> <p>Barr: \"And you didn't record this conversation?\"</p> <p>Owens: \"No.\"</p> <p>Barr: \"So you plainly didn't have a sting in mind when you embarked upon the inquiry.\"</p> <p>Digging further into absurdity, Owens produces what he clearly believes to be his trump card: \"Towards the end of the meeting, he refers again to the fact that he's going to go and get her [a nurse] a little bit drunk, I feel that it just underlines the very odd situation that I was in there with this chap. </p> <p>\"You know, he was claiming that he was going to get somebody drunk so he could get information. By the end of the meeting, he referred to it again and I went away thinking that we may need to expose he was doing.\"</p> <p>Lord Justice Leveson, his voice dark with warning, weighed in at this point: \"You think it's a proper construction of this conversation, do you?\"</p> <p>Some sense of self-preservation kicked in for Owens, who obviously did not want to face a perjury charge: \"I'm not able to recall whether it's a proper construction or not.\"</p> <p>Barr and Leveson greeted this preposterous argument with the derision it<br>deserved. Leveson later sought a response from Owens' bosses, and sent a list of<br>questions about the reporter's actions to Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver (who has since departed from the paper).</p> <p>She admitted: \"I don't think Mr Owens acted wisely and made some ill-judged comments. Given that Mr Owens did nothing with the information provided by Mr Atkins I do not believe his actions constituted a breach of the code. I emphasise that I would not have published the story.\"</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> Law lecturer <strong>Damian Carney</strong> proposes the setting up of a new regulatory body for the press providing strong remedies for complainants, with enough independence from government and industry to appease the public</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.

  "<p>The new director general of the BBC has vowed to place more female presenters on the news following criticism by news presenter Fiona Bruce that going grey was off-limits for women on screen.</p> <p>George Entwistle said he was \"sorry that she feels that she has to say that\" and that he would make sure that women, including older women \"get the right opportunities and are given the space they deserve\".</p> <p>\"The key here is to take every opportunity that arises, whenever there is a possibility of putting in a new female presenter in to do jobs in the news, we should look for it and take it if we can,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>But newsreaders such as Huw Edwards or George Alagiah have nothing to fear from a new wave of positive discrimination as Entwistle said he wasn't going to \"remedy one inequity by indulging in another, turfing out a whole load of blokes who might be doing their job brilliantly with a view to getting women in\".</p> <p>He was responding to remarks made by Bruce in an interview in Reader's Digest this week, in which she admitted that she dyes her hair as a BBC newsreader.</p> <p>\"Age is definitely an issue for women in TV. So far, it hasn't been for me, but I know I need to make the best of myself. For instance, I have a few grey hairs. I dye them. I don't let my grey hair show when I'm reading the news,\" said Bruce.</p> <p>\"Of course, we wouldn't even be having this conversation if I was a 48-year-old man. I used to get cross about that, but what's the point? I'm never going to change things on my own. If age does become an issue, I'll deal with it,\" she added.</p> <p>Entwistle, who began in his new role as director general this week, argued that the BBC was taking steps to redress the imbalance and pointed to grey-haired Mary Beard, the Cambridge academic who presented BBC2's Meet the Romans as a shining example of the BBC's efforts to find jobs for older women.</p> <p>Beard, who has long grey hair, has been attacked by TV critic AA Gill who said she \"really should be kept away from the cameras altogether\". The BBC director general told Today's John Humphrys: \"She is delightfully unbothered, as indeed are we, about the colour of her hair.\"</p> <p>\"The truth about the BBC in this question of making sure that women, all women and older women, get the right opportunities and are given the space they deserve to have,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are in the process, everybody in the BBC is thinking about this and trying to move in the right direction,\" he said.</p> <p>In the same interview, Entwistle apologised about the BBC's much-criticised diamond jubilee pageant, which prompted thousand of complaints. \"It was disappointing and I would he happy to add my apologies to those already articulated by BBC people, particularly about the factual mistakes.</p> <p>\"We were genuinely thrown out of our stride by the weather ... we had hoped of course to spend more time among the boats on the river. We had lost touch with audio feeds and camera feeds at times \u2026 and that meant the balance of the show changed and the tone went wrong. I agree with that \u2013 I would be the first to admit it.\"</p> <p>Entwistle, who earns \u00a3450,000 a year, also admitted that BBC executive pay had gone out of control.</p> <p>\"I agree that BBC executive pay got too high \u2026 my salary for the job I've just started is markedly lower than my predecessors ... It's not far off half what my predecessor's was at its height,\" he said, referring to Mark Thompson who at one point was earning \u00a3617,000 a year.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Yahoo has completed a long-awaited $7.6bn (\u00a34.7bn) deal to sell back its 40% stake in China's Alibaba Group, generating a windfall that could help ease the pain of Yahoo shareholders who have endured the company's foibles during the past few years.</p> <p>After Yahoo distributes most of the proceeds to its shareholders, its newly hired chief executive, Marissa Mayer, will still have an extra $1.3bn to finance acquisitions or hire new talent as she tries revive the company's revenue growth.</p> <p>Tuesday's resolution comes four months after Yahoo and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd outlined the details of a complex transaction that has taken more than two years of on-again, off-again negotiations to hammer out. The deal will give Alibaba \u2013 a privately-owned company which owns China's version of eBay and a number of e-commerce sites \u2013 greater autonomy as it looks toward a stock market flotation in the next three years.</p> <p>But it is also rewards Yahoo for one of the few moves that has gone right for the troubled company in the past few years. It paid $1bn for a 40% stake in Alibaba in 2005, and is now reaping a huge return.</p> <p>Alibaba is paying $7.1bn in cash and stock to buy back half of Yahoo's holdings. Another $550m is being paid to Yahoo under a revised technology and patent licensing agreement with Alibaba. After taxes, Yahoo estimates it will pocket about $4.3bn, to add to the $1.9bn in cash the company had as of 30 June.</p> <p>Yahoo plans to spend about $3bn of the Alibaba proceeds buying back its own stock in the upcoming months, leaving Mayer with some financial flexibility to pay for other items on her turnaround agenda.</p> <p>\"This yields a substantial return for investors, while retaining a meaningful amount of capital within the company to invest in future growth,\" Mayer said in a statement.</p> <p>The decision on how to handle the proceeds may have reflected a compromise between Mayer and Yahoo's board.</p> <p>Before hiring Mayer away from Google in July, Yahoo had pledged to distribute virtually all of the proceeds from the Alibaba sale to its shareholders.</p> <p>But the company wavered from that stance last month when it filed regulatory documents disclosing that Mayer was considering holding on to the money to help carry out her vision for Yahoo. Without providing specifics, the documents said Mayer was mulling possible acquisitions. </p> <p>Analysts think Mayer may try to make a big splash by putting together a takeover offer for one of the hottest websites, such as online scrapbook Pinterest or check-in service Foursquare, in order to enhance its offering to users. The latter was previously the subject of rumours of a Yahoo takeover in 2010 when the company was headed by Carol Bartz, but nothing came of it. </p> <p>Another big payoff looms for Yahoo when Alibaba goes public, an event expected by the end of 2015. Alibaba has the right to buy back half of Yahoo's remaining 23% stake before the IPO. Yahoo then could choose to sell its remaining Alibaba stock after the shares begin trading.</p> <p>Alibaba currently has a market value of about $40bn, based on the prices paid for the stock the company recently sold to raise enough money to finance the Yahoo deal. Yahoo, in contrast, has a market value of less than $20bn, and is seeing its revenue base eroded as Facebook and Twitter suck up the advertising revenue it had relied on.</p> <p>A big chunk of Yahoo's value remains locked up in Alibaba. Based on Alibaba's market value and the preferred shares it just picked up, Yahoo is still sitting on Alibaba stock worth about $8.9bn. That amount will increase if Alibaba is able to continue to thrive as more people in China get online access.</p> <p>\"The completion of this transaction begins a new chapter in our relationship with Yahoo,\" Alibaba CEO Jack Ma said in a statement.</p> <p>While Alibaba has been growing, Yahoo has been shrinking. The contraction has occurred even as the advertisers that provide most of Yahoo's revenue have been spending more money on the internet. Most of that online marketing has been flowing to internet search leader Google and, to a lesser extent, Facebook.</p> <p>Yahoo's financial funk has depressed its stock for years, increasing the pressure on the company's management to extract money from its Alibaba investment to reward its shareholders.</p> <p>Since beginning its discussions with Alibaba in 2010, Yahoo has had five CEOs, including two interim leaders. The deal had already been agreed upon in May, while Yahoo was being run by Ross Levinsohn, who left shortly after the company hired Mayer in July.</p> <p>Although Mayer is highly regarded in the internet industry, investors still seem sceptical about whether she can find a way to energise a company and staff that has seemed stuck in a downward spiral for years \u2013 and to pump up a stock that has been stuck below $20 for the past four years. The stock was trading at around $35 when Yahoo invested in Alibaba seven years ago.</p> <p>Yahoo shares added 22 cents, or 1.4%, to end Tuesday's session at $15.90. About the same level where the shares stood when Mayer took the helm. The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index has climbed 10% during the same period while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has risen by 8%.</p> <p>Buying back stock could boost Yahoo's stock by reducing the company's outstanding shares. With fewer shares trading, it will be easier for Yahoo to increase its earnings per share \u2013 one of the yardsticks that investors rely on to evaluate a company's value.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the great doomed rock bands, with their mayfly lives and drawn-out, highly profitable after-lives, few have a legend as potent and precisely defined as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/joydivision\" title=\"\">Joy Division</a>. They played their first concert in January 1978 and their last in May 1980. In that time they released two albums and a few other songs: a pop music close to unique in its icy, addictive bleakness. They wore stark, photogenic clothes and haunted the hollowed-out cities of a decaying northern England. Their singer, Ian Curtis, was so intense onstage that he had epileptic fits. The day before a pivotal first tour of the United States, he hanged himself. He was 23.</p> <p>This solemn version of the Joy Division story has endured for decades, periodically reinforced by authoritative accounts such as <em>Touching From a Distance</em>, a claustrophobic 1995 memoir by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/11/popandrock.joydivision\" title=\"\">Curtis's widow Deborah</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/118797/control\" title=\"\"><em>Control</em></a>, an acclaimed 2007 band biopic, shot in reverential black and white and directed by onetime Joy Division photographer Anton Corbijn; and finally, by all the musicians who have drawn from Joy Division's seemingly inexhaustible well of young male angst and moody looks and riffs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/peter-hook\" title=\"\">Peter Hook</a> was the band's bassist. Much louder and more melodic than in traditional rock, his tough-but-tender throb and hum was the heart of their sound. Since their demise, he has been a leading curator in the Joy Division heritage industry, and gives over a substantial part of this book to a list of every concert the band played, sometimes with a set list as well. Even the group's pre-history, as a less poised and original punk-influenced outfit called Warsaw, is lovingly detailed. Hook recalls his eager acceptance of a just-recorded live tape offered by the promoter of a Warsaw show, \"the start of what was to become a collecting obsession\". And when the author listens to it? \"What a great revelation \u2013 we were really good.\" The rock star as fan writer about his own band is not, you fear, going to be the most rewarding of literary enterprises.</p> <p>So it comes as a shock, and a welcome one, to discover quickly that the main project here is quite different. Hook wants to show his band's rise and fall as messier, more collective and more human than the usual Curtis-dominated Romantic parable. Thus, instead of Joy Division as a quartet of tragic heroes \u2013 \"Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,\" runs a much-cited Curtis lyric \u2013 Hook presents them as a gang of lippy, laddy northerners with a \"reputation for trouble\".</p> <p>There were frequent fights at their gigs: \"<em>All</em> of my mates were involved,\" he writes of one. \"Like a giant ball rolling up and down in front of us as we were playing \u2026 Which of course wound me up. So I started kicking these kids from the stage \u2026 kicking them in the head.\" To rehearse, the band used a disused mill near the centre of Manchester, \"decorated with cans of our piss because the toilet was miles away\". At shows by rival groups, \"We were <em>terrible</em> for nicking things \u2026 We used to [see] all this beautiful stuff backstage and nick it all.\"</p> <p>Hook writes with conversational glee about the scams and pranks that accompanied his band's sharp-elbowed rise to prominence. The anecdotes can get tiresome, but the picture they build, of a seedy, arty, aggro-fuelled, semi-derelict urban England \u2013 of Manchester, in particular, before being bohemian was city council-approved \u2013 is revealing and vivid. Meanwhile, the pen portraits of his bandmates have a surprising delicacy. Drummer Stephen Morris had a jazzy, educated style and comfortably-off parents with \"a koi-carp pond\". Guitarist Bernard Sumner was sly and self-contained, always finding a heater for himself for their freezing practice rooms. And Curtis was a chameleon: already married, but also \"one of the lads\"; a father, but also having an affair with a Belgian journalist; a pop star in the making, but also a devotee of the rock and literary avant garde. \"By the end,\" writes Hook with gruff astuteness, \"there were just too many Ians [for him] to cope with.\"</p> <p>Exhaustion also took a toll. Joy Division, for all the graveyard stillness of their record sleeves, were participants in a frenetic golden age for British pop, which had begun with punk in 1976 and would peak, commercially at least, with the British dominance of the American charts in 1983. Groups grew up fast and seized their moment, or disappeared. Yet Joy Division did not earn enough from their feverish touring and recording to give up their day jobs. Hook worked in the offices of the Manchester Ship Canal Company, Curtis at an employment exchange, and Sumner for a film company where&#xa0;his \"job was to colour in Danger&#xa0;Mouse\".</p> <p>Such weird, novelistic details freshen the story throughout. But for Curtis at least, the pressure of multiple lives became increasingly perilous. In 1980 his epilepsy worsened fast. Onstage, Hook remembers \"looking at Ian wondering if, or when, it was going to happen\". The fits left \"some of the audience laughing, some scared, some cheering\". Britain in the early 80s could be a pretty cruel, unthinking place. Meanwhile Curtis's lyrics, always melancholy, turned almost relentlessly morbid. With unsettling honesty, Hook tries to explain why the band did not see the crisis coming \u2013 or, if they did, do much to avert it. First, he rather jaw-droppingly admits: \"We never really looked at his lyrics.\" They could rarely hear them over the distorting roar of their crude practice and performance equipment; but also, the bandmates were increasingly \"little musical islands\", concentrating on their individual parts, which Joy Division's eccentric, dictatorial producer Martin Hannett \u2013 \"a wizard surrounded by [dope] smoke and in charge of his strange machines\" \u2013 isolated further into the group's lovely, lonely archipelago of sound. By the spring of 1980, that sound seemed ready to be played in stadiums, and the band, Curtis included, were reluctant to slow down. For what followed, concludes Hook, \"We're all of us to blame.\"</p> <p>As an attempt to rewrite the Joy Division legend, this uneven book succeeds only partially. For all the gritty new context and boisterous new&#xa0;stories here, Curtis still dominates. But Hook has restored a flesh-and-blood rawness to what was becoming a standard tale. Few pop music books manage that.</p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett's <em>When the Lights Went Out </em>is published by Faber.</p>",

The day before there had been harrowing reports that some 40 people were left to drown by security forces when a leaking tugboat carrying refugees bound for the US had sunk seven miles off the Cuban coast. The reports, vigorously denied by the government, gave focus and immediacy to a simmering discontent that finally spilled into the open. Rarely, if ever, had anyone heard such calls for an end to Fidel Castro's rule.</p> <p>But the defiance was charged with desperation. In the aftermath that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's economy had gone into a tailspin. With the loss of its primary trading partner, 80 per cent of Cuba's trade came to an end. So did the billions in Soviet economic aid. Overnight Cuba was plunged into a period of such hardship and deprivation that there were stories of people eating the animals at the Havana zoo. It was christened, in characteristic state speak, as the 'Special Period in the Time of Peace'. That was 22 years ago, and the 'Special Period' is still in full effect. The uprising on the Malecon, although brief, was taken as a wake-up call by the leadership.</p> <p>Today, Cuba is at a crossroads. Caught in the opposing tensions of economic survival on one hand and adherence to its socialist revolution on the other, the country is embarking on a process that will either salvage the meaning of socialism, or bequeath the country to those who are waiting, once and forever, to bury the ideals of its revolution.</p> <p>It's not a new problem.</p> <p>Cuba, sheltered for so long under the umbrella of its Soviet protector, is among the last in a long string of socialist states that have had to confront the failures of centrally planned economies in the age of capital. But Cuba is utterly determined not to fall prey to the free-market fictions that led to such wreckage in Russia and in all those former Eastern Bloc countries that had been lured down the capitalist path.</p> <p>Cuba is taking a different route \u2013 one that seeks to reconcile socialist ideals with enterprise. Slowly, reluctantly, Cuba's leaders, spearheaded by Fidel's brother, Ra\u00fal Castro, are flirting with the market. They are relaxing the stranglehold of the state on the private economy. They are restructuring large swathes of Cuba's agricultural sector. They are devolving a measure of economic planning and control to municipalities. They are allowing the emergence \u2013 very limited to be sure \u2013 of private enterprise. But most interesting of all, they are paying serious attention to the role of co-operatives in transforming the Cuban economy.</p> <h2><strong>Co-op autonomy is key</strong></h2> <p>I was in Cuba as part of a Canadian delegation of co-operators that had come to learn what this transition to a co-op economy meant and to offer what support we could. It was my second trip to the country and I could immediately see the differences. There were caf\u00e9s, restaurants and small businesses everywhere. Fruit stalls and craft markets abounded. Havana was brimming with entrepreneurial life. Nevertheless, my own feelings about the new direction were mixed \u2013 a combination of sympathy with the stated goals of the effort, and misgivings about whether the particular brand of socialist ideas \u2013 and practices \u2013 that govern Cuba's political realities were at odds with the task.</p> <p>Can co-operatives save socialism in Cuba? Or will they suffer the fate of co-ops in other countries where they were used to serve the needs of the state rather than those of the citizenry? This was the question in my mind. In every case where governments have sought to bend co-operatives to state interests, three results have followed: a hollowing out of co-op principles and the reduction of co-ops to mere extensions of the government; the ultimate failure of these enterprises and a dependence on the state; and the defamation of the co-op model which came to be seen, quite correctly, as a means of state control. In the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, co-operatives have yet to salvage their reputation. Will this happen in Cuba?</p> <p>After the revolution and the expropriation of the big agricultural estates, co-operatives were viewed through a Soviet lens, as a way to achieve large-scale production through state-controlled collectivization. As a result, co-operation as a form of mutual self-help, independent from the state, is little understood \u2013 either by the state or the populace. Co-operatives are still viewed as a means of helping the government solve the failures of a command economy. But the questions of co-op autonomy and open markets are the keys that will determine whether co-ops will play the role that is hoped for them, or whether they will survive at all.</p> <p>Cuba's newfound affection for co-operatives is entirely understandable. Faced with the enormity of the economic challenges, the leadership realizes that something has to change. In sector after sector, inefficiencies and dysfunctions are staggering. In a country whose prime challenge is to feed its people, 50 per cent of the state-owned arable land is uncultivated and unproductive. Only 18 per cent of the land is irrigated. Since 1989, agricultural exports have declined from 80 per cent to 18 per cent of the national economy. The agricultural question is paramount in Cuba and it is here that much of the focus on co-operatives lies.</p> <p>In 2008 the government sought to improve agriculture production by turning state farms into co-operatives. These co-ops, called UBPCs, were turned over to the farm workers to own and operate under a lease arrangement with the state. But unlike co-ops that had been organized by independent farmers to share land, farm equipment and labour, many of these state-mandated co-ops floundered. There was no effort to teach former state employees how to run a co-op, no experience in managing an independent enterprise, no choice over where co-ops could purchase supplies, or what they could produce, or to whom they could sell their produce. Supplies were bought from state departments, quotas still had to be sold to state agents. And if a co-op wanted to pursue a new business that was not mandated in its charter, it could not do so. In short, the co-ops were hamstrung by a closed market system dominated by the state.</p> <p>But lessons are being learned. Constraints are being lifted and a more open system may emerge for co-ops to access supplies and sell produce independently. Comprehensive co-op training is underway across the country.</p> <h2><strong>Slow motion demolition</strong></h2> <p>Housing is another sector in deep trouble. When the 'Special Period' came, 80 per cent of skilled labour abandoned the farms and fled to the cities. A major housing crisis followed. In Havana today, 11,000 people are living in shelters. Almost 120,000 people are on waiting lists for housing. In all cases, including those who own their homes, people live in housing that is crumbling into the ground. This is why a visit to Havana can be such a heartbreaking experience. How to reconcile such elegance with the corrosion and decay that eats away at these colonial buildings that now linger, ghost-like, from another era? In Havana, an average of 3.1 buildings collapse every day. The graceful old city is caught in something like a demolition progressing in slow motion.</p> <p>Housing is clearly one area where co-operatives could play a crucial role. Others include the provision of much-needed social services \u2013 like childcare and services to the elderly and the disabled. What is still lacking, however, is a legal framework to allow for such collective and civic forms of property. It is rumoured that co-op legislation will be introduced in 2013. But unless these co-ops can independently access labour, capital and supplies it is hard to see how they could function as autonomous enterprises. This is even truer in sectors like light industry where the government hopes co-ops can kick-start new enterprises.</p> <p>Cuba has to marry the market freedoms that are the precondition for co-operative enterprises with the controlling reflexes of an anxious \u2013 not to say paranoid \u2013 state. Not that the paranoia is unfounded \u2013 only that it is unhelpful. The threats that crowd Cuba are very real and very obvious. The bellicosity of the US shows no sign of letting up. Expatriate fanatics still nurse their revenge fantasies from nearby Florida. And there are other, more subtle dangers.</p> <p>The 'Special Period' now comprises 40 per cent of the time since the 1959 revolution. An entire generation has grown up knowing nothing else. A survival mentality has taken hold that corresponds to what is essentially a war economy of scarcity and subsistence. It is a corrosive environment that breeds individualism and alienation, and undermines the social solidarity that is, in the final analysis, the last refuge of the revolution.</p> <h2><strong>Socialism was always a top-down affair</strong></h2> <p>The opening of new sectors like tourism and the adoption of a parallel dollar currency in the 1990s created new class divisions that separated those who had access to dollars from those who didn't. Moreover, decades of state paternalism have ingrained socialism as a philosophy imposed from above. As one Cuban economist told me: 'Socialism was always a top-down affair. It never developed as a change in the mutual relations among people at the level of community.'</p> <p>Co-ops are a key to making this possible.</p> <p>The political leadership today clearly understands what is at stake. Ra\u00fal Castro and his allies know that if the revolution is to have a legacy beyond them, change has to come and that they are its stewards. Despite the hardships and the discontent, the old revolutionaries still retain an allegiance from their people. The ideals of the revolution remain vital. But there are fears that those that come after will lack the moral authority to drive the changes that a new era demands. They are profound and mark a turning point for the country.</p> <p>Gone is the egalitarianism that Ra\u00fal Castro now says fostered a pervasive idleness that is distinctly unrevolutionary. Gone are the massive subsidies that propped up the state enterprises. They are required to earn their way or perish. Gone too is the use of government sinecures to absorb unemployment and to dispense patronage favours. The state intends to lay off 1.3 million workers in a system where the government, directly or indirectly, employs 85 per cent of the population. Where will these people go?</p> <p>Cuba's leaders hope that a combination of co-operative restructuring and independent entrepreneurship will take up the slack. Without further measures to free the economy from state controls this is not likely. But beyond this, there looms what is perhaps the single greatest threat to reform in Cuba \u2013 the state bureaucracy. For the thousands of functionaries that handle the patronage networks of the state and its enterprises, reform can only mean trimming back the powers that bestow their status and livelihoods. They will resist change at every turn.</p> <p>Ultimately, the future of socialism in Cuba rests on its leaders accepting that society is not the state and that the interests of the two are not the same. The survival of socialism depends on finding economic models that marry the ideals of solidarity and equity and social justice with that of open markets and free people. Co-operatives are a natural choice but it will take additional risk from its leadership and a trust in their people to make this bold experiment work.</p> <p>Despite the enormity of the challenge, and the grip the old socialist ideas still have on the political imagination, there is an unbounded pride in Cuba born of struggle and endurance against impossible odds.</p> <p>Cubans are survivors. They are resourceful and innovative, and among the most educated people in Latin America. Given the chance, they have created thousands of enterprises everywhere in the small spaces and crannies opened up by the new freedoms. And if Cuba's leaders can place their trust in their people, and in the endurance of the ideals they have fought so hard to protect, the co-operative economy they hope to build might yet forge a new kind of civic socialism for a world in desperate need of new visions.</p> <p><em>John Restakis is executive director of the </em><a href=\"http://bcca.coop/\" title=\"\"><em>BC Co-operative Association</em></a><em> in Vancouver and has been active in the co-op movement as a researcher, educator, writer and advocate for 20 years.

  "<p>Anti-poverty campaigners have hailed a <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/18/uk-eu-transparency-idUKBRE88H0L720120918\" title=\"\">vote on Tuesday by a European parliamentary committee</a> requiring EU oil, gas, mining and timber companies to publish their payments to foreign governments.</p> <p>They say the move brings Europe a step closer to putting a spotlight on payments worth billions of euros by extractive companies to governments, which have until now remained secret, allowing corrupt officials to pocket natural resource revenues.</p> <p>Parliamentary representatives will now negotiate with member states before a final version of the directive goes to all MEPs for a European parliamentary vote later in the year.</p> <p>\"I'm pleased the committee has overwhelmingly backed my compromises for a strong law on transparency and disclosure for the extractive industries,\" said Arlene McCarthy, a British Labour MEP and lead legislator on the transparency law, after Tuesday's vote in the legal affairs committee.</p> <p>\"We haven't given in to the pressure of industry and government lobbying for a weak transparency regime. We're insisting on project-by-project reporting with a low threshold of \u20ac80,000 for payment disclosure. We refused to accept exemptions which would create large loopholes in the law,\" she said. \"The vote was a clear rejection of the 27 EU member states' weak proposals for disclosure of country-by-country payments and reporting in the extractive industries.\"</p> <p>McCarthy said the vote gave MEPs a strong negotiating mandate to force member states and the European commission to accept parliament's amendments, putting the world on track to create strong global transparency standards with equivalent rules in the EU and the US. However, she criticised Conservative MEPs for failing to back the measure. \"This is another U-turn by Conservatives, reneging on Prime Minister David Cameron's call on Europe to bring forth country and project reporting,\" she said.</p> <p>Advocacy groups warmly welcomed the vote by the European parliament's legal affairs committee. Laura Taylor, <a href=\"http://www.tearfund.org/\" title=\"\">Tearfund</a>'s head of public policy, said: \"As many mining, oil and gas projects are in developing countries, this will ultimately lead to a better deal for the people who are currently in poverty but who are quite literally living on top of their country's wealth. When people are better informed they are able to hold their authorities to account and see resources released for development instead of being lost to corruption. This could mean essential services like clean water, healthcare and education, and help to reduce long-term dependency on aid.\"</p> <p>In 2009, exports of oil, gas and minerals from Africa were worth about five times the value of international aid to the continent ($246bn against $49bn), according to <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/library/extractive-sector-transparency-why-eu-needs-strong-set-rules\" title=\"\">Global Witness</a>, yet the wealth from natural resources is concentrated in the hands of the few \u2013 depriving benefits for the many in what has become known as the \"resource curse\".</p> <p>\"The European parliament has truly reset the debate on transparency in the EU, so now it's all eyes on member states to rubberstamp the rules,\" said Eloise Todd, Brussels director of <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/?p=9667\" title=\"\">ONE</a>. \"The details really matter. Getting them wrong would leave millions in the developing world in the dark about what happens to the billions of dollars their governments received for oil and mining deals. Getting them right means local people can hold their governments to account and ensure the money goes to building schools and hospitals, not mansions and limousines for the chosen few.\"</p> <p>Nigeria's corruption agency says $300bn-$400bn has been stolen or wasted over the last 50 years and campaigners say the Democratic Republic of the Congo received only $86,000 in mineral rights in 2006, despite an estimated $1bn of mineral exports each year.</p> <p>But Javier Pereira, policy officer at Eurodad (European Network on Debt and Development) injected a note of caution. \"Despite today's promising progress, there is still a long way to go to ensure that this legislation effectively combats issues of corruption that keep people in developing countries in a cycle of poverty,\" he said. \"Tax dodging is not easily defeated, so companies should be required to report additional information like sales volumes, assets and profits to put their payments into context. EU governments must now raise the bar by adopting a strong proposal, which should be at least in line with the recently implemented US rules.\"</p> <p>The committee's position is similar to the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) rules adopted in August in four key areas. It reaffirms the principle of project-by-project reporting for large private and public listed European oil, gas, mining and logging companies; proposes a definition of project based on \"activities governed by a single contract, licence, lease, concession or similar legal agreement with a government upon which payment liabilities arise\"; deletes the exemption for companies reporting in countries where criminal law prohibits disclosure \u2013 the SEC said such an exemption would be \"inconsistent with the statute and would encourage countries to adopt laws specifically prohibiting the required disclosure\"; and proposes a minimum payment threshold of \u20ac80,000, almost identical to the SEC minimum of $100,000.</p>",

So much was already known \u2013 a longer, larger (yet not wider) screen, thinner body, a new connector offering instant obsolescence for hundreds of accessories \u2013 that its Tom Daley-like lack of splash was declared, in this Olympic year, to lack enough of the technology motto citius, grandior, vilius (faster, bigger, cheaper) \u2013 even if it is the first two.</p> <p>Like statisticians poring over Olympic outcomes, they declared too that it didn't break any records \u2013 not the biggest screen, not the world's thinnest phone, not packing the most features. But as anyone who watched the Games would tell you, it's not the record-breaking that matters; it's the experience.</p> <p>That starts when you hold it: raw specifications (18% thinner than last year's 4S, 20% lighter, 12% less volume) don't explain how it seems to float in the hand, and how typing or swiping feels like touching the very pixels. (New processes have removed one layer of glass from the touchscreen.) The tactile pleasure is second only to Nokia's beguilingly curved (and largely overlooked) Lumia 800. And while the 4in screen is longer, but not wider (enough for six rows of icons rather than five), you can still swipe across it with your thumb, unlike giants such as Samsung's whopping 4.8in Galaxy S3. </p> <h2>Software and services, not just specs</h2> <p>In truth, it's the software that makes this phone amazing. In a world dominated by \"specifications\" \u2013 how fast, how far, how many, many commentators think the Olympics of smartphones is measured, like a race, by how fast you do things. Does this phone run at 1.6 GHz and that one at 1.61GHz? Award the medal! </p> <p>What photos and specifications can't tell you is what it's like to hold in your hand. While Apple can show you endless photos and promo videos (and critics can endlessly snort at how feeble its measurements are compared with bigger rivals), it's only by picking it up do you understand what Sir Jonathan Ive is on about. He speaks in his quietly rapturous tones about \"chamfered edges\" and \"unique object\" \u2013 and \"seamlessly\". (And \"aluminium\", correctly.)</p> <p>The first surprise is that it's really light, making the year-old iPhone 4S feel like a paperweight. There's also a subtle friction to the edges and the metal back that makes it far less likely to slip from your grasp (a complaint often made of the iPhone 4 and 4S). </p> <p>Next, although the screen is longer (4in diagonally rather than the 4S's 3.5in; 1136x640 pixels, compared with the 4S's 960x640, both at 326ppi), fitting in six rows of icons instead of five, you can still operate it by sweeping one thumb across the screen, from home button at the bottom to power switch at the top. </p> <p>Among smartphones, bigger screens abound, but most are compromised because as they grow, they need two hands to operate. Somehow Apple has evaded this pitfall. The HTC Titan, for example, with a 4.7in screen, is unusable because (like the iPhone) its power button is on the top; you can't hold a phone in your palm and still reach all the way across the top. (In contrast the Samsung Galaxy S3 \u2013 hereafter the SGS3 \u2013 has its power button near the top of the right-hand side, so you can work it.)</p> <p>Another element you can't see from the pictures: when you start typing, or swiping between apps, it feels as though you're touching the pixels; the production process has eliminated a layer of glass in the touchscreen. It's spooky at first; after only a short while other phones feel thick.</p> <h2>Down from the iCloud</h2> <p>For existing iPhone owners who have an iCloud account to which they have backed up their phone, there's a nice welcome that didn't exist last year. If you activate a new iPhone with that iCloud account, you can set it up with everything \u2013 including photos, apps, settings and passwords for email and calendars and Wi-Fi, and even details such as your alarm times. </p> <p>Everything is as it was on the old one, seamlessly. That's better than either Android or Windows Phone, the two principal contenders, which will download your apps but leave you to fill in the settings and recreate your alarms and app settings. </p> <p>Sure, you might not set up an iPhone more than once every couple of years \u2013 but having it work like this (new since last year, because iCloud backups were only introduced with the 4S) is a definite plus.</p> <h2>4G/LTE, battery life and signal level</h2> <p>In the UK, only Everything Everywhere (Orange/T-Mobile) will have <strong>4G connectivity</strong> at least until 2013, when 3 will have some of its 1800MHz spectrum. I couldn't test this as I was using an O2-enabled model (and couldn't just swap in my own Orange/T-Mobile SIM, because the iPhone 5 uses the new nano-SIM). The expectation is that it will offer connectivity of up to 100Mbps over long distances; if it does, it will transform the whole experience of using this phone and others like it, as you'll see.</p> <p>I couldn't directly compare <strong>signal reception</strong> of the 4S and 5 because the two models I was comparing were on different networks (Orange and O2), rendering any comparison moot.</p> <p><strong>Battery life</strong> on the iPhone 5 seemed better, though it wasn't possible in the time available to make a precise comparison. Apple is certainly promising more \u2013 225 hours' standby time on the iPhone 5 against 200 on the iPhone 4S, though that's still less than the 300 hours originally offered for the iPhone 4. But it's promising more 3G browsing and talk time (8 hours v 6 hours), plus 8 hours of LTE use \u2013 which is colossal, given that early versions of LTE chewed through battery life. By biding its time and not offering it last year, Apple may have given itself the best chance to benefit from 4G. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p> <p>The flipside \u2013 how quickly it charges, rather than discharges \u2013 is positive: the iPhone 5 is a power sponge, charging even more quickly than the 4S, which was no slouch itself.</p> <h2>Panoramic camera</h2> <p>The \"Panorama\" camera functionality is truly remarkable. Start moving the camera, take a picture, and it will keep going until you have a 28MP scene. Yes, other cameras have had panorama systems \u2013 including, yes, Samsung. Those limit you to staying in one place and moving the camera around. This is different: you can move yourself, you can move around or up and down and object, or whirl completely around \u2013 360 degrees of freedom. Then once you're done, the software stitches it together, with no fisheye distortion and no stitching. I tried circumnavigating a colleague's head, and whirling the phone around in a field: the results are really interesting. </p> <p>I anticipate devices to which you can strap a panorama-capturing iPhone that will keep steady, or macro pictures showing things in huge details. One <a href=\"https://twitter.com/counternotions/status/246113055463854080\">sardonic tweet</a> after the iPhone 5's introduction, looking at the billion-dollar valuation put on photo-sharing service Instagram by Facebook, said \"Don't call yourself an entrepreneur if you haven't yet formed your next startup, Panoramagram\". You laugh now. All I can say is: just wait. And if you make picture frames, expect some orders.</p> <h2>Maps and mapping</h2> <p>The news in May that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/may/11/apple-maps-io6-google\">Google was sidelined as the provider of maps for the iPhone</a> (in any phone that runs iOS 6, to be released later on Wednesday 19 September) caused a fair amount of hand-wringing and worry. Would it be as good? Or would it just use some in-between rubbish?</p> <p>Don't worry \u2013 it's very good. Here we need to distinguish between the maps themselves, and the maps app. The maps don't have all the highlighting of Google's, but the amount of detail such as road names seems to me greater. The 3D view (which you can yaw by sliding two fingers up or down on either end of the screen) is entertaining \u2013 more so if you turn on the satellite imagery \u2013 and you can also rotate the maps with two fingers, or bring them back to true north by tapping a compass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348005686940/maps-guardian-view.png\" alt=\"Guardian viewed on iPhone 5\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian offices in London viewed on the new iOS 6 software on the iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That all brings feature parity with Android \u2013 as does the introduction of turn-by-turn voice navigation, so that your satnav can now play music and make or receive phone calls.</p> <h2>Hello, Siri</h2> <p>What really catapults the iPhone 5 past its rivals is the combination of features and services. In particular Siri, the voice-driven \"assistant\", is transformed in the UK from something quite useful for sending texts or emails, or making phone calls without unlocking the phone, into a real virtual assistant. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348005839328/siri_on_football.png\" alt=\"Siri does football on iOS6\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri knows football scores on iOS6 running on the iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its new incarnation, Siri can find and book restaurants (or subvariants \u2013 you want Thai restaurants, it will find them) near you, tell you football scores, offer turn-by-turn navigation to anywhere, open apps (handy if your phone has so many you can't find them), post comments to Twitter or Facebook, and find film times and reviews. (It does other stuff too including weather forecasts and stock prices.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376926\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348006060594/siri_on_cricket.png\" alt=\"Siri can't do cricket\" width=\"230\" height=\"162\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri can't do everything: cricket flummoxes it still</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I've been using an iPhone for the past few months, after about a year only using Android phones, and found the earlier incarnation of Siri increasingly useful. For example on Monday I had to make a number of calls and send texts while driving. Sure, anyone can make voice-dialled calls with a Bluetooth headset. But write texts? From a locked screen? With a headphone/mic combination, I could. You dictate, Siri translates, reads it back, and will then send when you say \"send it\". </p> <p>But the new one is dramatically better. Here's why. Until this month, if you wanted to find a nearby restaurant, you'd have to unlock your phone, go to the browser, type in \"restaurants\", and hope that you'd get some related results in your search. Or you might have had an app like TopTable, where you'd still have to type in some details and wait for a response.</p> <p>With Siri now, you simply say \"Find Thai restaurants near here\". It thinks for a bit and comes back with a list. I tried this even in my rural location \u2013 and it offered six, five of which I didn't know existed. (Sadly, a Siri-driven restaurant reservation system is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico. Ay caramba!)</p> <p>Or you need to get directions to a location: you tell Siri \"give me directions to\u2026\" and, after some ruminating, it will transform into a satnav. So now you've got a satnav that can play music and make and take phone calls \u2013 it will interrupt those with directions as needed. (As a security note, it might be a good idea to use a different name for your home than \"Home\", just to avoid opportunist thieves navigating back to your house.)</p> <p>Siri is voice control done right, because you don't need to think about the context of what you're asking; you simply give the command and it works it out. True, it doesn't transcribe everything perfectly, but then typing on a keyboard isn't perfect either. It will do football results (and it doesn't think that's American football), so \"what are the football results from this weekend\" gives you the Premier League results. Or you can be specific \u2013 \"did Tottenham Hotspur win?\" (But nothing's perfect: \"did Spurs win\" gives you details of some American football team, and for now, at least, rugby and cricket fans are out of luck.)</p> <h2>Video</h2> <p>The iPhone 5 gets a rear camera capable of 1080p video recording, during which you can also shoot stills. (Some Android phones, including the SGS3, have had this for a while.) The front-facing camera gets 720p recording, and FaceTime \u2013 Apple's video call protocol \u2013 works on both Wi-Fi and mobile, if your carrier allows it.</p> <h2>Do Not Disturb, and other messages</h2> <p>iOS6 introduces the idea of Do Not Disturb \u2013 times between which you don't want phone calls or notifications such as texts to bother you, although you can elect to let those numbers picked as \"Favourites\" through at once, and determined callers on the second call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376927\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348006226427/reject_call_ios.png\" alt=\"Rejecting a call on iOS6\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rejecting an incoming call on iOS6 on the iPhone 5: sliding up the \"reject\" icon on the right offers three pre-written messages, or you can send a custom one</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, when someone calls and you can't respond, you get a choice of rejecting the call, or sending a pre-prepared text message from a selection, or creating one on the spot \u2013 all from the lock screen if needed. Yes, HTC and Samsung have offered this already. This is an elegant implementation, though. </p> <h2>Let them Passbook</h2> <p>The growing number of QR-style tickets and other items that accrue in one's email inbox can seem alarming. Apart from anything, they're difficult to find and organise (we've all had the moment running a server search on our email for that ticket at the airport or rail check-in, surely?). The answer that some companies are trying to push is NFC, or near-field communications. Apple's answer however is not NFC but Passbook, an app which collects special versions of those tickets (they're not just email attachments). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376928\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348008141611/passbook-_vouchers_lots.png\" alt=\"Passbook on iOS 6: lots of vouchers\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passbook on iOS6 on the iPhone 5 pulls together vouchers and tickets from different companies and locations</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \"passes\" can be location-sensitive, and show in your lock screen (convenient). It wasn't possible to test this (developers have yet to write many apps, though it will only be a matter of time) but the interaction is very smooth. Certainly, not having to dig through emails will be a bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376929\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348008379934/passbook-_voucher.png\" alt=\"Passbook voucher on iOS 6\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passbook voucher on iOS6 on iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Almost all shall have updates</h2> <p>If you bought an iPhone 4S last year, most of the improvements in software from the iPhone 5 are available to you too. From Wednesday, the new iOS software is available for any of the iPhones released since 2009 (3GS, 4, 4S), as well as the second-generation iPad and iPad 3. </p> <p>That brings many of the software features to those older handsets free of charge (though not all; Siri and Panorama are only for the iPhone 5 and 4S, for example) \u2013 and it will all happen at once. While Android users who have the newest phones can certainly boast that they have had better software than Apple (particularly on the mapping side, where turn-by-turn has been standard for two years), many are stuck waiting for their operator, or handset maker, or both, to update their handsets to newer software. (Google's own statistics show that <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\">57% of Android phones that connect to its Google Play service use Android 2.3</a>, released late in 2010.) </p> <p>Now, Siri in particular is dramatically better than anything on offer on Android \u2013 and shows that Apple is sliding, ever so subtly, to a world where the screen plays second fiddle to other functions. </p> <h2>Only connect</h2> <p>Oh, that new connector. By dumping the 30-pin analogue connector it had been using since 2003 (introduced to connect either to FireWire or USB 2.0 sockets, as iPods did) for its 9-pin digital \"Lightning\" Apple has caused gigantic upheaval in the accessories market. Though a 9-digital-to-30-analogue adaptor does exist, it will <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MD823ZM/A/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter?fnode=48\">cost \u00a325</a>, so you'll probably not want many. But Apple seems to be directing accessories companies towards wireless connections such as its AirPlay system \u2013 and accessory makers meanwhile have decided that 30-pin is dead: they've already switching almost their whole production (save 20% or so) over to the 9-pin connector.</p> <p>Happily, the 9-pin can be plugged in either way, halving your chances of frustration while plugging in the USB lead. Obsolescence is ugly \u2013 no other word for it \u2013 but Apple is never one to be tied to the past.</p> <h2>Conclusions</h2> <p>It's worth recalling that a smartphone isn't a package of specifications. It's that, plus features (the software that drives the onboard camera, say) and services (such as the software that runs Siri or the maps). Those who were quick to dismiss the iPhone 5 based on its specifications \u2013 but no experience with its features or services \u2013 made the mistake of thinking that a phone is just components. But it's the gestalt that makes it a pleasant experience \u2013 or otherwise. For those who insist on NFC, or direct access to the phone's file system, or the option of opening web pages in multiple different browsers, the iPhone and iOS will never be satisfactory. </p> <p>But Apple doesn't care. Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/news/new-os-x-headlines-jobs-keynote/104976\">once said</a> that interfaces which spawned a lot of windows meant that \"you get to be the janitor\" \u2013 a post he didn't relish. Android lets you be the janitor, air-conditioning chief and managing director; the iPhone lets you be the user. It's a key difference in philosophy. You can't do as much on the iPhone \u2013 but sometimes fewer choices mean faster decisions. Siri in particular is a revelation; expect to hear much more of its C#-listening-to-G#-acting pings around you.</p> <p>As for the iPhone 5, it's a lovely piece of equipment. Boring? Lacking wow? With its market value now crossing $700bn and iPhone 5 pre-orders through the roof, Apple might disagree.</p>",
  "<p>The official definition of domestic violence is to be changed from March to ensure that thousands of teenage victims who are abused while in a relationship get the help and support they need, ministers are to announce today. It is also to be widened to explicitly include \"coercive control\", which is defined as complex patterns of abuse by one partner using power and psychological control over another, such as financial, verbal abuse or enforced social isolation.</p> <p>The current single definition of domestic violence as \"any incident of threatening behaviour, or abuse between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality\" was introduced in 2004. It is not a statutory definition but it is used by government departments, crown prosecutors, the police and immigration authorities to identify domestic violence cases and ensure they get access to help for them to escape an abusive relationship. The definition covers so-called \"honour violence\", female genital mutilation and forced marriage but teenagers aged 16 to 18 are currently excluded.</p> <p>However, the British Crime Survey has recently found that young people are more likely to suffer partner abuse than any other age group, with 12.7% of women and 6.2% of men aged 16-19 having experienced some kind of domestic abuse in the last year.</p> <p>The Home Office says that anecdotal evidence shows there are worrying high levels of acceptance of abuse in teenage relationships: \"At present, domestic violence committed against a person under 18 would be considered child abuse by most services. Whilst this may be appropriate for children experiencing parental or family-based violence, there is the suggestion that the nature of teenage relationships is often more similar to relationships between adults and as such could be considered an extension of adult domestic violence.\"</p> <p>It adds that recent research shows that more fluid, less narrow labels are needed to describe teenage relationships, in which a \"date\" can take many forms and non-cohabiting couples are far more likely than in adult relationships.</p> <p>A survey of teenagers in 2009 by the children's charity NSPCC found that 75% of girls experienced some form of emotional abuse, 33% of girls experienced some form of sexual abuse and 25% some form of physical abuse. Three-quarters of the girls surveyed who had a partner at least two years older than themselves said they had experienced some form of physical violence.</p> <p>A Home Office impact assessment has estimated that as many as 5,280 high-risk teenage girls could be referred to multi-agency panels involving the police, domestic violence advisers, children's services, health and housing professionals, as a result of the move to improve their safety.</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the true face of domestic violence was much more complex and more widespread than people often realised. \"Suffering at the hands of people who are meant to care for you is horrific at any age. But it can be especially damaging for young people \u2013 the scars can last for a lifetime.\" He said that frontline campaigners, the police and councils had called for the new definition so they could provide victims with the right support.</p> <p>Clegg added that the message was \"even if you are young, even if what you experience isn't one single act of violence, you do not have to put up with abuse. There is help out there for you.</p> <p>\"And to the perpetrators the message is equally simple: what you're doing is wrong and won't be tolerated.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's no knowing how and where it will all end. But it is clear with every week that passes in Europe's biggest crisis that Britain and the rest of the EU are heading in starkly different directions.</p> <p>Minds concentrated by almost three years of euro crisis, Berlin for months has been demanding to reopen the EU treaties to facilitate a big pooling or surrender of \u2013 depending on your point of view \u2013 national sovereignty to facilitate a federalised eurozone, with what amounts to a core European government of an expanding 17 countries that would take on prerogatives over tax-and-spend powers. Britain is well out of that.</p> <p>Last week the European commission signed up to the German blueprint, while unveiling problematic EU legislation making the European Central Bank the policeman of the eurozone banking sector. Britain will have no part of that, either.</p> <p>On Tuesday the German foreign ministry extended the federalising economic policy-making to foreign and defence, along with 10 other EU foreign ministries carefully chosen to reflect the non-UK EU mainstream \u2013 small countries, big countries, single currency members and those outside the euro, core western states and newer east European countries. The likelihood is that the 11-country consensus will swell into a majority among the EU's 27. Britain also stands apart from this. The 11 include Germany and France, the big ones, plus Italy, Spain and Poland \u2013 after Britain the biggest EU countries.</p> <p>In short, Britain's isolation becomes more fixed, while the cross-Channel gap widens to become less than bridgeable. More in sorrow than in anger.</p> <p>There is ample support and sympathy for Britain's role in Europe, for the quality of its contribution in foreign, security and defence policy, for its pragmatic liberalism, its role in upholding the freedoms of the single market, its anti-protectionist instincts, the relative quality of its shrinking army of eurocrats.</p> <p>But there is also exasperation with the negativity, the lack of team spirit, the seeming resolve to exploit Europe's biggest ever predicament for national or even party political ends.</p> <p>It becomes ever harder for London to construct more than ad hoc, single, issue-driven alliances in Europe. Poland, for example, was a driving force behind Tuesday's radical foreign and security policy proposals. Until a couple of years ago it was a natural British ally in the European contest. It owed France nothing since Paris rightly saw the expansion of the EU to eastern Europe as a zero sum game diluting French clout. And history dictated that Warsaw would be wary of Berlin. But it has since given up on Britain, calculating that the national interest means making common purpose with Germany.</p> <p>On the euro, on a future open eurozone political federation, on the transfer of still national powers to European institutions, there remain ample differences between the main EU states, most fundamentally between Germany and France. Some things never change.</p> <p>But that is not a drifting apart, rather an argument over fixing the terms of getting closer together. It is a political process where Britain is increasingly outside looking in.</p> <p>All the evidence, argument, and logic point to the European treaties being re-opened for further refinement within a year in order to make possible the transfer of further sovereign national powers to Brussels. The stakes are too high to accommodate David Cameron's problems.</p> <p>Either he manages to renegotiate the terms of UK membership - he's not owed a lot of favours - or he has to order a British referendum. Seen from Brussels, the question is less whether there will be a referendum, rather what's the question on the ballot paper.</p>"
