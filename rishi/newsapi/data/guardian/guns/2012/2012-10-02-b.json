  "<p>The advertising watchdog has criticised Channel 4's controversial Big Fat Gypsy Weddings poster campaign, ruling that it depicted a child in a sexualised way and reinforced negative stereotypes.</p> <p>Channel 4's four posters, promoting the second series of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings which aired early this year, featured the words \"Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier\" over images of Gypsy boys and girls.</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority ruled on Wednesday that the campaign was irresponsible, offensive and reaffirmed negative stereotypes and prejudice against the Traveller and Gypsy communities.</p> <p>\"As a result of this decision, Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy brand has been held up to be morally bankrupt,\" said Yvonne MacNamara, chief executive of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain. \"Channel 4 should hang its corporate head in shame.\"</p> <p>The Irish Traveller Movement in Britain, and several co-complainants, successfully appealed against the original decision made in March by the ASA not to investigate the campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/22/big-fat-gypsy-wedding-ads?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">despite almost 400 complaints about the ads</a>.</p> <p>Channel 4's posters included a one of young boy with an aggressive look on his face, two young women in low-cut tops and three girls elaborately dressed for their first communion.</p> <p>The ASA found that one of the girls in a low-cut top, wearing heavy makeup and with part of her bra visible, was 15 \u2013 a year below the legal age children are allowed to appear in ads.</p> <p>Channel 4 said that the girl had turned 16 before the image was used, adding that the poster was \"not more revealing than any number of other ads, for example, swimwear products\".</p> <p>\"Although we understood that the girl was depicted in her own choice of dress we considered that, in choosing that image for use in a poster, Channel 4 had acted irresponsibly by depicting a child in a sexualised way,\" said the ASA.</p> <p>The ASA was equally critical about Channel 4's use of the image of the aggressive-looking young boy.</p> <p>\"He was depicted in a way that was offensive and endorsed negative stereotypes about him and his community,\" the watchdog ruled. \"We considered that the ad reaffirmed commonly held prejudices about Gypsy and Traveller children in a way that was likely to cause distress and mental harm to children from those communities, including to the boy featured in the ad, by suggesting that was an acceptable way to portray him.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 said that the ad campaign used \"real and intimate\" photographic portraits in a \"journalistic, reportage style that reflected the journalistic intent of the series\".</p> <p>The broadcaster said in its submission to the ASA that the campaign was approved at the highest level, which would imply it was signed off by the Channel 4 chief executive, David Abraham.</p> <p>\"It was not Channel 4's intention for these adverts to cause offence but we are sorry this was the case among some members of the Gypsy and Traveller community,\" said a Channel 4 spokesman. \"All responsible action was taken pre-publication: the posters were voluntarily submitted to the industry's independent CAP copy advice team who advised that they believed they complied with the advertising code; consent was obtained from contributors; and the posters were shared with those featured, who had no objections.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 has been backing away from its hit franchise, which derives its name from the hit movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding and has delivered massive audiences for the broadcaster.</p> <p>In August, the Channel 4 chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, told the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival that the broadcaster would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/23/big-fat-gypsy-wedding-axed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">not be making any more series of Big Fat Gypsy Weddings</a>. However, there will be six \"Gypsy-themed\" one-off specials next year.</p> <p>In March media regulator Ofcom <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/mar/19/gypsy-complaints-dismissed-ofcom?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">dismissed complaints</a> that the TV campaign for the show breached any aspects of the broadcasting code.</p> <p>\"The ASA's powerful findings represent a fundamental turning point in how Travellers and Gypsies can be portrayed in the media in the future,\" said David Enright, a parner with law firm Howe &amp; Co, which represented ITMB.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Acclaimed screenwriter Jimmy McGovern is to examine the controversial legal doctrine of joint enterprise in a 90-minute drama for BBC1.</p> <p>The award-winning writer of Hillsborough will examine the common purpose rule \u2013 which can result in a group being convicted of a crime, regardless of which member committed it \u2013 in the feature-length Common.</p> <p>The law, increasingly invoked in instances of gang-related attacks and murders, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/20/the-conversation-joint-enterprise-law\" title=\"\">the subject of debate</a> as campaigners question its potential for injustice.</p> <p>Fears have been raised over whether joint enterprise leads to some young people being unnecessarily dragged into the legal system, and others being imprisoned for crimes they witnessed but neither committed nor helped plan.</p> <p>Others argue that the law is an effective tool against gang culture \u2013 and ensures perpetrators are not left unpunished in instances where the crime was reasonably forseeable and none of the gang tried to stop it.</p> <p>\"Joint enterprise was first used in Britain's courts a few hundred years ago. It was designed to stop the aristocracy duelling,\" said McGovern.</p> <p>\"If one duellist killed another, then all involved in that duel \u2013 the seconds and the surgeons \u2013 were charged with murder. It worked: Britain's aristocrats stopped duelling.</p> <p>\"Now the law is being used against Britain's youth. If someone dies in a fight and you're involved in any way whatsoever, you can find yourself charged with murder.\"</p> <p>The writer, who said the burden of proof required in joint enterprises cases was \"frighteningly low,\" focuses his drama on Johnjo, a 17-year-old who drives away in panic from a fatal stabbing at a pizza restaurant, with three other young men in his car.</p> <p>Common follows the attempts of the police and the victim's parents to uncover the truth about the stabbing \u2013 and Johnjo's to navigate the legal system.</p> <p>\"Common is an ambitious and controversial film,\" said Ben Stephenson, the BBC's controller of drama commissioning. \"Much in the same way as Hillsborough and Sunday, Jimmy McGovern wanted to write this film after talking to the families of those directly affected by the joint enterprise law.</p> <p>\"We believe that it is right for the BBC to give writers such as Jimmy an opportunity to tell a story like this, and to allow the audience to make up their own minds about it.\"</p> <p>McGovern, perhaps best known for his drama serial Cracker starring Robbie Coltrane, has recently made two series of Accused, for BBC1 starring Sean Bean, Anna Maxwell Martin and Stephen Graham, among others.</p> <p>Common will broadcast in 2013, with long-term McGovern collaborator David Blair directing, and casting yet to be announced.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmjust/1597/1597.pdf\" title=\"\">report from the Commons justice committee</a>, the director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/jan/18/joint-enterprise-gang-member\" title=\"\">promised new guidelines on joint enterprise</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The comandante had not shown up for the rally, disappointing supporters in the sun-baked plaza, a triangle of cracked concrete amid a bustling outdoor market, but they made the best of it. A convoy of cars and trucks adorned with posters of&#xa0;the familiar jowly, smiling face slowly circled, blasting campaign songs from huge speakers. A middle-aged woman in red leggings shimmied to the&#xa0;beat of a campaign song blasting from speakers.</p> <p>Another handed out flyers with the election manifesto which outlined \"five great historic objectives\". One: \"Defend, expand and consolidate national independence.\" Two: \"Continue building Bolivarian socialism of the 21st century in Venezuela as an alternative to destructive and savage capitalism.\" Three: \"Make Venezuela an economic, social and political power within the growing power of Latin America and the Caribbean.\" Four: \"Develop a new international geopolitics forming a multicentric and pluripolar world to achieve equilibrium in the universe and guarantee planetary peace.\" Five: \"Preserve life on the planet and save the human species.\"</p> <p>No one ever accused Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of thinking small. He casts politics as an existential contest between good and evil, the oppressed and the oppressor. The next battle is on Sunday, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/sep/29/hugo-chavez\" title=\"\">seeks a third term</a> to extend his<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/feb/02/hugo-chavez-venezuela\" title=\"\"> 14-year rule</a> to 2019. There is a clenched tension in the streets, for no one knows what will happen. Some polls give the president a wide lead, others show him trailing. Wild rumours fill the air: Ch\u00e1vez's family is selling its cattle herds and trucks in anticipation of fleeing to Cuba; pro-Ch\u00e1vez militias are preparing to seal off parts of Caracas; the opposition is planning to assassinate Ch\u00e1vez. Nonsense, but people are worried enough to stockpile water, batteries, tinned food and toilet paper.</p> <p>The election will decide the fate of Ch\u00e1vez, 58, and his revolution. Lose, and the revolution dies. Win, and it survives, but only for as long as the leader has a pulse. Ch\u00e1vez, Gabriel Garcia Marquez once noted, had \"a body of reinforced concrete\". His energy was superhuman, his appetites prodigious. He drank more than 30 shots of sweet, black coffee daily, fuelling a routine that included 3am phone calls to ministers and aides. No longer. Cancer treatment has bloated and debilitated the comandante. After his diagnosis Ch\u00e1vez changed the slogan \"Fatherland, socialism or death\" to \"We will live and we will win\". All references to \"muerte\" in official discourse have been expunged. \"There will be no death here, we must live,\" he instructed. But few believe his claims to be cured of a disease whose exact nature and location remains a closely guarded secret. Some palace insiders whisper it is terminal.</p> <p>The revolution hangs by a thread. There appears to be no plan B, no successor. Ch\u00e1vez surrounded himself mostly with mediocrities, valuing loyalty over competence or, it turned out, honesty. With the chief ailing they look lost. A rally in Catia, a Ch\u00e1vista bastion near the presidential palace, Miraflores, was abruptly cancelled in disarray. The foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, put on a brave face but a microphone caught his murmured words: \"<em>Que cagada.</em>\" What a fuck-up. Not elegant but if Ch\u00e1vez loses it will be the campaign's epitaph.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez's absence from many rallies has given him the air of Banquo's ghost. He hovers in the form of television appearances, and occasional, relatively brief public appearances, an echo of the man who used to barnstorm the country and wade into crowds. Winning the election under such circumstances would be a triumph, and he may well pull it off, but it will not shake off the sense of <em>fin de regime</em>.</p> <p>His legacy will be debated for decades, much as people still argue over Juan Peron in Argentina. Many outsiders made up their minds long ago. There was Ch\u00e1vez the dictator who jailed opponents, sponsored terrorists and left his people hungry. And there was Ch\u00e1vez the hero who empowered the poor, deepened democracy and stood up to the US. While based in Caracas for the Guardian from 2006 to March this year I&#xa0;would hear both versions on trips abroad. Dublin, Shanghai, San Francisco, it didn't matter where, opinion was polarised and passionate. And completely depressing. This was Venezuela of fantasy, a cartoonish projection, each side parroting simplicities and distortions as revealed truth. The reality was more complex and fascinating but if I broached <a href=\"www.guprod.gnl/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/hugo-chavez-cult-oil-venezuela\" title=\"\">oil dependency</a>, or details that determined the fate of the revolution, eyes would glaze over. Few wanted to hear nuances of political economy. They wanted tales of the demon or gospels of faith.</p> <p>There was, arguably, a duality to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The poor boy from the plains who loved to sing and tell stories rose up army ranks and attempted a bloody coup in 1992 against an unpopular but democratically elected government. Six years later he took Miraflores via the ballot box but in power created a personality cult, abolished term limits, curbed private media and put the armed forces, legislature, judiciary and state oil company, PDVSA, under his personal control. He turned a blind eye to Farc guerrilla camps near the Colombian border and hailed the likes of Mugabe, Gaddafi and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/02/venezuela-hugo-chavez-syria-video\" title=\"\">Assad</a> as brothers.</p> <p>But the same president was adored by millions of his people, won free (if not always fair) elections, survived a US-backed coup, accepted electoral defeat (a 2007 referendum), spent oil revenues on health clinics, literacy courses and social programmes, slashed poverty, devolved power to communal councils, stood up to George Bush over Iraq, encouraged regional pride and assertiveness across Latin America and did it all with charisma and flair. The occasional clowning and buffoonery which grabbed headlines concealed a shrewd, sophisticated political mind.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, in other words, was \u2013 is \u2013 a hybrid: a democrat and autocrat, a progressive and a bully. His \"Bolivarian revolution\", named after the 19th-century revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, has embodied these contradictions. What, then, has it wrought these 14 years?</p> <p>For Ruth Guerrero, a Chavista canvasser in Petare, a hillside slum in eastern Caracas, the answer was simple. \"Hope.\" The 56-year-old mother of three grew up poor and unemployed, unable to follow a yen for learning. Thanks to \"Mision Robinson\", an adult education course, one of myriad social programmes, Guerrero obtained a law diploma and now earns $380 a month teaching at a Bolivarian university. \"Before that I had lived a life full of injustice. Ch\u00e1vez has been my teacher and leader.\"</p> <p>Guerrero's effort to hand out leaflets garnered little attention from passers-by, however, and she feared friends and neighbours would abandon Ch\u00e1vez. Polls show Petare voting for the opposition. \"I'm worried. I keep telling them that the president doesn't like rubbish in the streets, or potholes, or insecurity, that he wants us to tackle them together.\"</p> <p>Guerrero was referring to the single most damning critique of the revolution, one that has nothing to do with Ch\u00e1vez's democratic credentials. Venezuela is falling apart. In the case of infrastructure, literally. Roads are crumbling, bridges falling, refineries exploding. A wheezing power grid condemns much of the country to rolling blackouts. Public hospitals, with a few exceptions, are dank, dingy affairs where patients must supply their own bedsheets, bandages and food.</p> <p>Prisons are filthy and riven by violence which claimed 500 lives last year. To massage statistics there was a tacit deal between authorities and some gang leaders to hang victims so they could be counted as suicide, a mid-ranking penal official told me. She had armfuls of documentation and grisly photographs. \"But how can I use it? If I do, I'll be fired, lose my pension and then be prosecuted.\"</p> <p>Murder rates have more than doubled, filling morgues and making Caracas deadlier than Baghdad, reflecting an underfunded, politicised judicial system. Kidnappers, sometimes in league with police, snatch victims from cars, shopping malls, university campuses and bus stops. A recent security plan did not reassure \u2013 by some counts it was Ch\u00e1vez's 20th such initiative. Lack of security is one reason so many young Venezuelans are emigrating, giving Caracas the melancholy nickname City of Farewells.</p> <p>The economy is not falling apart. It is growing about 5% this year, with unemployment of around 8%. It is, however, warping. Under Ch\u00e1vez Venezuela, which claims bigger oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, has seen prices leap from $9 a barrel to over $100, gushing about $980bn through PDVSA.</p> <p>Ahistoric bonanza begging a big question: where is the cash? Social programmes and subsidies \u2013 you can fill a car's petrol tank for around 50 cents \u2013 account for some, as do arms purchases and (mostly stalled) infrastructure projects. But much vanished. Ch\u00e1vez is no Mobutu. He did not build palaces in the jungle to store pink champagne. He did, however, create a tangle of economic controls which let opportunists in government, and those with friends in government, siphon off billions of public money.</p> <p>Few outsiders grasp how profoundly restrictions such as Cadivi \u2013 a currency control agency that tried to shore up the ever weakening Venezuelan bolivar \u2013 perverted the economy and spawned a class of high-rolling parasites nicknamed \"boligarchs\". Ch\u00e1vez occasionally complained about them but let them get rich as long as they supported the government.</p> <p>Their revolution has been one of dodgy bond issues, government contracts and currency manipulation, yielding yachts, Rolexes and Hummers. They pay fashion designers such as Giovanni Scutaro, who used to dress Ch\u00e1vez, astonishing sums for outfits. \"When people from the United States and Europe come here and see our weddings, they go: 'Wow, so much money.' There is no equilibrium between perceptions from afar and the reality of what is happening inside the country,\" Scutaro says.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/26/us-venezuela-chavez-fund-idUSBRE88P0N020120926\" title=\"\">a Reuters investigation</a> detailed how more than half of public investment churns into secretive funds controlled by Ch\u00e1vez with no oversight by auditors or congress.</p> <p>One fund, called Fonden, swallowed about $100bn. Some was spent on white elephants \u2013 an abandoned newsprint factory, a \"city of aluminum\" \u2013 and on ill-fated investments in Ecuadorean bonds and Lehman Brothers-issued derivatives. In a functioning, accountable democracy this would be a huge scandal but Venezuela's government \u2013 plus state prosecutors and media \u2013 ignores it. \"That is not Ch\u00e1vez's money. That money belongs to 29 million Venezuelans and as such the information should be available to everyone,\" said Carlos Ramos, an opposition legislator.</p> <p>Harassing the private sector \u2013 investment evaporated amid expropriations \u2013 and bungled management of multiplying state enterprises translated into shrivelled agriculture and industry. Huge imports to fill the gap, though you would never guess it from Orwellian rhetoric trumpeting \"food sovereignty\" and \"manufacturing independence\". The result is increased dependence on oil, now accounting for 96% of export earnings versus 80% a decade ago. That is why so many Venezuelans end up on pavements selling knick-knacks (they are counted as employed), or watching the clock in decaying state enterprises.</p> <p>This does not add up to collapse. There are always petrodollars to stuff into cracks. But analysts say that, regardless of who wins the election, Venezuela faces a grim economic reckoning. The economy is growing now only because of a splurge in government spending and borrowing, mostly from China.</p> <p>In the headquarters of PDVSA, his office overlooking Avenida Libertador, one of Ch\u00e1vez's top oil officials told me that the boss started as a pragmatist but turned ideological after opponents tried to oust him in a 2002 coup and general strike \u2013 soon after which oil revenues began booming. Then, in hushed tones of heresy: \"It was a historic opportunity that was wasted. He doesn't understand economics. Ch\u00e1vez doesn't know how to manage. As a manager he's a disaster.\"</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution has no gulags, no torture chambers, but in wasted potential lies tragedy. Here was a sublimely gifted politician with empathy for the poor and the power of Croesus \u2013 and the result, fiasco.</p> <p>Neither side likes to acknowledge it but the revolution is in many ways a continuum of oil-fuelled populism dating back half a century, notably that of the giddy, spendthrift 1974-79 administration of Carlos Andres Perez, the mercurial president Ch\u00e1vez tried to overthrow in 1992. The difference is Ch\u00e1vez had even more money, more power, more showmanship.</p> <p>It was easy to overlook the blunders while he strutted the stage, singing and dancing, blowing kisses, riding a bike, a horse, a tank, holding court from his desk, blending folk tales with ideological thunder, commandeering airwaves to talk and talk, sometimes for eight hours straight, oratorical marathons which exhausted aides, paralysed opponents and sucked up the oxygen.</p> <p>If Ch\u00e1vez were healthy he would have walked this election, his skills of enchantment steeled, as ever, by control of state resources and institutions. Instead, he has rationed his public appearances and relied on television to simulate the magic of old while his youthful opponent, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/venezuela-chavez-challenger-election-pledges\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, bursts into villages, towns and cities denouncing their dilapidation.</p> <p>When visiting the Caruachi hydro-electric plant to whip up support Ch\u00e1vez suffered the indignity of being heckled by workers demanding unpaid wages and the restoration of collective-bargaining rights. His microphone failed and a back-up sound system transmitted what sounded like shouts of \"justicia\", justice, at which point state television cut the broadcast. A nation accustomed to highly choreographed presidential events with handpicked audiences gasped at the glimpse behind the curtain.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez can boast genuine accomplishments. He put poverty and social exclusion at the forefront of debate. He made millions feel they had an ally in government. And he called time on US browbeating in Latin America. But the price was high. Gutted institutions, a <em>caudillo </em>(strongman) cult, economic dysfunction. After a recent spate of bad news \u2013 a prison riot, a collapsed bridge, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/27/venezuela-oil-refinery-explosion-chavez\" title=\"\">an oil refinery accident</a> \u2013 Ch\u00e1vez reached for a telling metaphor. \"The show must go on.\" Maybe it will, maybe he will win, and live to rule. But what cost the spectacle?</p> <p>\u2022<em> Rory Carroll's book about Ch\u00e1vez, Comandante, will be published next March by Canongate in the UK and by Penguin Press in the US. </em></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Burton is in a sweet spot. The fashion house at which she succeeded the late Alexander McQueen is riding a wave of commercial success, powered by last year's royal wedding dress. Meanwhile her catwalk collections, which were good right from the start, get better with each passing season.</p> <p>Her Paris fashion week collection for Alexander McQueen was a knockout not only by her standards, but by those set by McQueen himself. Burton's McQueen is a different place from that which she inherited: she has clipped some of the thorns, and let the sunlight in.</p> <p>Female empowerment, control, secrecy, precision of form, sex and nature are codes are at the heart of the McQueen brand, and this season Burton hit upon the perfect plot device to tell her story.</p> <p>The queen bee and her hive were the starting points for a collection which was, as is right and proper at McQueen, tempting as honey but with a deadly sting. Organza and lace suits were embroidered with hexagons and honey bees; cocktail dresses in nectar-sweet colours were dotted with appliqu\u00e9 flowers caught between their silk layers.</p> <p>Beekeeper hats in laser-cut patent leather and crystal wedge heels packed honeycomb-tight with amber crystals bookended looks of perfect symmetry. By the time Burton took her bow, to the tune of the Archies' Sugar Sugar, the designer had made one thing very clear: duchesses are terrifically useful publicity, but this label needs no other queen bee.</p>",
  "<p>A group trying to design the world's first fully printable plastic firearm has seen its plans backfire after its 3D printer was seized back by the manufacturer.</p> <p>A week after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/3d-printing-guns-legal-issues-us-law\">Guardian published details</a> of the Wiki Weapon project, the team behind it, <a href=\"http://defensedistributed.com/\">Defense Distributed</a>, was told by the printer company that it violated federal firearms laws.</p> <p>Stratasys, the company that makes the uPrint SE 3D printer, said it had taken the decision on the basis of Defense Distributed's stated aims and its lack of a firearm manufacturer license. </p> <p>\"It is the policy of Stratasys not to knowingly allow its printers to be used for illegal purposes,\" the company's legal counsel <a href=\"http://defdist.tumblr.com/\">wrote in a letter</a> to the group's spokesman, Cody Wilson.</p> <p>Whether Defense Distributed would have broken any laws in the printing and testing of prototype Wiki Weapons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/3d-printing-guns-legal-issues-us-law\">remains uncertain</a>. The stated goal of the project is to create an open-source schematic that anyone can download. Wilson also was adamant that the Wiki Weapon would be free and that Defense Distributed had no intention of becoming a business. </p> <p>\"Our intentions are not to break the law,\" said Wilson. \"This is America; I don't need to register a thing.\"</p> <p>Under federal law, hobbyists creating pistols, handguns and some rifles do not have to register their creations with the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (ATF) as long as they do not sell, trade or share their weapons. That said, the ATF requires the blueprints for \"any other weapon\" to be subject to ATF review before it is produced.</p> <p>Since 3D printing technology is so new, even the ATF doesn't have answer for what a Wiki Weapon would be. Wilson said he asked the bureau himself and the only answer he got was a shrug.</p> <p>\"Basically, the law has not anticipated this,\" he said. \"Current laws rely on conventional ideas of what a gun is.\"</p> <p>Despite the setback, Defense Distributed plans to press on with the project, albeit on a different path. To protect themselves from prosecution Wilson has decided to get a manufacturer's license and incorporate Defense Distributed into a company.</p> <p>The paperwork will likely take a couple months and cost a couple thousand dollars, but Wilson, a second-year law student at the University of Texas, said he would rather do that than risk going to prison.</p> <p>He said he initially envisaged the group as a \"distributed network of people\" working towards a common goal. That avenue no longer seems feasible, but the group remains committed to their goal of producing a open-source firearm.</p> <p>\"This is the legal regime we exist in,\" said Wilson. \"It's what this old world of legal hierarchy requires. I have to go thorough a legal process just to try something.\"</p> <p>This is the second delay the project has encountered since it started. The crowdsource funding website Indiegogo froze Defense Distributed account earlier this year claiming that project related to the sale of firearms. Shortly afterwards Defense Distributed secured the $20,000 it needed by using the direct distribution platform Bitcoin.</p> <p>Wilson said he never expected to have to become an arms manufacturer to pursue the project, but it seems necessary to go forward. </p> <p>\"I've been contacted by some private equity groups interested in funding the project. They think this is the future,\" said Wilson. \"We'll get there, but I guess I've got to turn into a capitalist before it's all said and done.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ian Hislop is out and about in London talking to people, normal people, about emotional matters. He's not a natural with the public, I'd say \u2013 it's as if he knows he can't be too clever, or witty, or sarky. But what, frankly, does that leave, for someone who's all about being those things? Nodding along, a little uncomfortably, that's what.</p> <p>Luckily he doesn't do it for too long in this first episode of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01n7rh4\" title=\"\"><strong>Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip \u2013 An Emotional History of Britain</strong></a><strong> </strong>(BBC2). Soon he's burrowing into the past, ferreting around (there is something ferret-like about Hislop, isn't there?) among books and pictures. Not too many normal people to deal with here, just experts. Like AN Wilson (now there's a man to test your stiff upper lip, don't you just want to throw your arms around him and give him a big hug, soak up the warmth). And this fellow at the Queen Mary Centre for the History of the Emotions ...</p> <p>What? No! That's a made-up centre, isn't it? What the hell were they doing until this programme happened and (sort of) justified their existence? Sitting around among their dusty books, waiting for the phone to ring. Eventually, after several years, it did, the first time ever in fact. \"Hello? Yes ... Ian Hislop? You're making a programme ... about the history of emotions ... yes I believe we can help you ... that's exactly what we do, pretty much all we do ... an interview? ... let me just check the diary ... actually, no need, that'll be fine ...\"</p> <p>Anyway, it turns out we Brits weren't always so buttoned up, our upper lips weren't always so stiff. Back in the day we were a touchy-feely-huggy-kissy lot (lucky for AN Wilson he wasn't around then). Even Nelson was basically a metrosexual hippy. So what happened? The French revolted, that's what, our lip-stiffening was a direct result of that.</p> <p>It's a bit more complicated, and interesting. And Hislop snuffles out a fascinating route from Tudor va-va-voom to icy Victorian reserve. Sometimes I get a bit lost and can't see how something fits in, but that's just me not keeping up, and it really doesn't matter because the stories are such a hoot. Like the cunning British scheme to sort out the French, put a stop to their silly revolution, by making them all play cricket. And James Boswell's big night out on the town to celebrate the king's birthday, which involved drinking a lot, getting into a few fights, and dipping his machine into the canals of prostitutes. Eurgh ... his words, not mine, filthy man. Three prostitutes, as it happens, \"thrice nightly\" Jimmy B they used to call him. How does this fit in with the history of the stiff upper lip though? There's very little reserve going on there; plus he must have needed all his stiffness for his machine, in order for successful canal-dipping to take place, so to speak. Oh I see, that was the beginning of politeness, though Boswell wasn't very good at it (you're telling me!), on account of being Scottish.</p> <p>There's not an awful lot to go on visually for this documentary. Hislop looks at a book, and another book, and at a portrait by Johann Zoffany. The camera scans the page, the picture, a statue, a flag; Hislop ferrets around, in his black suit. But thank God we don't go down the dreaded dramatic reconstruction route (take note, Andrew Marr), although it might have been quite fun for Boswell's Big Night Out.</p> <p>And it will be easier next time, as we'll presumably be getting into times where there's some footage \u2013 of events when lips either remained stiff (world wars), or didn't (the death of Diana). Gazza's tears, will they feature? Andy Murray's Scottish ones even?</p> <p>What about Hislop himself, is he Wellington or Nelson, stoical or sentimental? Or is there something between the two, an upper-lip semi? That curls up slightly, in the corner, wittily, satirically ... Yeah, that. Anyway, his programme is a lovely one.</p> <p>I've tried to like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wg3f6\" title=\"\"><strong>Cuckoo</strong></a> (BBC3), I really have. I like the premise \u2013 girl goes gap-year travelling, comes back with floppy-upper-lipped American new-age husband. He's not quite what girl's family had in mind for her.</p> <p>People I know and whose judgment I trust (did trust) have told me they think it's funny. But the girl (Tamla Kari) is so dippy that it's hard to feel anything for her except annoyance. The comedy is mainly based around the generational/ideological gap and tension between husband (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/24/andy-samberg-cuckoo-bbc-sitcom\" title=\"\">Andy Samberg</a>) and dad (Greg Davies); but it's overdone, forced, not recognisable or real. Nor is it surreal, or bold. It's just a little bit silly really.</p>",
  "<p>If this parliament runs its full course, we are barely halfway to the 2015 general election. It is therefore too early to be certain that Britain is about to turn once more to the Labour party. Ed Miliband, likewise, has much to do before the voters decide whether they want him as prime minister. But those issues will soon be at the centre of the political battleground. And in his<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference-live#block-506afe0bc0e3eab0be492bf3\" title=\"\"> leader's speech</a> to the Labour conference in Manchester on Tuesday, Mr Miliband did himself and his party a good turn in making those goals seem more achievable than they have felt before.</p> <p>The Labour leader went to great lengths to underscore his ordinary background. At times it felt like special pleading, although it will undoubtedly help to pin David Cameron into a corner. But his speech was certainly that of an unusually able person. It felt, above all, like the speech that he really wanted to make. It told the country who he is and it outlined his vision for another chapter in the Labour story. He said what he meant and he meant what he said. You cannot ask more of a leader than that.</p> <p>Mr Miliband had clearly put a lot into his preparation. He spoke for more than an hour without notes, made barely a stumble and looked comfortable. His strikingly soft-toned words were aimed at middle Britain voters \u2013 particularly women \u2013 who feel, as he put it, that their lives are beset by forces which they cannot control. This was not just a well-crafted and well-executed appeal; it was also one that a modern Labour leader should be making. Mr Miliband has to win the confidence of the voters who turned away from Labour in 2010 and who were prepared to give Mr Cameron a chance. He was right to pitch his message to these voters, and to ask for a hearing from well beyond the party faithful.</p> <p>The speech was dominated by a repeated appeal for a \"one-nation\" approach. When Benjamin Disraeli used the same phrase in 1872 \u2013 in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/oct/02/one-nation-miliband-disraeli-archive-1872?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">speech</a> delivered not a stone's throw from the modern Manchester conference centre \u2013 it was said that, just as the sculptor discerns the angel within the block of marble, so Disraeli <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/charlesmoore/8887929/A-gift-for-winning-they-brought-to-the-Conservative-Party.html\" title=\"\">discerned</a> within the British nation the Conservative working man. Mr Miliband, by contrast, seems to discern the social democratic middle earner within modern post-crash Britain. This is both audacious and traditional. Mr Miliband has stolen the Tories' one-nation clothes just at a time when Mr Cameron has forgotten to look after them. But he is also executing a classic New Labour move from the Tony Blair <a href=\" http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/458843-i-want-a-britain-that-is-one-nation-with-shared\" title=\"\">playbook</a>.</p> <p>Mr Miliband made clear, though, that he is a leader for different times from those of Mr Blair. In Mr Miliband's nation, as in Mr Blair's, much will be expected from the out-of-work and the benefits claimant, although much will also be given. But Mr Miliband made clear that he will adopt the same approach at the top of the social and income scale, too, something Mr Blair never seriously attempted. No interest was too powerful to be untouched, said Mr Miliband. Many will cheer that.</p> <p>There were relatively few specifics in Mr Miliband's speech. That's because the frame, not the detailed picture, is his main concern at this stage in the parliamentary cycle. That's fair enough. This is not yet the moment for details. But Mr Miliband had to give a sense of the direction in which he wants to move. Up to a point, he succeeded. A better-trained workforce, incentives to business to establish apprenticeship programmes, an end to the short-termism of quarterly published accounts. All these help to establish the principle that, just as every school should be a good school, so every business should be a good business. And quite right, too.</p> <p>Mr Miliband has done a good day's work. The Tories will be uncomfortable, as they should be. None of this means, however, that Labour are home and dry; or that Britain has suddenly embraced a Labour leader who still <a href=\" http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/double-poll-blow-casts-shadow-over-ed-milibands-big-day-8193160.html\" title=\"\">polls poorly</a>. But Mr Miliband has done his best to change that. And now he needs to do more of the same, and to hope that it works.</p>",
  "<p>Legislation that would have ensured that the City traders behind the Libor interest rates scandal did not escape prosecution is to be promised by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, on Wednesday.</p> <p>In her conference speech she will pledge that the next Labour government will introduce the first-ever Economic Crime Act in a drive against the \"grey and murky area\" of financial crime, including fraud and money-laundering.</p> <p>The legislation would make it a criminal offence to manipulate interest rates to make money, while victims pay more.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary is also to make clear that Labour police and commissioners elected next month will \"halt the Tory rush to privatisation of our police\" and limit the involvement of private companies in the police service.</p> <p>The decision to frame an economic crime bill is one of a number of areas of the criminal justice system that Cooper is expected to identify in her conference speech as in need of reform to tackle the full range of crimes in the 21st century.</p> <p>She is to say that the financial crime legisation is required to provide clarity for the police and to address the myriad network of existing agencies to tackle city crime, all with overlapping structures, different responsibilities and different powers.</p> <p>The Libor rate scandal involved the manipulation by traders of the London Interbank Offered Rate in Britain which is used as a benchmark by financial institutions around the world and underpins contracts with a value of more than $300tn.</p> <p>The official inquiry, the Wheatley review, highlighted concerns that criminal sanctions for Libor manipulation were insufficient for enforcement or deterrence. It said it was unclear even if the law allows for charges to be brought despite its finding that the scandal had \"torn at the very fabric that our financial system is built on\".</p> <p>Cooper says that the public looked at what had happened and had seen no real sign of people being held to account.</p> <p>Cooper is expected to say: \"Look at the Libor scandal that emerged this summer. It is a multibillion pound fraud. People were fiddling figures to get rich, while small businesses paid the price.Yet no one has been arrested. The experts say it can't even be treated as a crime offence. The police and the SFO don't even seem to know where to start.</p> <p>\"In the United States they have seen 800 prosecutions for serious fraud since 2011. Here in the UK the SFO pursued just 20. If a mum can't afford her TV licence she'll end up in court. But defraud millions of pensioners or small businesses and you can get off scot-free.We need an end to the double standards. We need a new Economic Crime Act. People need to be able to invest with confidence knowing everyone is playing by the same fair rules.\"</p> <p>She says that the government, the police and other agencies all looked around but nobody was clear what crime had been committed or who should act. She claims it is the same with other financial crimes, such as serious fraud and money-laundering, which is costing the country an estimated \u00a338bn a year.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary is also to promise that Labour police and crime commissioners will halt the Tory rush to police privatisation with their \"nothing ruled out contract tenders that include neighbourhood patrols, detective investigations and more\".</p> <p>\"Pushing forces to sign massive contracts with a single organisation where value for money is at risk,\" she is expected to say. \"Have they learned nothing from the Olympics?\"</p> <p>Cooper will say that Labour recognised public private partnerships could be important in the police but tough tests had to be applied on value for money, transparency and accountability, resilience and security, and above all on public trust.</p> <p>\"We don't want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain,\" she is expected to say. \"We want police officers ... policing our communities \u2013 not private companies putting them under guard.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012. The comments that Yvette Cooper is expected to make in her speech have been changed in the light of updated information. It was further amended on 4 October 2012, to correct a figure of $300m to $300tn.</p>",
  "<p>Who takes birth control, and why? </p> <p>Sociologist Michael Kimmel often encourages his students and readers to observe human culture from the perspective of a recently-arrived <a href=\"http://thecollegevoice.org/2011/02/28/guyland-addresses-challenges-of-growing-up-male/\">extraterrestrial tourist</a>. It's a way to step back and free oneself slightly from just-so explanations about society, and sometimes, it produces surprising results.</p> <p>A martian observing the political landscape in this election year would report back that, on Earth, birth control is a method used by mothers to make them better mothers. Sex? Sorry, our alien anthropologist shakes his presumably tentacled head. Never heard of it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/why-it-matters-fight-over-birth-control-and-abortion-rages-on-national-and-state-levels/2012/10/01/dbf26856-0b9c-11e2-97a7-45c05ef136b2_story.html\">This year</a> has seen an unprecedented number of attacks on contraception and abortion access in America. Thankfully, the result has been an unprecedented amount of public conversation about why contraception and abortion access are important and ought to be not just preserved, but expanded.</p> <p>But more often than not, that conversation doesn't include sex. That is absurd: we are having a national discussion about birth control, without ever mentioning the basic human activity that can lead to birth.</p> <p>When the Democrats and other pro-choicers argue for preserving and expanding access to birth control, they talk about pregnant rape survivors and mothers of three who want to ensure they can provide for the children they already have. They talk about Planned Parenthood's life-saving <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/what-planned-parenthood-actually-does/2011/04/06/AFhBPa2C_blog.html\">cancer screenings</a>.</p> <p>They don't talk about the millions of American women who aren't mothers and don't intend to be mothers, and just want to have sex. Lots of it. Purely for pleasure. Those millions of women get left out of this crucial conversation: their experiences obscured and stigmatized.</p> <p>Of course, we need to ensure that pregnant rape survivors can get the morning after pill or abortions if they want them. It is true that <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/US-Abortion-Patients.pdf\">61% of women</a> who have abortions are already mothers and are terminating pregnancies because they cannot provide the emotional and/or financial support that another child would need from them. And Planned Parenthood does, of course, provide life-saving cancer screenings and STI testing.</p> <p>That is all true, and it should all be a part of the discussion about keeping contraception and abortion legal, accessible and affordable. But those can't be the only stories we tell about birth control.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, Virginia Democratic state delegate Charniele Herring <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/the-rachel-maddow-show/49041157\">appeared on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow show </a>to talk about the restrictions being imposed on abortion clinics in her state. The restrictions, known as \"Trap laws\", are designed to make compliance impossible and closure inevitable. Herring <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49061994/ns/msnbc-rachel_maddow_show/t/rachel-maddow-show-friday-september-th/\">made the case</a> for the clinics in the manner that has become typical this year:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"These clinics provide healthcare. They provide preventative service, cancer screenings. That's things that keep us women alive and keep our bodies healthy so we can care for our families.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, they do. They also provide birth control to women who haven't started a family yet, and maybe won't ever do so, but who want to have sex anyway.</p> <p>We need to talk about families, but we also need to talk about sex. We need to talk about mothers, but we cannot ignore the existence and the rights of women who are not mothers. The GOP is waging a \"War on Women\", and the Democrats are fighting back \u2013 but only on behalf of certain kinds of women.</p> <p>Women-with-children-first framing is politically potent: it humanizes women who use birth control, or patronizes Planned Parenthood. It enables the Democrats to speak about family values (political ground that is usually ceded to the Republicans). And it makes the case for reproductive freedom without having to talk about sex \u2013 a subject that apparently makes Americans terribly uncomfortable. It's far less awkward to talk about families and motherhood, and women who get pregnant through terrible acts of sexual violence, rather than through consensual, orgasmic, sweaty hay-rolling.</p> <p>It boggles the mind that in a year when we all learned the phrase \"transvaginal ultrasound\", we are somehow still uncomfortable talking about why women like me and my friends take the pill. We don't take it so we can be good mothers, we take it so we can have good sex. There's nothing wrong with that. And as a party that claims to be fighting for women in this political war, the Democrats need to stop implying that there is. The same goes for the pro-choice advocates \u2013 myself included \u2013 who are speaking out against Republican encroachments on reproductive freedom.</p> <p>We should keep talking about mothers of three and about pregnant rape survivors, because those people exist and they need birth control. Their stories are also far more likely to sway people who are on the fence about birth control access than my friends' tales about casual consensual encounters. But the point that pro-choicers ought to be making is that every woman is entitled to reproductive freedom, regardless of marital status. Every woman, regardless of how many kids she has. Every woman, not just the ones who make for good talking points or political props. Every woman, even the ones who dare \u2013 unspeakable though it apparently is \u2013 to have pleasurable, non-procreative sex.</p> <p>We must stop pretending that this large group of American women does not exist. It's time to acknowledge the naked elephant in the room. I'm a member of that group, and we're starting to feel \u2013 any extraterrestrials living among us must forgive the word \u2013 rather alienated.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here tonight to celebrate this thing called CFR Cluj v Manchester United in the Champions League. It's the second Group H game for each side and both can consider themselves lucky to have three points on the board in the wake of less than impressive openers. </p> <p>While they'll happily take it, only the most blinkered United fan would claim their side's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/champions-league-manchester-united-galatasaray\">win against Galatasaray at Old Trafford</a> was not mired in good fortune. The Turkish side will remain mystified by the referee's decision not to award them a penalty for Nemanja Vidic's blatant foul on Umut Bulut in a match that will otherwise be remembered for <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/michael-carrick-manchester-united-v-galatasaray/\">Michael Carrick's composure</a> in front of goal, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFmTs4puoSc\">Nani's lack of it</a> and the welcome return to action from illness of Darren Fletcher.</p> <p>Boasting considerably less Champions League pedigree than their visitors tonight, Romanian champions CFR Cluj got their campaign off to a winning start with a heroic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/braga-cfr-cluj-champions-league\">2-0 away win over FC Braga</a>. Brazilian midfielder Rafael Bastos availed of his counter-attacking side's only two shots on goal to bag a brace against his former club. They'd probably gnaw your hand off if you offered them a point in the DR Constantin Radulescu Stadium tonight, but are an outside bet to get one.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>CFR who?</strong> You may not know a great deal about them, but <a href=\"http://www.cfr1907.ro/en/\">CFR Cluj</a> are no <a href=\"http://www.felingwmpottery.co.uk/Mugs/mugs-grp.jpg\">mugs</a>. They've won their last five Champions League matches (including qualifiers), but have been less than impressive on the home front and are currently lying sixth in <a href=\"http://uk.soccerway.com/national/romania/liga-i/20122013/regular-season/\">the Romanian top flight</a>, nine points off the pace being set by Steaua Bucharest after 10 games. Even though they hammered Gloria Bistrita 5-1 at the weekend, it would be a big surprise if they were to nick even one point from tonight's match.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The Cluj manager speaks:</strong> CFR have a few players with experience in the Champions League and we have the whole of Romania behind us,\" said Cluj manager Ioan Andone in the build-up to this evening's fixture.\" I hope our enthusiasm will make a difference. If we manage to score, we will have a chance. I don't think you can speak about fear against United. If we won it would bring prestige and six points in the group, which is very important. It would be huge for Cluj and Transylvania too.\"</p> <p><strong>The Manchester United manager speaks:</strong> \"I watched the games against Basel and Braga and I would pick out Rafael Bastos [as the main threat],\" said Sir Alex Ferguson in his pre-match presser. \"CFR are a team who defend quickly and get plenty of bodies behind the ball. Their main strength is the counter-attack, as they showed against Braga. Counter-attacking is very important in European football these days. Their strongest point is they have got three points. They play us tomorrow and then two games against Galatasaray. They need secen more points from five games and they will qualify.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Manchester United team news:</strong> Sir Alex Ferguson makes six changes from the team that was beaten by Spurs on Saturday. David De Gea is in goal, but the somewhat porous back four of Messrs Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans and Evra remains intact. Anderson, Tom Cleverly and Darren Fletcher are named in a three-man midfield, while Wayne Rooney joins Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez in a front three that could fill their boots against a side that's conceded in 10 of their last 12 games.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>CFR Cluj-Napoca:</strong> Mario Felgueiras, Sepsi, Cadu, Rada,<br>Ivo Pinto, Sougou, Aguirregaray, Muresan, Camora, Bastos, Kapetanos. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Stancioiu, Diogo Valente, Nicoara, Maftei, Piccolo, Bjelanovic, Luis Alberto.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> De Gea, Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Cleverley, Anderson, Fletcher, Rooney, Hernandez, van Persie. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Lindegaard, Nani, Welbeck, Powell, Kagawa, Buttner, Wootton.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Interesting trivia (depending on your point of view):</strong> There are 13 different nationalities represented in tonight's starting 22: Brazil, England, France, Greece, Mexico, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Senegal, Spain and Uruguay. </p> <p>Manchester United field one Spaniard, two Brazilians, three Englishmen, a Frenchman, a Scot, a Mexican, a Dutchman and a Norn Ironer. CFR Cluj's line-up comprises four Portuguese, three Romanians, a Uruguayan, a Senegalese, a Greek and a Brazilian.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>An amusing start to the evening:</strong> This match is being broadcast on ITV and presenter Adrian Chiles and his analysts Gareth Southgate and Lee Dixon are standing pitchside. As they discussed the line-ups, somebody had the bright idea of the turning on the pitch sprinklers behind them. Sadly, they appeared to be standing <em>this much</em> out of range and managed to avoid a proper soaking, although they did get liberally sprayed.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Some reader emails: </strong> \"Alphabetised countries - the true sign of the obsessive,\" writes John out in China. \"Fine work, sir.\"</p> <p>\"Some interesting points in your preamble, but I can't help feeling you're missing the truly important information,\" writes Matt Dony. \"Exactly what <em>did</em> Fergie make of the Ryder Cup win?\"</p> <p>\"Not to be stereotypical, but given that one of the greatest Romanian exports is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count\">this fellow</a>, is anyone else hoping that the stadium announcer takes tonight's attendance manually and says 'A ha-ha!' after each number?\" asks Ryan Dunne.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack!</strong> The teams emerge from the tunnel and ITV immediately cut to an advert break.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Manchester United kick off playing from right to left and with their players wearing white shirts, shorts and socks. Cluj's player's wear burgundy coloured shirts with white triangles under the arms, burgundy shorts and burgundy socks.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Manchester United concede the first corner of the match and Rafael Bastos prepares to swing it in from the left. His delivery to the near post is excellent and Modou Sougou leaps highest to send a header flashing wide of the far post off Darren Fletcher.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Bastos takes the second corner and sends this one towards the far post in a bid to pick out the centre-half Cadu. He does exactly that, but the ball's a mite too high for the Portuguese defender and he sends it high and wide under pressure from Rio Ferdinand.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Manchester United ping the ball around the edge of the final third trying to find an opening past the 10 men CFR Cluj have behind the ball. A rogue pass gifts possession to the home side and they attempt to attack on the break.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> I can see a theme developing here. As expected, CFR Cluj have dug in on the edge of their own penalty area and are showing no inclination to take the match to Manchester United. It's fairly understandable, considering their success against Braga, when they won 2-0 after having two shots on goal compared to their opponents' 38.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Modou Sougou, who wears the No99 on his back, has gone down injured inside his own half after coming out second best from a challenge with Anderson. Apart from the two corners, that's been the highlight of the opening 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-0 Manchester United (Kapetanos 13)</strong> Manchester United go behind to asn early goal once again. From inside his own half, Rafael Bastos picks out Sougou on the right flank with a marvellous long diagonal pass. With Patrice Evra nowehre near him, the right-winger crosses low and hard into the centre, where the unmarked Antelis Kapeanos sweeps the ball into the bottom left-hand corner from eight yards or so.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> United's defence pick up where they left off on Saturday, standing off an opposition striker and allowing him too much time when they should have closed him down. Alone and without help in front of Evans and Ferdinand, Kapetanos was given far too much time on the ball before scoring. The only resistance he met was a lazy leg waved in his general direction by Evans when he was unleashing his shot past De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Fletcher and Rooney combine well on the edge of the Cluj penalty area and the latter fires off a shot from just outside the D. Goalkeeper Mario Felgueras puts it out for a corner, from which Manchester United win another one.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> From the second corner, the ball breaks to Hernandez in the Cluj penalty area with his back to goal. He plays it back to Anderson, who tries to pick his spot and side-foots the ball a couple of feet past the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Another enterprising attack down the right flank from CFR Cluj, with defensive midfielder Matias Aguirregaray picking out Sougou with a long pass. The winger is unable to keep his footing and slips, allowing Manchester United to clear.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> United attack down the centre, with Tom Cleverley picking out Robin van Persie with a first-time ball that takes four defenders out of the equation. With his first touch, Van Persie sends the ball skidding not too far wide of the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> CFR Cluj substitution: Modou Sougou off, Luis Alberto on. The provider for the opening goal is forced off with an injury sustained in a collision with Anderson some minutes ago. \"I don't think Patrice Evra will be shedding any tears to see the back of him,\" says Andy Townsend on ITV.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> More patient build-up play from Manchester United's players as they try in vain to find a way through the packed Cluj defence. Nobody could mistake them for Barcelona as it all looks a bit slow and ponderous. The home fans are whistling relentlessly, presumably in a bid to get the referee to blow for half-time a bit early.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-1 Manchester United (Van Persie 29):</strong> Manchester United win a free-kick on the left flank, which Wayne Rooney whips into the penalty area. Standing unmarked, Robin van Persie leaps and misses the ball with his head, but gets a lucky break when it hits his shoulder, loops over the goalkeeper and drops under the crossbar and into the back of the goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Good play again from Cleverley, who picks out Javier Hernandez on the edge of the penalty area. The Mexican unleashes a snap-shot that's on target, but not hit with enough venom to trouble Mario Felgueiras in the Cluj goal.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Possession stats: CFR Cluj 30%-70% Manchester United. Cluj get the ball out of their own half and it's whipped into the Manchester United penalty area from the left. Pantelis Kapetanos is the only player within 30 yards of it, but it doesn't go anywhere near him.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Hernandez dinks the ball between centre-back and right-back for Robin van Persie to chase and the Dutchman shjoots low and diagonally from left to right. Goalkeeper Felgueiras stays on his feet and blocks the shot.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Darren Fletcher links up with Cleverley and Anderson before sending a cross to the far post towards Van Persie. Cluj right back Ivo Pinto heads clear.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> \"I think Andy Townsend may have spoken too confidently re Evra (25 min),\" writes Hugh Collins. \"If Celtic can win an away game in the Champion's League, then I wouldn't be that surprised to see an adult defender reduced to tears by the sight of an opponent's back.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Manchester United win a corner off Ivo Pinto and Wayne Rooney sends it towards Robin van Persie at the far post. He's beaten in the air and CFR Cluj embark on another of their trademark counter-attacks, only for Gabriel Muresan to to drag a shot wide of David De Gea's goal.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Another United chance, but by no means a gilt-edge one. Rafael crosses to the edge of the penalty area, where Wayne Rooney is forced to lean backwards before directing a weak header harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> It's half-time. After falling behind once again, Manchester United go in all square at half-time courtesy of a Robin van Persie fluke. They've been vastly superior to CFR Cluj, but have looked anything but clinical up front or at the back. Elsewhere in this group, Portuguese side Braga lead Galatasaray 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Random half-time observations</strong> </p> <p>\u2022 Wayne Rooney still looks to be carrying a bit too much timber; or at least looks very, very laboured. He's <em>pouring</em> with sweat compared to the other players, but then he has been out for a while. <br>\u2022 All Manchester United's chances have been created through the middle of the poitch, which is unsurprising considering they're playing without any wingers.<br>\u2022 Manchester United need to bring on a winger.<br>\u2022 Manchester United's defending for the goal they conceded was hideously bad. Evra was caught hopelessly out of position, which allowed Cluj winger Sougou to cross.<br>\u2022 When the cross went into the penalty area, Kapetanos got the better of both Evans and Ferdinand, when they should have been able to deal with him comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Alex Ferguson's half-time interview:</strong> \"Our passing and intensity of possession has been good, but losing that goal the way we did was a shocker ... an absolute shocker. The way they play everyone is behind the ball, so it's going to be difficult to get width. They're just sitting in there and hoping we make mistakes.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> No changes on either side as the home team kicks off. If you haven't l;istened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/audio/2012/oct/01/1\">this Monday's Football Weekly podcast</a> yet, then shame on you. It was presented by Soccer Am's Max Rushden, who left the studio to hop on a train to Manchester, from where he was flying to Cluj to support the Romanian champions in this match.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Wayne Rooney tries his luck with a long-range effort which the goalkeeper puts out for a corner from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-2 Manchester United (Van Persie 48)</strong> Great goal from Manchester United, which has its origins on the right flank. With the ball at his feet and lots of time on his hands, Wayne Rooney looks up and sends a splendid diagonal pass up and under into the corridor of uncertainty between goalkeeper and back four for Robin van Persie to chase. The Dutchman beats the dithering goalkeeper to the dropping ball, cocks his left leg like a dog taking a pee on a lamp-post and dinks it into the bottom left-hand corner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Another lapse in concentration by Manchester United's defenders almost lets Kapetanos in for a second. Muresan squares the ball low and hard from the right and, with Evans and Ferdinand standing off him again, the Cluj striker has all the time in the world to slash it high over the crossbar. If he'd hit the target there, who knows what might have happened?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> \"While we're on the subject of random observations, did you know that basic gingerbread is a mixture of flour, brown sugar, golden syrup and cinnamon?\" asks Simon McMahon. \"And that Grasmere in Cumbria is considered the home of gingerbread? Yes, I'm having to watch the great British Bake-Off and follow the footie on the minute-by-minute.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> If Manchester United's players are trying to wind up their manager and ensure a long, fraught trip home from Romania, they're doing a very good job. Cluj win a corner, the ball's sent in from the right and Cadu rises completely unmarked at the back post to send a bullet header flashing wide of the left upright. He runs back into position with his head in his hands, berating himself for not doing better.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> United earn some respite after a five-minute period of sustained Cluj pressure, when Rafael Da Silva wins a free-kick wide on the right flank from his namesake Rafael Bastos in the Cluj side.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> From the edge of the final third, Matias Aguirregaray tries to play Pantelis Kapetanos through for a one-on-one with De Gea with a stabbed pass along the deck for the striker to chase. Rio Ferdinand makes a crucial interception.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> CFR Cluj substitution: Goalscorer Kapetanos off, to be replaced by Croatian one-cap wonder Sasa Bjelanovic.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Decent enough play from United, who carve Cluj open down the right flank, before Anderson squanders possession by sending a deep looping cross way too near the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Cleverly tries to play Javier Hernandez through on goal with a ball through a gap between two players in the Cluj defence, but the Little Pea is flagged for offside.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> With nothing else going on, fancy getting strafed with my stat gun? It's not as unpleasant as it sounds. Passes completed: Cluj 152-473 Manchester United.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Excellent play by Manchester United, with Rooney linking up beautifully with Tom Cleverley down the inside left. The midfielder plays a weighted pass along the deck for Rooney to pull back towards Van Persie, who stretches out a leg and misses making contact by <em>this</em> much.</p> <p>\"Shouldn't basic gingerbread contain ginger?\" asks Daniel Stauss in response to Simon McMahon (55 mins). \"Isn't that the whole point of gingerbread? If you type the word ginger enough times, your fingers lose all sense of feeling.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Evra goes to ground in the Cluj penalty area while trying to get on the end of a pull-back from Robin van Persie. The referee gestures to the Frenchman to get to his feet. While I can't be certain it shouldn't have been a spot-kick without seeing a replay, it didn't look like one on first viewing.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> After coming in from the left flank, Hernandez plays the ball out of the penalty area to Rooney, who tries to pick out Robin van Persie with a dinked ball over the top. There isn't quite enough weight on his pass and Cluj clear.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Pass. Probe. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Probe. Lay off. Pass. Pass. Probe. Lay off. Pass. Probe. Clatter. Peep! Free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Having made his debut for Manchester United in the Capital One Cup against Newcastle last week, Scott Wootton now makes his Champions League bow. The 21-year-old from Birkenhead replaces Jonny Evans, who has been nursing a dead leg all evening.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Cluj substitution: Matias Agiurregaray off, 24-year-old left-footed midfielder Viorel Nicoara on. He's not from Birkenhead.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution: Little Pea off, Danny Welbeck on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> With just seven minutes to go, this match is being played at a very pedestrian pace. Manchester United are looking very comfortable in possession, but are just one gaffe or long-range howitzer away from having to share the points here. That would be calamitous, despite them have been drawn in a group that looked even easier than the one they usually get.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> I've been very impressed with Tom Cleverley tonight. His performance was no-frills and efficient, while his movement has been good and his short passing has been very neat and effective. Rio Ferdinand gets booked for a high challenge on Rafael Bastos, who he hoofs in the stomach as the pair contest a 50-50 ball.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> David De Gea wins a free-kick after being clattered by Sasa Bjelanovic with a late challenge as he plucked the ball from the sky. He did well to hold on to that ball despite the mid-air collision. Remember the amount of abuse and ridicule he was subjected to by assorted armchair goalkeeping experts, who were very quick to write off a 21-year-old off because he occasionally looked dodgy under a high ball? I do. </p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Manchester United win a throw-in deep in Cluj territory, but their hosts win possession back and launch another counter-attack. Ivo Pinto gets in a cross from the right and David De Gea saves brilliantly from a Rafael Bastos bullet-header after the Brazilian steals in unmarked at the near post. Corner for Cluj ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> After his comments on Saturday, we can only presume that Sir Alex Ferguson is <em>delighted</em> with all this injury-time the referee is playing; Cluj are certainly trying to make the most of it. United fail to clear the corner properly, the ball falls kindly for Ionel Rada on the edge of the penalty area and he pulls the trigger only to see his effort blocked by a desperate Rafael lunge.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep!</strong> It's all over. Manchester United do just enough to hold on for the win against a very limited team who will consider themselves unlucky not to have stolen a point in the dying seconds of injury time. While Alex Ferguson will be relieved to get out of Romania with the win, must be seriously concerned with his side's many shortcomings in defence.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>On a far more important note:</strong> \"Daniel Stauss is probably right,\" writes Simon McMahon of the great ginger-free gingerbread debate. \"I think the ingredients I listed are those required for the basic dough to which the ginger is then added. It would certainly be a bit strange if ginger was absent from gingerbread. I wasn't really paying attention to be honest. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hollywood\">Paul Hollywood</a> can rest easy.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Elsewhere in Group H:</strong> Braga have beaten Galatasaray 2-0 in Istanbiul, which means Manchester United are top with six points from two games, Cluj and Braga next on three points each and Galatasaray are whipping them in on no points.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband opened up about his family's history in a highly personal speech designed to show how \"my story\" underpins his political mission as guardian of Britain's 'one nation' politics.</p> <p>Addressing the party conference in Manchester for an hour without notes or autocue, the Labour leader said that his \"deep conviction\" for Britain is rooted in his parents' experience as survivors of the Nazi Holocaust.</p> <p>Miliband decided to talk in such personal terms to challenge perceptions that he is a policy wonk with no inner core. He had rehearsed his speech for weeks to deliver a near word-perfect version.</p> <p>\"I want to tell you my story,\" he said. \"I want to tell you who I am. What I believe. And why I have a deep conviction that together we can change this country. My conviction is rooted in my family's story, a story that starts 1,000 miles from here, because the Milibands haven't sat under the same oak tree for the last five hundred years.\"</p> <p><strong>Family</strong></p> <p>He said he would not have been standing before the Labour conference were it not for the \"compassion and tolerance\" Britain had shown to his parents after they escaped the Holocaust. His mother, Marion, had been given refuge by nuns in Poland. His late father, Ralph, a Marxist academic, escaped to Britain from Belgium.</p> <p>\"Britain gave me, gave my family, a great gift that my parents never had,\" he said. \"A safe and secure childhood. And you know my parents didn't talk much about their early lives, it was too painful, it hurt too much. The pain of those they lost. The guilt of survivors.</p> <p>\"But I believe that their experience meant they brought up both David and myself differently as a result. Because having struggled for life itself, they instilled in us a sense of duty to ease the struggles of others.\"</p> <p><strong>Schooling</strong></p> <p>He repeatedly mentioned how he was educated at a comprehensive school \u2013 Haverstock in north London \u2013 to contrast his background with that of the prime minister, David Cameron. Watched by his former English teacher, Chris Dunne, he said: \"I went to my local comprehensive with people from all backgrounds \u2026 I wouldn't be standing on this stage today without my comprehensive school education.</p> <p><strong>Ruth First</strong></p> <p>As the son of one of the world's leading Marxist political scientists, Miliband became familiar with major political figures from across the world. His memory of Ruth First, the murdered anti-apartheid campaigner, is seared in his mind.</p> <p>\"The image I remember is of somebody vivacious, full of life, full of laughter,\" he said. First visited the Miliband family home in Primrose Hill when he was 12, shortly before she was assassinated.</p> <p>\"And then I remember a few months later coming down to breakfast and seeing my mum in tears because Ruth First had been murdered by a letter bomb from the South African secret police. Murdered for being part of the anti-apartheid movement. Now I didn't understand the ins and outs of it, but I was shocked. I was angry. I knew that wasn't the way the world was meant to be. I knew I had a duty to do something about it.\"</p> <p><strong>Faith</strong></p> <p>Miliband, who has said he has a Jewish identity but not in a spiritual sense, said that First's death had helped him forge his own faith \u2013 \"not a religious faith, but a faith nonetheless\".</p> <p>\"So here is my faith. I believe we have a duty to leave the world a better place than we found it. I believe we cannot shrug our shoulders at injustice, and just say that's the way the world is. And I believe that we can overcome any odds if we come together as people.\"</p> <p><strong>One nation</strong></p> <p>The spirit of Britain's Olympic heroes, from \"Zara Phillips the grand-daughter of a parachuting Queen, to a boy born in Somalia, called Mo Farah\", rekindled an old spirit in which Britain came together, he said.</p> <p>Miliband then cast himself as today's guardian of the one nation tradition whose father was the 19th century novelist and Tory prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. He joked how Disraeli, as leader of the opposition, took three hours and consumed two bottles of brandy when he set out his vision, just across the road at Manchester Free Trade Hall in April 1872.</p> <p>\"It was a vision of Britain. A vision of a Britain where patriotism, loyalty, dedication to the common cause courses through the veins of all and nobody feels left out. It was a vision of Britain coming together to overcome the challenges we faced.</p> <p>\"Disraeli called it 'one nation'. One nation. We heard the phrase again as the country came together to defeat fascism. And we heard it again as Clement Attlee's Labour government rebuilt Britain after the war.\"</p> <p><strong>Attack on David Cameron</strong></p> <p>The prime minister has abandoned any claims to be a one nation leader after cutting taxes for millionaires, Miliband said. \"But there is one thing that this government might have claimed to be good at, and that is competence. Because after all, they think they're born to rule. So maybe they'd be good at it. Have you ever seen a more incompetent, hopeless, out of touch, U-turning, pledge-breaking, make it up as you go along, back of the envelope, miserable shower than this prime minister and this government?\"</p> <p><strong>Jokes</strong></p> <p>Miliband peppered his speech with personal jokes relating to his family. He said that his late father would have been delighted by his tabloid nickname. \"My late father, as some of you know, wouldn't agree with many of the things I stand for. He would've loved the idea of 'Red Ed'. But he would have been a little bit disappointed that it isn't true.\"</p> <p>Miliband also recounted how his son Daniel, aged three, had pleaded with him to talk about urged him to talk about dinosaurs in his speech. \"I want dinosaurs! I want dinosaurs, I want flying dinosaurs! I want dinosaurs that eat people daddy,\" Miliband said quoting his son in his speech. \"No Daniel,\" he replied. \"We tried predators last year.\"</p> <h2>Remembering your lines</h2> <p>'Doing the dickies', (thespian slang for remembering your words) is a mystical knack that all performers must acquire if they're to survive in live theatre. No retakes, idiot cards or autocue when you're appearing in front of an audience.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Paul</strong> will be here from around 7.30pm. In the meantime, why not read Dom Fifield's feature on Nordsjaelland:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tumbleweed will presumably drift through the streets of Farum on Tuesdaynight. Ticket sales suggest the inhabitants of the North Zealand town will have upped sticks to the capital's Parken Stadium, almost 15 miles away, to celebrate Nordsjaelland's unlikely 'home' debut in the Champions League against the holders, Chelsea, suitable visitors for a landmark occasion. There is a sense of disbelief in these parts that any of this is actually happening. Roberto Di Matteo's side are partypoopers at a celebration.</p> <p>What makes the scenario all the more remarkable is that Nordsjaelland have been in existence for 21 years, and have courted scandal and financial catastrophe already in that brief time. The Wild Tigers sprung from the merger of Farum Idraetsklub and Stavnsholt FC, their rise through the domestic divisions initially overseen by Farum's mayor, Peter Brixtofte, until his chairmanship was tarnished when it emerged he had abused his position to overpay private companies to provide council services in return for sponsorship monies for the club.</p> <p>Farum Boldklub, as it was then known, was close to bankruptcy when Brixtofte resigned \u2013 he was subsequently jailed \u2013 before a local businessman, Allan Pedersen, invested in the set-up. Boldsklub became FC Nordsjaelland in 2003 to mark a clean break, even if his own chairmanship has since been tinged in controversy after he bought the club from his holding company, AKP Holdings, just prior to the latter slipping into administration. The dispute over that sale is ongoing and will be heard in the country's supreme court, so to have claimed a first Superliga title last season amid that backdrop of turmoil was a staggering achievement. Kasper Hjulmand's team may have lost their opening game 2-0 at Shakhtar Donetsk, but they are an unknown quantity at this level.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/oct/01/nordsjaelland-chelsea-champions-league\">Read more...</a></p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br><strong>Nordsjaelland: </strong>Hansen; Parkhurst, Okore, Runje, Mtiliga; Adu, Nordstrand, Stokholm; Lorentzen, Beckerman, John<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Villadsen, Christiansen, Christensen, Gundelach, Laudrup, Ticinovic, Petry</p> <p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech; Ivanovic, David Luiz, Cahill, Cole; Ramires, Lampard; Moses, Oscar, Mata; Torres<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Turnbull, Romeu, Mikel, Hazard, Terry, Azpilicueta, Bertrand</p> <p><strong>Ref: </strong>M Strahonja (Croatia)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Roberto Di Matteo:</strong> Got to admire Roberto Di Matteo's man-management so far this season. Not only does he, along with time, appear to be tactfully ushering Frank Lampard towards the fringes, but he is also showing no fear when it comes to dropping under-performing players. Eden Hazard has been irrelevant in the last two matches and has been deservedly benched for tonight so that Victor Moses can play after some encouraging displays off as a substitute so far. This is probably the strongest possible Chelsea line-up tonight. Am I forgetting someone?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.43pm: And now, an email from Philip Podolsky: \"Let's spare a moment's thought for the newly retired Michael Ballack, a great footballer for Bayer Leverkusen whose most memorable moment at Chelsea was <a href=\"http://deepwish.com/images/old/6a00e54ef2975b883301156f8975cd970c-pi.jpg\">angrily chasing uncle Fester across the pitch</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> The Danes, whom, in deference to the cliche already used several times by Sky's commentary outfit, we will henceforth called David, begin the battle against the London-based Goliath.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> David remains true to his philosophy and tries to build calmly from the back. He pieces together a decent move before it founders near the Chelsea box. Hmmn. This David riff isn't working, is it? Let's stop.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Chelsea exploit some very defending, as Torres and Moses combine in the box before feeding Oscar, who sends a skimmer a couple of yards wide from a tight angle.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> That's a magnificent clearance by Okore. Moses seemed certain to nod the ball into the net after Oscar stood a cross up at the back post ... but the defender stole in to beat the striker to it and nod against the upright and wide.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> The bookies fancy they know something that is not at all obvious from the opening exchanges: Chelsea to keep a clean sheet is 2.3 on a certain online gambling facilitator, which suggests they think the Danes are going to score.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Oh Torres! His mojo is well and truly banjaxed! The ball ricocheted off Moses into the Spaniard's path and he had a clear run on goal, or could even have shot straight away from 25 yards. Instead he tried to twist needlessly past a defender ... and lost the ball.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Okore returns to the pitch with a Terry Butcher-style bandage around his head after injuring himself making that heroic clearance several minutes ago.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong>Not quite Harry Potter-esque from the Danes but a decent spell from them all the same, as they stroke the ball around and move Chelsea about promisingly. The spell is lifted when John loses his patience and fires a reckless shot high and wide from 22 yards.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> They have an admirable approach to playing, these Nordsjaelland lads. Swansea-esque insofar as they are all comfortable and progressive on the ball. And that approach has just won them a corner after a long-range shot is deflected behind. Naturally, they take the corner short. But after some more tidy interplay, Mtiliga lofts it into the box and Cech claims easily.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Moses has not made the most of his starting opportunity so far: he has given the ball away several times through hefty touches. And, indeed, a certain scrappiness is beginning to infect Chelsea's play, in contrast to the home side who are gaining in confidence and style.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> That's an outstanding block by Cole, who hurls himself in front of Lorentzen to prevent the forward from shooting from close range after a flowing move from the increasingly impressive hosts.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> A botched back-header by Runje gives Torres a sniff of a chance. The Spaniards wants to fill his nostrils, but the keeper parries his 20-yard shot.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> The crowd are starting to ol\u00e9, just recognition for Nordsjaelland's slickness. For Chelsea, the importance of suppressing this the uppity Danes is underlined by news from the other match in this group: Shakhtar have taken an away lead against Juventus.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Di Matteo's decision to bring back Lampard for this game is not looking clever at the moment: Chelsea could do with Mikel out there, as they are struggling to break up the Danes' tidy play.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Juventus have equalised against Shakhtar, thanks to Bonucci.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> This is highly commendable from Nordsjaelland, and deeply lame by Chelsea. The game could go either way.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Nordsjaeeland 0-1 Chelsea (Mata 33')</strong> Way to banish lameness! Torres won possession deep in Danish territory, robbing the defender in much the same way that he robbed Laurent Koscielny on a couple of occasions on Saturday. He could have stormed through on goal himself but instead he tapped the ball sideways to Lampard who also could have taken a shot himself. But instead he laid the ball into the path of Mata, who finished smartly from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Chelsea seek another. Oscar and Mata combine nicely around the box before being crowded out by the defence. But Chelsea quickly regain possession. The hosts are looking crestfallen since the goal.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> The home right-back, Parkhurst, has torn forward to good effect several times already in this match and his latest venture culminated in a good cross that Cahill had to head behind for a corner. Nordsjaelland are re-awakening ...</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> John overhits an intended pass to Beckmann as Nordsjaelland threatened to break through again.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Superb defending by Okore again! Moses burst past him and seemed certain to carry on into the box and take on the keeper .. but the defender showed tremendous speed and strength to get back and dispossess the forward.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Torres finds himself one-on-one with the keeper! And fluffs the chance, hitting a tame effort straight at the stopper.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time: </strong>Nordsjaeelend are deservedly applauded off the pitch after an accomplished display. Accomplished up to a point, that is, since they look ropey in the final third. Chelsea's demonstrated their superiority in that sector with a very smartly taken goal. That has been the difference so far.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> That's odd. I could have sworn that the Danes kicked off in the first half and yet here they are doing the same again in the second. Either I am losing my mind or the ref, Chelsea and Nordsjaelland are all losing theirs. Yep, it must be the latter.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Hansen curries off his line to smother the ball as Torres attempted to latch on to a through-ball.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Ivanovic shows his savviness to track the run of John and intercept a well-intentioned through-ball. Chelsea then rumble forward and win a corner through Moses.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Lampard sends in a wicked in-swinging corner and Hansen does well to paw it off the head of Ivanovic.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Fine play by John, who received the ball wide on the left and then cut inside, leaving Ramires in his wake, and cracking a fierce low shot inches wide from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Chelsea are spending more time on the ball than they did for most of the first half and they look like they could pierce the opposing defence at any moment. But the Danes carry a threat going forward too. The match is far from over.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Moses' evening isn't getting any better: again he received the ball in a good area but fails to beat his man, this time Parkhurst doing what Okore has done on several occasions and out-thinking and even outmuscling the burly youth.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Okore showcases yet another of his qualities, striding forward before floating a lovely pass over the Chelsea defence for Beckmann, who attempts to nod the ball over Cech from 12 yards but instead nuts it over the bar. That was their best chance of the match, and a warning to Chelsea that a second goal is required by them.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> The pressure is mounting from the minnows, who force Cech into an awkward save, Stockholm making him punch an 18-yard shot clear.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Chelsea change: Moses' time is up: after a poor performance, he is replaced by Eden Hazard. The home side make a change too: Ticinovic on, Nordstrand off.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> A lull, punctuated only by whistling from the ref for minor infringements.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> So much for Chelsea's swish new style: other than for their snazzy goal, Chelsea have performed pretty much like last season in this tournament, albeit with slightly less chaos in their box. But the opposition have had most of the ball.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> What a marvelous run by John, thwarted by a marvelous save from Cech! The winger hared down the left and then cut inside and curled a delicious shot towards the far corner ... but Cech hurled himself across the goal to push it on to the post with one hand! Cole then blocked the follow-up shot from Beckmann.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Nice move by Chelsea, featuring pleasing contributions from Ivanovic and Mata. But Okore was on hand again to foil the visitors, heading away just Torres prepared to volley into the net from close range.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Runje booked for chopping down Ramires at the edge of the box. This freekick is a prime opportunity to Chelsea to kill off the underdogs' resistance ...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Mata daba a woeful freekick into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Nordsjaelland 0-2 Chelsea (David Luiz 80')</strong> That was wibbly wobbly wonder from David Luiz! After Mata botched the previous freekick, Mata stepped up to take the next one, which was over near the left-hand corner off the box, about 25 yards out. The Brazilian took a lengthy run-up and then slasshed across the ball, utterly bamboozling the keeper with a shot that wobbled one way and the other before crashing in off the near post!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Nordsjaelland 0-3 Chelsea (Mata 82')</strong> Another lovely goal from a player who has started the season in superb style. Chelsea tried to tippy-tappy their way through their opponents and it kind of worked as, after some slick passing by them, a defender intervenes only to unwittingly play it into the path of the ever-moving Mata, who slotted it past the keeper from 16 yards.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Chelsea substitution: Mata toddles off, Mikel wanders on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Home change: Lorentzen off, Andreas \"Son of\" Laudrup on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Lampard tries to give the scoreline an even more inaccurate appearance by lashing one in from 30 yards. But it whizzes over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Nordsjaelland 0-4 Chelsea (Ramires 89')</strong> Penetrative intricacy by Chelsea, the very sort that Nordsjaelland have lacked in an otherwise splendid performance. Oscar exchange clever passes in the box with Torres before stabbing the ball across goal to Ramires, who tapped in from two yards.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Don't judge a match by the scoreline. This was a lost close than the margin of Chelsea's victory suggests. Indeed, if Petr Cech had not produced an astounding save in the 74th minute to deny the Danes a deserved equaliser, the European champions might have been humiliated. As it turned out, a late flurry of goals - all of them nicely taken - put the seal on an important win.</p>",
  "<p>The new law criminalising squatting starts to bite (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/first-squatter-jailed-new-law\" title=\"\">First squatter jailed under new law</a>, 27 September), and what a chilling headline that is \u2013 accepting as inevitable that this is just the first. We see a young man, an apprentice bricklayer, imprisoned for three months, and his two housemates awaiting sentence. It seems likely that he will lose his apprenticeship and be discharged from prison \u2013 homeless and with a criminal record.</p> <p>There are almost a million empty properties in the country, while there are countless homeless or appallingly badly housed people. Housebuilding is falling far short of meeting demand. Many property owners see their houses simply as financial assets rather than homes for people to live in, and so are content to keep them empty while their investment grows in value. This is immoral.</p> <p>It is difficult to grasp the thinking behind the fierce application of this iniquitous law. Clearly it can only swell both the numbers of people experiencing homelessness and the population of our already overcrowded prisons. In addition, the consequences of handing out criminal records to people whose behaviour up until this month has been completely outside the criminal law, will blight lives and destroy the reputations of potentially thousands of ordinary people. Despite attempts to demonise those who take empty houses back into use, the truth is that the majority of squatters are responsible people who, in a time of real housing crisis, squat as a last ditch attempt to prevent homelessness.</p> <p>The Simon Community has been living and working with poor and homeless people since 1963, and we deplore this strategy. We call for a more humane and effective approach to social policy. It is deeply saddening and indeed shameful that this coalition government, faced with a problem like this, cannot do better than effectively to criminalise poverty and homelessness. This was not in either party's manifesto. No one voted for it. Consultation prior to the change in the law produced overwhelming opposition to the measure. Crucially, this approach does not reflect the views of the vast majority of people in this country who are decent and compassionate and who when presented with people in need would not consider imprisonment to be the answer.<br><strong>Bob Baker</strong><br><em>Director, The Simon Community</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Larry Elliott (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/30/labour-legacy-balls-economic-credibility\" title=\"\">Riding high \u2013 now Labour needs to say something</a>, 1 October) tells us \"Five million people are on housing waiting lists yet housebuilding is at its lowest since the 1920s\". In a market economy, this is only understandable if we accept that the misery of homelessness and often substandard private renting is acceptable to politicians because 70% of voters are homeowners. But it is not only the interest of voters that politicians have to appease; perhaps, more importantly, the banks have about \u00a31 trillion of outstanding mortgages. So when first Grant Shapps (when minister for housing) and now Ed Balls promise to build 16,000 and 100,000 homes respectively at \u00a325,000 each, you can be sure that nothing will happen, because the land banks will not be made available for cheap homes. As must be obvious, the only way to provide badly needed homes is to tax unused land with planning consent and remove VAT from repairs and maintenance, which would help to make the million empty homes habitable.<br><strong>Henry Pryor</strong><br><em>Hay-on-Wye</em></p>",
  "<p>Christian Louboutin has secured the trademark for the distinctive red used on the soles of shoes he designs, and the retailer Harrods has a trademark over the shade of green synonymous with its brand. Now confectionery giant Cadbury has won a lengthy court battle giving it the right to the trademark for the distinctive colour of purple it uses for the packaging of its milk chocolate.</p> <p>The UK-based chocolate company \u2013 acquired by the food business Kraft in 2010 \u2013 applied for the trademark in October 2004, registering its right to use the colour purple (Pantone 2685c). But its rival Nestl\u00e9 argued that colours could not be practically trademarked for commercial advantage.</p> <p>Rejecting Nestle's appeal, Judge Colin Birss said in the high court in London: \"The evidence clearly supports a finding that purple is distinctive of Cadbury for milk chocolate.\"</p> <p>He noted in his ruling that Cadbury has used purple for its Dairy Milk bars since 1914.</p> <p>The ruling means that the particular shade of purple is now specific to milk chocolate bars and tablets, milk chocolate for eating, and also drinking chocolate.</p> <p>Cadbury said in a statement: \"We welcome the decision of the high court which allows us to register as a trade mark and protect our famous colour purple across a range of milk chocolate products. Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for more than a century and the British public have grown up understanding its link with our chocolate.\"</p> <p>Paul Medlicott, head of FMCG at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, commented: \"Trademarks of names and logos are familiar to most businesses, but the high court's ruling in favour of Cadbury shows the increasing importance of colour trademarks. Cadbury sought to, and has succeeded in, trademarking its distinctive purple colour used in relation to its products. It is now able to prevent its competitors using that same colour. The challenge faced by Cadbury in getting the colour registered as a trademark is evident when you see that their trademark application was first filed in 2004.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police chiefs have been accused of attempting to hide away a potentially embarrassing court case launched by women who say they were tricked into forming long-term, intimate relationships with undercover officers.</p> <p>The women have begun legal action against the police, alleging undercover officers \"deliberately and knowingly deceived\" them into the relationships of up to six years by concealing their identity.</p> <p>The women, who say they have suffered immense emotional trauma and pain, want the case heard at the high court. But lawyers for the Metropolitan police have applied to move the case into a little-known tribunal.</p> <p>If the case goes to tribunal, the women will get no automatic right to an oral hearing, nor the chance to cross-examine witnesses and see the evidence, nor read the reasons for losing if that were the verdict, nor appeal against the verdict.</p> <p>Three women who started the legal action say they had relationships with Mark Kennedy, the undercover police officer who spied on the environmental movement for seven years.</p> <p>In legal papers, one woman says she had a relationship with Kennedy between 2004 and 2010; another says their relationship lasted for seven months in 2005.</p> <p>A third, who says that she had a relationship with him between 2003 and 2005, told a BBC radio documentary on Tuesday : \"He was a serving police officer and he never should have touched me whatever the circumstance.\"</p> <p>The police are also understood to be attempting to transfer to tribunal another case in which a second undercover officer had relationships with two campaigners.</p> <p>The move by Scotland Yard comes amid an intense dispute over government plans to extend secret hearings into civil courts in cases involving national security.</p> <p>Police chiefs have faced a series of criticisms over their 40-year operation to run spies in political groups, including allegations that they failed to disclose crucial evidence which wrongly convicted campaigners, and authorised undercover officers to give false evidence in court.</p> <p>But much controversy has been over the \"unmasked\" undercover officers who have admitted, or been accused of, having sex or long-term relationships with the activists they were sent to spy on.</p> <p>Police chiefs have claimed that the spies were not permitted \"under any circumstances\" to sleep with the campaigners, as such conduct was \"grossly unprofessional\" and \"never acceptable\".</p> <p>The group of women who last year started legal action against police chiefs have alleged that the deceit by partners who turned out to be spies was \"deeply degrading\" and caused them psychiatric and psychological injuries including depression, trauma, anxiety, anger and difficulties in trusting people again.</p> <p>At a high court hearing before judges next month they will challenge the police's application to have the human rights case moved to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.</p> <p>This tribunal was set up to adjudicate complaints by the public about the intelligence services and the use of surveillance powers by official bodies.</p> <p>According to its website, the tribunal, which says it operates in a \"necessary ring of secrecy\", says it is under no obligation to hold oral hearings, although complainants can ask for one.</p> <p>No information or documents which have been provided to the tribunal, or even the fact that they have been provided, can be disclosed to complainants.</p> <p>The tribunal also states that complainants cannot appeal against a verdict in the UK, but would have to take their case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.</p> <p>Harriet Wistrich, the women's solicitor, said the police were \"trying to hide away, in a secret tribunal, terrible stories\" of those whose privacy was violated by undercover officers and their handlers. She said the women wanted to know how much information about their intimate relationships with the spies was passed on to police chiefs.</p> <p>She added that the police could try to move to the tribunal the cases of another five women who say they had relationships with undercover officers before the 2000 Human Rights Act was introduced.</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said police had \"received details of a number of claims regarding individuals allegedly acting in undercover roles\".</p> <p>He added: \"They are very unusual, complex, areas of law.

  "<p>Iran's beleaguered president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has blamed the plummeting value of the national currency on a \"psychological war\" perpetrated by enemies abroad and opponents at home.</p> <p>Speaking as the rial hit an all-time low against the dollar, Ahmadinejad told reporters that the slump was the result of the \"temporary problem\" of the international embargo on importing Iranian oil. He said sanctions would only pressure the \"people of Iran and not its government\" and would not force Tehran to change its nuclear policy.</p> <p>\"It's a battle,\" he told reporters in Tehran. \"Enemies have managed to reduce our oil sales but hopefully we will compensate for this.\" He rejected suggestions that the crisis was the result of his government's economic incompetence.</p> <p>\"Are these currency fluctuations because of economic problems? The answer is no,\" Ah said. \"Is this because of government policies? Never&#xa0;\u2026 It's due to psychological pressure. It's a psychological battle.\" While he was speaking, the rial fell to a new record low.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad said Iranians would not retreat from the nuclear issue. \"If anyone thinks that they can put pressure on Iran [to force us to change our policy], they are certainly wrong and they must correct their behaviour,\" he said.</p> <p>The Iranian president accused his conservative rivals of complicity in exacerbating the crisis over the rial, saying they had contributed to the situation by launching a propaganda campaign against him. The president pointed the finger at Ali Larijani, the parliament speaker, and criticised him for giving an interview in which Larijani said mismanagement accounted for 80% of the problems and the sanctions 20%, comparing government policy to \"Robin Hoodian economics\".</p> <p>\"The respected head of parliament should come forward and help instead of giving interviews,\" Ahmedinejad said.</p> <p>The deputy speaker, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, echoed Larijani, saying on Tuesday that the government's only enemy was \"illusion\". At least one Iranian MP accused the government of manipulating the country's foreign currency reserves amid speculation that Ahmadinejad might be summoned for questioning.</p> <p>\"The president has deliberately kept the market agitated,\" said Elias Naderan, of the parliamentary economics committee, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. \"I really don't know what Mr Ahmadinejad is thinking. What plan does he have, what is his expectation of the system, and how does he plan to manage this disorder?\" Despite several attempts to calm the markets, the government has failed to bring the rial under control. It has lost at least 57% of its value in the past three months after US and EU sanctions targeting the regime's nuclear programme came into effect in July.</p> <p>On Monday the rial experienced its biggest devaluation in a single day, dropping more than 15%.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a senior official indicated that the government was relying on its security services to curb speculators, who are blamed for the rial's drop. It was not clear how the move could be implemented as previous attempts to get the police to enforce the official exchange rate have failed.</p> <p>\"We have greater expectations that the security services will control the branches and sources of disruption in the exchange market,\" he said, according to the Fars news agency. \"Brokers in the market are also pursuing the increase in price because for them it will be profitable, and there is nobody to control them.\"</p> <p>Many Iranians have lost faith in the rial and are now rushing to convert their assets and properties to foreign currency and gold.</p> <p>Meanwhile, an opposition website, <a href=\"http://www.kaleme.com/\" title=\"\">kaleme.com</a>, reported that Tehran's bazaar was planning to go on strike on Wednesday in reaction to the currency crisis and government plans to send security services to restore calm in the market.</p> <p>In his first domestic press conference since his visit to New York last week, the president also reacted to the speech made by Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, at the UN general assembly, in which he used a bomb illustration to draw red lines for Tehran's nuclear programme. Ahmadinejad said the diagram was \"childish and primitive\" and insulted the audience.</p> <p>\"That drawing was only good for children, he should learn to draw better,\" he joked.</p> <p>Despite questions on his UN speech, Israel and Syria, the press conference was mostly dominated by the currency crisis and the internal power struggle between Ahmadinejad and his opponents in parliament and the judiciary.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad expressed regret over the arrest last week of his media adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, and criticised his culture minister for speaking against a reformist newspaper, Shargh, which was closed down at the same time over a cartoon deemed insulting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the French embassy in Tehran was attacked by a small group of people protesting against an anti-Islam film that infuriated the Muslim world for mocking the prophet Muhammad. About 30 protesters were said to have smashed a police guard post and thrown stones, though no casualties were reported.</p>",
  "<p>The taskforce charged with prosecuting US banks behind the excesses of the housing boom and bust has brought its first case \u2013 to mixed reviews.</p> <p>President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/obama-housing-crisis-unit_n_1229617.html?1327453577\">appointed New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman </a>to head the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group in January in his state of the union address. \"This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Late on Monday, Schneiderman announced his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/jpmorgan-sued-bear-stearns-mortgage\">first case would be against Bear Stearns</a>, once one of Wall Street's biggest players and now part of JP Morgan.</p> <p>According to the complaint, Bear Stearns and its lending unit, EMC Mortgage, defrauded investors who purchased mortgage securities packaged by the companies from 2005 through 2007.</p> <p>The suit argues that wrongdoing was widespread at the firm, and that Bear Stearns made material misrepresentations about the quality of the loans in the securities, ignoring warning signs of trouble ahead as they sold them to investors. The same allegations have been made in several private lawsuits brought against JP Morgan.</p> <p>John Coffee, a professor at Columbia law school, said it was a \"significant move\" but said cynics were questioning both the timing and the target. \"It's about time there was action, and this is a much broader case than we have seen so far, much broader than the risk-averse SEC [the US's top financial watchdog] would be prepared to bring,\" he said. \"But it's Bear Stearns, not JP Morgan,\" he said.</p> <p>Coffee said Schneiderman had recently been eclipsed by Benjamin Lawsky, head of the recently formed New York department of financial services. Lawsky brought a high-profile case against Standard Chartered in August over allegations of money laundering.</p> <p>The case is similar to a number of private actions that have already been brought. In a statement, JP Morgan has claimed the case was brought \"without ever offering us an opportunity to rebut the claims and without developing a full record \u2014 instead relying on recycled claims already made by private plaintiffs.\"</p> <p>Coffee said: \"They wanted to bring this case quickly. A cynic might say they wanted to bring it before the election to show they are doing something.\"</p> <p>Peter Henning, a professor of law at Wayne State University, said the case was important because it was the first broad action brought by Obama's team. \"The case says this was a pattern of behavior, not some small specific wrongdoing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But then it's an action against a defunct firm. You aren't going to see any significant reforms here,\" he said. Henning also said he did not expect any money to back to mortgage holders. The case is likely to lead to a settlement that will be paid out to other large institutions, not individuals.</p> <p>\"If they are leading with their strongest suit, my reaction is largely a shrug of the shoulders,\" Henning said.</p> <p>Annemarie McAvoy of Fordham University, a former federal prosecutor, said this case was likely to be the \"opening salvo\" in a series of cases. \"Clearly there were a lot of problems. It hasn't been as easy for regulators to bring cases as they would have liked.\" </p> <p>\"But it wasn't JP Morgan that was responsible here,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>It was my enthusiasm, as a GP, to ensure my patients get the care they need, that led me to take up a role as champion for commissioning at the <a href=\"http://www.rcgp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal College of General Practitioners</a>. I was eager to engage in a practical way with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/interactive/2012/mar/15/nhs-reforms-100-voices-interactive\" title=\"\">government's health reforms</a>, and this position, which included sharing good practice and educating GPs around the country about effective and ethical commissioning, seemed an appropriate way to do it.</p> <p>Commissioning for healthcare involves matching the health priorities for local populations with services, choosing who to provide them \u2013 be that an established local NHS hospital or \"any qualified provider\" \u2013 and negotiating a contract for the level of service agreed. Like many doctors I welcomed the fact that GPs would be in charge of commissioning as a devolution of power to those who had frontline experience of delivering care. However, in the last year the enthusiasm has seeped out of me as the realities of trying to commission health services with an inadequate budget have become all too apparent.</p> <p>The NHS in England is expected to achieve \u00a320bn in \"efficiency savings\" by 2015. The consequence of this squeeze is that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-19353569\" title=\"\">trusts have begun to focus on reducing staffing costs</a> as a way to save money. The recently formed South-West Consortium of 20 trusts has made it very clear how intends to make the efficiency savings. Simply put, it wants nursing and medical staff to do more for less.</p> <p>Those of us who work in healthcare are often willing to go the extra mile. From my own experience I agree that there is a need for longer patient consultations. I have done this in my own practice but at personal cost to myself and my children, who now need to get up before dawn and arrive at school as early as there is supervision for them in the playground so that I can start my morning surgery earlier and offer my patients 15-minute appointments. But the aggressive stance of some employers and a government that has frozen pay and raided our pensions will undermine the goodwill shown by staff.</p> <p>For clinicians to be able to offer more time to address the needs of an older population with a limited pool of doctors will require new models of care. GPs are best placed to devise these models with advice from our experts in public health and alongside the available use of social care. The English <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/20/nhs-reform-health-bill-passes-vote\" title=\"\">NHS Health and Social Care Act</a> became legislation arguably with that blueprint; however, GP commissioning is beholden to budgets that are allocated by the Treasury and the political diktat that enshrines the market as the best way to improve quality through competition and choice. In my experience patients, particularly elderly patients, don't want a dizzying array of choice. They just want high-quality care.</p> <p>Clinical commissioning groups (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/datablog/2012/may/10/clinical-commissioning-groups-mapped\" title=\"\">CCGs</a>) are being set up to provide choice. This is instead of building partnerships between established voluntary groups and local NHS hospitals and social care to deliver joined-up, co-ordinated care. Choice and plurality have done nothing to address health inequalities. How is a patient with no private transport able to \"choose\" to go to a private provider with a shorter waiting list if it is inaccessible by public transport?</p> <p>The smokescreen of the act has also allowed politicians to hide from the real debate that needs to take place. Can the nation afford comprehensive health provision, including every new medicine that is developed? And if not, how do we ration healthcare in a way that is fair? CCGs should not be the scapegoats for rationing. Tough decisions about what services can and can't be provided are needed. How will the typical MP react when the CCG removes the cross-subsidy to its local hospital, causing it to close? With a megaphone, I suspect.</p> <p>General practice is straining at the seams as many of our most experienced GPs spend hours in commissioning meetings. Telling clinicians to innovate and improve the health service when the primary focus is to do things more cheaply is simply setting them up to fail. If CCGs fail, commissioning of our health service will fall into the hands of corporate commissioners who will further open up the NHS to profit-making healthcare providers.</p> <p>Sadly, like many GPs I have become completely disillusioned, so much so that I recently resigned from my role as a champion for commissioning. This wasn't over anything I had been asked to do, nor for any single specific CCG directive. It was more that I do not want to be an instrument of the privatisation of the NHS. I shall never champion that.</p>",
  "<p>Since the start of this year, I have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/search?q=Brett+Kershaw+&amp;section=higher-education-network\" title=\"\">blogging at regular intervals</a> about moving to Qatar to work at University College London's (UCL) new campus. Our journey from a small team of staff in a sparse corridor of offices, to a fully operational university campus with students is complete. It has been a very rewarding, if sometimes exhausting, process and last month we welcomed our first intake of 32 students from 13 nations.</p> <p>It's still very early days for <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/qatar/\" title=\"\">UCL Qatar</a>, but we are on course for growth and hopefully success, so I feel able to reflect on lessons learnt that may come in handy for other UK institutions that are considering opening a branch campus in the Middle East or beyond.</p> <p>It is hard to comprehend how much work was and is needed to set up a branch campus from scratch and get to this stage. When I arrived in Qatar in late 2011, relatively little was in place apart from offices and grand plans. Our HR manager was already on the ground and had made significant progress in recruiting academic and administrative staff. It had of course already taken UCL senior management a lengthy period of time to make this vision a reality. We've seen milestones reached, from the basics such as purchasing computers and setting up an IT network, to the formal approval of the academic content for our degree programmes, and then on to opening our admissions process and gradual profile raising activities. Our first events have taken place \u2013 public lectures on all things cultural heritage \u2013 attracting audiences form across Doha and beyond, which have really served to put us on the map locally.</p> <p>The week in the run up to the arrival of our students was a particularly busy and anxious time, as we scrambled to get all our final arrangements in place. For me this meant welcome packs for our students and helping to piece together the itinerary for freshers week \u2013 a great British tradition that we successfully implemented in the Gulf, albeit without the hangovers! For other colleagues, it meant organising a meet-and-greet collection service for our international arrivals at Doha Airport.</p> <p>And that's been one of the fun things about being a part of the unique and unusual environment of setting up a branch campus. You may have your role within the organisation, but inevitably you'll have the opportunity to become involved with everything. I've gotten insight into IT, HR, finance and operations that ordinarily I wouldn't gain such exposure to. I've also been able to work very closely with our academics as they built and shaped our degree programmes. Even if every day is likely to throw up an another unexpected curveball, it is a learning experience that cannot be obtained in the usual academic environment of a well-established home campus.</p> <p>Our students are our priority now. As we move into this new phase of our young existence, our staff will work hard to continue to give our students everything they expect from a UCL degree. When we were recruiting students onto our degree programmes we were looking for students who were not only outstanding academically, but also energetic and able to come in and create a dynamic extracurricular environment. A concern for me was how we could create that special student experience that UCL is renowned for. To my great relief, our students have gone above and beyond in these early weeks. Bonds have been created and student societies formed. We'll all be turning out to watch the newly-formed UCL men's football team play their first match in the Education City football league against Texas A&amp;M University. The international students have definitely been enjoying discovering Doha \u2013 they spend their free time socialising in Doha's souqs and taking in the cultural attractions.</p> <p>The student demographics are very exciting. By far the most students, some 30%, come from Qatar itself. But they are learning alongside students from around the globe, from the Americas to Europe and East Asia. Each student brings a unique background \u2013 we have artists, photographers, conservators, scientists, historians and more. They can only benefit, grow and be challenged by this varied learning environment. We have high ambitions for our graduates. We expect them all to go on to be future leaders in the cultural heritage sector, whether it be as archaeologists or museum professionals.</p> <p>As much as building a branch campus is a challenge for a staff member, it is also a bold step for a student. I have to applaud our students for having the faith in us to deliver a programme that matches their high expectations and to be part of the first cohort. They have the unique opportunity to shape their courses for future classes, and their feedback and input will be sought all along the way as we seek to grow our student numbers and continue to attract high quality students from Qatar, the Middle East and all across the globe.</p> <p>To do this, we'll have to demonstrate that our programmes are unique and different. We'll use our location as a key selling point \u2013 Doha is at the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds and is a perfect gateway for students wishing to gain practical exposure to the region. And we've invested in our facilities to ensure that our students have the most modern and equipped labs and teaching spaces, plus an exceptional library collection.</p> <p>For universities out there who are considering a similar international move, I'd say that the experience is well worth it. Obviously, your destination should be chosen carefully, there should be both an existing local gap that your degree programmes can fill, and a genuine thirst amongst the local population for the programmes you offer. In the future, I hope to see another British university out here in Qatar to fly the flag with UCL.</p> <p><em>Brett Kershaw is marketing officer for University College London's Qatar campus.

McGeady floats it in but Celtic clear ... but it comes straight back and Lustig is forced to nod the ball out for another corner. Kallstrom takes this one ... and Celtic eventually scramble it away. But it'll come straight back again ... Celtic are struggling to get out of their own half.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Celtic are trying to steady matters. knocking the ball about a bit and advancing from their hitherto drastically deep positions. Wouldn't go so far as to suggest they are starting to pose a threat but this is progress, at least.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Hooper is all on his lonesome up front for Celtic, whose five-man midfield has so far been unable to make any connection with him. But they have at least begun to make it difficult for Spartak to tear through them. No clear chances for either team so far.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spartak 0-1 Celtic (Hooper 11')</strong> That's a superb strike from a man who has barely touched the ball so far! Wanyama seized possession in midfield to initiate a snappy Celtic attack. Lustig fired a low cross from the right towards the near post, where Hooper, getting the jump on the defence, met it with an immaculate touch to send the ball past the goalkeeper from six yards! A textbook away goals in Europe.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Quick, someone ask Gary Neville is Gary Hooper is close to an England call-up ...</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Celtic are looking accomplished. The goal has given them an energy boost and they are retaining their shape and using the ball well when they get it. Spartak have yet to get a clear sight of goal.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Kallstrom gets too much height on a corner. Pareja attempts to meet it but it's a token effort and his header from 10 yards droops harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> That was dicey for Celtic! Spartak, attacking rather frantically, pinged ball into the box and it ricocheted around a bit before Izaguirre walloped it clear just as Emenike looked set to shoot.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Commons scurries into the box as Celtic mount another break. Get past his man and he'll have a clear shot on goal ... but Pereja foils him with an excellent last-ditch tackle.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Mulgrew sees yellow for booting the ball away after the ref awards Spartak a soft freekick. He could regret that ...</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Solid defending by Wilson, who shepherds the ball back to Forster under pressure from the forward.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Denied! Spartak are starting to look a right shower and Celtic are showing they could hurt them more on the break. After the Russians sloppily lost possession in the opposing half, Izaguirre lashed 50 yards forward before slipping the ball to Samaras, who curled in a sumptuous cross to Hooper. The striker headed into the net and wheeled away in rapture ... only to spot the linesman's flag: he had strayed a yard offside.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Another impressive Celtic break peters out when Lustig sends in a feeble cross.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Lovely cross from Kombarov on the left ... but Emenike, having got away from Wilson, completely misses the ball when attempting to head home from six yards!</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Commons collects the ball some 30 yards from goal. And the best thing he can think of doing is shooting .... 20 yards wide.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min: </strong>Wanyama booked for a sneaky or unwitting trip on De Zeeuw as Spartak tried to launch a counter-attack.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Mulgrew wins a freekick wide on the left. He hoists it into the box but Carloca nuts it away.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Spartak work space on the right well, aided by some slackness from Samaras. Makeew's cross finds Emenike but the Nigerian heads way over.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Brown is having a terrific game in midfield and one of the main reasons why Spartak are finding it hard to build fluently.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> I do believe that was Spartak's first shot on target. And didn't Forster milk it! Pareja wobbled a soft freekick over the wall from 28 yards. It was heading towards the centre of the goal and it looked like the keeper could have got it: but instead he amused himself by diving acrobatically to bat it away with both hands.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spartak 1-1 Celtic (Emenike 42')</strong> A lovely ball over the top by Kallstrom catches out Wilson. Ari, with a brilliant first touch, plays it into the path of Emenike, who hammers it into the net from close range!</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Fine response by Celtic, who win a corner after Makeev almost turned a Lustig cross into his own goal.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Celtic should be ahead. After taking the lead in splendid fashion, they generally kept a rather ordinary looking team at bay without much ado. But one exceptional pass from Kallstrom and momentary shoddiness from the Celtic centrebacks allowed the Russians to equalise.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> The teams are back on the pitch, an essential conditions of play resuming. All set then. \"I sometimes think the stereotype of Samaras as an utter galoot is an exaggeration, but Spartak's goal came straight after Samaras was put clean through, but mucked around in a frankly embarrassing manner until he'd lost possession,\" notes Niall Harden. \"I'm never going to ignore a stereotype again.: Typical Celtic fan.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spartak 2-1 Celtic (48')</strong> That is shambolic from Celtic. De Zeeuw unleashed a shot from 25 yards that took a slight nick off Wilson. IT was headed wide but Forster tried to save it anyway ... and the compounded the misjudgement by fumbling the ball. Ari, reacting faster than any Celt, prodded it back across the face of goal, where Emenike, also reacting faster than the defenders, shunted it into the net from two yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Celtic have looked dangerous on the break since the start of this match but their problem now is that Spartak do not particularly need to come at them any more so there is less scope for rapid counter-attacking.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> McGeady beats Commons down the left and then sends in a teasing cross. Wanyama helps it back to Foster with his chest.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Spartak are nothing special at all. Celtic are well capable of winning this, let alone drawing.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Mulgrew delivers a freekick from the left. Ambrose leaps like a frightened elephant and heads over.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Celtic are nothing special at all. Spartak are well capable of winning this.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Strange refereeing! Mulgrew puts Hooper through before Insaurraide pulled him back at the edge of the area. The ref originally seemed to wave play on and even contemplated booking Hooper for diving. Neil Lennon did The Angry Dance on the sidelines and then, suddenly, the ref copped on and sent off the Spartak player. Who says refs never change their minds? And that The Angry Dance is a waste of time and swear words?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> After a lengthy pow-wow following the red card, Spartak decide to make a substitution: off comes De Zeeuw, on comes Bryzglaov. Any minute now, Celtic will get a chance to take their freekick, which is about 21 yards out.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Mulgrew curls his freekick over the wall, but straight at Pesyakov.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Celtic have plenty of the ball now but Spartak are stacking sandbags around their box. It won't be easy to get through.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Celtic make a substitution before taking a corner, Wanyama jogging off to be replaced by Forrest.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spartak 2-2 Celtic (Kombarov og 71')</strong> Fabulous move by Celtic! Samaras' role was pivotal: a lovely dummy by him foxed the Spartak defence and allowed a Mugrew cross from the left to travel through to Hooper. HE helped it on to Forrest, whose low shot was saved by Pesyakov but rebounded off Kombarov and into the net!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Celtic are going for the win: Spartak are on the rack. A vicious Commons cross is poked behind for another corner, which Spartak defend well.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> McGeady, having done little to catch the eye of the Scottish visitors, is replaced by Dzyuba.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Kombarov, eager for redemption, hurtles down the left and fires in a fierce cross. Forster comes out ... and hold it, for once.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Celtic substitution: Ledley on, Mulgrew off.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Forrest creates space for a cross from the right with a great shuffle, and Pareja has to excel to prevent Hooper connecting from close range. Celtic are doing their utmost to plunder an elusive away win.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Forrest is a proper menace down the right. Another cross from him is cleared. Ledley collects it and sends in a ferocious swirling shot from 28 yards. Brilliant save by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Ledley shows good strength to muscle Ari off the ball and snuff out a rare Spartak attack. And that is Ari's last involvement, as he is replaced by Kozlov.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Brown ... to Commons ... to Hooper. THe striker lets fly from the edge of the box. Saved by Pesyakov. That was another decent move by Celtic, who go tantalisingly close to a first ever away win in the Champions League group stages. Forrest wasn't involved in that move but if there is to be a winner, you can be sure he'll have a role to play in that: he has Kombarov on toast.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Spartak 2-3 Celtic (Samaras 90')</strong> That's a superb goal! Celtic showed patience and precision to work Izaguirre into a crossing position and the delivery was excellent ... but Samaras' header was even better, as he Larssoned it into the far corner from 10 yards!</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Mayhem in the Celtic box as Spartak threaten to poop the party! Wilson eventually hoofs the ball over the bar to settle Celtic's nerves, slightly. I haven't seen how much added time there will be, but there should be around six minutes given the number of stoppages in this half.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Forrest wisely ekes out a throw-in down near the Spartak corner flag ....</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> Sod wasting time: Forrest almost notches a fourth goal! Celtic were zipping the ball about to the dismay of their hosts, when Brown played it to Forrest and suddenly the forward was in. He shunted it past the keeper but it was cleared.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Celtic win away in the Champions League group stages for the first time ever! (They've previously won away in qualifying matches but apparently that doesn't count, apparently). And they fully deserved. Bouts of sloppiness for the two goals that they conceded notwithstanding, Celtic were the better team and there were some boss individual performances in there: Brown, Mulgrew, Hooper and, when he came on, Forrest, were all tremendous. And Samaras suddenly turned into a sensation towards the end: a beautiful feint for Celtic second goal, and a stupendous header for the winner. Bring on Barcelona!</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney is throwing in the towel. Not on the presidential race, mind you. But in recent weeks, he has tacitly abandoned his strategy of making this election a simple referendum on President Barack Obama's handling of the economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/us/politics/as-economic-argument-sputters-romney-broadens-focus.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times reports</a> that \"rather than focusing on Mr Obama, they plan to stress that voters need to make a choice between two men with different visions of the world.\" This means \"Mr Romney intends to hit the White House with a series of arguments \u2013 on energy, healthcare, taxes, spending and a more direct attack on Mr Obama's foreign policy record\", rather than focusing like a laser beam on jobs and the economy.</p> <p>In other words, Romney is now abandoning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/mitt-romney-conservative-pundit-roundup\">his framing of the campaign</a> in favor of Obama's. Why?</p> <p>To some extent, this is because Romney's monomaniac focus on the economy didn't work as well as Bill Clinton's in 1992. Romney's vast personal wealth and the specifics of his business background \u2013 private equity and venture capitalism \u2013 have made it more difficult for him to seem in touch with the concerns of those with financial struggles. Second, the recession and the financial meltdown both started under George W Bush, with whom Romney bears some resemblance on policy, complicating the argument that Obama is solely responsible.</p> <p>A presidential candidate also needs to have detailed policy positions on the whole range of issues facing the country, not just economics. Moreover, it would be political malpractice to ignore the president's (mis)handling of Libya. But with this caveat: a campaign needs an overarching theme.</p> <p>The biggest problem is that Romney simply did a poor job making the economic argument. He unveiled a 59-point plan that was too long and unfocused to resonate. Then, when it was distilled to five points, it was still forgettable \u2013 even if you aren't Rick Perry. The rest of the details were supposed to be filled in by his choice of running mate. But the Romney tax plan isn't exactly Paul Ryan's, and the Democrats gleefully attacked Ryan's Medicare plan.</p> <p>That was as far as the positive case for Romney as an economic problem-solver went. Even when Romney confined his critique of Obama to the economy, he was all over the place: China, taxes, monetary policy, deficits, the unemployment rate among women. He did not establish a convincing connection between troubling statistics and Obama's policies.</p> <p>More often, Romney simply assumed that the self-evidently bad economy was Obama's fault and reason enough that he should be elected. </p> <p>Yet, there remains a huge, undeniable gap between Obama's promises and his results. In some cases, he is essentially repeating the same goals this year that he failed to achieve in his first term. Some of this over-promising came wrapped in hyperbolic, almost messianic rhetoric.</p> <p>Romney should stick to pointing to the disconnect between Obama's words and deeds, contrasting \"hope and change\" with slow growth and net job losses. He must note that Obama's deficits will lead inexorably to higher taxes, even for some of the \"47%\". Don't let Obama get away with \"created or saved\" metrics or comparisons to Bush. Compare the price tag of the Obama administration with the tangible results.</p> <p>None of that is good enough if Romney fails to establish himself as a suitable alternative. Romney should turn his record at Bain, on the Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts into a complete story: he is someone with expertise in turning around financially troubled entities \u2013 and that is exactly what Washington needs right now.</p> <p>It may not be an inspiring sales pitch, but it is the one that worked in his only successful political venture. Romney didn't get elected in Massachusetts because voters identified with him, felt comfortable with his wealth or even particularly liked him. He convinced them that he could come in and manage the government's financial affairs better than the people who were currently in charge.</p> <p>It's an opening that Romney has. He can accuse the bipartisan political class in Washington of mission creep and say that they have lost focus on their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders \u2013 in this case, the taxpayers. He can say that in the business world, a chief executive who promised much and delivered little would have to be fired. </p> <p>The Romney-Ryan ticket has made many of these arguments in the past, of course. But it has not done so in any sustained way and has not stuck with any of them long enough for them to really permeate the public consciousness.</p> <p>This one-two punch has the benefits of being as accurate as anything is in politics, while also connecting with the concerns of voters who like Obama personally but aren't satisfied with what he has done as president. The campaign is, instead, unfolding in a way that allows them to stay with the president they like over the challenger they find off-putting.</p> <p>At this late date, it's not guaranteed to work. But it is a better bet than throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks.</p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband drew on the words of the former Conservative leader Benjamin Disraeli when he outlined his vision for Labour as an inclusive, \"one-nation\" party that can rebuild Britain from the recession.</p> <p>Miliband used his keynote address to the party conference to attribute his \"faith\" \u2013 the belief that people need to leave the world \"a better place than we found it\" \u2013 to his roots as the son of Jewish immigrants, and to his state-school background.</p> <p>In his third conference speech as leader \u2013 his second in Manchester \u2013 amid disappointing personal polling, Miliband performed a political landgrab by citing the one-nation speech Disraeli gave in April 1872 at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester to punch home his key message: that Labour is the party that can bring the country together.</p> <p>Miliband cited individual stories of people who feel the system does not work for them because Britain currently has \"two nations, not one\", such as a young person \"brimming with life\" who had written to 137 employers and failed to get a reply from any of them.</p> <p>In a well-received speech lasting over an hour and delivered without a script, to periodic waves of enthusiastic applause, he said Disraeli's speech 140 years ago had set \"a vision of Britain where patriotism, loyalty, dedication to the common cause, courses through the veins of all and nobody feels left out\". Recalling the one-nation spirit of Clement Attlee's Labour government, which rebuilt Britain after the second world war, he said: \"I didn't become leader of the Labour party to reinvent the world of Disraeli or Attlee. But I do believe in that spirit, that spirit of one nation. One nation: a country where everyone has a stake. One nation: a country where prosperity is fairly shared. One nation where we have a shared destiny, a sense of shared endeavour and a common life that we lead together. That is my vision of one nation. That is my vision of Britain. That is the Britain we must become.\"</p> <p>In a speech light on policy announcements, he promised:</p> <p>\u2022 a crackdown on employers who don't pay the minimum wage to foreign workers, to stop the undercutting of Britons and prevent the exploitation of people who come here to work, and to end the \"shady practices\" of gangmasters.</p> <p>\u2022 to end the rule that require companies to publish their<br>accounts every three months, to encourage long-term investment.</p> <p>\u2022 a focus on \"the forgotten 50%\" who do not go to university, offering English and maths until they are 18, and a technical baccalaureate.</p> <p>\u2022 a \"new deal with British business\" under which companies would be given control over apprenticeship funding in return for committing to providing good training to young recruits.</p> <p>\u2022 and an end to public sector contracts to firm that don't invest in training the next generation.</p> <p>Punching home his one-nation message \u2013 a brand he used 46 times in all \u2013 he said: \"Every time Britain has faced its gravest challenge, we have only come through the storm because we were one nation. But too often, governments have forgotten that message.</p> <p>\"With one million young people out of work, we just can't succeed as a country. With the gap between rich and poor growing wider and wider, we just can't succeed as a country. With millions of people doing the hard work and effort but not rewarded, we just can't succeed as a country.</p> <p>\"And with so many people having been told for so long that the only way to get on is to be on your own, in it for yourself, we just can't succeed as a country.\"</p> <p>He said he understood voters who turned their backs on Labour in 2010 amid the financial crisis and gave David Cameron \"the benefit of the doubt\", but he added: \"I think we've had long enough to make a judgment.\"</p> <p>Miliband said the prime minister would next April be giving each millionaire in the country \u00a340,000, \"not just for one year, but for every year\".</p> <p>\"At the same time, they will be imposing a tax on pensioners. It is wrong, what they are doing. It shows their priorities.</p> <p>And David Cameron was not just writing the cheques; he was receiving one, too, Miliband said. He asked how many other cabinet ministers would benefit, and how Cameron could justify the move.</p> <p>Miliband's vision would ensure that people with disabilities were looked after but insist that those who were able to work, did so. He warned that if Labour won power in 2015, there would be many cuts that Labour \"won't be able to reverse even though it would like to\", with \"tough settlements\" ahead for the public services in the next parliament.</p> <p>But the Labour leader said that under his watch, a one-nation party would ensure \"the broadest shoulders will always bear the greatest burden\".</p> <p>\"We will never cut taxes for millionaires and raise them for ordinary families,\" he said. \"That is not being one nation. And here's the other thing: I will never accept an economy where the gap between rich and poor just grows wider and wider. In one nation, in my faith, inequality matters. It matters to our country.\"</p> <p>Miliband said his vision meant no going back to \"old Labour\" or representing \"one sectional interest of our country\". The party needed to be the party of the private, as well as the public sector, the party of the small business struggling against the odds, the party of the south just as much as the party of the north, and of the squeezed middle as much as the party of the poor.</p> <p>The Labour leader said it was also necessary to \"move on\" from New Labour. He said that despite its great achievements, it \"was too silent about the responsibilities of those at the top, and too timid about the accountability of those with power\".</p> <p>\"In one nation, responsibility goes all the way to the top of society,\" he said.</p> <p>The biggest applause was reserved for the NHS, as Miliband attacked Cameron over the NHS reforms, saying he \"broke his solemn contract with the British people\" during the election campaign to protect the health service.</p> <p>This was \"a contract that can never be repaired\", he said.</p> <p>Miliband led the hall in a chorus of \"No!\" as he asked what the responses had been from doctors, nurses, paediatricians, radiologists, patients and the public to the reforms.</p> <p>The NHS was based not on \"values of markets, money and exchange\" but on those of care and co-operation, he said.</p> <p>\"That is the magic of the National Health Service. That is why the British people love the National Health Service. And I am afraid the Tories have shown in government it is something they just don't understand.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012. The original said Miliband had promised \"a change in the rules to require companies to publish their accounts every three months, to encourage long-term investment\". Miliband said he would end the rule that required companies to do so.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney will use Wednesday's presidential debate with Barack Obama to try to get across a clear, unequivocal message after weeks in which he has been accused of leaving voters confused by frequently chopping and changing.</p> <p>Romney, in an <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/nationalpolitics/ci_21676605/romney-wont-deport-young-illegals-who-have-temporary\">interview with the Denver Post</a> and at a late-night rally in Denver on Monday, offered a preview of his line of attack for the 90-minute debate. Central to his strategy will be to attempt to undo some of the damage caused by the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders. </p> <p>He will list damning statistics showing the extent to which Americans have become dependent on the federal government, from food stamps to unemployment benefits.</p> <p>He will also attempt to work into the debate, even though it is supposed to be devoted exclusively to domestic policy, accusations that the White House obfuscated over the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>In a sign that Republicans have not yet given up on Romney with five weeks left to election day, one of the biggest of the conservative Super Pacs, American Crossroads, which is run by, among others, Bush's former adviser Karl Rove, announced Tuesday it had bought $16m in television and radio ads for a week-long blitz in the eight presidential swing states and in four Senate contests.</p> <p>If Crossroads had decided the election was now unwinnable, it would have shifted the bulk of the money to the Senate races. Instead, it is spending $11m on the presidential race and $5m on the Senate races.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team has been engaged for days over what strategy to pursue in the debate and in the weeks left to election day: whether to stick rigidly to the economy, as his main strategist Stuart Stevens advocates, or seek to exploit questions over Obama's handling of the Middle East.</p> <p>The internal debate remains unresolved, with campaign advisers briefing journalists that Romney is to adopt a scatter-gun approach in the coming weeks, tackling a range of issues across a broad spectrum. The Romney campaign has had three relaunches in as many weeks.</p> <p>In contrast with Obama, who is facing no criticism from Democrats over the way he is running his campaign, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have rounded on Romney for what they label a policy vacuum and sought to fill it with conflicting advice, ranging from offering specific policy points to switching to foreign policy.</p> <p>Ed Gillespie, one of Romney's campaign advisers, denied that the regular switches in messaging over the last few weeks reflected chaos and insisted it reflected the range of issues facing voters.</p> <p>In the Denver Post, Romney predicted that after the debate the lines between him and Obama would be clearer. \"I think what's going to happen in this debate is each of us will get the opportunity to describe our pathway forward for America. And for the last several weeks and months, the president has dramatically distorted my own views. I look forward to the debate so people will understand what I actually believe.\"</p> <p>The main line from Romney, according to his campaign advisers, will be that the last four years have been disastrous and that voters don't want another four years of the same.</p> <p>At the rally in Denver on Monday night, Romney rehearsed his response to the secret video, arguing that the 47% were dependent on federal aid because of Obama's policies. The Republican candidate ran through a series of statistics: the number of people on food stamps had risen by 15 million; one in six live in poverty; 23 million are looking for work; and for 43 straight months, unemployment has stood above 8%.</p> <p>\"The economy is not in recovery. We're not seeing a real recovery. The president's policies have not worked,\" he said.</p> <p>Conservatives hope that the election will eventually tighten and that the US media, keen to see a dramatic election finish, will jump on the slightest sign of recovery by Romney as a comeback. </p> <p>But the latest poll, from Quinnipiac University, shows no shift yet in Obama's lead, putting him at 49% to Romney's 45%. It records he has an 18% lead over Romney among women, 56% to 38%, and 94% to 2% among African Americans. Romney has a lead among men 52% to 42% while white voters back Romney 53% to 42%.</p>",
  "<p>The EU has unveiled proposals that would force banks to separate their risky trading activities from their high street operations in the latest effort by policymakers to prevent a rerun of the 2008 banking crisis.</p> <p>The high level report for European commissioner Michel Barnier also proposes that senior bankers should have part of their bonuses paid in bonds, which could ultimately be used to prop up ailing banks and a lid be put on the total amounts that can be handed out to staff. One proposal is that bonus payments to staff should not be greater than dividends paid to shareholders. He also suggests that the size of bonuses relative to salaries be limited.</p> <p>The report by the Finnish central bank governor, Erkki Liikanen, is intended to prevent taxpayers needing to bail out banks again and is published at a time when politicians around the world are continuing to grapple with the issue of how to make banks safer.</p> <p>Among Liikanen's others suggestions are that loans to property companies should have different rules about the amount of capital that banks must hold to support the lending so that banks are not destabilised by a property crash. The report also calls for \"more attention\" to be given to the ability of management and bank directors to run large, complex banks and calls for \"fit and proper\" tests for boardroom candidates.</p> <p>Lawyers said Liikanen's proposals \u2013 which Barnier has now put out to six weeks' consultation \u2013 could have implications for the UK's coalition government, which is working towards implementing the ringfencing proposals set out by Sir John Vickers' Independent Commission on Banking.</p> <p>Paul Edmondson of law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, said: \"If Brussels goes down the route of separating bank trading books the UK won't be able to prevent that being enforced here. What happens now to the proposed UK ringfence?\".</p> <p>Liikanen presented his proposals from Brussels just hours before Labour leader Ed Miliband refuelled the debate on the structure of British banking by threatening to go further than Vickers and break them up. \"Of course, this government promised change but things aren't really changing. So I've got a message for the banks. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Miliband said at the Labour party conference in Manchester</p> <p>Liikanen insisted he was not trying to completely to break up \"universal\" banks which unite investment banking and retail banking \u2013 such as Barclays, Deutsche bank in Germany and BNP Paribas in France \u2013 despite his demand for a \"legal\" separation between some of the riskier investment banking activities and high street banks.</p> <p>Liikanen's group builds upon the Volcker rule being adopted in the US \u2013 named after former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker \u2013 which prevents banks using their own money to take bet on markets through proprietary trading. Liikanen calls for proprietary trading of securities and derivatives to be legally split if the activities amount to 15 to 25% of a bank's total business.</p> <p>Such separation, Liikanen said, would make the deposit-taking parts of banks \"safer and less connected to high-risk trading activities and to limit the implicit or explicit stake of taxpayer in the trading parts of banking groups\".</p> <p>His report said that his recommendation for separation were \"fully compatible\" with the Vickers proposals although industry experts expressed concern about whether this was the case. \"The Liikanen group has taken what appears to be the mirror-image of the Vickers approach to the nettled issue of how to separate investment banking from retail and commercial banking. Vickers recommends ring fencing the retail and commercial bank; Liikanen would ring fence trading and market-making activity,\" said Thomas Huertas, partner in financial services at Ernst &amp; Young.</p> <h2>Blueprints for bank regulation across Europe</h2> <p>\u2022 International bank supervisors in Basel, Switzerland, intend to force banks to hold triple the capital required before the 2008 crisis \u2013 but only by 2019.</p> <p>\u2022 Sir John Vickers' banking commission has called for a \"ringfence\" to be erected to protect UK high street banks from their \"casino\" investment bank operations. Banks would have until 2019 to comply.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour leader Ed Miliband is threatening to break banks up unless they enact Vickers by 2015.</p> <p>\u2022 In the US, regulators are grappling with how to limit \"proprietary\" trading \u2013 when banks gamble with their own cash. It is called the Volcker rule \u2013 after former Fed chairman Paul Volcker \u2013 and is due to take effect by 2014.</p> <p>\u2022 The Liikanen report calls for a split between risky casino banking and high street banks.</p> <p>\u2022 The European Central Bank is urging banking union across the eurozone.

  "<p>The BBC has responded to growing pressure to take action over the Sir Jimmy Savile sexual assault allegations, announcing that it will assist any police investigations into the claims.</p> <p>After two days of fresh allegations about the late Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It presenter, the BBC said its internal investigations unit would be making contact with all the police forces dealing with sexual assault claims about Savile, to \"offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue\".</p> <p>\"A number of serious and disturbing allegations have been made over the past few days about the sexual abuse of teenage girls by Jimmy Savile,\" a BBC spokesman said.</p> <p>\"Some of these allegations relate to activity on BBC premises in the 1960s and 1970s. We are horrified by allegations that anything of this sort could have happened at the BBC \u2013 or have been carried out by anyone working for the BBC,\" he added.</p> <p>\"They are allegations of a serious criminal nature which the police have the proper powers to investigate.</p> <p>\"So we have today asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue.\"</p> <p>The new BBC director general, George Entwistle, is understood to have been involved in the decision, which was taken following discussions with senior police officers about the best course of action.</p> <p>The police are understood to have advised that the best way forward was for the BBC to co-operate with their investigations, rather than launch its own inquiry.</p> <p>The BBC also sought late on Wednesday to tackle the controversy surrounding the Newsnight investigation into the Savile sex abuse allegations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/01/jimmy-savile-abuse-allegations-newsnight?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">which was dropped in December last year</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2012/10/newsnight_and_jimmy_savile.html\" title=\"\">In a BBC blogpost</a>, the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, said he decided not to broadcast the item after receiving a guidance note from the Crown Prosecution Service, which said it had advised police not to pursue an investigation \"due to lack of evidence\".</p> <p>\"We did establish the police had investigated the allegations in 2007. However, as the police would be obliged to investigate I wanted to check how they would respond to the allegation that it was not pursued because Jimmy Savile was too old,\" Rippon said.</p> <p>\"The CPS told us: 'The CPS reviewing lawyer advised the police that no further action should be taken due to lack of evidence.' The additional guidance noted stated. 'As this is the case, it would not be correct to say that his age and frailty was the reason for no further action being taken.'</p> <p>\"This statement specifically denied the allegation that the investigation was dropped because of his age. I felt it was significant the guidance was included and we had not established any institutional failure and I judged it weakened the story from a Newsnight perspective. I took the decision not to publish.\"</p> <p>Rippon denied that Newsnight had withheld evidence from police, or that he had been ordered by his BBC bosses to drop the Savile investigation.</p> <p>He admitted that some members of the Newsnight team \"disagreed strongly with my judgment\", but accepted his decision. \"There were no rows of any kind as has been reported,\" he said.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

But one simple question remains: can Blaine die?</p> <p>\"I hope not,\" says the 39-year-old from New York, where <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ultrabookexperience\" title=\"\">Electrified</a>, his latest piece of performance art, is staged. \"The dangers are the things you don't anticipate.\" Blaine has not performed a big stunt for more than three years \u2013 his last was clowning around with great white sharks in 2009 \u2013 because of his 20-month-old daughter. When his girlfriend, Alizee Guinochet, became pregnant, he postponed a gulf-stream-assisted voyage across the Atlantic in a bottle because it might take eight months. Surprisingly, he admits to being \"a little more cautious about the long-term effects\" of his stunts since becoming a father.</p> <p>While Blaine is protected by his suit, which conducts electricity, if he reaches through the open cage-style helmet around his head to scratch an itch, he will electrocute himself. \"It's only the equivalent to seven Tasers,\" says Blaine in a somnolent drawl. \"But it's continual \u2013 snap, snap, snap \u2013 and then you go into cardiac arrest.

So, basically, he is inviting trolls to torture him? \"I'm torturing myself,\" he says. \"In London I more or less provoked their interaction. This time, I'm forcing their interaction. They can shoot more electricity at me, they can turn it down, they can play music. The people being able to do all that is a nice distraction.\"</p> <p>His biggest fear is not malevolent internet crowds but hallucinating from sleeplessness, rubbing his eyes and giving himself a shock. He hopes his daughter in the crowds will help keep him alert. \"She's so smart, she comes to some of the rehearsals and she totally gets it,\" he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> David Blaine's performance will be projected live at The Truman Brewery, London E1, from 7pm this Saturday; visitors will be able to control 1m volts of electricity and communicate with David Blaine from 9pm - 10pm.</p>",
  "<p>Hot on the heels of former supreme court president <a href=\"http://ukscblog.com/lord-phillips-supreme-court-judgment\">Lord Phillips calling for partners in city law firms</a> to sacrifice fee earning work in order to become part-time judges, Mr Justice Tugendhat has made the case for lawyers to leave their practices altogether to take up positions on the bench. Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.5rb.com/newsitem/Conference-5RB-2012\">5RB 2012 conference</a> last week he said:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"[I] urge all of you, both barristers and solicitors, those in private practice and those who are employed, to consider where the specialist judges are to come from in the future to hear freedom of expression cases, whether in the high court or in the county court. As the recruiting posters put it: Your country needs you. If no one with experience is willing to become a judge, there will be no specialist judges.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://jac.judiciary.gov.uk/selection-process/selection-exercises/forthcoming/1658.htm\">Judicial Appointments Commission</a> has announced seven vacancies in the Queen's Bench Division (QBD) of the high court including four specialists, one in defamation. There is an argument for having specialist judges, said Tugendhat, particularly in freedom of expression cases, in order to save court time and costs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"In some cases in my experience a non-specialist judge may take twice as long, or more, to decide a case as a specialist judge would take. This is mainly because a non-specialist judge may have to read for the first time statutes and case law that a specialist judge will already know and understand. And where the judge is not a specialist, counsel have to make submissions as to the law which assume no knowledge on the part of the judge.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However, the last time vacancies were advertised the defamation slot was not filled and this is partly due to over-specialisation in private practice suggested Tugendhat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"One reason for there being a difficulty in appointing specialist judges is that in the last 30 years there has been an increasing trend towards specialism in all areas of the law. The result is that there are more specialist cases to be tried, but the judges appointed to the QBD include fewer who had more than one specialism in their professional practices\".</p> </blockquote> <p>He gave the examples of two former high court judges, Sir David Hirst and Sir Brian Neill, both of whom had specialised at the bar in commercial law as well as defamation.</p> <p>Tugendhat, who is in charge of the jury and non-jury lists of QBD, is himself a media specialist. All judges in the division are expected to work across a range of matters, including in the criminal division of the court of appeal, and for around half the year they are \"on circuit\" trying serious crime, he explained. The result is that even if someone with a specialism in defamation is appointed in the next round, \"the new judge will probably not be available in the jury list for more than 3 weeks per term, if that,\" he said.</p> <p>While several important privacy and defamation have been decided by non-specialist judges media law practitioners are nevertheless needed to deal with the article 8 and article 10 (European Convention on Human Rights) issues that arise in privacy and defamation actions, including those cases in which injunctions are sought, said Tugendhat.</p> <p>Tugendhat was one of the last judges to be appointed following an invitation from the lord chancellor and he expressed the view that there was some public benefit in inviting lawyers to sit on the bench: <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>\"No one would wish to return to the old ways. But there was one advantage of the former system that cannot be replicated under the present system of appointment. Under the present system it is less clear to lawyers that they may have a duty to the public to apply for appointment. To decide not to apply may not seem to be the same as to refuse an invitation from the Lord Chancellor. But the effect is the same. That person does not become a judge.\"</p> </blockquote>",

  "<p>The situation is \"very fluid and very advanced,\" said Tom Enders, boss of EADS, on Monday night about the plan to combine the aerospace group with BAE Systems. That, presumably, is the positive way to describe a situation that appears chaotic even as the first deadline to produce a merger document approaches.</p> <p>Indeed, the word \"fluid\" doesn't do justice to the position of Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, chairman of EADS and chief executive of its 7.5% shareholder Lagard\u00e8re, the French media firm that bears the family name. Wearing his EADS hat, he's fully supportive of the deal and its 60/40 ratio; wearing his second hat, he backs the Lagard\u00e8re corporate stance that the terms are \"currently unsatisfactory\" and thus an \"indispensable re-examination\" of the deal is required.</p> <p>The hopeful thought \u2013 at least for Enders and his BAE counterpart, Ian King - is that the objections of Lagard\u00e8re, and fellow shareholder Daimler, over price could evaporate once governments get involved. That assumption looks far from safe, however, since the Enders/King vision of a company that confers the same rights on all shareholders appears fundamentally different from any version being contemplated in Paris and Berlin. In those capitals, the debate is all about how large a slice of the shares the two governments should keep, not as a pure investment but to retain influence and control.</p> <p>Even that negotiation, however, will be sterile if, say, 9% apiece gets the thumbs down in Washington. In that case, there would be no point in proceeding with the merger since BAE's privileged status in the US defence market would be undermined.</p> <p>The only encouraging news for Enders and King is that no government has yet said anything that would definitively kill the deal. It is still possible that all the various pieces of the jigsaw could fall into place. But the minimum definition of a deal that can be presented to shareholders \u2013 which is what EADS and BAE hope to announce by next Wednesday \u2013 is one where the governments of the UK, France and Germany have agreed on governance arrangements and shareholding structure. Further, the companies must be able to claim credibly that the US is at least prepared to contemplate allowing the merger to proceed.</p> <p>The first hurdle is high, in other words. Of course, Enders and King could opt to delay for a week or two. But that's a dangerous course too since resentment will only deepen if EADS' share price continues to sit 16% below its pre-leak level. Best to try to hurry the governments along. But the odds on a clean announcement next week already look 50/50 at best. This deal makes Glenstrata look straightforward.</p>",

  "<p>The first time I laid eyes on James Bond, he had just emerged from the ocean with a fake seagull on his head. He then blew up a drug lord's laboratory, peeled off his wetsuit to reveal an immaculate white DJ, snogged an exotic dancer, clocked in her eyeballs the reflection of a bad guy sneaking up behind them, tipped said bad guy into the bathtub, threw an electric heater in after him, and quipped: \"Shocking, positively shocking!\" All this, and the credits hadn't even started. My 12-year-old self thought I'd died and gone to heaven.</p> <p>Many years later, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79341/goldfinger\" title=\"\">Goldfinger </a>(1964) remains not just my favourite Bond movie, but the standard by which all other Bond movies must be judged. It has Sean Connery, of course, and the best theme song, incorporating Shirley Bassey and lashings of John Barry brass.</p> <p>And it has the best villain; Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fr\u00f6be) is a petty-minded plutocrat who cheats at cards and golf, and has the best ever evil dialogue. His masterplan is to profit from the economic chaos that will ensue after he has detonated an atomic bomb in Fort Knox, making America's gold reserves radioactive for 58 years. \"He's quite mad, you know,\" Bond says to Pussy Galore, just in case any of us might have thought this was a viable get-rich-quick scheme.</p> <p>Ah yes: \"Poosy\", as Connery calls her \u2013 the implicitly (explicitly in Ian Fleming's novel) lesbian pilot with the ultimate absurd Bond girl name. And yet Honor Blackman, who plays her, never looks less than Totally In Control, even when required for plot purposes to yield to Bond's manliness. Mindful of Blackman's ass-kicking role as Cathy Gale in TV series The Avengers, the film-makers allow her to fell Bond with a judo throw, but that's as far as they go with this feminist nonsense. Bond promptly upends her in the hay, and overcomes that implicit lesbianism with just one kiss.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fy_PJODH3p0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fy_PJODH3p0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy_PJODH3p0\">Reading this on mobile?

And the best car \u2013 the Aston Martin DB5 with smokescreen, oil slick, front-wing machine guns and passenger ejector seat, all of which Bond employs against carfuls of henchmen in pursuit \u2026 to no avail, because he ends up totalling it and getting captured anyway.</p> <p>Which brings me to what I like most about Goldfinger: it makes me laugh. I never tire of the back projection used to make it look as if Connery is in Miami rather than Pinewood, the disposable comedy gangsters, the montage of troops pretending to be gassed and collapsing unconvincingly, or of Pussy Galore's crack team of girly stunt pilots.</p> <p>Best of all is Bond's uselessness. He manages to get both Masterton sisters killed (one of them covered in gold paint, the best ever death of a Bond girl) and spends most of the film quaffing Dom Perignon, a \"rather disappointing brandy\", martini or mint julep, you name it. He gets strapped to a table with a new-fangled laser beam pointed at his private parts: the best Bond-in-peril scene and one that is not easily escapable \u2013 our man's family jewels remain intact only thanks to the villain's inexplicable reluctance to deliver the coup de grace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397055078\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/10/2/1349191554827/Goldfinger-2--004.jpg\" alt=\"Goldfinger 2 \" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What a way to go \u2026 Sean Connery and Shirley Eaton in Goldfinger.

But even at the climax, he's reduced to bashing cack-handedly at the atomic bomb casing with a gold brick, trying in vain to stop the countdown, only for a CIA man to step in at the last minute and calmly flick the \"off\" switch.</p> <p>Despite its hero's ineptitude, Goldfinger is full of quintessential Bond moments, all of which have since been recycled or spoofed so many times you forget this is where they began \u2013 Bond tricking the jailer into opening his cell door, a minor bad guy's car reduced to a scrunched-up cube in a scrapyard compactor, the villain shooting his own henchmen.

  "<p>When Chris Dowding followed up a referral from a hospital discharge team to visit a 91-year-old woman who lived alone, he quickly realised she needed support.&#xa0;With her consent, he fitted a device she could activate at the push of a button to record sound and relay it live to a control centre.</p> <p>Dowding works for Staffordshire fire and rescue service. Yet his wages are paid by the NHS. Like many in the fire service, his job has changed so much over the past decade that the question being asked is: \"Are firefighters the new social workers?\"</p> <p>Since 2003, the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/firestatsgb201011\" title=\"\">number of fire incidents in Great Britain</a> that firefighters respond to has halved, from 572,000 to 287,000. Deaths and serious injuries have fallen commensurately, but, of the 388 fire-related fatalities in 2010-11, half involve people over 60. So with far fewer call-outs, fire services have turned increasingly to preventive work, visiting older and vulnerable people in their homes to check and advise on fire safety. \"If you compare the cost of replacing a pair of sloppy slippers with the cost of caring for somebody who has fractured their hip, you can start to see why it's so important,\" Peter Dartford, Staffordshire's chief fire officer and chair of the national prevention committee of the Chief Fire Officers Association (CFOA) told a <a href=\"http://www.staffordshirefire.gov.uk/2340.asp\" title=\"\">recent conference on dementia</a>.</p> <p>Dartford was making the point that fire fatalities account for less than 3% of accidental deaths of older people. By contrast, 43% are attributed to slips, trips and falls. He sees it just as much a part of the job of a visiting fire officer to look for trip hazards in the home, or for signs of vulnerability on the part of the householder, as for dodgy wiring.</p> <p>\"We are often in these homes before other agencies because we are actively seeking to get into households to promote fire safety,\" Dartford says. \"I am a passionate advocate of the idea that prevention is better than cure and because we engage with people, because we can capture their imagination and because fire services staff have a very positive standing within local communities, we can use that to influence a range of things beyond fire.\"</p> <p>Dowding, a specialist technician who works across south Staffordshire, underscores his chief's argument. \"The uniform does promote trust,\" he says. \"It opens doors and people feel more comfortable talking. They don't think: 'This social worker is going to put me into care, or take my children away'.\"</p> <p>Older people's organisations endorse this view. Elaine Jones, director of operations at Age Concern Birmingham, which works closely with the fire service, says: \"In our experience, it is trusted by older people. Firefighters' reputation for saving lives, often in dangerous circumstances, generates tremendous goodwill.\"</p> <p>The process works in two directions. Fire service community teams take referrals from agencies, such as the NHS, council adult social care and voluntary groups, and they make referrals to them when they come across an individual about whom they have concerns. While checking on the safety of appliances, or fitting a smoke alarm, they will assess whether the householder has any mobility problems, or whether there are any signs of drug or alcohol misuse or mental illness. They may even carry out basic and subtle tests for sensory deprivation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.staffs.ac.uk/faculties/health/research/camh/\" title=\"\">Academics at Staffordshire University</a>, which hosted the dementia conference in collaboration with four fire services and the CFOA, are developing a short series of questions for fire officers to ask the householder to determine whether there are any indications of cognitive impairment. Derek Beeston, reader in ageing and mental health, goes so far as to say: \"I&#xa0;would describe the fire service, certainly in Staffordshire, as probably the most dementia-friendly prevention service in the world.\"</p> <p>Firefighters stress they are not pretending to be health and welfare experts. Steve Vincent, head of community safety and partnerships for West Midlands fire service, says: \"We are not professionals, but we will notice some of these issues in the home. We will talk to the individual in a sympathetic way and then bring in partner agencies from among health and social care providers in the area.\"</p> <p>Do firefighters mind the switch of role? Some inevitably will, but Neil Pedersen, an assistant area commander with the Staffordshire service, says: \"I've been in the fire service 23 years and done the lot, rescuing cats up trees and all, but over the last 10 years there has been a complete culture change from response \u2013 going out in a big red fire engine to fight fires \u2013 to prevention. I have to say it's been exactly the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>One of the leaders of this culture change was Merseyside fire and rescue service. Phil Garrigan, its deputy chief fire officer, reckons his men and women have visited around 160,000 homes of older people and have started to play a key part in helping end the isolation many of them endure.</p> <p>\"We believe we are the eyes and ears of the community,\" says Garrigan. He talks of his fire officers finding people living in \"squalor you would never believe existed in the UK in 2012\". A glance at the service's log of reports bears this out: in one case, a man and his son were found living in a property that was immediately condemned as unfit for human habitation, with \"evidence that vermin had been eating food off this elderly gentleman's clothes while [he was] in bed\".</p> <p>Other cases demonstrate the fire risks being run by many people with dementia or mental health problems: one man experiencing psychotic episodes \"kept candles lit to keep witches away from his home\"; an older man with Alzheimer's disease was found to be habitually pouring tea over the flames of his coal-effect gas fire; and a woman who believed her dead sisters were alive was discovered to be preparing food for them, putting it on the table and then returning it to the gas cooker to keep warm.</p> <p>Under a scheme he calls \"community nudge\", Garrigan hopes his officers will be able to encourage neighbours to keep an eye on people identified as at risk. \"It's far better if we can engage someone down the street to look in,\" he says. \"There's some work to be done about the role we can play in linking the local community around the vulnerable person.\"</p> <p>Two obstacles stand in the way of fire services' growing role in the community. One is over-zealous interpretation of data protection law, thwarting exchange of information with other agencies. Garrigan admits it is a problem, but insists: \"I will happily share the data we hold on vulnerable people with other preventive services if I believe it is in the best interests of the individual.\"</p> <p>The other difficulty is money. Dowding is highly unusual in having his pay covered by&#xa0;the&#xa0;NHS: most preventive work is funded from the fire services' own budgets, which are to be slashed by \u00a3207m in England by&#xa0;2015.</p> <p>Vij Randeniya, chief fire officer in the West Midlands and president of the CFOA, says: \"Fire and rescue services are facing the toughest challenge in their history.\"</p> <p>Will it be the fire engines that go, or knocking on doors?</p>",
  "<p>When you start university, you'll find the way you study changes. School textbooks are replaced with academic journals, classrooms are swapped for giant lecture halls&#xa0;and \"referencing\" becomes a&#xa0;familiar&#xa0;chore.</p> <p>Humanities students will notice the biggest difference when they're handed their university timetable \u2013 there's far less teaching time than at school or college. This means you can enjoy a lot more freedom, says Ian Shrimpton, a second-year philosophy student at Reading University.</p> <p>\"When you're set an essay you're given a recommended reading list, but the rest is up to you \u2013 it's not like at school where you're bound by a curriculum. There's quite a wide variety of lectures on offer, so you pick the ones that you find interesting.\"</p> <p>But there are some formal standards you have to stick to. Universities expect you to present your work professionally. This means any books you have used when researching your assignments need to be cited, either in the footnotes to your work or at the end in a bibliography.</p> <p>This can be a bit tedious, says Sophie Murray-Morris, a third-year English student at Birmingham University. \"When you finish an essay you think: 'Yay! It's over; I'm done!' But then you realise that you have to do your bibliography.\"</p> <p>And getting it right is quite tricky, she says. \"When we were set our first essay, we were given a 10-page guide to referencing, which was a bit daunting. There are different rules for citing books, journals and websites, and you have to get it spot-on. Even by having a comma in the wrong place you risk losing marks.\"</p> <p>Universities also expect students to be exact when it comes to meeting deadlines, says Charlotte Britton, welfare officer at Swansea University students union. \"Tutors can tell if work is handed in late, either because you have to submit it online, or because it has to be handed in at your departmental office.</p> <p>\"It varies from uni to uni, but a late hand-in can mean anything from getting 10% knocked off your work to getting zero marks, depending on how late it is.\"</p> <p>But tutors recognise that first year is tough, says Thomas Joyce, professor of orthopaedic engineering at Newcastle University. \"In our school every student is allocated a tutor who can offer guidance if a student wants to check their progress.\"</p> <p>If you're starting university, he says work hard and enjoy your studies, but don't be shy about asking for support.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was changed on 04.10.12 to clarify that Charlotte Britton is welfare officer at Swansea University, not Cardiff University</p>",

  "<p>The impact of Ed Miliband's speech on education at this year's Labour conference remains to be seen, but people in Westminster are still talking about last year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/27/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference\" title=\"\">argument for responsible capitalism</a>. The financial crisis in 2008 exposed some basic weaknesses in our capitalist system, but it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/27/ed-miliband-speech-labour-conference\" title=\"\">Miliband's speech</a> that gave the first and most explicit recognition of the need for a more responsible form of capitalism, not only as an end in itself but as a means to achieving a more successful economy.</p> <p>But was the Labour leader picking up a thread already out there?</p> <p>In the Companies Act 2006, the previous government <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/172\" title=\"\">introduced a provision</a> whereby a director must act in the way he considers would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members.</p> <p>The director must have regard to various factors, including the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment. However, these provisions did not change the basic legal position of individual companies or of their directors. They are duties owed to the company itself, so are for the company (generally controlled by the directors) to enforce. So this duty of responsibility is not \"outward-facing\" and does not trigger direct enforcement by the public authorities.</p> <p>So how does Labour take this forward?</p> <p>It should be remembered that the main purpose of establishing a limited company with its own separate corporate identity is to limit the liability of the individuals involved, whether as shareholders, directors or otherwise.</p> <p>The system rests on the assumption that, even if those involved in the ownership and management of companies act for their own selfish ends, the net result will, nonetheless, be for the benefit of the community as a whole.</p> <p>Clearly the way forward cannot be to return to the pre-industrial era, when those involved in business remained personally responsible throughout. The right approach must surely be to develop mechanisms (if necessary through legislation, or at least non-statutory codes of guidance) which will prevent the harmful consequences of unrestrained business activity, while allowing such activity to continue to benefit the community through the production and distribution of goods, services, jobs etc.</p> <p>So how might the law frame this?</p> <p>Consider first the powers and responsibilities of shareholders. It may seem tempting to increase the powers of shareholders, to enable shareholders to control the composition and remuneration of the board of directors more effectively.</p> <p>However, by itself, conferring greater control is unlikely to be sufficient, since shareholders are likely to be motivated primarily by the profitability of their own investment, and will not necessarily promote the long term success of the company, let alone the benefit of the community generally.</p> <p>Consideration should therefore be given to imposing a minimum period between the acquisition and disposal of shares, though research is needed to evaluate what the effect of such a measure is likely to be.</p> <p>Turning to the responsibilities of directors, a code of conduct like the <a href=\"http://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Codes-Standards/Corporate-governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-Code.aspx\" title=\"\">Corporate Governance Code</a> could be developed.</p> <p>Miliband suggested that those in business, particularly in banking, ought to be bound by similar rules to those who work in teaching, medicine and the law. It now seems to be widely accepted that there should be greater involvement in executive pay by the company's owners/shareholders and by its employees, not least because they have an obvious financial stake in the way which the company's available resources are applied.</p> <p>Steps to ensure greater transparency in relation to remuneration arrangements are already in hand. However, the time has surely come for society to take a more active role in relation to systems of payment. As the Labour leader has also pointed out, even the European Parliament is proposing that if your bonus is doubling your annual salary, that should be enough.</p> <p>With regards to tax policy, incentives for particular kinds of economic or investment decisions are an obvious example. Some form of tax credit for child-care would be likely to have a positive impact on the diversity of the work force. More widely, it has been suggested that all tax proposals should be subject to a \"sustainability audit\".</p> <p>Finally, a clear area for government action arises in relation to procurement decisions. For example, Labour has said that it would make it a condition that firms winning large government contracts should offer apprenticeships.</p> <p>David Coats, associate director of the Work Foundation, in an article for Fabian Review, observes that another attractive step would be to ratify the <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312239\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation's convention on labour clauses in public contracts</a>, which requires the government only to do business with those who observe either the wages and conditions negotiated with trade unions or the prevailing wage in a sector.</p> <p>No one would suggest that issues relating to the conduct of business should be subject to frequent direct legal or judicial intervention, but there are nonetheless legal improvements which can be made, both on the criminal and on the civil side.</p> <p>By way of example, there seems to be scope for the creation of additional criminal offences, not necessarily involving proof of deliberate dishonesty. Thus the former Serious Fraud Office director <a href=\"http://www.sfo.gov.uk/about-us/our-views/director's-speeches/speeches-2012/enforcing-the-law-on-fraud-and-corruption-does-self-reporting-pay.aspx\" title=\"\">Richard Alderman has recommended</a> the creation of an offence of recklessly managing a company. The need for a tighter approach to prosecution in relation to financial crime has now been emphasised by the Treasury select committee in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/18/bob-diamond-slammed-libor-report\" title=\"\">initial report</a> on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/libor\" title=\"\">Libor</a>.</p> <p>On the civil side, the biggest problem remains the funding of litigation, and there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/16/jackson-litigation-costs-reform\" title=\"\">considerable concern</a> that reforms introduced by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, by diminishing the profitability of the conditional fee agreement, will make it much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/22/milly-dowler-cameron-legal-reform\" title=\"\">harder for claimants</a> to pursue civil claims, especially in group litigation.</p> <p>What mechanisms might be available to guarantee that business activity in general works for the benefit of the community, and not to its disadvantage?</p> <p>There is no doubt that greater transparency is a first step in this respect, and measures such as those requiring the directors' report to provide environmental information are to be applauded. However, what is lacking is any co-ordinated monitoring (let alone regulation) of the extent to which this kind of disclosure is made, or as to the longer term results.</p> <p>It is increasingly clear that a \"standing commission on responsible capitalism\", which could carry forward such proposals, and build on the work of the various temporary inquiries referred to above, is what we now urgently need. As Keynes observed, a system which works for the collective benefit also tends to maximise individual profit, whereas, and this we have all observed, a system which fails to work for the collective benefit risks destroying individual profitability, and thereby destroying the system itself.</p>",

But he put on hold a provision that would have required anyone unable to produce photo ID to file a preliminary vote and then validate their ballot within six days of the vote by producing the card.</p> <p>The judge's <a href=\"http://media.philly.com/documents/CMWSuppDetAppPrelInjOrder_100212.pdf \">preliminary injunction</a> on the photo card requirement will last only for the 2012 presidential election. Simpson said he had decided to impose it because \"I am not still convinced that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the commonwealth's implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election\".</p> <p>The ruling is subject to a possible appeal by the state to the Pennsylvania supreme court.</p> <p>Advocates for voting rights hailed the judgement as a victory for their cause. Wendy Weiser, an expert on the subject at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU school of law, said the ruling would help to keep US elections free, fair and accessible to all. \"Implementing a sweeping new voter ID law so close to an election would prevent eligible citizens from voting and having their say in our democracy. We are pleased the court refused to allow politicians to manipulate the system for their own benefit by rushing through new voting requirements that would keep out legitimate voters.\"</p> <p>The Pennsylvania voter ID law was one of the most egregious examples of a spate of hardline legislation that has swept the country. Since January 2011, 19 states have <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/2012_summary_of_voting_law_changes/\">passed a total of 24 laws</a> that erect new hurdles to voting, the most common of which is a requirement to show photo ID cards.</p> <p>Proponents of the laws have insisted they are necessary to combat fraudulent ballots. But in practice, proven examples of fraud at the ballot box are fleetingly rare, and civil rights groups such as the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union have argued the measures disenfranchise vulnerable communities such as ethnic minorities, older people, disabled people and the young.</p> <p>The Pennsylvania legislation caused extra consternation earlier this year when Mike Turzai, leader of the Republicans in the Pennsylvania assembly, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuOT1bRYdK8\">said at a rally of party members</a>: \"Voter ID, which is going to allow governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania. Done.\"</p> <p>The law also caused alarm after Pennsylvania election officials released figures that suggested that <a href=\" http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-05/news/32537732_1_voter-id-new-voter-id-cards\">some 758,000 registered voters did not have valid photo cards</a> \u2013 suggesting up to 9% of the electorate could be disenfranchised. In his deliberations, Simpson rejected the 9% figure as inflated, but he also found that the state's claim that just 1% of voters were without valid identification was an underestimate.</p> <p>The battle over Pennsylvania's voter ID law has been so fierce in part because of the state's rich crop of electoral college votes \u2013 it holds 20 of the 270 votes needed to win the presidency. In 2008, Obama won the state with 54% of the vote to John McCain's 44%.</p> <p>This year most polls are putting Obama again comfortably in the lead in Pennsylvania. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/pa/pennsylvania_romney_vs_obama-1891.html \">Real Clear Politics tracker poll </a>has the president eight points head on 50% to Mitt Romney's 42%.</p>",
  "<p>The shadows are lengthening across the Golden Temple, the last rays of the sun striking off its gilded exterior. Pilgrims walk slowly around the four sides of the sacred pool. The religious chanting of the Sikh clerics within, broadcast across the entire complex, keeps out the traffic's growl on an early autumn evening in the crowded city of Amritsar.</p> <p>But from a small construction site in one corner of the temple complex comes the sound of drilling. Here workmen brought from distant Rajasthan are preparing spectacular marble panels inlaid with semi-precious stone for a new place of worship, or <em>gurdwara</em>.</p> <p>This is no ordinary shrine. It is a memorial dedicated to those who died in perhaps the most controversial single event in recent Sikh history, the storming of the Golden Temple by Indian security forces in 1984 after it was occupied by Sikh militants under the command of a seminary student turned extremist, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Many hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed in the assault, including Bhindranwale as well as Sikh and Hindu pilgrims caught in the crossfire, and the complex was badly damaged. The assault led to the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the then prime minister, by her Sikh bodyguards, which provoked the massacre of about 3,000 Sikhs by mobs in Delhi alone.</p> <p>The Punjab, the north-western state that is the historic homeland of the Sikhs, was plunged into a violent insurgency that lasted almost a decade.</p> <p>For most of the population that's all history. But for others, events that stunned the subcontinent 30 years ago continue to rouse passions. At the weekend 78-year-old Lieutenant General Kuldeep Singh Brar was targeted in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/01/attempted-murder-indian-military-officer\" title=\"\">apparent murder attempt</a> during a visit to London. In 1984 Brar led the bloody assault on the temple; he remains a hate figure for some Sikhs.</p> <p>In the Punjab, meanwhile, a fierce row has erupted over the new <em>gurdwara</em>. It is being built by volunteers led by Baba Harnam Singh, the head of the seminary Bhindranwale once led. The dispute is reopening wounds that have barely healed, revealing tensions between Sikh communities overseas and in India, and showing how events such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/wisconsin-sikh-temple-domestic-terrorism\" title=\"\">killing of six Sikhs by a lone, racist gunman in Wisconsin </a>in August can have a political, social and cultural impact thousands of miles away.</p> <p>One key question is whom the memorial is meant to honour. \"The memorial is for all those killed, except [those] from the Indian state, of course. It is for the defenders, not the invaders,\" Harnam Singh told the Guardian, sitting in an alcove near the shrine, surrounded by seminary students in white robes and orange or blue turbans. \"It is for our martyrs.\" For Bittu Kanwarpal, secretary general of the once-proscribed Dal Khalsa organisation and a former militant, the key aim is to teach \"the next generation [about] the handful of people who sacrificed their lives and fought the might of the Indian state\".</p> <p>Support for some kind of memorial appears almost universal in Amritsar, but the involvement of the hardline groups and the leading role of Bhindranwale's own institution has worried many moderate Sikhs. Few in the Punjab now talk of the violence of previous decades, which often pitted brother against brother and involved widespread human rights abuses by all protagonists. It is not taught in schools or even in universities, other than as an optional element of postgraduate courses on terrorism. \"We will talk about it if someone wants to. But what is the point of raking over these bad memories? There are other issues such as deep and widespread poverty,\" said JS Sekhon, at Amritsar's Guru Nanak Dev University.</p> <p>Journalists in Amritsar say their yearly stories on the anniversary of the 1984 assault are met with dismay. \"People ask why we are going back to this,\" one said. The result is widespread ignorance. Yards from the Golden Temple, 19-year-old Damandeep Singh, who runs a dried fruit shop, said he knew of \"some kind of fight in the temple and then some bad times, but I don't know the details\". The vacuum is increasingly filled by the hardliners and voices from the diaspora. The two often coincide.</p> <p>Substantial funds have been donated to the new shrine from Sikhs overseas. Analysts say permission for the memorial, mooted since 2005, was granted after the local ruling party was surprised by widespread protests over the hanging of a jailed Sikh militant this year. \"We were worried that we were being outflanked by the hardliners. We need to keep the core Sikh vote,\" said one adviser to the party.</p> <p>The protests were in part a result of a revival in Sikh identity, the adviser said, influenced by diaspora Sikhs. Many Sikhs in the west feel humiliated by demands to remove traditional knives at airports or take off their turbans for official photographers, for example, and have been shocked by incidents in which Sikhs have been attacked, often mistaken for Muslims, in the last decade.</p> <p>\"The Wisconsin shooting was just one of many such incidents,\" said Kiranjot Kaur, an elected member of the Shiromani gurdwara parbandhak committee, which acts as a parliament for Sikhs and administers religious sites. \"They have a big impact here [in India]. They give rise to a sense of insecurity within the community here like over there.\"</p> <p>One response is to stage events such as Mr Singh, organised by the Amritsar-based Turban Pride Movement, which aims to encourage more Sikhs to wear traditional clothing and to <a href=\"http://in.news.yahoo.com/mr-singh-international-2012-amritsar-generate-awareness-sikhism-143723748.html\" title=\"\">increase awareness of the religion</a> among other communities. Contestants are judged on their knowledge of their faith as well as traditional Sikh martial arts, dance and music.</p> <p>Then there is a new cult status among teenagers of Bhindranwale himself. Some talk even of a Sikh Che Guevara. \"He fought oppression. He helped everybody, Hindu, Sikh or Muslim,\" said Solvinda Singh, a 19-year-old student.</p> <p>But such feelings, along with the new memorial, risk raising dormant tensions. \"He was a terrorist. Why commemorate a terrorist?\" said a police officer whose father was killed by Sikh militants in 1991. \"Any memorial should be for all victims of the conflict. I go to the temple daily to bow before the almighty. I do not even look at [the new shrine].\"</p> <p>Two-thirds of the Punjab's 24.5 million inhabitants are Sikh, and nine million are Hindu. Many Hindus support a memorial, but not all. Laxmi Kanta Chawla, a politician with the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, said buried memories should not be disturbed. \"These terrorists created violence and havoc. Tens of thousands died because of them, including many Hindus,\" she said. The battle is unlikely to be resolved soon. A key grievance of the Sikh community in India is what they say is the failure of the government to punish those responsible for the attack on the Golden Temple, the mob violence or abuses by security forces during the insurgency.</p> <p>HS Phoolka, a supreme court lawyer who has fought a long campaign to bring those accused of killing Sikhs in the 1984 massacres to justice, said the failure to \"apply the law of the land equally\" still fuelled resentment. \"The current generation need to know what happened. If proper legal process was followed, the attitude of people in the Punjab and outside would be completely different,\" he said.</p> <p>No one seriously suggests a return to the horrific violence of the 1980s and early 90s. Even hardliners admit that the creation of an independent Sikh state, Khalistan, is now a rallying cry rather than a genuine demand. But no one doubts the passions excited by recent history. \"If people stand silent, it does not mean they have forgotten,\" said Kaur, a moderate politician. \"One needs to resolve these issues. One needs to bring them to closure. In the Punjab that is sadly lacking.\"</p>",

Because <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/02/new-school-building-designs-curve-ban\" title=\"\">the government has banned curves from new school buildings</a>. Not just curves but also \"faceted curves\", indents, dog legs and notches. In other words, any shape you like as long as it's a plain box. The Department for Education is cracking down on what it saw as architectural extravagance in the now-scrapped Building Schools for The Future (BSF) programme. <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schoolscapital/buildingsanddesign/baseline/b00213673/baseline-designs-cost-and-area\" title=\"\">Its new \"baseline designs\", unveiled on Monday</a>, call for affordable, stripped-down, purely functional school buildings. Nothing wrong with that per se, but in taking his war with architecture into abstract geometrical realms, Michael Gove is revealing the source of his secret trauma.</p> <p>Gove clearly has issues with architecture. Last year <a href=\"http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/gove-richard-rogers-wont-design-your-school/8610768.article\" title=\"\">he told a free-schools conference</a>, \"We won't be getting Richard Rogers to design your school. We won't be getting any award-winning architects to design it, because no one in this room is here to make architects richer.\" Never mind what works for children or teachers. Or the fact that architects, especially award-winning ones, are generally quite good at designing buildings. Or the fact that the day before this outburst, Gove had been praising <a href=\"http://www.rsh-p.com/work/all_projects/mossbourne_community_academy/occupation\" title=\"\">Hackney's Mossbourne Community Academy</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/feb/08/architects-can-inspire-mossbourne-academy\" title=\"\">designed by, er, Richard Rogers</a>.</p> <p>In Gove's mind, good architecture seems to be indelibly associated with New Labour and the 1990s. And nothing signified that era of moral and aesthetic decay so much as the curve. Look how it sprang up in the pods and blobs of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/will-alsop\" title=\"\">Will Alsop</a>! Look how Norman Foster besmirched the City with his <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/greatbuildings/swissrebuilding/0,,2190414,00.html\" title=\"\">curvaceous Gherkin</a>, then built a spherical City Hall in London for the new (New Labour) mayor (and his lickspittle architectural advisor, Richard Rogers). Curves were everywhere: <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/greatbuildings/guggenheim/0,,2183680,00.html\" title=\"\">Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim</a>, the <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/greatbuildings/edenproject/0,,2183698,00.html\" title=\"\">London Eye</a>, the <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/greatbuildings/edenproject/0,,2183698,00.html\" title=\"\">Eden Project</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/visitandlearn/15983.aspx\" title=\"\">Scottish parliament</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.rsh-p.com/work/all_projects/millennium_experience\" title=\"\">Millennium Dome</a> (New Labour and Rogers again, ugh!), Zaha Hadid, <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/online/jonathan-ive-on-apple/imac-1998\" title=\"\">Jonathan Ives' iMac</a>, the <a href=\"http://the-car-club.co.uk/Pictures-Ford-Ford-Ka-Modified-Pink-2-[donny-Show-2006]-Format-Photo.html\" title=\"\">Ford Ka</a>, the sun, the moon, Kylie Minogue's bum. It must have been 10 years of wonky hell for Gove.</p> <p>So now he's literally putting things straight. Perhaps this is the first step towards a square new coalition utopia \u2013 a world entirely designed by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/lego\" title=\"\">Lego</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rubiks.com/\" title=\"\">Rubik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/piet-mondrian\" title=\"\">Mondrian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/david-chipperfield\" title=\"\">David Chipperfield</a>. Although that sounds a bit colourful. Perhaps colour should go too. Who needs it, after all?</p> <p>Curves or no curves, the sentiment for practical, low-cost, functional school buildings is one all architects can get behind. Think of Alison and Peter Smithson's seminal, scrupulously rectilinear <a href=\"http://en.wikiarquitectura.com/index.php/Hunstanton_School\" title=\"\">Hunstanton School</a> \u2013 a shining example of postwar modernist architecture. Or the standardised, prefabricated school design<a href=\"http://www.venicetakeaway.com/?portfolio=test\" title=\"\"> Oscar Niemeyer produced for Brazil's education department in the 1980s</a>. This was so successful, 508 schools were built to it, each customised to local needs. Why couldn't a similar thing happen here? Oh yes, because Niemeyer's design had curves in it.</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wonder if you could offer any guidance - I'm looking for any recent children's fiction set in ancient Rome for children aged 10 and up. I'm already a fan of Rosemary Sutcliff but would be particularly interested in any stories based on the domestic side of the Romans as opposed to the gladiator/soldier theme.</p> <p>Rebecca</p> </blockquote> <p>I, too, loved Rosemary Sutcliff who taught me all I know about Roman Britain \u2013 and a lot of other history besides. Her empathy with both the indigenous population of Britain and the Roman settlers provided an even-handed view of the past which was stimulating and satisfying. When The Eagle of the Ninth was published in 1954, the history of Rome as a model of might and empire was a familiar part of the school curriculum. What the Romans gave ancient Britain in terms of governance as well as domestic details such as the earliest kind of central heating was well-known. Now, in the teaching of history, curiosity about Rome and Romans in Britain is focused more on the underdogs than the rulers. Sadly, that hasn't translated into as many novels for children as might have been hoped, possibly because the history of Rome is inseparable from the concept of Empire, which is regarded more warily today. </p> <p>However, while legionaries may be out of fashion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/feb/09/gladiator-soldier-trumps\">gladiators are in</a>. Simon Scarrow's excellent series, which launches with Gladiator: Fight for Freedom, gives a good, if grim, account of the terrible treatment of a poor family might have experienced - Marcus Cornelius Primus, the gladiator, is rising out of such a family thanks to his fighting skills. </p> <p>More domestically, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2012/mar/01/top-writing-tips-caroline-lawrence\">Caroline Lawrence</a> creates an attractive and convincing view of growing up as a child in Rome in her Roman Mysteries. The series is based on the \"precinct\" format; the group of children at the heart of the adventures are neighbours readily slipping in and out of each other's houses and engaging in their local neighbourhood. How they and their families interact provides a fictional background which combines impeccably researched and accurate detail of everything Roman from toilets to writing tablets while also feeling remarkably like family/community life anywhere.<br></p>",

Our readers were divided over the wisdom of said remarks. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18495403\" title=\"\">Tron9 felt Davies had been misrepresented:</a></p> <blockquote> Did anybody actually listen to the podcast that Alan made referring to Hillsborough? He asked why only Liverpool did this \u2013 he mentioned the Rangers disaster and many more. [This] was then twisted out of control by the Mail and the Mirror who were having slow news days. Maybe he went over the top and if you listen to his podcast he can be ranty at times, but he said many times he wasn't trying to disrespect the families or people involved. It's a shame so many jumped on the bandwagon of hate without listening first to what he said and the context of the discussion. </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18502232\" title=\"\">Alarming, however, saw things otherwise:</a></p> <blockquote> Davies might have realised that the recent revelations about what went on in Hillsborough happened precisely because the families didn't let it lie and did what they could to keep the cover up in the public eye. <br> The Rangers tragedy didn't involve such levels of corruption as far as I can remember. If it had done I'm sure the families of the victims would have followed the same path as the Liverpool families.  I'm sure he didn't mean any harm but it was an extremely pointless observation. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/29/thick-of-it-episode-four\" title=\"\">the debate rages on about The Thick of It</a>.

This week's episode satisfied all those who'd been missing Malcolm Tucker, although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18578630\" title=\"\">Domfloyd thinks that, even in the absence of Peter Capaldi's character, his influence is felt in a highly topical way</a>:</p> <blockquote> A brilliant episode. And unlike others, I really enjoyed the first three too. This series seems darker, more paranoid and \"messy\" than the earlier series, and therefore more fitting to these optimism-free times. <br> I like that all the other characters attempt to be Malcolm Tucker. It shows he left his mark on the entire political system, even though no one does it quite like Tucker.  The Labour government was masterful at spin. The coalition tries to be, but fails. It seems only apt that the coalition in The Thick of It should try to be like Tucker was in previous series but fails \u2026 </blockquote>",
  "<p>As a gay African, with a background in analytic philosophy, the most annoying opposition to my sexual orientation is the claim that my lifestyle is un-African. It is annoying because historic and anthropological claims about the origins of behaviour seldom offer principled reasons why a lifestyle should never be allowed.</p> <p>Colonialists are often accused of bringing homosexuality to Africa. Yet they never get attributed with a likelier anthropological truth: introducing penal codes to the continent that outlaw gay sex. An irony that bypasses homophobic leaders such as Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, is that anti-sodomy laws on their countries' statute books were first designed and implemented by the former colonial powers now accused of exporting homosexuality. Should former colonial masters not rather be accused of teaching Africa how to codify homophobia?</p> <p>There is no anthropological evidence that homosexuality first occurred in Africa after colonisation began. The linguistic markers that draw attention to same-sex attraction \u2013 \"faggot\", \"gay\", \"homosexual\", etc \u2013 may be inventions of the English language. And homophobic taxonomies distinguishing sexual identities that are \"normal\" from those that are \"abnormal\" may have first flowed from psychological studies in the west. But basic same-sex attraction, without linguistic markers or psychological theories, occurs in all societies where human beings find themselves. It would be rather strange for fundamental human experiences to be so highly relative that homosexuality was time- or place-bound.</p> <p>A more serious problem with the claim that homosexuality is un-African is that it is a feeble normative assertion. For one thing, the mere existence of gay men and women who are African constitutes a counter-example to the claim. You can only insist that homosexuality is un-African if you maintain that a few individuals are entitled to define what being African must mean. It is not clear why gay Africans cannot craft narratives of African identity that includes the fact that they are homosexual. Why is same-sex attraction inherently un-African? I have yet to see homophobes across the African continent answer this question without simply asserting that it is so.</p> <p>Of course, assertions, especially in the hands of men and women with massive political power, can quickly become reality. Hence the constant reports about the repression of gay Africans. But that is just evidence of the might of state power. It is not a compelling moral argument just because a majority of citizens swallow the homophobic rhetoric of political leaders.</p> <p>And this relates to the biggest lie about homosexuality's place in African societies. Even assuming homosexuality does not predate colonialism, which it does, it would not follow that homosexuality should not be permitted here. Why should African beliefs and traditions not be subject to moral criticism and revision?</p> <p>Any African leader, who thinks tradition for its own sake is worth preserving, inadvertently promotes the continent as a place where critical self-examination is not allowed. That is nothing to be proud of. Any custom, homophobic or otherwise, that cannot withstand critical evaluation should simply be assigned to a dustbin of historic embarrassments. Since homosexuality is not harmful to gay men and women, or to any gawking bystander, there is no reason to outlaw it in Africa or elsewhere. Opposition to homosexuality, let's face is, at best aesthetic \u2013 \"Yuk!\" \u2013 and at worst prejudice that is handed down to us. It is homophobia, rather than homosexuality, that is ultimately an embarrassment for Africa.</p> <p><em>Eusebius McKaiser is an associate at the University of Witwatersrand's Centre for Ethics, based in Johannesburg.

  "<p>Mitt Romney has softened his position on immigration, promising for the first time to honour changes introduced in the summmer by Barack Obama that offer temporary visas to undocumented young people brought into the US by their parents.</p> <p>In an interview with the Denver Post before the first presidential debate in Colorado on Wednesday, he pledged that he would not revoke Obama's executive order and that undocumented young people who were brought to the US before their 16th birthday will not be deported.</p> <p>Romney has avoided answering the question of what he would do with Obama's order if he won the election, saying only that the issue had to be addressed by long-term reforms. His shift, on the eve of the debate and five weeks before the White House election, is aimed at cutting into Obama's commanding lead among Latino voters, who, though a minority, could tip the balance in some swing states.</p> <p>Romney told the paper: \"The people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place, which is a two-year visa, should expect that the visa would continue to be valid.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I'm not going to take something that they've purchased. Before those visas have expired we will have the full immigration reform plan that I've proposed.\"</p> <p>His change came the day before the first presidential debate, being held in Denver, and five weeks before the White House election.</p> <p>Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration during the Republican primaries and caucuses, saying he would pursue tough policies that would lead to \"self-deportation\". But he now faces electoral arithmetic that shows Latinos backing Obama by at least two to one \u2013 and that could make a difference in swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and Florida.</p> <p>When Obama introduced the change in June with an order that bypassed Congress, Romney criticised the president for failing to go through the legislature. Faced with questions at the time about what he would do about the visas if he won the election, Romney opted for ambiguity, saying the order would be \"superseded\" by what he said would a comprehensive immigration reform package.</p> <p>There are an estimated 11 million or more undocumented migrants in the US, making immigration an emotive issue. Some diehard Republicans favour deporting those immigrants without papers, but Democrats, and some moderate Republicans, argue this is impractical and needs a more humane approach.</p> <p>Obama won the support of Latinos in the 2008 election, but disillusionment crept in with his failure to deliver on immigration reform combined with a continuing high number of deportations.</p> <p>In an interview last month with Spanish-language network Univision, he described the lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his first term. His order lifting the threat to undocumented children rallied Latinos behind him again.</p> <p>Romney and some of the other Republican presidential candidates alienated many Latinos during the primaries and caucuses with their anti-immigrant rhetoric. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry took a different line. </p> <p>Since becoming the Republican presidential nominee, Romney has tentatively tried to woo Latinos, with a series of Spanish political broadcasts and appearances on Spanish-language TV stations.</p> <p>Romney had been working on an immigration reform plan with the Florida senator Marco Rubio, but abandoned it when Obama announced his order.</p> <p>In the Post interview, Romney said he would introduce immigration reform in his first year in office but did not go into specifics.</p> <p>\"I will propose a piece of legislation which will reform our immigration system to improve legal immigration so people don't have to hire lawyers to figure out how to get here legally,\" Romney said. \"The president promised in his first year \u2013 his highest priority\u2013 that he would reform immigration, and he didn't. And I will.\"</p> <p>As well as voting for the president in November, Colorado will also vote on whether to legalise marijuana, allowing people to possess small amounts for recreational purposes, the first state in the US to allow this. At present, it is available over the counter in the state for medicinal uses.</p> <p>The change is backed by some Republicans as well as Democrats.</p> <p>A recent poll showed 51% in favour of the change in law but Romney expressed his opposition.</p> <p>\"I oppose marijuana being used for recreational purposes and I believe the federal law should prohibit the recreational use of marijuana,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The French wellington boot-maker Le Chameau, which is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/jun/18/know-your-welly-tribes\" title=\"\">a firm favourite of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge</a>, is set to be snapped up by private equity firm Marwyn Management Partners for \u20ac16.5m.</p> <p>The brand, founded in 1927 in Normandy, is about a third the size of its biggest rival, Hunter, but private equity bosses believe it has great expansion potential, especially since its royal fans have been pictured on several occasions sporting the handcrafted boots, which cost up to \u00a3550 a pair.</p> <p>Last year, Le Chameau posted net sales of \u20ac24m (\u00a319.2m). By comparison, UK rival Hunter had sales of \u00a378m last year.</p> <p>Le Chameau's parent company, the skiwear and camping equipment firm Lafuma, wants to offload the business to focus more on its outdoor sports market instead.</p> <p>Mark Watts, executive director of Marwyn, said: \"Le Chameau is a brand with an exceptional heritage and product of the very highest quality.</p> <p>\"We look forward to progressing the transaction to completion in the coming weeks and then helping to grow the business and develop it as a truly international luxury brand.\"</p> <p>Sales of Le Chameau's \u00a3160 Vierzonard boots jumped by a third after the duchess was pictured wearing a pair at a charity event this summer. Sales of men's boots also increased on the back of the \"duchess effect\".</p> <p>The royal connection will no doubt help increase the company's identity, but the biggest profit boosts are expected to come from expanding markets in Asia, where consumers are keen to show off their wealth with high-end goods and clothing.</p> <p>The investment is Marwyn's first foray into the luxury goods market after focusing on construction groups and then moving into software and media. The equity firm focuses in buying small- and medium-sized firms worth up to \u00a3500m.</p> <p>One of its biggest deals was in 2007 when it bought and floated for $200m (\u00a3125m) the film and television distributor Entertainment One, the company behind the releases of the Twilight film franchise and the Peppa Pig TV series.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Retail_and_leisure/article1136816.ece\" title=\"\">Hunter has reported a 38% increase in sales in 2011 to \u00a378m</a>, with sales in the UK up 53%, US sales up 11% and international sales elsewhere rising 66%.</p> <p>Its Regent, Glitter and Gloss Original boots sold particularly well, according to the company, while its Balmoral leather Hawksworth boot, costing \u00a3285, won new footwear product of the year at the shooting industry awards.</p> <p>The US private equity firm Searchlight Capital bought a majority stake in the business last December, announcing plans for an international expansion, which appear to be working.</p> <p>Searchlight's chairman, Oliver Haarmann, said: \"In 2011, Hunter continued to see success in both fashion and traditional country markets. Europe and the far east drove a favourable international performance whilst product development also contributed to strong sales. Going forward, even with the challenging market conditions, we will continue to invest in the Hunter brand, supporting its development in the digital environment and the expansion of the Hunter business across the globe.\"</p>",
  "<p>Even by its own turbulent standards, Georgia looks to be entering a prolonged period of political instability following watershed parliamentary elections won by the opposition Georgian Dream coalition \u2013 the first time since independence in 1991 that power has been transferred through an election rather than a revolution.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/02/georgia-president-saakashvili-election-defeat\" title=\"\">President Mikheil Saakashvili's unexpectedly gracious admission today</a> that his ruling United National Movement had been defeated fair and square, his victorious opponents may face serious problems working with a man they have spent months vilifying and decrying as a dictator. Saakashvili is not due to stand down until October next year, and is unlikely to accept lame duck status without a fight.</p> <p>Who rules Georgia, a pint-sized Caucasus nation of 4.5 million people, matters disproportionately to both Russia, its former colonial master that involuntarily relinquished control in 1991, and the US and Europe. Georgia has a strategic importance that belies its size \u2013 a crossroads at Asia's gate with signposts pointing to Iran, Turkey, Russia and west and north across the Black Sea.</p> <p>For energy-poor western Europe, Georgia is a vital conduit for Caspian basin oil and gas exports that are not, for now at least, under Moscow's manipulative control. Vladimir Putin's Kremlin views Georgia very much as part of its backyard, a \"near abroad\" property (though the phrase is not much used these days) that should conform to Russian interests. Europe believes it belongs inside its post-Soviet, liberal pro-market \"eastern neighbourhood\".</p> <p>The idea Georgia might one day join Nato \u2013 it already contributes through the Partnership for Peace scheme \u2013 and the EU is anathema to Russian nationalists. It is not coincidental that since 2008, when Putin sent his tanks deep into Georgian territory in support of independence for the breakaway satraps of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia has effectively controlled about one-fifth of Georgia's total land mass.</p> <p>The problem for both sides of this strategic equation is that Georgia's leaders \u2013 they might better be termed overlords \u2013 tend not to do what they are told, even by putative friends. Saakashvili's authoritarian, sometimes confrontational style, pockmarked by serial rights abuses including a recent prison torture scandal, has embarrassed his Brussels backers. The west wants a stable Georgian government, not one engaged in a personalised, potentially dangerous feud with the Putin regime.</p> <p>Yet the man behind the Georgian Dream opposition, billionaire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/01/bidzina-ivanishvili-profile-georgia\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, could also prove an awkward customer, should he be confirmed as prime minister. Ivanishvili made his money, lots and lots of it, during Russia's corrupt oligarch era. He still reportedly holds a chunk of Gazprom shares. Saakashvili predictably labelled him a Kremlin stooge, a charge he denies.</p> <p>While Putin will undoubtedly be hugely gratified to see his sworn enemy Saakashvili taken down a peg or two, he cannot be sure the mercurial Ivanishvili, who until recently led the anonymous life of a Citizen Kane-style recluse in his large luxury home overlooking Tbilisi, will do his bidding. Cloning Ukraine's pro-Kremlin president, Viktor Yanukovych, would be too good to be true for the Kremlin's karate king. That Georgians have swapped one Saakashvili for another is a more plausible possibility.</p> <p>Commentator Thomas de Waal casts the elections as a <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/26/georgia_holds_its_breath\" title=\"\">clash of titans</a>, neither of whom placed a more perfect democracy at the top of their to-do list:</p> <blockquote> \"Greek scholar Ilia Roubanis has called Georgian politics 'pluralistic feudalism', a competition between a patriarchal leader who enjoys uncontested rule over the country and a leader of the opposition bidding to unseat him and acquire the same [...] <br> \"Saakashvili has been personally leading the election campaign for the governing party [...] even though he is not running for parliament himself. His main message is that, like the medieval Georgian king, David the Builder, he has been building a new nation and he and his team deserve to be allowed to finish the job.\" </blockquote> <p>.</p> <p>Ivanishvili's parliamentary victory has punctured that vision, potentially fatally. But <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/01/georgias_electoral_showdown?page=0,0\" title=\"\">as James Kirchick of the New Republic pointed out</a>, his leadership credentials remain untested, his policy programme is both grandiose and vague on particulars, and President Saakashvili remains a formidable and powerful rival. With the loosely bound, six-party Georgian Dream coalition subject to potential splits and parliamentary defections, and the country entering wholly new territory, Georgia's political outlook, never calm, looks more stormy than ever.</p>",
  "<p>The NHS has been addressing the growing problem of older people becoming <a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/get-involved/campaign/hungry-to-be-heard/\" title=\"\">malnourished while in hospital</a>, either because they don't get food they can eat or the help they need to eat it. However, malnutrition among older people in care has proved to be a more difficult problem to tackle as many residential care homes are small family-run establishments. The <a href=\"http://www.bapen.org.uk/tackling-malnutrition/nutritional-advice-and-information/treating-malnutrition/food-first-project\" title=\"\">Food First project</a>, led by two registered dietitians based at Bedfordshire primary care trust (PCT), now part of South Essex partnership trust (SEPT), aims to address the root causes of the condition.</p> <p>Cathy Forbes, an advanced specialist dietitian and Food First project lead, says: \"Over the last few years, the medicines management team at the PCT realised that spending on oral nutritional supplements [for older people], which are mainly prescribed by GPs, was increasing steeply, and we were looking for ways to control costs. We realised that the best way to reduce the need for oral supplements was to ensure that care homes were providing a high standard of dietary intake for residents. We also quickly understood that in only tackling the issues around inappropriate prescribing, we were just 'sticking a plaster' over the problem of malnutrition and not addressing the real issues.\"</p> <p>Forbes helped to set up a scheme to support staff working with vulnerable people across health and social care. It includes drawing up individual nutritional care plans for people in care homes and allowing staff to change a person's diet.</p> <p>\"Obviously, most independent [care] providers want their residents to eat good food \u2026 and they realise that if residents are eating better food, they're more alert, happier and will stay in the care home for longer, for which they get paid, so there's a financial incentive too,\" says Forbes.</p> <p>Nympha Castillo, a senior carer at the Little Bramingham Farm care home in Luton, which has 24 residents, says it has benefited hugely from working with the Food First team. \"We have a number of residents who are regarded as at high risk from malnutrition, and in the past we've used oral supplements with these residents,\" she says. \"But since we've redesigned our menus to give better nutritional content, we've had to use these much less. Our residents also seem much more alert and enjoy their food more.\" The home encourages families of residents to come and eat with them as this can encourage elderly people to eat more.</p> <p>As part of the programme, the Food First team has a regular system of inspections of care homes' food standards. After initially working with the managers and caterers in homes on menus and nutritional requirements for residents, they visit homes on a weekly or fortnightly basis to check that standards are being maintained and to advise on solving any problems. The homes are given a certificate of food nutritional quality, which they can display publicly, and \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 if standards fall, the team can withdraw the certificate.</p> <p>The project has been funded by medicines management teams in Luton and Central Bedfordshire PCTs, which oversee prescribing in the residential and nursing home sectors. The initial start-up costs are offset by a long-term reduction in prescribing costs for nutritional products. Already in 2011-12 SEPT says it has saved \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>The programme, which was set up in 2009, has now been extended to three PCT areas. As a result of working with the team, 95% of care homes in the three areas have improved the nutritional standards of their food and have seen improvements in residents' health. Similar schemes are now also running in other areas of England, including Darlington, County Durham and Leicester.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the British Dietetic Association (BDA), the professional body for registered dietitians, has launched its own campaign, <a href=\"http://www.mindthehungergap.com/\" title=\"\">Mind the Hunger Gap</a>, to make health and social care professionals more aware of the problem of malnutrition. \"We want to co-ordinate with other organisations in tackling the problem and we are working closely with Carers UK on ways to improve nutrition for vulnerable people,\" says Andy Burman, BDA chief executive. \"Around 20% to 30% of our members work in the community and they have seen a sharp rise in the number of people suffering from malnutrition in recent years.</p> <p>\"We can demonstrate to our colleagues in social care that we can tackle these issues cost-effectively, and our campaign is crucial, especially at a time when the NHS and councils are having to save money.\"</p>",
  "<p>As more than half a million students puzzle over thousands of courses on Ucas, the most important advice, says Karen Pichlmann, head of admissions at Bournemouth University, is to choose something you like: \"Three or four years is a long time if you aren't really interested.\"</p> <p>Get it right and you will reap the benefits: 85% of UK students said they were were either \"definitely\" or \"mostly\" satisfied with the quality of their course, according to the latest National Student Survey.</p> <p>But how to sift between so many joint, combined and unusual options \u2013 for instance, forensic computing and security, forensic investigation or forensic science out of the 132 undergraduate courses at Bournemouth?</p> <p>The answer is research. Jonathan Tinnacher, head of student recruitment at the University of Leicester (165 courses) says: \"Be thorough in the research you do, making sure the courses you apply for really are what you want to do, and that you've done the right subjects at school to get in. And be thorough in your application, making sure that everything you say is clear, correct and complete.\" Apply early, adds Karen Pichlmann, if your course admits through interviews or if you want a place in halls.</p> <p>Universities publish entry profiles on the Ucas website, which say exactly what they are looking for. Students who fit the bill \u2013 be it academic or non-academic \u2013 will be first to receive an offer, says Tinnacher. Don't waste choices on wishful thinking. Many universities demand minimum criteria, like B or C in English and maths at GCSE: if you don't have these grades, don't apply to them.</p> <h2><strong>What do you really want?</strong></h2> <p>Choosing works both ways: are you what they want? And do they offer what you want? League tables, internet chat forums and universities' own course microsites offer masses of information on everything from teaching methods to the best clubbing. Do you want a party town? A country campus? And don't forget your best resource \u2013 last year's school-leavers, who are already living with the results of their research.</p> <p>Research should include visiting at least three open days, run by universities throughout the year. Online league tables and comparison websites are useful, too, but nothing beats the real vibe of a visit. Jeremy Jones, 22, studies classics at Oxford University and says: \"When I went for the open day, we saw a class with everyone arguing about their subject and I immediately felt how much I wanted to join in.\"</p> <p>Parents need to be careful about intervening in this process. They may feel that law is a good career, but you will not be keen to swot up on cases when you long to be creating computer games. Parents may have been happy at a particular institution \u2013 but would you thrive?</p> <p>Even if you start late, don't rush at your online application: writing a personal statement is as important as grades; your chance to stand out.</p> <p>Rob Evans, head of admissions for the University of Sussex, stresses, \"The best personal statements are personal: honest, genuine and in the applicant's own words, which reflect on what the applicant has done rather than merely describing it.\" Draft, leave for a few days, review, draft again, then throw it away and&#xa0;redraft.</p> <p>Finally, vary your level of application, so that you have a real gap between your two offers. Your lower offer should be 40-60 points lower than your higher offer, because the Ucas \"adjustment\" period after results means that universities may revise an offer 20-40 points down. And if you don't get your grades \u2013 or anywhere near \u2013 there will still be good places in clearing, with the best choice for those who act quickly on results day.</p>",

This is why I have to make a specification concerning the 75%, and I can do it as a neutral Swiss. Willsher rightly remarked that tax burdens are hard to calculate.

  "<p>In its early pages, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141198651/mrs-bridge\" title=\"\">Mrs Bridge</a>, Evan S Connell's 1959 debut novel, can read a little like a parody of the life of the kind of person who might have purchased <a href=\"http://j-walk.com/other/goodwife/images/goodwifeguide.gif\" title=\"\">one of those \"How to Be a Perfect Housewife\" etiquette guides</a> that were popular during the more buttoned-up years of the last century, and which modern publishers <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-1950s-%2522Good-Housekeeping%2522/dp/1843404885/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349176193&amp;sr=1-9\" title=\"\">occasionally reprint for their comedy value</a>. India Bridge, its central character, has special expensive hand towels, which she puts out only when she has guests and secretly hopes they will not use. When in company, she rings the bell for her maid, Harriet, because she thinks it's expected of her, even though it would be easier to walk into the next room and talk to her directly. She judges people \"by their shoes and their manners at the table\", and has never met a socialist.</p> <p>Written from a kind of tilted, ironic angle, it's often very funny; no surprise that it is a favourite book of Joshua Ferris, author of the similarly tilted and ironic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141027630/then-we-came-to-the-end-a-novel\" title=\"\">Then We Came to the End</a>. And if this were all Mrs Bridge was, it would still be one of the sharper novels about mid-20th-century domestic life. But Mrs Bridge is so much more than that. It's a book about an underrepresented character in American literary fiction \u2013 the alienated upper-middle-class housewife, passing from youth to old age with a nagging existential fear \u2013 written, with great sensitivity, by a man in his early 30s. It's a book that is smart and knowing and makes its reader feel as if they're in on a joke, while at the same time gradually coaxing them to feel more and more empathy for its vaguely absurd main character, and ultimately playing them like an emotional Stradivarius.</p> <p>Right from the off, Mrs Bridge is slightly at odds with her situation. \"It seemed to her that her parents must have been thinking of someone else when they named her,\" we are told. Early on, we learn that her wealthy, hard-working husband, Walter, doesn't appear to feel any great passion towards her; her early hope that the long hours he spends at the office are \"a temporary condition\" are soon dashed. She tries her best, always concerned about the eyes that are upon her, never wanting to make trouble for anyone else, ensuring her children are cared for and that she puts up neither too many nor too few Christmas decorations, for fear of being judged. In everything she does, though, there is just a tinge of disenfranchisement; a feeling of absence. She feels she has failed when she finds a porn magazine in her son Douglas's laundry, but when he builds a tower of junk, she listens to him speak with enthusiasm about it only \"because she knew children wanted their parents to be interested in what they were doing\".</p> <p>In the novel's short, themed chapters, there are occasionally flashes of Saki's dark, abrupt wit. At one point, we find Mr and Mrs Bridge discussing a former neighbour's child, Tarquin, who seems to have got up to no good in a manner that has made the local newspaper headlines. They remark that they knew he was a \"bad sort\" when they heard him calling his parents by their middle name. Only at the end of the chapter are we casually informed that the no good he has got up to is shooting both his parents dead. Later, it seems Mrs Bridge is finally getting in touch with the sadness she feels about the lack of physical warmth in her marriage and, with great effort, prepares to speak to Walter about it. When he arrives home that night, before he has chance to speak, he announces \"I see you forgot to have the car lubricated\" and we never hear of the matter again.</p> <p>Connell wrote Mrs Bridge at around the same time that Philip Roth, John Updike and Richard Yates produced some of their most celebrated early books: writing, like they did, about suburbia, about families, about alienation. But his name isn't mentioned in serious literary discussions as theirs are. Perhaps this is because he's had a far less heavyweight literary career path: apart from Mrs Bridge, he is best known for a similarly slim sequel,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141391557/mrs-bridge-and-mr-bridge\" title=\"\"> Mr Bridge</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780712666947/son-of-the-morning-star-general-custer-and-the-battle-of-the-little-bighorn\" title=\"\">a biography of General Custer</a>. But I wonder whether Roth, Updike or Yates could have written about characters like these with the same sensitivity. Even the domineering Mr Bridge \u2013 who fails to realise that what his family need is \"himself instead of what he can give us\" \u2013 is treated with sympathy. Could those novelists have been brave enough to tell such a big story in so few, modest pages? As Ferris says in his introduction to the new Penguin edition: \"No book so relentlessly reminds us of the relentlessness of time.\" Sometimes, the sadness of it can be nothing short of dizzying. \"Thirty, thirty five, forty, all had come to visit her like admonitory relatives,\" Connell writes of his main character, \"and all had slipped away without a trace, without a sound, and now, once again, she was waiting.\" If there is a more profoundly affecting sentence that has been written in American fiction about the ageing process, I am yet to read it.</p>",
  "<p>After weeks of dithering, Mali finally last week asked for United Nations backing in the hope of one day regaining control of the north of the country overrun six months ago by heavily armed Islamist groups. This initiative is supported by France.</p> <p>Mali's decision opens the way for the deployment of five battalions \u2013 3,300 combatants \u2013 provided by members of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Last Monday, on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meeting, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, was finally able to announce that the interim president of Mali, Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, had asked UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to table a security council resolution mandating an international force \"to help the Malian army to reconquer the occupied areas of northern Mali\".</p> <p>Until recently Bamako had been keen to obtain outside help, but would not have foreign troops stationed in the capital. The government finally yielded to pressure from Ecowas, which is determined to prevent the rot spreading to neighbouring countries.</p> <p>But the agreement underpinning intervention has yet to be finalised and much remains to be done. Ecowas is having difficulty finding troops, as potential participants have set stiff financial conditions. Many of their armies are already fully stretched.</p> <p>There will be no lack of operational headaches. Bamako wants its own army to play a leading role, but it is currently in tatters after being mauled by a rebel offensive in mid-January. Some observers suggest it may take 18 months to put it back on its feet. Even with outside support it will be hard put to win back the northern provinces, held by some \"6,000 Islamist combatants\", according to a French estimate. So Mali and its neighbours are counting on various forms of support from further afield, mainly France: training, intelligence, cargo and combat aircraft.</p> <p>At the UN general assembly last Wednesday, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande called for a security council meeting \"as soon as possible\", but Paris is reluctant to be too active, for fear of being accused of neocolonialist intervention. It also wants to avoid exacerbating the plight of four French hostages held by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in northern Mali.</p> <p>According to the International Crisis Group, the US is adopting a cautious stance, but Paris knows that US backing in the security council is vital. It will have to convince the Russians too. However, Britain is fully aware of the risks of regional instability and is particularly concerned about the threat to Nigeria and Sierra Leone posed by the proliferation of armed Islamist groups.</p> <p>This article appeared previously in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>My parents moved to the Shadsworth estate, on the outskirts of Blackburn, when it was first built in the late 1950s, and my mother still lives in the house where my brothers and sisters were born. I moved away in 1985, but when both my father and mother-in-law became seriously ill nine years ago, I&#xa0;moved back with my husband and our 14-year-old son Alex.</p> <p>All of my immediate family live on or around the estate, which is home to around 2,000 people. All of my family are, and always have been, in employment. I'm a part-time community development worker with a degree in English literature and psychology. My husband, Paul, is a landscape gardener. We are by no means unique.</p> <p>As parents, we all have aspirations for our children. School, college, university, good jobs, and stable families are important to us. We are served by four primary schools, which all received a good rating in their last Ofsted inspections, and the older children have just relocated to a new \u00a324m secondary school. There are teenagers on the estate who are studying at college and university, and adult students learning new skills.</p> <p>Shadsworth's fantastic GP surgery is staffed by professionals with a&#xa0;positive outlook, who are very accessible to patients, and we have a multimillion-pound hospital, a leisure centre with a swimming pool, playgrounds, and a&#xa0;nature trail. Shadsworth appears to be a suburb just like many others. That's because it is. Not that you'd know that from its \"Shameless\"-like portrayal in the BBC's Panorama documentary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19547168\" title=\"\">Trouble on the Estate</a>, in September.</p> <p>Yes, we have problems. Drugs, alcohol issues, kids hanging around, \"dysfunctional\" (how I detest that word) families. In an area where 42% of&#xa0;adults have no formal qualifications and 39% of children are considered to live in poverty, life can be tough. But we are a&#xa0;pretty resilient bunch.</p> <p>Local volunteers run popular community groups at the health and wellbeing centre. They include bingo, a breakfast club, a dads' group, parent and tots, and stitch and bitch. Shad Beehive majorette group has won many trophies nationally, and Greensleeves is a volunteer-run garden project growing produce for sale.</p> <p>Twin Valley Homes, which owns the majority of housing on the estate, has a tremendous input at community level, and, along with local charity Healthy Living, which provides a mobile fruit and vegetable co-op, was instrumental in saving the health and wellbeing centre. Local children are queueing up to join Brownies and Cub scouts at the parish church, which also supports vulnerable people through its pastoral care group.</p> <p>A resident-led community board has just been set up that will oversee the spending of a \u00a31m lottery grant awarded to Shadsworth and Whitebirk because we were identified as one of the 150 areas in the UK that hadn't received much lottery funding. The board will ensure that the money earmarked to build better communities has a lasting legacy by investing in people and places. This may be through backing social enterprises, and providing training for residents and groups so that any improvements are sustainable.</p> <p>Most <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9535308/BBC-made-youths-put-hoods-up-to-make-estate-look-worse-in-Panorama-documentary.htm\" title=\"\">residents</a> felt a sense of betrayal, outrage and disappointment towards Trouble on the Estate, which they consider to be blatantly prejudiced.

  "<p>Pictures taken by the Canadian photographer Daniel Hayduk reveal an intriguing, but essential, aspect of the west African economy. Contraband fuel purchased legally in Nigeria, where subsidies keep prices much lower than in neighbouring countries, irrigates the economies of the whole region.</p> <p>Every morning a flotilla of small boats approaches the Togolese coast, laden with Nigerian fuel. The jerry cans are thrown overboard and towed back to the beach by swimmers. The precious liquid is decanted for sale in the capital Lom\u00e9, but also in Ghana, Burkina Faso and even Mali. The beaches of neighbouring Benin are the scene of similar operations.</p> <p>Smuggling has reached an unprecedented level with the boom in global oil prices since 2008. It is hard to provide firm estimates but it certainly seems essential to the economies of each state. In November 2011, Benin's finance minister acknowledged that more than three-quarters of the fuel consumed there was illegally imported from Nigeria. In Togo, population 6 million, a 250-litre barrel sells for $300, a small fortune in a country where about two-thirds of the population live in poverty. Some smugglers and local dignitaries have reaped generous rewards, and \"micro-petro-states\" have sprung up on either side of the border between Togo and Benin, where \"local officials \u2026 are largely independent of national law and its enforcement\", according to an article published in March by the website ThinkAfricaPress.</p> <p>Despite the scale of the smuggling, the authorities have done little to stop it. Street vendors watch out for police raids, which are sometimes violent, but carry on selling the fuel in broad daylight. Corruption is not the only explanation. The racket is a serious problem for governments, but a source of work for many people, and a boon for all those who use the cheap fuel \u2013 the price is 15% to 30% less than in Togo's licensed filling stations. To stop such a flourishing trade is unthinkable in a country where the informal economy is predominant \u2013 accounting for more than 70% of jobs in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the International Labour Organisation. On the other hand, this illegal business entails a net loss for the already constrained budgets of these countries.</p> <p>International agencies, particularly the International Monetary Fund, issue regular protests, pressing for prices to be harmonised across the region. Nigeria is under pressure to end its system of subsidies. A Nigerian parliamentary report, published in April, estimated the subsidies had cost the nation $17bn in 2011, much more than the $8bn announced by the government. So far attempts to raise prices have failed, with general strikes forcing the authorities to backtrack.</p> <p>In January, yielding to popular outrage, President Goodluck Jonathan had to rescind his decision to raise the price of a litre of petrol from 60 cents to 85 cents. Most Nigerians see the subsidy as the only good thing about the oil industry, which has benefited an elite perceived as deeply corrupt.</p> <p>\u2022 This article appeared previously in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>In-laws in films are generally used to comic effect. In the work of <a href=\"http://www.clarissehahn.com/\" title=\"\">Clarisse Hahn</a> they could form the basis for half a dozen tragedies and as many historical epics. The director's life-partner, Oktay Sengul (credited as assistant director), belongs to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds\" title=\"\">Kurdish</a> family from eastern <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\" title=\"\">Turkey</a>. His parents emigrated to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\" title=\"\">France</a> and regularly return with their children to the little town where the clan settled after its village was razed. In the course of various visits Hahn has built up a meticulous family portrait, betraying deep affection but also a form of lucid effrontery.</p> <p>Watching the great-grandmother in the first real sequence of <a href=\"http://en.unifrance.org/movie/30028/kurdish-lover\" title=\"\">Kurdish Lover</a> it is immediately apparent this is no ordinary family album. Far from being a fairy godmother, the old woman is more like a wicked witch: mean, cruel to her daughter-in-law, capriciously tormenting her brood.</p> <p>In the confined space of the house Hahn picks up the forces working on the family: jealousy, frustration, enduring inequality between men and women, but above all the miseries of war and exile. None of this is said; it is all filmed, with very little commentary. For example, Hahn offers no explanation of the refugee situation, so if you know nothing about Kurdish history, you may find it confusing.</p> <p>Hahn tends to focus on moments of violence and doubt, ranging from a break-up on Skype to the ritual sacrifice of a lamb. The apparent modernity of the online strife is compensated by the complete lack of privacy, with the whole clan sitting around while one of the youths struggles to come to terms with the demands of his western European girlfriend.</p> <p>We almost learn more about Hahn than her partner, supposedly the subject of the essay. She is often hailed directly by the people she so persistently films, sometimes prompting resentment. But the switch back and forth between a contemplative gaze and more invasive probing is quite in tune with the chaotic life of Kurdistan, a country that refuses to go away, despite having never really existed.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Scores of students were killed after gunmen burst into a university residence in north-eastern Nigeria hours after a disputed student union election led to rival gangs rampaging through the town.</p> <p>At least 32 students were shot or stabbed at Federal Polytechnic Mubi as armed union members attacked the residence during the night, a university official said. Residents said rival students killed the winner of the elections late on Sunday, then spread out in gangs across the town.</p> <p>\"They were going door to door to find their victims, but anybody in the wrong place at the wrong time could have been killed,\" said one student. The spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency, Yushau Shuaib, said in a statement: \"The crisis in Mubi is suspected to have been fuelled by campus politics after an election at the [college].\"</p> <p>A student told Associated Press that students had recently found a warning, believed to have been written by members of the radical Islamist sect Boko Haram, pasted on the gate of the female hostel in the campus ordering the authorities to evacuate the school. Mubi, in north-east Nigeria, has become awash with weapons and violence since Boko Haram began attacks there. More than 1,100 people have died in the group's battle to impose a strict interpretation of sharia law on Nigeria's 160-million strong population, evenly split between Muslims and Christians.</p> <p>Security officials say top-ranking members have migrated to the town after sustained military crackdowns on the group's spiritual home in neighbouring Borno state. Last month, officials arrested 154 members while at least 30 people have died in attacks and shootouts there.</p> <p>\"Because of the situation with Boko Haram we didn't take risks and the army was deployed. There was an hour of gun battles during the night before the [union members] were driven back,\" a state security official told the Guardian.</p> <p>Security officials said a stash of explosives and other weapons, including brand new AK47s, submachine guns and poison-tip arrows, was discovered during a raid last month on a student residence used by Boko Haram. Another police sweep last week uncovered further piles of explosives and weapons. A dawn-to-dusk curfew had just been lifted as the latest violence erupted.</p> <p>\"It's getting scary,\" said a Mubi resident whose home overlooks a student union house. \"These days the student unionists come with guns to protect themselves and they loan them to local thieves.\"</p> <p>\"People are fleeing to neighbouring villages. Some are going by foot; anything to escape,\" the resident added.</p> <p>While student union elections often trigger violence, large-scale attacks are rare. \"It is unheard of to have violence reaching these kind of disturbing levels. It's really hard to even secure a university place in Nigeria, so most times students wouldn't make this kind of trouble,\" a former union member said. \"Most times it's people using mercenaries under the guise of unionism,\" he added.</p> <p>Sixteen students who were arrested in Mubi in September were released after two days of questioning, an official said. Across West Africa, student union leaders often wield enormous power in campuses amid strong links to local and national politicians. Campuses in neighbouring Ivory Coast shut down for months earlier this year in an attempt to wipe out heavily-armed union members whose feuds frequently led to deaths. Attacks from Boko Haram have subsided in recent months after military crackdowns. But the group released a video Monday in which fugitive leader, Abubakar Shekau, threatened to attack the wives of government officials in retaliation for the Nigerian government allegedly mistreating the wives of 10 sect members being detained with sect members.</p>",

The work itself is about sex and politics. It deals with the absorption of a kingdom into an empire, depicted as a game of erotic manipulation on the part of their respective rulers. Keegan-Dolan's treatment of the underlying issues is fitful and, at times, awkwardly symbolist.</p> <p>The plywood set suggests a desert landscape. At the start, the performers are all dressed in similar white suits or frocks, and are only differentiated as Romans or Egyptians by donning grey or black costumes later on.

There's no indication of who rules what or whom. There is, however, a lot of stylised gore as buckets of blood are thrown about, a crocodile \u2013 the Renaissance emblem of deceit \u2013 is disembowelled, and a dead giraffe has its tongue ripped out.</p> <p>Keegan-Dolan seems less interested in the relationship between Zazzo and <a href=\"http://www.annachristy.com/Home.html\" title=\"\">Anna Christy</a>'s petulant Cleopatra than in the sparring between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D3S3IH-nQk\" title=\"\">Patricia Bardon</a>'s traumatised Cornelia and <a href=\"http://www.opus3artists.com/artists/andrew-craig-brown\" title=\"\">Andrew Craig Brown</a>'s brutally handsome Achilla. Sesto (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kqjOQVOew8\" title=\"\">Daniela Mack</a>) is contentiously played as a woman rather than a man, though the transformation from victim to assassin is finely observed. The dances, meanwhile, with their mix of curtseys, bows and pastoral, effortlessly elide baroque with contemporary dance, but seem extraneous to the action rather than integral to it.</p> <p>Musically, things are less precarious. Vocally as well as dramatically, Mack, Craig Brown and the sensational Bardon give the finest performances, along with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9d9GnDvuCY\" title=\"\">Tim Mead</a> as a truly creepy Ptolemy.

  "<p>A quick flick through polls of the top 100 books for children will tell you that animal characters remain some of the most popular and enduring in children's fiction. As a comedy writer, my personal favourites are the irrepressible Toad of Toad Hall, the accident-prone Paddington Bear, Humphrey the problem-solving hamster, and Charlotte, the brainy spider. My main animal character is a cat-burglar called Atticus who has a change of heart when he falls in by chance with the local police inspector's family. </p> <p>Animal characters demonstrate the full range of human characteristics. They might be kind, brave, greedy, cruel, selfish, ambitious, shy, confident, lazy, clever, hardworking, independent, fearful, resourceful or just plain silly. They may have particular attributes, like being able to talk! Just like humans, they will undoubtedly have to overcome obstacles in the course of the story. And they will probably learn a lesson or two along the way.</p> <p>So how do you persuade your reader that it's perfectly acceptable for a bear to stop for a chat, normal for a toad to be hauled up before a judge, par for the course for a hamster to secretly sort out classroom crises, or a spider to write messages in its web (or for that matter for an increasingly cuddly cat to help humans catch a gang of magpies thieves), without resorting to that overused resource, \"magic\"? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571284498\">Buy Atticus Claw Breaks the Law at the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <p><strong>1. Keep it real. Well, almost</strong></p> <p>What are the animal's perceived characteristics and reputation? This is a good starting point and can take you in all sorts of interesting directions. Is the animal really like that? If so, does it change? Set up conflicts for the animal to resolve. For example, what would make a cat compromise its independence \u2013 a chance of a permanent home maybe? Or you might prefer a reversal: a cat that isn't lazy but a workaholic, one that isn't a carnivore but a vegetarian. Play with stereotypes. A third alternative is to exaggerate the animal's known characteristics: the vicious feline with razor sharp claws that rips rats for a crunchy brunch. </p> <p><strong>2. Inhabit their world</strong></p> <p>Your animal character might be doing something amazing like saving the world from evil geniuses or something terrible such as plotting the downfall of humans; they might just be heading out for a picnic on the beach with the family, but at all times he or she has to be both credible and appealing to the reader. What makes them tick? What do things look like from their point of view? What are their perceptions of their surroundings, of other animals, and in particular, of humans? Get into their heads and look at the world through their eyes. Try writing a few scenes to test their voice. There's lots of comedy potential to be had in their different take on life. Atticus, for example, although he wants to go straight, will practically sell his soul for sardines. Ultimately, although they have human traits, the fact that animals come at things from a different angle is what appeals about them to readers of all ages. </p> <p><strong>3. Throw in some surprises</strong></p> <p>Challenge your character with some unexpected events or the arrival of an unwelcome visitor and see how he or she reacts. What characteristics do they display? Try giving them some unusual personality traits that you might not associate with a particular animal and see if it suits them. A marmalade-eating bear is utterly memorable. </p> <p><strong>4. Be clear how your character relates to humans</strong></p> <p>Their interface with the human world is probably the most difficult aspect of your animal character to get hold of. How do they do things? Do they communicate and, if so, how? Personally, I don't have any problem with talking animals, but it can be hard to convince. The more common formulation is that animals can talk to one another and understand humans, but humans aren't blessed with the same insight. Children are way more tuned in to the idea of animals as sentient beings than grown ups are, so letting your readers in on the secret when some of the (adult) human characters in the story don't get it is heaps of fun. Meanwhile your human characters reveal themselves by how they respond to the animal. Remember, they too can change!</p> <p><strong>5. Don't explain anything!</strong></p> <p>Whether you choose to let your animal talk to humans, like Toad and Paddington, or communicate in more subtle ways, like Humphrey, Charlotte and Atticus, you need to be clear, confident and consistent in your approach. Don't pause to explain. If it's well written, and your animal character oozes charisma, we'll buy it.</p> <p><em>Jennifer Gray is the author of Atticus Claw Breaks the Law, the story of the world's greatest cat burglar.

  "<p>Georgia is on the edge of a new, uncertain political era after president Mikhail Saakashvili conceded defeat in parliamentary elections, and said the opposition billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili would form a new government.</p> <p>In a TV address on Tuesday Saakashvili said his ruling United National Movement (UNM) had lost to Ivanishvili's Georgian Dream coalition. He urged Georgians to respect the result. \"We believe that their views are extremely wrong. But democracy works in a way that Georgian people make decisions by majority,\" he said.</p> <p>The election marks an extraordinary moment in Georgia's post-Soviet history, with power transferred for the first time democratically and thus-far peacefully between rival political forces.</p> <p>It is also a blow to the mercurial Saakashvili, who led the country's pro-western rose revolution in 2003. He has been an outsize, polarising figure ever since, at home and abroad.</p> <p>The man who defeated him is a 56-year-old billionaire with a stupendous private fortune, a large modern art collection and a zoo including penguins and a zebra. Ivanishvili entered politics just a year ago, turning a disunited opposition into a formidable electoral coalition. His democratic credentials are unproven.</p> <p>In a press conference on Tuesday Ivanishvili said Saakashvili should now resign. This is unlikely. Instead, Georgia is entering a potentially volatile political period. The new parliament is set to nominate Ivanishvili as prime minister. Saakashvili has to approve the nomination and could, theoretically, reject it, triggering a constitutional crisis.</p> <p>But Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a senior presidential adviser, said on Tuesday that Saakashvili would not seek to thwart Ivanishvili.</p> <p>\"Saakashvili is very disappointed [with the result]. But one thing he is certain about is that leaders don't cheat in elections, and don't govern against the popular will,\" he told the Guardian, adding that the \"political dynamics\" were with the opposition.</p> <p>The big political question is whether Saakashvili and Ivanishvili can co-operate, in the wake of an election campaign characterised by mutual vitriol. The early signs of co-operation were not encouraging. Ivanishvili called Saakashvili's widely praised reforms a joke, and said his rule was \"based on lies\". Government sources dismiss Ivanishvili as a Russian stooge.</p> <p>Under Georgia's constitution the president will carry on until the end of his term next October. After that Georgia shifts from a presidential to a parliamentary system. Over the next 12 months Saakashvili and Ivanishvilithe two men will have to work closely together, and consult on foreign policy and the budget.</p> <p>Ghia Nodia, a former education minister who now runs a Tbilisi thinktank, said: \"You have Saakashvili's emotionality and Ivanishvili's bizarre character. But it's in both their interests to co-operate.</p> <p>\"If Ivanishvili accepts this power-sharing arrangement, he will see it as a transitory stage towards acquiring full power,\" he said.</p> <p>Nodia said the president deserved credit for allowing the democratic process to take its course: \"Whatever happens next, Saakashvili has vindicated himself to an extent. He is not a perfect democrat. But he is more democrat than autocrat. In autocracies, oppositions can't win elections.\"Some feared Ivanishvili might be tempted to emulate Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovych and mete out judicial punishment to his defeated political enemies. \"The deep divisions in the country are slightly threatening. I sense vengeance, not just among people in the street but among [Georgian Dream] politicians who will be in the new parliament,\" Nodia said. Ivanishvili, however, said that government officials would not be prosecuted unless they had broken the law.</p> <p>Another unanswered question is Ivanishvili's policy towards Russia. The tycoon's international priorities are similar to Saakashvili's, and include European integration and Nato. But he has also pledged to improve relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Ivanishvili said he would try to convince Russia that Georgia's strategic aspirations were not a threat.</p> <p>Russia welcomed the result, saying ties that had been frozen in the wake of the 2008 Russian-Georgia war could be renewed.</p> <p>\"We are definitely looking forward for a fresh, new non-hostile, sober leadership in Georgia,\" said Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman.</p> <p>A new leadership would be \"very good, very positive for us\", he continued. \"If they have more political wisdom under a new leadership, then lots and lots of new roads can be opened for the country.\" Russia cut ties with Georgia in the wake of the 2008 war over South Ossetia.</p> <p>Putin and Dmitry Medvedev, the current prime minister who was president at the time of the war, have refused to speak to Saakashvili. Ivanishvili has raised the prospect that some of Georgia's key exports \u2013 such as wine and mineral water \u2013 banned by Moscow in 2006 could now resume.</p> <p>Relations are expected to improve under Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s. Peskov said the Kremlin had had no contact with Ivanishvili in the run-up to the vote. \"We don't know him,\" he said. \"We'll continue to watch very closely the preliminary results in Georgia, where the people are not in favour of the acting authorities so they should be changed.\"</p> <p>Georgian government sources, meanwhile, said they had not been expecting to lose Monday's election. Opinion polls had put Saakashvili's party in front.</p> <p>They conceded that a video broadcast on 19 September showing prison officers beating and raping inmates with broom handles had turned public opinion against the authorities. Voters in the Georgian Orthodox church \u2013 unhappy with the government's socially liberal policies \u2013 had also supported the opposition in huge numbers, they said.</p> <p>Official figures have yet to be confirmed but government sources said the coalition would have 84 parliamentary seats and the UNM 66. Ivanishvili's six-party coalition appears to have won about 51% of the popular vote, with 41% for UNM and 9% for other parties.</p> <p>Thousands of Georgian Dream supporters gathered on Monday night, celebrating in the capital Tbilisi and flooding Freedom Square. They included several nuns in black habits, waving blue Ivanishvili flags.</p> <p>\"The reality is that the majority of people in this country support Ivanishvili,\" Tarel Peradze, an engineer, said. He added: \"The problem is that Saakashvili didn't do dialogue. He only did monologue.\"</p>",

  "<p>On Friday 21st September we had our first visit to the newly-opened <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/announcing-facebook-engineering-in-london/10150973192418920\">London Facebook Office</a> for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/londonhack2012\">London Hack 2012</a>. Facebook has a strong culture of 'hacking' and once a month, employees are given 24 hours to spend developing a new app. Successful ideas, which were prototyped at a hack day, include the Like button and Timeline. </p> <p>The theme of the day was 'distribution' via the <a href=\"http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/\">Open Graph API</a>. By positing user 'actions' (such as read, share, like, ate etc) to the Open Graph (OG), this information can be shared across the Facebook platform via the newsfeed and posting to users' friends. As usage of the app increases, the graph can also be used to build intelligence about a users' personal preferences and recent activities, enabling Facebook to provide a more personalised user experience. Used effectively, this can develop a powerful two-way loop between the user and the app.</p> <p>To fully explore how Open Graph can be used, we were given presentations from other services including <a href=\"http://www.deezer.com/en/\">Deezer</a>, a music streaming service, <a href=\"http://pusher.com/\">Pusher</a>, a notifications service for real-time application features, and <a href=\"http://www.twilio.com/\">Twilio</a>, an API for sending and receiving text messages and voicemails. </p> <p>Twilio demonstrated just how easy it is to use their API with a live demonstration. After <a href=\"http://sydlawrence.com/\">Syd Lawrence</a>, developer evangelist at Twilio, jotted down a couple of lines of code, the audience were invited to text in a phone number. Within a few seconds there were a stream of these messages printed out to the terminal. Moments later we were all called back and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\">Rickrolled</a>. With tools explained, we were ready to hack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397026922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/1/1349089286925/403355_10152111777145582_255416373_n.jpg\" alt=\"The new offices before the day began: all set to hack.\" width=\"460\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new offices before the day began: all set to hack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What we did strayed a little from the given themes, moving more in the direction of correlating Facebook and the Guardian's information. Currently we use Guardian Discussion (our commenting platform) on guardian.co.uk and Facebook Comments for any debate on <a href=\"https://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">our Facebook Canvas app</a>. Instead of working with these existing apps, though, we decided to play with Twilio \u2013 the text and voice messaging service with a sleek and simple API to plug into your web and mobile apps \u2013 to see how we could use it to offer new ways for users to interact with the news.</p> <p>Signing up and getting our phones synced was all there was to it. We connected our newly-created aggregated comment system to their API, and there we had it. Voicemail and text message comments.</p> <p>While this in itself didn't seem obviously useful, it did surface the challenge of serving news, and any content surrounding it (i.e. comments), to people who aren't able to be \u2013 or choose not to be \u2013 connected to the internet 24/7.</p> <p>This could be useful for both the creation or consumption of news: posting to a liveblog from an area that has little or no data coverage; getting a text from someone who has mentioned a new shop opening just down the road. For simple messages and notifications, Twilio is brilliant due to its immediacy of receipt and straightforward implementation.

  "<p>With the arrival of the NHS commissioning board, the biggest quango ever created, with direct control of \u00a325bn, the health service has entered the age of Davids. While much has been made about how tightly Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, will embrace the private sector, real power is now in the hands of three mandarins: David Behan at the Care Quality Commission (CQC); David Bennett at Monitor and Sir David Nicholson at the board.</p> <p>Of these, Nicholson, with an impeccable NHS pedigree, is the most important. He is not, in the parlance of former health secretary Andrew Lansley, one of nature's \"liberators\". By reputation, he remains an arch-centraliser, preferring to run things from the impregnable heights of power. As the commissioning board will oversee GPs \u2013 and the \u00a360bn they will spend \u2013 the future will be a trial of strength between a giant board and thousands of family doctors across England.</p> <p>Lansley's gamble was that the 8,000 GP practices would prove impossible to police with the zeal of a political commissar. However, so far, Nicholson has proved able to impose his view on the service \u2013 for example, ensuring private companies don't do any of the commissioning for GPs. He will also pop up if a clinical commissioning group goes bankrupt \u2013 to ensure failing partners will be made accountable. The Treasury, it is said, was particularly keen to have someone at the board with a firm hand on the tiller.</p> <p>All this is important because GP commissioning is the one policy Labour's health spokesman, Andy Burnham, and the coalition can agree on \u2013 with the role of the CQC and hence of Behan clouded by the <a href=\"http://www.midstaffsinquiry.com/pressrelease.html\" title=\"\">Francis report</a> into the Mid Staffs debacle. Labour's health policy has come under close scrutiny this week. Much has been made of the apparent confusion between the call from Burnham to \"repeal the Health and Social Care Act\" and Labour leader Ed Miliband's claim not to \"reverse it all back\". In fact, Miliband and Burnham are on the same page, although reading from different parts of it. What Miliband appears to be against is turning the NHS into a regulated industry, operating under rules set by Monitor \u2013 the new economic regulator.</p> <p>The coalition thinks the NHS should become more like the telecoms or gas industry. Lansley, a former civil servant who piloted privatisations in the 1980s, knows the arguments well. He's been <a href=\"http://www.andrewlansley.co.uk/newsevent.php?newseventid=21\" title=\"\">making them</a> since 2005.</p> <p>Labour's policy is bad news for Bennett, the Monitor chairman, who had been a senior partner at McKinsey and head of the Downing Street strategy unit under Tony Blair. Bennett nailed his colours to the mast in early 2011 when he said: \"We did it in gas, we did it in power, we did it in telecoms \u2026 We've done it in rail, we've done it in water. So there is actually 20 years' experience of taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation.\"</p> <p>This doesn't sit easily with Burnham's \"one budget, one system\" mantra for Labour's NHS. The creed of competition and choice, which fell so easily from the lips of New Labour, is a policy that cannot speak its name in the present party.</p> <p>Bennett's view of the NHS, like that of his fellow former Downing Street health adviser Paul Corrigan, who last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/private-sector-failing-hospitals\" title=\"\">said</a> up to 30 hospitals could be run by private firms, is not where Labour's politics are going. This appears smart politics \u2013 winning Miliband votes inside and outside the party. The polls put Labour 30 points up on the NHS issue. Like his new policy guru, Harvard teacher Michael Sandel, the Labour leader thinks healthcare profits \"<a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/if-i-ruled-the-world-michael-sandel/\" title=\"\">might degrade the goods at stake</a>\". Whether it's smart policy, only time will tell.</p> <p><em> </em></p>",

But increased demand \u2013 especially in London, where around 30,000 students are waiting to collect a police registration certificate (PRC) \u2013 has left officials unable to cope.</p> <p>Mariella Nihabi, 18 from Brazil, has missed the first few days of her course at London College of Fashion because of the delays. \"I cannot attend class before I have registered but this is the third time I have tried queuing, today I have been here since 6am. There are people who got here earlier.</p> <p>\"It's horrible \u2013 we have to wait here for hours and pay for the travel each time. If they want us to register, they could at least ask us to do it at a police station nearer to where we live.\"</p> <p>London Met's <a href=\"http://content.met.police.uk/Site/overseasvisitorsrecordsoffice\" title=\"\">overseas visitor records office website</a> blames the delays on the large number of international students registering at the start of the academic year. It asks people not to form queues the night before: \"Our queues are currently starting at 12.00am. In the interest of health and safety we would kindly request that you do not start queueing at this time as it forces us to close our queues as early as 06.30am.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"We operate on a first come, first served basis so it's advisable to attend early in the morning.\"</p> <p>Daniel Stevens, NUS international students officer, says it is unclear why is is necessary for students to visit police offices when their information is already held by the UK Border Agency.</p> <p>\"There are numerous other ways to avoid the distress being faced by these students including increasing staff numbers, adjusting the amount of time given to students to register, or creating a ticketing system so that students have defined times to register.</p> <p>\"It is absolutely unacceptable that students be asked to be queue for hours, often in terrible weather, and be expected to arrive before 6.30am to have any chance of being seen.\"</p> <p>The problems come only weeks after universities minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/13/willetts-uk-reputation-foreign-student-visas\" title=\"\">David Willetts launched a global drive to bolster British universities' reputation abroad</a> following the removal of London Metropolitan University's right to sponsor overseas students. The higher education business in international students is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>But a law student from the London School of Economics who has spent the past four days trying to join the queue says British inefficiencies are putting overseas students off. \"Obviously this will damage British universities' reputation.

  "<p>About 600m new jobs will be needed worldwide in the next 15 years to absorb a burgeoning workforce, mainly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, according to a World Bank report.</p> <p>The private sector will be the engine for job creation, accounting for 90% of jobs in the developing world, but governments have a vital role to play by ensuring the right conditions are in place. The <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?contentMDK=23044836&amp;theSitePK=8258025&amp;piPK=8258412&amp;pagePK=8258258\" title=\"\">2013 World Development Report</a> recommends a three-stage approach by governments, urging them to: put in place policy fundamentals that include macroeconomic stability, a business-friendly environment, investments in human capital and the rule of law; design labour policies to ensure growth translates into employment opportunities; and identify the jobs that do most for development, removing the obstacles that prevent the private sector from creating those jobs.</p> <p>\"The jobs with the greatest development payoffs are those that make cities function better, connect the economy to global markets, protect the environment, foster trust and civic engagement, or reduce poverty,\" said Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank. \"Critically, these jobs are not only found in the formal sector \u2013 depending on the country context, informal jobs can also be transformational.\"</p> <p>The report comes against a grim backdrop. The world economy is still stuttering from the 2008 financial shock that triggered the biggest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. About 200 million people \u2013 including 75 million under the age of 25 \u2013 are unemployed.</p> <p>Many millions more, most of them women, are shut out of the labour force altogether. Growth in total employment, hovering around 1.8% a year before 2008, fell to less than 0.5% in 2009, and by 2011 had not yet reached its pre-crisis level. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/28/europe-riots-root-imf-austerity\" title=\"\">Thousands of people last week took to the streets in Greece, Spain and France</a> to protest against austerity policies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, almost half of all workers in developing countries are in small-scale farming or self-employed jobs that typically do not provide a steady income and benefits. The problem for these workers is not the lack of a job \u2013 many hold more than one job but have trouble making ends meet because they do not earn enough.</p> <p>Worldwide, more than 3 billion people are working, but jobs vary greatly. About 1.65 billion are employed and receive regular wages or salaries. Another 1.5 billion work in farming and small household enterprises, or in casual or seasonal labour. Almost 2 billion working-age adults, mostly women, are neither working nor looking for work, but an unknown number are eager to work, says the report.</p> <p>It notes the importance of the private sector \u2013 the source of nine out of 10 jobs in the world \u2013 in creating jobs. China provides the most dramatic example of private sector employment. In 1981, the sector accounted for 2.3 million workers, while state-owned firms employed 80 million. Twenty years later, the private sector had 74.7 million workers.</p> <p>The creation of jobs \u2013 mostly in Asia, but also in other parts of the developing world \u2013 has been the driving force in reducing poverty. The report says the share of the developing world's population living on less than $1.25 a day (in purchasing parity) fell from 52% in 1981 to 22% in 2008.</p> <p>The report says policymakers should set priorities by considering: what jobs are good for development (which will depend on a country's phase of development, demography, endowments and institutions); whether there are enough of these jobs; the constraints in creating more of these jobs; and whether those constraints can be removed or offset.</p> <p>Vietnam is cited as an example where policies were successfully pursued to bring about a development payoff from jobs. In the 1990s, Vietnam concentrated on increasing productivity in agriculture, freeing labour to work in rural off-farm employment, and eventually supporting migration to cities. A strong emphasis on agricultural technical advice, land reform and deregulation led to rapidly growing agricultural productivity on very small plots. The results were dramatic.</p> <p>In 1993, 70% of jobs were in agriculture, 58% of the population lived in poverty, and famine was a real concern. Two decades later, Vietnam is the second-largest exporter of rice and coffee, the largest exporter of black pepper and cashew nuts, and a big exporter of tea, rubber and seafood products, while poverty has plummeted.</p> <p>In another success story, Rwanda supported the reintegration and demobilisation of more than 54,000 former combatants after genocide. While former fighters were only a small share of the country's population of 10 million, their reintegration had payoffs for social cohesion. Rwanda built on this by rejuvenating the private sector through reforms of institutions and business regulations. Growth reached an estimated 8.8% in 2011 and the poverty rate dropped by 12 percentage points between 2005 and 2010.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of peasant farmers from across India will set out on Wednesday on a 200-mile march on Delhi in one of the biggest such protests seen in the country for years.</p> <p>Organisers of the demonstration aim to highlight problems for India's landless, for hundreds of millions of poor farmers and for so-called tribal communities who often live in resource-rich areas where lucrative mining operations are causing massive environmental damage.</p> <p>\"Millions of people are living in slums, on railway tracks, under plastic sheets \u2026 They should have a piece of land to call their own. Others have to make way for factories, roads, airports, mines. I do not accept industrialisation at this cost,\" said PV Rajagopal, the veteran activist who leads the Ekhta Parishad organisation behind the march.</p> <p>Rajagopal and his followers say they are inspired by the example set by Mahatma Gandhi and his ideal of a nation of self-sufficient villages. One aim of the march is to mobilise the hundreds of millions who have not benefited from India's 20-year economic boom. Today is the anniversary of Gandhi's birthday and a national holiday.</p> <p>However, Gandhi's \"vision is being rejected every day in this country\", according to Rajagopal, who made his name by persuading bandits in central India to \"lay down their arms\" in the 1970s.</p> <p>The march is an embarrassment for the beleaguered Indian government, a fragile coalition led by the Congress party.</p> <p>Rural voters have traditionally voted for Congress and their support will be crucial in elections due in 2014. In recent years, the poor have increasingly turned to other, often local, parties.</p> <p>Jairam Ramesh, the minister for rural development, travelled to Gwalior, the northern India town from which the march will start, to try to convince the marchers to abandon their plan to walk to Delhi.</p> <p>At a public meeting on Tuesday, he listed measures which he said the government had taken to help India's rural poor and invited Rajagopal to a meeting in Delhi in nine days.</p> <p>But organisers refused to abandon the march, saying it would go ahead as planned. In 2007 a similar march resulted in a series of measures which helped, they said, but did not go far enough or were not fully implemented.</p> <p>Legislation is pending to simplify India's complex and archaic mechanisms for compensating those forced to quit land to make way for the major projects on which the country's continued economic growth partly depends. However it is unlikely to be passed in the near future, if at all.</p> <p>Growth in India has slowed rapidly in recent years, prompting new efforts aimed at boosting foreign investment and reducing the country's ballooning financial deficit. Huge amounts are currently spent on inefficient subsidies to the very poor.</p> <p>The marchers, who organisers say number 50,000 \u2013 though there appeared to be fewer \u2013 come from all over India.</p> <p>Ramtha Yadav, 26, had travelled for two days to Gwalior with nearly 500 other landless labourers from Uttar Pradesh, where many social and economic indicators are worse than in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>\"We need to march because we cannot trust the government, whatever the minister says. He talks about new laws but how will they actually be enforced on the ground?\" Yadav said. \"We have no land even for a shelter, without even thinking about farming. When it rains we live under trees.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's not difficult to pinpoint where it started to go wrong for Zenit. Last season they won the league by 13 points, lifting the title for the second time in succession. Although they were beaten in the Super Cup by Rubin, they began this season with four straight wins, despite a fixture list that looked testing: there was a 3-1 triumph at CSKA and then a 5-0 demolition of Spartak. At that stage, it looked as though Zenit might cruise to a hat-trick of Russian titles.</p> <p>And then, quite abruptly, it all went horribly wrong, which is why Zenit go into Wednesday's Champions League game against an almost equally out of sorts Milan having won only one of their last five league games and taken a 3-0 beating from M\u00e1laga in their first Champions League game.</p> <p>At first the slump in form seemed to be a dip caused by two tough fixtures in a row \u2014 the good news for Zenit is that from now until mid-November, they have as simple a run of fixtures as the Russian league is ever likely to throw up. They drew at Anzhi, who now top the table, then lost at home to Rubin. They beat struggling Mordovia and then they bought Hulk and Axel Witsel for a combined fee of \u20ac83m. After years of financial caution, this seemed like the moment when Zenit stepped up a level, when they might begin really to challenge the western European elite. The signings added quality and depth to the squad but, more than that, they were a statement of what Russian clubs could do.</p> <p>What nobody seemed to have taken into account was how the Zenit dressing-room might react to newcomers, particularly massively hyped newcomers earning a reported three times more than even the best paid of the existing squad. \"I'm not against foreign players but there must be a balance in the team,\" the captain, Igor Denisov, said. \"Yes, the club has bought good players but do you think they are so much better than us that they should make three times as much?</p> <p>\"Zenit already have great players who have won as many titles as the new guys. I would understand if we got Messi or Iniesta. They would deserve any price. The principles of how the club is run are the most important as well as the respect of the Russian players, especially us \u2013 the St Petersburg natives who have always made up the core of a team like Zenit.\"</p> <p>Denisov's complaints led to him being relegated to train with the youth team. \"This measure is related to the fact that Denisov made an ultimatum to the club and refused to take the pitch against Krylya Sovetov, demanding that his personal contract be reviewed,\" said a statement on the club website. \"FC Zenit believes that by breaking his agreement with the club, Denisov is behaving unprofessionally, thereby discrediting himself as a player of FC Zenit and the Russian national team, and causing serious harm to his reputation.\" Fabio Capello called him up to the national squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers regardless.</p> <p>The forward Alexander Kerzhakov also was expelled from the first-team squad \"for improper behaviour\" but was admitted back to the first-team squad after talks with the coach, Luciano Spalletti. It's understood that he has been treated more leniently because he did not demand a pay increase.</p> <p>\"As for Kerzhakov, he very clearly demonstrated that in these troubled times, he only wants to think about himself,\" Spalletti said. \"We do not want to take along those who only think of themselves and do not want to move forward together with us.\"</p> <p>Morale is clearly shot. With the exception of Vyacheslav Malafeev, after the crisis emerged, none of the Russian players in the squad had spoken to the media until Monday, skipping the mandatory post-match mixed zones. Speaking to Sport-Express, the midfielder Victor Fayzulin insisted that \"none of the players have lost interest in winning, none are not training to fully capacity and none are taking it easy\", when asked if the problem had become psychological. He then, slightly oddly, went on to answer a question that hadn't been asked: \"This is definitely not the result of malice.\" There is clearly something seriously wrong when a player, unprompted, feels he has to deny his team-mates are losing games deliberately.</p> <p>Spalletti himself has been criticised for his handling of the situation. \"There has been a loss of control over the team \u2013 and a loss of mutual understanding within team sports creates a difficult moral atmosphere,\" the local Communist party said in an open letter to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. \"A series of very painful lesions has been replaced by open squabble between the leading players in the team to see who of them will get any more money. In this conflict, the public cannot decide who is right or wrong\u2014all are equally ugly, selfish and greedy.\" The party seems to blame Spalletti for this, suggesting he should be replaced by \"a stern coach from North Korea, where sport is part of the daily struggle for the independence and dignity of the country\".</p> <p>That prompted Putin to respond in an odd statement in which he seemed to be deflecting blame from the government and on to Gazprom, the sponsor whose largesse funded the signings \u2013 the tone perhaps conditioned by revelations that Zenit had claimed money from a state social insurance fund to pay players who had suffered injuries (something that may be legal but is clearly unpopular with the public).</p> <p>\"I also complain sometimes,\" he said. \"I would like to note that it's the companies that buy the players and not the government. But fans also want to see world stars, not those who are on the wane but those who are at their peak.\"</p> <p>Yet at least some Zenit fans clearly don't want to see Hulk: a hoax bomb with a photograph of him taped to it was left in a bag at their training ground last week. Hulk himself has insisted that he is perfectly happy at the club. \"I think with time I will adapt,\" he told R-Sport, \"but it is clear that the fact that they speak another language in Russia creates some difficulties. Still, I feel that the climate within the team is fantastic. I'm happy to play for Zenit, I have absolute support from everyone here. I'm trying to fit into the team and Zenit generally. I have no problems with anyone. I'm just trying to do my job the best way that I can. I'm very happy with my role in the team, which is to score goals.\"</p> <p>So far he has managed one in a league game, in the 2-2 draw against Krylya Sovetov. Zenit's winless run was extended on Saturday as they could only draw 1-1 against Lokomotiv in a game ruined by a baffling red card for Loko's Roman Shishkin after 31 minutes, sent off for a second yellow after a foul on Hulk committed by Vedran Corluka. They now lie sixth, five points behind the leaders Anzhi with a third of the season gone.</p> <p>A month ago, they seemed a side ready to scale new heights; now, they're desperately scrabbling to get back to where they were before they spent \u20ac80m. Both they and Milan will look at out of form opponents with some hope. \"Spalletti has called this the match of the year,\" said Fayzulin. \"If we win the mood and atmosphere in the team will improve and it will be a psychological turning point.\"</p>",
  "<p>Managing relationships with various public groups, from customers to media, bloggers, non-governmental organisations and many others, is becoming increasingly important in the digital age.</p> <p>A good PR consultancy can add value, bring expertise and give advice on how best to shape your communications strategy. But, for those small businesses that have never worked with a public relations agency before, or those that do but don't feel that they're getting added value, how exactly do you make sure that you are working effectively with your chosen partner?</p> <h2><strong>Define your objectives</strong></h2> <p>When you are working with an agency, you need to sit down and decide what success will look like. It's probably going to be a mix of outputs and outcomes, and, although the former are easier to measure, targets should be agreed which address both. A reporting and measurement system should also be implemented that shows whether these targets have been met.</p> <h2><strong>Check your budget</strong></h2> <p>It is important to have a budget in mind. How much can you afford to spend on public relations, and what results do you want to see? If you don't have a clear idea of your budget and expectations, it will be difficult for your agency to work effectively.</p> <p>If you have an agency on retainer, you should sit down at the end of each year to review the past 12 months and plan for the year ahead. At this stage you should also update your budget. This may mean a fee increase to ramp up activity, or simply restructuring the existing budget to focus on different targets or a new campaign.</p> <h2><strong>Understanding your business</strong></h2> <p>Arguably, the most valuable skill to look for in an agency is the ability to understand your business and provide objective and creative ideas on how to make you more successful. If your agency doesn't understand your company then you won't end up with a strategy that works for you.</p> <p>For instance, your partner agency should truly understand your competitive advantage, as well as the challenges and opportunities within your industry. The agency should then use that knowledge to work alongside you and define the primary aims of the campaign \u2013 whether raising awareness, gaining market share or creating new business leads \u2013 the key audiences you would aim to reach and the messaging that would be used to do so.</p> <p>Finally, in the digital age, PR must be aligned with other marketing activity. To get the most out of an agency it is important to ensure that they have done their research and are well integrated with the rest of your business.</p> <h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2> <p>Make sure you examine your public relations agency's methodology. Are they data driven? Do they have media training capability? Are they ensuring that their recommendations are based upon analytical insights, backed by extensive knowledge of trends, issues and facts? When you are working with an agency you will get more added value if you take advantage of all their skills.</p> <h2><strong>Deciding on your message is crucial</strong></h2> <p>Make sure that at least once a year you sit down with your agency and do a messaging session. This is crucial as the messages that you decide on will underpin all of your communications activity. If you don't have proper messages in place, there will be no clear strategy and you will end up with inconsistent coverage that doesn't re-enforce your business values.</p> <h2><strong>Making sure you get the right team</strong></h2> <p>Make sure that you are utilising the skills of your agency for maximum impact. For instance, ensure that creative team members are involved if you are coming up with campaign ideas, but also clearly define who is responsible for what. The most effective account teams often have complementary skills. Chemistry is also important as you need to get on well with the people you're working with.</p> <h2><strong>Build up trust in the relationship</strong></h2> <p>You should encourage your agency to push and advise you \u2013 they are experts in their field and have the knowledge to guide you as to where the opportunities lie. You should work together sharing content and ideas to make sure that the team has everything it needs to do its job properly. Particularly, make sure your agency has full and proper access to spokespeople and experts, so it can get the relevant materials to create compelling pitches.</p> <p>Try to find a system to ensure that any content or data that is generated within your business can be shared and used.</p> <p>Using a public relations agency can bring a myriad of benefits including expertise, industry analysis, media contacts, and social media and crisis management skills, but to get the most out of the relationship, you need to ensure you work together towards achievable aims. Only then will your agency truly provide added value rather than incurring extra expense.</p> <p><em>Jonathan Jordan is a senior partner and founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.sermelo.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Sermelo</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>There is something magical about the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. For me, autumn represents a period of change when nature girds its loins for the long and slow descent into winter.</p> <p>Just occasionally we're graced with an Indian summer. The extra boost of warmth on our faces this late sun provides give us that last opportunity to secure a dose of vitamin D, but it is with a sense of foreboding that we watch as the trees begin to cast long shadows. These shady places are of course in stark contrast to the \"golden light\" created from the sun's position as it steadily becomes pulled ever closer to the horizon, making this a great season for beautifully lit and atmospheric photography.</p> <p>The season has, almost by default, become defined by its most powerful images: that of leaves changing colour. Whether it be the buttery yellows of birches, the vivid reds of sycamores or the burning gold of beech trees, autumn colour is an ephemeral spectacle that is not just confined to a few choice nature reserves, but a treat that can be seen just about anywhere.</p> <p>When certain environmental factors combine to make the annual event a year of exceptional quality, the sheer intensity of colours can combine to make the observer feel giddy or light-headed. In this digital age, many sightseers now often seem obsessed with attempting to capture this spectacle for time immemorial. For me it's an infinitely far more enjoyable experience when the image is burnt onto your retina rather than on a memory stick. In fact this is simply a spectacle that demands you to stop, stare and admire.</p> <p>Seasonal mellowness aside, an autumnal storm is more than capable of creating an equally memorable experience. With gun-metal skies, the accompanying wind and rain can often combine forces to bring the colourful display to an abrupt end as the now-tinted leaves begin to be mercilessly ripped from their moorings. But these lashings never last for too long and the period of freshness which invariably follows a downpour has to be one of the best times for a nature ramble.</p> <p>As the leaves fall and the trees prepare for winter, the woodland creatures are also busily making preparations for the lean times ahead. While some mammals are winding down, the much loved red squirrel is more frenetic than ever, as it gorges on fruit and stockpiles nuts like its life depends on it \u2013 which it will. Once relatively common, our only native squirrel has declined dramatically over the past 50 years \u2013 in England they are now restricted to just a few locations.</p> <p>Fortunately a trip to one of its strongholds, such as Brownsea Island in Dorset, or Formby on the Lancashire coast, will rarely disappoint. But be warned, you'll need to be either quick off the mark, or very still to capture them on camera. Having just acquired their thick winter coats, autumn is also undoubtedly the time of year when these enchanting ginger rodents look their most dapper.</p> <p>Undoubtedly one of the most dramatic autumnal moments is the majesty and raw power of the red deer rut. Seeing evenly matched stags size each other up before clashing in a titanic battle, whether it be in London's Richmond Park or the Highlands of Scotland, is an experience that you'll never forget. The unfolding drama as the stags compete to be the winner \"that takes all\" is a scene that has played out since primeval times. As ever, patience and a good eye are needed to catch the moment when the two dominant stags decide to dispense with the talk and get on with the action!</p> <p>And what about the kingdom of the fungi? The mild, wet conditions created by autumn represents the perfect time for a huge array of mushrooms and toadstools to cast their introverted nature aside as they finally push their heads above of the soil to distribute their spores. Representing the full gamut of shapes, sizes and colour, fungi are the perfect subjects for honing macrophotographic skills.</p> <p>For my money, the only way to become immersed in all that the natural world has to offer is to get yourself out on a Great British Wildlife Walk \u2013 something that the National Trust is encouraging us all to do this autumn. Irrespective of whether it's a brief stroll around your local park or a whole day spent in the back of beyond, one thing is for sure, your visit will be time well spent.</p> <p>There are no rules to follow when out and about save one: enjoy it. A walk on the wild-side is also an assault on the senses, so don't forget to use them, whether it be listening to the local robin holding its territory for the winter, the musty smell of a neighbourhood fox or a brief glimpse of a deer.</p> <p>The beauty of technology these days means that you can now create wonderful images, whether you have state-of-the-art camera kit or a just a mobile phone. So enjoy the photographic revolution, get yourself outside and capture the essence of autumn \u2013 you won't regret it!</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/guardiangreenshoots/\" title=\"\">Share your photos of wildlife near walks on our Flickr group</a></p> <p>\u2022 Mike Dilger is a naturalist, writer and TV presenter.

  "<p>The coalition agreement promised new approaches to government. But its vision for public services has showcased policies which are all too familiar.</p> <p>In the latest edition of <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/fabian-review-autumn-2012/\" title=\"\">the Fabian Review,</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidwalker?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">David Walker</a> warns that the public sector must beware what he calls \"zombie ideas\". These are ideas that are pitched as new but are, in fact, reheated attempts to push \"choice\" (usually meaning more non-state providers), \"competition\" (again more non-state providers) and \"efficiency\" (often best obtained through more non-state providers).</p> <p>These ideas drive time-consuming and costly reorganisations that often leave staff and service users increasingly frustrated.</p> <p>What happens in practice is reflected in public opinion. When the <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/frustrated-powerless-and-ignored/\" title=\"\">Fabian Society and YouGov</a> asked members of the public what they thought politicians talking about public service reform meant for services in their area the three most common answers were:</p> <p>\u2022 I expect lots of time and money will be spent reorganising.</p> <p>\u2022 I expect services to get worse.</p> <p>\u2022 I expect services to be privatised.</p> <p>The coalition's open public services reform programme is the latest in the long line of attempts to introduce zombie ideas into the public sector. The Fabian Society report, <a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/publications/for-the-public-good/\" title=\"\">For the Public Good</a>, demonstrates that much of the coalition's public services agenda runs against the grain of public opinion.</p> <p>Of more than 2,000 people responding to our survey, 62% believed that public services should be provided mainly or only through government. Only 33% agreed with David Cameron's view that government should no longer be the default provider of services.</p> <p>Our research also shows that people felt deeply suspicious about the role that the private sector plays in delivering public services. Some 64% agreed that \"public services should not be run like businesses but rather depend on the values and ethos of the public good.\"</p> <p>It would seem that the public already knew what it took the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/14/g4s-olympic-effort-private-sector\" title=\"\">G4S Olympic debacle to teach defence secretary Philip Hammond</a>. Commenting after the military had to be brought in to deliver on G4S's Olympic security contract, Hammond noted: \"I came into the MoD with a prejudice that we have to look at the way the private sector does things to know how we should do things in government. But the story of G4S and the&#xa0;military&#xa0;rescue is quite informative.\"</p> <p>What of the other of Walker's zombie ideas: choice? Interestingly, our research shows that while people view choice as a positive thing which can improve services, they almost never equate it with an increased role for non-state providers. Instead, our focus groups showed that people think about choice in terms of greater control over aspects of the service experience such as appointment times.</p> <p>When we asked people what they thought would improve public services, there were four methods which enjoyed positive net approval (ie more people thinking that this would improve services than did not). These were, in order of popularity:</p> <p>\u2022 Groups of people holding a service to account.</p> <p>\u2022 Government ministers requiring national standards.</p> <p>\u2022 People choosing between services.</p> <p>\u2022 Staff having control over services.</p> <p>These results further confirm that appealing to choice alone will not win public support for reform programmes. What is of particular note is that the four options enjoying positive net approval can all be delivered within a public sector framework. The research highlights a public desire for more user voices alongside national standards and perhaps most importantly, staff having greater control over services.</p> <p>This may signal that the next wave of public service reform must take the step of recognising public servants as policy makers in their own right. The essential nature of meeting the diverse needs of service users suggests that such recognition would prove wise.</p> <p>As noted by American political scientist <a href=\"https://www.russellsage.org/publications/street-level-bureaucracy\" title=\"\">Michael Lipsky,</a> public services operate under the tension of a necessary paradox. On the one hand, governments and voters require that all users of public services enjoy the same basic level of standards and are treated equally. On the other, that services users and public servants respond to the intuitive feeling that every case should be treated as an individual with special circumstances.</p> <p>This paradox means that the discretion of public servants will always be an important part of how services are delivered.</p> <p>The coalition's open public services programme simply represents the latest in a series of public service reform agendas that fail to satisfactorily engage with the essential nature of discretion in public service delivery. In the coming months it is crucial that a more nuanced understanding of the pressures faced by staff informs a new public service narrative that swims with the tide of what staff as well as users want and need.</p> <p><em>Natan Doron is senior researcher at the</em><a href=\"http://www.fabians.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em> Fabian Society</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Campaigns such as the <a href=\"http://hfsg.co.uk/\">Hillsborough relatives</a>' and, going further back, the long struggle to <a href=\"http://www.actsa.org/page-1438-AAM.html\">end apartheid</a> in South Africa, are a reminder of how faith and perseverance are so often commitments for the long term.</p> <p>Another example is the stubborn presence of objectors at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/01/menwith-hill-eavesdropping-base-expansion\">RAF Menwith Hill</a>, the communications centre used by the United States' <a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov/\">National Security Agency</a> for all manner of activities across the world.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.caab.org.uk/\">persistence of objectors</a> has been phenomenal, with a demonstration outside the nest of spooky radomes every Tuesday since 2000 except four. It is typical of it that the campaign knows exactly how many \u2013 or few \u2013 Tuesdays have been missed plus the reason in each case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397011913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2011/8/27/1314468920303/Predator-drone-aircraft-002.jpg\" alt=\"Predator drone aircraft\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Predator drone.

The focus will be on the use of drones and its theme, the <a href=\"http://dronecampaignnetwork.wordpress.com/week-of-action-events/\">Faceless Face of US Military Drones</a>, will be illustrated by faceless face masks on many present; yet another imaginative way of keeping <a href=\"http://www.dronewarsuk.com\">the issue in the news</a>.</p> <p>Those gathered at Menwith will be joined by a second demonstration which invokes the spirit of the old northern <a href=\"http://www.clarioncc.org/\">Clarion cycling clubs </a>which united the freedom of spinning across the moors and dales with freethinking politically about a free-er world. One of my favourite snatches of poetry is the dream of the Bolton millworker and Clarion member Allen Clarke who hoped to be buried:</p> <p><em>Where I can see the cyclists halt<br>And hear the yarns they spin<br>And there I will rest and watch and bless<br>The sweet and jolly scene<br>'Til the Master of Cycles bids me rise<br>And mount my new machine.</em></p> <p>In this spirit, <a href=\"http://www.yorkshirecnd.org.uk/\">Yorkshire CND</a> has organised a 100-mile bike ride <a href=\"http://www.cnduk.org/get-involved/events/item/1488-re-cycle-the-bases-in-north-yorkshire\">called Re-cycle the Bases</a> from RAF Fylingdales on the North York Moors to arrive at Menwith on Tuesday after holding meetings en route. They should roll up well in time for the main demonstration between 6pm and 8pm outside the base's main gate. </p> <p>Laila Packer, the joint co-ordinator of the <a href=\"http://www.caab.org.uk/\">Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases</a>, sums up the case against drones, both for the suffering they cause and as an own-goal: </p> <blockquote> <p>Innocent civilians have been and are being killed, injured and traumatised by these deadly, immoral and illegal weapons. The human suffering has caused and is causing untold suffering and igniting hatred against the US and any other government involved. It is making the world a far more dangerous place.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397011914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/2/1349168907047/lpercy.jpg\" alt=\"lindis percy\" width=\"140\" height=\"105\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lindis Percy.

Whatever your views on Menwith Hill, you will surely find the gentle persistence of the protesters remarkable; an example is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/sep/07/privacy.freedomofinformation\">Lindis Percy</a>'s account of the day she went to Harrogate to make a quiet protest as the Olympic Torch came through, because the route was lined in part by staff from the base.</p> <p>She made her point, equipped with her upside-down Stars and Stripes with the legend Independence from America on it, holding a brief debate with an American soldier:</p> <blockquote> <p>Many of us are very concerned with what you are doing round the world and what you do at Menwith Hill.</p> <p>\"But we are bringing freedom to the world \u2013 that's what we do\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Before she was roughly snatched away by four West Yorkshire police officers and held in a side road and then a stifling van. She never protests angrily at such treatment but always uses the complaints system, so the seven officers are subject to an inquiry by an inspector. Then she was released at the town police station, asked a North Yorkshire police sergeant if he could ring for a taxi to get her back to the torch route and he said he was driving into town anyway, and could he give her a lift?</p> <p>In the same spirit, the September newsletter notes that a new USAF commander has taken over at Menwith Hill and adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>We have written to him to welcome him and request a meeting. We have always done this when there is a change of US commander but have yet to receive a response. We very much hope that this one is different.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p><strong>Can you tell us about the Cornerhouse and Library Theatre Company merger and how its new name 'Home' defines its identity?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cornerhouse.org/\" title=\"\">Cornerhouse</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.librarytheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Library Theatre Company</a> have been around in Manchester for 27 and 60 years respectively. They are both much loved and well supported cultural organisations, but in the current environment that in itself is no guarantee of long-term survival. Back in 2010, and prompted by the possibility of a new building, the director of the Library Theatre Company Chris Honer and I first asked if it would bring artistic opportunities. We considered how artists are working increasingly across platforms and don't define themselves by a particular medium \u2013 we concluded that creating a production-focused, cross-artform organisation would provide new artistic opportunities and also a chance to improve and grow our existing audiences.</p> <p>We realised the new organisation wouldn't simply be \"A + B = C\" but that it would be something different \u2013 we needed to be clear about that in the conversations we were, are and will be having with audiences. Central to this creation of a completely unique organisation was a new name. However, the new name needed to build on the common brand strengths of both organisations to provide a clear link to them.</p> <p>During research, our audiences identified two groups of brand attributes. The first were associated with the experience of the organisation: warm, welcoming, cosy, a home from home, friendly and relaxing. The second attributes were associated with our work: challenging, edgy, modern, global, inspiring. It's important to note that all of these words came from our audiences. With <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home</a> we decided to let the name embody the first set of values and leave space for the work, our programme, to define the second. The name is only the start of the conversation \u2013 we have a long way to go yet.</p> <p><strong>What made these two arts organisations the right fit \u2013 would they have been sustainable individually?</strong></p> <p>Both organisations are engaged with their respective artistic fields, and our programmes are ideas driven \u2013 we're also engaged with our audiences and both rooted in Manchester, but outwards looking. Being of a similar scale helped and being in good financial shape was important too. We were probably sustainable individually but the merger has strengthened us and given the sector (hopefully) a brighter outlook on how to survive the financial doom and gloom.</p> <p><strong>What kind of business model will Home work to?</strong></p> <p>The short answer is that we're working on it. Co-production, both in the UK and abroad, is something that's very much in our thinking, but for creative reasons rather than financial. We want to build on the work we've done around co-creation and participation and we'll also be developing our work with digital technologies to distribute to and engage with audiences.</p> <p>I can say with some certainty that it will be a lower carbon business model as energy costs become one of the most significant variables to control. Our social spaces will continue to be central to our business offer so expect us to keep serving some of the best coffee in Manchester! We currently earn a significant proportion of our income but clearly, like other arts organisations, we'll have to earn even more in future.</p> <p><strong>Creative industries are part of the plan \u2013 where do you see their meeting point with the culture sector?</strong></p> <p>There are many meeting points between the creative industries and the cultural sector \u2013 they have a symbiotic relationship. I believe the cultural sector is a creative industry itself and that many of the creative industries draw on culture for ideas, inspiration and talent.</p> <p>For the wider creative industries our existing building acts as a meeting point: a place to do business, explore ideas and gain inspiration, and this is something we're planning to take with us to Home. However, we also plan to make interventions that help the development of the creative economy, such as hosting guest creative industry networks, seminars and symposia and looking at how we can help young emerging creative people to develop their career.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us more about the new building planned for 2014?</strong></p> <p>The Library Theatre Company has been without a home since 2009 so our theatre performances have been a combination of work presented at <a href=\"http://www.thelowry.com/\" title=\"\">the Lowry</a> and site specific work. Cornerhouse is a building where the audience experience degrades as we get more successful. Both organisations need rehousing for those two reasons alone. Yet by designing a building that's more energy efficient and provides opportunities to increase earnings we help to future proof the business. Our designers have been very cognisant of what our audiences have said about the experience of visiting the two organisations so we think that when people visit Home they'll recognise it.</p> <p><strong>You're a member of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.managers.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Chartered Management Institute</strong></a><strong> \u2013 is there room for more management training in the arts?</strong></p> <p>There is but I'm not a great advocate for specialist arts management training, although I am an advocate for craft skills in our sectors because they're very important and do require specialist input.</p> <p>Basically, management is management. I've read and heard too much nonsense about how arts management is somehow special, but a good manager should be able to transpose their management skills to meet the needs of their business, arts or otherwise. I think some of the best arts managers I see around are as good if not better than managers in other sectors.</p> <p><strong>How do you lead and motivate your staff through a period of such transition?</strong></p> <p>I try to keep our team both involved and well briefed, but it's harder than it sounds because of the speed we're having to move at and our need to continue with business as usual. The days of ACE Lottery money paying for organisations to go dark for two years I think are long gone, so that is not a luxury open to us. Having said that I don't think that culturally this is something we would have done anyway.</p> <p>We are trying to create space for more creative engagement internally but this isn't easy. Nevertheless, much of what has been designed into the building has come from our team. Ultimately, I think the motivation for our team comes from artist and audience \u2013 we like to make good work and we like it when audiences are excited by it.</p> <p><strong>Why do you do what you do?</strong></p> <p>That's a tough one. Perhaps because no one has stopped me yet? I do enjoy it, I believe it has a purpose, and I get to meet and work with amazing people: artists, audiences, technicians, marketers, even accountants and lawyers! Ultimately there is no better drug than seeing an audience of one or thousands have their lives changed in some very small way by an artwork that you have helped create the space for.</p> <p><em>Dave Moutrey is director and chief executive of <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home, Manchester</a> \u2013 follow Cornerhouse on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CornerhouseMcr\" title=\"\"><em>@CornerhouseMcr</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Mother of five Mariam Abdullah borrowed \u00a312,000 to pay for her eldest daughter to get her master's and PhD from the University of Oxford. She didn't turn to a bank for the money though; instead an informal, unregulated and unprotected lending scheme run by her local community in north London.</p> <p>\"I knew the bank wouldn't give me a loan because I had a poor credit rating, so I turned to my local community for the money,\" she says. She's not the only one: with public trust in commercial banking at an all-time low and some payday loan companies charging 4,214% APR, minority communities are finding alternative ways to borrow large sums of money, and many are turning to each other.</p> <p>\"I had no contingency plan,\" Abdullah says. \"If my community didn't lend me the money then my daughter wouldn't have been able to go to university.\" Instead, she borrowed the money and repaid it over a year. Her daughter went to Oxford, gained a PhD in Islamic banking and finance, got a job at a \"magic circle\" law firm and is now a published author. \"I've borrowed money multiple times since then and I trust the people I do it with. There are no hidden fees and it is pretty stress-free,\" Abdullah says.</p> <p>The scheme may be stress-free, but it is also unregulated. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) warns that with any scheme like this both savers and borrowers are not subject to any of the same protections afforded to them if they were dealing with a traditional bank or lender.</p> <p>If a scheme collapses members are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme so will lose their money. There is also no access to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which deals with financial complaints. Nor are participants subject to the same stringent credit and affordability checks as those wishing to borrow from peer-to-peer lenders, which put borrowers and savers who do not know each other in contact, usually via the internet.</p> <p>An FSA spokesperson said: \"These schemes are very high risk and our advice to participants is do not invest any money you wouldn't be prepared to lose.\" Despite the risks, the FSA is aware such schemes are becoming increasingly popular and are gaining momentum.</p> <p>Organisers say the schemes may be more common than people realise, because they are only spoken of behind closed doors. Participants are reluctant to advertise that they have large sums of cash on the property for fear that they might get burgled, while organisers are scared of what the government and financial institutions would do if the schemes ever came to light.</p> <p>How they work varies. In a scheme like that which Abdullah used, 10 people, usually friends or family, each agree to pay \u00a3100 a month into the scheme for 10 months. Each month one member of the group receives a lump sum of \u00a31,000 to spend as they like. The order the participants receive the money is decided in advance, and irrespective of whether you are first or last you must continue to pay your share each month. The amount paid in and the length of the repayment depends on the amount individuals wish to borrow and how much other members of the group can afford to pay.</p> <p>Khadija, a Somali-British woman and an organiser of another scheme in London, says they are run by all sorts of communities across the UK. \"Indians, Arabs, Sudanese, West Indians, Filipinos, etc. They all do it,\" she says.</p> <p>Different communities call it different things: the Caribbean communities call it Pardner; Somali communities call it Ayuto; and other African communities call it Sou Sou.</p> <p>Such schemes have existed for generations with participants using the money for anything from putting down a deposit on a house or paying for an education, to covering the cost of a wedding or even as small business loans.</p> <p>Much like peer-to-peer schemes they are built on mutual trust and benefit. \"Nobody loses out and it's our duty as part of the community to help each other,\" Khadija says.</p> <p>The reason such schemes are so popular among minorities, she explains, is that unlike most financial arrangements there is no interest, no handling charges and no administration or late fees. It also means people can avoid loan sharks.</p> <p>For a while the schemes fell out of favour with minority communities because bank accounts, credit cards and Isas are now easily available to all. However, Khadija says that since the financial crisis the number of people returning to the schemes has increased. \"I get lots of people asking if they can become part of it, but I have to be careful about who I get into it with,\" she says.</p> <p>Tobi, who is originally from Nigeria, started using such schemes while at university in Leeds. \"It was very helpful for expensive things like buying a new laptop or car insurance,\" he says. \"At 27 I am the breadwinner in my family as my Dad is too old to work. So I have to pay the mortgage and these schemes are so helpful.\"</p> <p>Tobi says there are similar schemes among Nigerian communities called Ajo, but these operate more like traditional financial institutions in that the organisers turn a profit.&#xa0;The basic workings are the same as those described above, except Ajo runs in cycles which never last more than a month.</p> <p>During that month an \"Ajo Collector\" organises the scheme and collects a one-off fee from individuals taking part as a service charge.&#xa0;Clients can never exceed the amount they contribute during the cycle, so if you only contribute \u00a3100 during the month you can only borrow \u00a3100.</p> <p>Because these schemes are not publicised it is hard to get a sense of how often they go wrong, and how many members have lost money. Mohamed, a scheme organiser originally from Kenya, insists they rarely go awry. \"We screen people before they are allowed to join and we make sure everyone can afford to pay,\" he says.</p> <p>Mohamed says because everyone within the group is either a close friend or a member of the family, the bonds of trust and respect between participants is strong. \"It has always worked and it is the best thing we have found,\" he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Some names have been changed</em></p>",

  "<p>This question is something I had to ponder in preparation for my course interview: why was I here applying to do a masters degree in social work?</p> <p>The person who most inspired me to train for a career in social work was my childminder, who we all called Nana Mary. My sister and I didn't have a grandmother figure and she was the nearest person we had. Early on in my life, we lived in Shepherd Bush, West London, among a strong Irish community. Mary was our next door neighbour.</p> <p>She had a big family to look after but always had so much time for her neighbours and people in need in the community.</p> <p>Nana Mary was a local Labour councillor in the early 1980's for Hammersmith &amp; Fulham council. Nana Mary had me singing the protest song Red Flag at age four, telling me about CND and the Greenham Common women's peace camp. Old Labour was at her very core. I would watch in awe at her passion for her community, animal welfare, women's and disability rights .</p> <p>She was somebody who didn't have much financially but gave so much of her time and care to others. Mary was quite a character and would often be very blunt and forthright with her views \u2013 she wanted everyone to know she was nobody's fool.</p> <p>Her political and social ideas definitely influenced me to try for an A-level in sociology and it ignited a passion as I began to realise the depth of inequality and injustice that exists in this country. I then went on to study sociology as a degree at the University of Liverpool.</p> <p>Studying, volunteering and working in Liverpool, which contains some of the most deprived communities in the country, along with Mary's political and social influences, made me see the world differently, and observe that not everyone gets a fair chance in life.</p> <p>I have seen many communities that seem to have been left behind, suffering from years of social deprivation and injustice. It made me consider how I could take what I had learnt in life and education, and try and make a real difference, like Mary did in our community, when I was a child.</p> <p>Social work seemed to be the obvious answer.</p> <p>Mary sadly passed away in 2007 but her influence is still very present in my life. I was fortunate to gain experience as a social work assistant to gain an understanding of what social work is really about.</p> <p>It was a reality check about the challenges social workers face trying to help people in crisis: long waiting lists, lack of funds, constant pressure and criticism, and even death threats. This did leave me wondering at times why people become social workers. It must be for the love of the job and certainly not for any financial reward.</p> <p>Despite the negative aspects of the job, the social workers I met were all driven by a passion similar to what I had seen in Nana Mary.</p> <p>I am returning to university as a mature student with a bit more life experience. Doing the MA in social work will help me start my career as a newly qualified social worker.</p> <p>I am fortunate to have gained a place at the University of Manchester to study the MA and I'm really looking forward to it. I hope that if Mary was still around she would be proud of me doing the course and my chosen career path and I just wish she knew how much I admired her.</p> <p><em>What inspired you to enter social work?

  "<p>If you've been invited for a university interview, congratulations \u2013 the battle is, in part, won. The next challenge is to meet academics face-to-face and prove that you are able to cope with the demands of your chosen course.</p> <p>Interviews are no mean feat, but if you do your preparation, you'll stand yourself in good stead, says Julian Skyrme, head of student recruitment at Manchester University. First, make sure you know exactly what to expect on the day.</p> <p>\"The university should send you information about what will happen when you arrive at interview \u2013 read this carefully,\" says Skyrme. \"Check if you will be asked to sit an assessment, or if there is anything you need to take with you. If you're not sure, call and ask.\"</p> <p>Also, speak to older students about how you can prepare, recommends Hira Nazir, a fourth-year dentistry student at Manchester University. \"If you don't know anyone studying your course, you can contact students through websites like the Student Room or the university's Facebook page.\"</p> <p>What you'll be asked varies according to degree choice, but it's all geared towards the same question \u2013 how suitable are you to study your subject at university level?</p> <p>\"It's essential that you read your personal statement through beforehand, as interviewers may wish to draw upon the topics you have raised,\" advises Dr Margaret Barnes-Davies, a graduate admissions tutor at the University of Leicester. \"Think why you have chosen a particular subject and university \u2013 read about the course online, and pay attention to the teaching styles offered.\"</p> <p>Candidates for particularly competitive subjects may also face academic questions. Nazir recalls being asked several specific dentistry questions. \"I was asked about cross-contamination control \u2013 how would I reduce the risk of infection? And I was given a scenario \u2013 I had to imagine I was out in town on a Friday night. Of the people I would see there, I was asked to say who was mostly likely to end up in my surgery the next morning.\"</p> <p>Tutors will be listening for analytical abilities and intellectual flexibility, says Skyrme. \"They want to see that you've done wider reading beyond A-levels and that you are able to cope with new ideas.</p> <p>\"An English candidate might be asked what a feminist would think of a particular book, for example. There won't always be a right or wrong answer.\"</p> <p>The key to preparing well is practice, which means plenty of mock interviews \u2013 with teachers, classmates or whoever is on hand. Valeed Ghafoor, a fourth-year medical student, remembers recruiting family members to act as interviewers.</p> <p>\"Even though they didn't know the subject well, they could still comment on my body language and the way I spoke. Although the academic element is very important, you also need to come across as someone who is intelligent, calm, and enjoys their subject.\"</p>",
  "<p>Humanism in its most virulent form tries to make science into a religion. It is awash with the intolerance of enthusiasm. For a start, there is the near-hysterical repudiation of religion. To quote Richard Dawkins:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think there's something very evil about faith \u2026 it justifies essentially anything. If you're taught in your holy book or by your priest that blasphemers should die or apostates should die \u2013 anybody who once believed in the religion and no longer does needs to be killed \u2013 that clearly is evil. And people don't have to justify it because it's their faith.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the caricaturing of \"faith\" as murderous fundamentalism, one hears echoes of the bloody and interminable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation\" title=\"\">Reformation squabbles</a> between Protestants and Catholics. It is also of course to give help to the real enemy, those who turn their back fully on science as they follow their religion.</p> <p>There are other aspects of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism\" title=\"\">new atheist</a> movement that remind me of religion. One is the adulation by supporters and enthusiasts for the leaders of the movement: it is not just a matter of agreement or respect but also of a kind of worship. This certainly surrounds Dawkins, who is admittedly charismatic.</p> <p>Freud describes a phenomenon that he calls \"the narcissism of small differences\", in which groups feud over distinctions that, to the outside, seem totally trivial. The new atheists show this phenomenon more than any group I have encountered.</p> <p>This is a personal matter, so let me stress at once that I am not writing this from a sense of exclusion or hurt. I am happy with my position and I love a good fight. (If this piece has not convinced you of this, then nothing will.) Dawkins has said that on a scale from zero to seven, from belief to non-belief, he scores about 6.9. I am even a tad higher than that. I am a true non-believer. I am also a fanatical Darwinian \u2013 more so even than Dawkins, because I think that when it comes to culture, genes do much that he hands over to his own special cultural notion of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme\" title=\"\">memes</a>\". I have written many books about the implications of Darwinian thinking for epistemology and ethics.</p> <p>What's more, I think that religion has done and continues to do much harm to society. In the blog I write for the <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogAuthor/Brainstorm/3/Michael-Ruse/142/\" title=\"\">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> I have taken on the Catholics, the Calvinists, the Mormons (that got me into hot water), and even the dear old Quakers (perhaps a bit Oedipal, because I was raised a Quaker). I was the expert witness in philosophy in Arkansas when the <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/aclu-applauds-removal-unconstitutional-creation-science-earmark-appropriations-bill\" title=\"\">American Civil Liberties Union successfully fought against a law</a> requiring the teaching of so-called \"creation science\" (aka biblical literalism) in the publicly supported schools of that state. I have been a vocal opponent of creationism for many years.</p> <p>And yet I, and others like me, am reviled in terms far harsher than those kept for real opponents like creationists. We are labelled \"accommodationists\" for our willingness to give religion a space not occupied by science. We are put down in terms that denote strong emotion, way beyond reason. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/sep/23/richarddawkins\" title=\"\">The God Delusion</a>, I am likened to Neville Chamberlain, the pusillanimous appeaser of Hitler. Jerry Coyne, author of both the book and the blog <a href=\"http://jerrycoyne.uchicago.edu/about.html\" title=\"\">Why Evolution is True</a> and an ardent groupie of Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, wrote about one of my books in terms used by George Orwell: \"There are some ideas so absurd that only an intellectual could believe them.\"</p> <p>The Minnesota biologist PZ Myers, who writes the blog <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/\" title=\"\">Pharyngula</a>, has referred to me as a \"clueless gobshite\". And if I had a dollar for everyone who has made a pun out of my last name, I would be a very rich man. Because I will not toe the line absolutely, because I will not bow down in praise of Dawkins and company, because I laugh at their pretentions and positions, I am anathema maranatha.</p> <p>As I said, I don't care about the personal attacks. I have the kind of personality that welcomes being in the public eye, even if the attention is critical. I have teased Coyne and sent him $50 as a retainer to make sure I am not forgotten. But I do think it all tells us something. Call it a secular religion if you will, but the humanism I have been discussing in this piece does bear strong similarities to conventional religion. One finds the enthusiasm of the true believer. And as a non-believing Darwinian evolutionist, as one who is a humanist in the broader sense, this makes me feel rather ill.</p> <p>\u2022 A longer version of this article appears in <a href=\"http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/michael-ruse-humanism-religion/\" title=\"\">Aeon magazine</a></p>",
  "<p>The government's desire to increase the private sector's involvement in the NHS and its <a href=\"http://responsibilitydeal.dh.gov.uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Responsibility Deal</a>, which aims to encourage healthier food, might create new opportunities for commercial and public sector partnerships in public health. Hospital catering, where the private sector already has a strong foothold, could become a fertile ground for new ways of working across the sectors and improve patient health.</p> <p>The NHS traditionally contracts services from the private sector so there is no cultural barrier to expanding these kinds of partnerships in hospital catering, according to the <a href=\"http://www.adph.org.uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Association of Directors of Public Health</a>. Its president, Janet Atherton, who is director of public health in Sefton, Merseyside, says: \"I think that when you talk about partnerships with the private sector you have got to be very clear about what you are trying to achieve, if that can be delivered better from the private sector, and what that means for public health.</p> <p>\"In terms of hospital food that means more than good quality food, it's also about being able to deliver choice, whether the food is appetising when you don't feel well and that it can be delivered at a time when people need it.\"</p> <p>Dr Sue O'Connell is chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.communityhealthpartnerships.co.uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Community Health Partnerships</a>, which co-ordinated the <a href=\"http://www.communityhealthpartnerships.co.uk/index.php?ob=1&amp;id=483\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lift programme</a> \u2013 a Department of Health initiative to create private-public sector partnerships for new primary care premises. She agrees with Atherton that it is vital the public sector has its aims and objectives clearly defined in any partnership with private providers \u2013 whatever the service.</p> <p>She says: \"The public sector has to understand right from the start what it needs and what it wants to achieve. Then when it goes to the private sector there is a greater clarity around the purpose of the whole arrangement.\" O'Connell also thinks the private sector has something new to offer the public sector: \"It can bring a different approach \u2013 the art of the possible.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hospitalcaterers.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hospital Caterers Association</a>, which estimates that around half its members now come from the private sector, says outsourcing has advantages. Its chair Janice Gillan, who is catering manager at Crosshouse hospital, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, says: \"Where private contractors do have an advantage is that they may have their own terms and conditions and may be able to save money because in the NHS if somebody is off sick at the weekend we still have to pay them time and half or double time.\"</p> <p>The private sector, according to Gillan is also not tied down by the same procurement red tape which she says dominates the NHS buying process. \"If we want to buy milk or butter for example we are governed by public procurement legislation,\" she says. \"There is a lot of governance around contracts on what you can and cannot buy, but if you are outside the NHS then you are not governed by that same legislation.\"</p> <p>Gillan, like Atherton, stresses that successful hospital catering is more than the quality of food alone. \"The service is just as important as production of food. You could have the best food in the world but it's no good if it's left to go cold or isn't cut up so the patient can't eat it.\"</p> <p>Roger d'Elia, who has 26 years of experience in NHS facilities management which includes hospital catering, says flexibility and choice were instrumental in his trust's decision to switch from NHS in-house suppliers to outside private contractors Medirest. Medirest is part of the global giant Compass group \u2013 a signatory to the government's Responsibility Deal, which takes voluntary pledges from business, industry and other organisations to help improve public health. Medirest has around 14% of the UK's patient catering market. He says the company offered flexibility and a consistent menu choice for patients \u2013 crucial to improving patient health.</p> <p>\"I think that traditional hospital catering was based on a rather military model of delivering food it was served at a specific time,\" d'Elia says. \"You got what you got and you were lucky to have any choice at all and there was no control of portion size. I think that mindset still exists in some hospitals.\"</p> <p>Outsourcing, he says, reduced food waste and made mealtimes a pleasure. \"Our food waste before had been between 20-25% but it went down to 0.5% because people were eating the food. Mealtimes became a pleasant event. When things are pleasant patients get better. From an acute hospital perspective, if people eat well their tissue regeneration is excellent, their wounds heal better and they can fight off infection.\"</p> <p>While the government's Responsibility Deal may not lay down the rules on what can and cannot be placed on a hospital patient's plate, it could contribute to raising the standards of hospital food generally.</p> <p>Professor Lindsey Davies is president of the <a href=\"http://www.fph.org.uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Faculty of Public Health</a> and is a member of the Department of Health's high level food network steering group involved in the Responsibility Deal. She says: \"I think it could have an impact if for example suppliers have signed up to the Responsibility Deal pledge to reduce salt in their products or remove trans fats, particularly if the hospital didn't have that kind of regulation before. That would be a good thing.\"</p> <p><em>This feature is sponsored by Compass, which is also sponsoring the healthcare network's next <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/sep/03/public-health-dialogue-embracing-partnerships\">Public Health Dialogue</a> event, on embracing partnerships, which takes place in London on 17 October</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers. </strong></p>",
  "<p>Ed Miliband will put himself on the side of the \"forgotten 50%\" on Tuesday by drawing on his state school roots and promising to reform an education system that he says fails half of Britain's teenagers by giving them second-rate vocational qualifications of little value to employers.</p> <p>In his address to the Labour party conference in Manchester, constructed around the theme of working together to rebuild Britain from recession, he will contrast his commitment to help those who don't go to university with a Tory plan for an education system designed \"for a narrower and narrower elite\".</p> <p>He will also explicitly call on his party to shift focus from Tony Blair's earlier commitment to increase the numbers going to university towards helping the teenagers between 14 and 18 who are in need of good vocational education to keep them from dead-end jobs.</p> <p>\"We cannot succeed if we have an education system that only works for half the country. It's time now to focus on those who don't go to university,\" he will say.</p> <p>Repeatedly drawing on his own experience at a London comprehensive \u2013 implicitly contrasting his own schooling with the Eton-educated David Cameron's \u2013 he will say that although for a quarter of a century children successful at exams have found the world open up, for the remainder school has offered very little and they have found themselves written off.</p> <p>His schooling at Haverstock school in north London taught him \"a lot more than just how to pass exams\", he will say. \"It taught people how to get on with each other, whoever they are and wherever they're from. I will always be grateful because I know I would not be standing here today as leader of the Labour party without my comprehensive school education.\"</p> <p>He will try to explain why his roots are so different to Cameron's, saying: \"My family has not sat under the same oak tree for the last 500 years. My parents came to Britain as immigrants, Jewish refugees from the Nazis. I would not be standing here today without the compassion and tolerance of our great country.\" Setting out plans for a clear vocational route to a gold standard qualification at 18 called a Technical Baccalaureate, he will also require all young people to study English and Maths to 18 as a strict condition for the award of the \"Tech Baccs\".</p> <p>He will also propose a German style shakeup of post-18 apprenticeships, in which companies, on an industry or regional basis, can sign legally enforceable agreements requiring all participating firms to pay a levy to cover the cost of training, so \u2013 ending the scourge of freeloading companies refusing to pay the costs of apprenticeships, but stealing skilled staff from firms that do train.</p> <p>He will also give businesses control of the \u00a31bn budget of the Skills Agency.</p> <p>Labour regards its plans for the forgotten 50% as far more sweeping than the tinkering reforms to A-levels proposed by the education secretary, Michael Gove.</p> <p>The proposal for a Tech Bacc, which was supported by Miliband's industry adviser, Lord Adonis, originates from a report by Prof Alison Wolf in 2011 commissioned by Gove. </p> <p>Wolf found: \"The staple offer for between a quarter and a third of the post-16 cohort is a diet of low-level vocational qualifications, most of which have little to no labour market value. Among 16 to 19-year-olds, the review estimated that at least 350,000 got little to no benefit from the post-16 education system\". The report highlighted that only 4% of 16-year-olds who have failed GCSE Maths and English go on to pass them by the age of 19, an omission that contrasts with the rest of the world's absolute determination to improve basic numeracy and literacy of its post-16 vocational students.</p> <p>Gove welcomed the report, but has not implemented it, prompting Miliband to claim Gove has contempt for vocational qualifications.</p> <p>More broadly Miliband will call for a society in which everyone can, and is expected to, play their part in restoring Britain. There will be calls on banks to work together with small firms and businesses to co-operate with long-term shareholders.</p> <p>Conservative sources dismissed Miliband's reform initiative, saying Gove has already set out the goal Miliband is discussing, has already changed the funding system to begin this transition, and that Miliband's pledge will already have happened long before the election.</p> <p>Miliband knows he faces a huge task to convince voters he is prime minister material, and much of the speech, some of it delivered away from the podium, will be designed to re-present himself to unimpressed voters.</p> <p>His task was not made any easier by the frequently critical Blackley and Broughton MP Graham Stringer telling a fringe meeting in Manchester that Miliband had \"failed to make a human connection with the electorate\" and was \"incapable of fighting the next election on personality\".</p>",

Sources with knowledge of the case said the officer was disciplined for his use of Twitter as a means to generate support for Greater Manchester police officers who wished to attend the funerals this week of the constables Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes, who were killed in Manchester last month.</p> <p>Under the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/%23coverforgmp?q=%23coverforgmp\" title=\"\">coverforgmp</a>, the officer was one of a number who called for police across the country to offer to provide cover for Greater Manchester colleagues in order that they could attend the services.</p> <p>West Midlands police denied this was the reason for the disciplinary action. A spokesman said it related to other issues involving his use of Twitter. These are understood to include the posting of images of a second world war weapon and grenade found in a property search.</p> <p>Scobbie, who is deputy chief constable of Tayside police, said he was watching developments in the two cases.</p> <p>\"There is a fine balance to be struck,\" he said. \"Social media is a positive tool if used properly and forces need to be careful about the amount of control they have.</p> <p>\"It comes down to the culture of an organisation and the degree of trust you have in your frontline officers. You have to allow them to make mistakes and deal with them as a mistake, rather than coming down heavily on them. People who make mistakes should be supported, otherwise we are in danger of looking out of touch and heavy-handed.\"</p> <p>There are 1,000 approved police tweeters \u2013 who operate from force-accredited accounts \u2013 and are doing so with the approval of their senior officers.</p> <p>Many other officers tweet under pseudonyms believing they can speak more freely as result.</p> <p>One of the first police tweeters was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hotelalpha9\" title=\"\">PC Ed Rogerson</a>, who tweets about his life as a community officer in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He started tweeting after being repeatedly told by members of the public when he was on the beat that he was the first officer they had seen in months. \"It used to annoy me really and I wanted to use Twitter as a way to increase my visibility,\" said Rogerson.</p> <p>\"I was the first frontline cop to be doing it and I've had an amazing response. The benefits of doing this outweigh the negatives. We have to trust police officers to use their common sense. You can have lists and lists of things you cannot say online but it all comes down to common sense. You need to understand the online culture and I don't think every police officer should be doing it.</p> <p>\"Social media and what you should and shouldn't do is something you need to understand before you start it.\"</p> <p>Scobbie said different forces had different policies on the use of social media.</p> <p>\"Some corporate communications departments in forces are uneasy because they feel they are the professionals and they don't want to give away that power,\" he said. \"There is obviously a role for corporate communications departments but I think that engagement is important, and engagement is something which I think you push down to the very lowest level possible.</p> <p>\"Frontline officers and PCSOs [community support officers] who have already got a relationship with the community can use social media to communicate what they are doing in a way that feels human. The feedback from the public is that they like it.</p> <p>\"The message has to be: 'We trust you with a baton and with the right to take away someone's liberty, I think we can trust you with a Twitter account.' \"</p> <p>Scobbie said officers needed to be supported and given the skills to use social media and said there was always a need to safeguard the police's reputation.</p> <p>But he said the use of social media was a tool for openness and transparency. \"If there are officers who are saying things which are critical then we need to engage with them and look at the allegations they are making, and turn it into a constructive dialogue,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If you are too prescriptive and controlling, you are in danger of driving the whole thing underground and you will get individuals just attacking everything from internal spoof accounts.</p> <p>\"It is far better to encourage social media use within an organisation, have a proper strategy that makes it clear to people why you are doing this, the kind of things you want officers to be using Twitter for and the fact that you will support them if they make mistakes.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the West Midlands force said the suspended officer was being investigated over alleged misuse of social media, against force policy. \"Any breaches of force policy are taken extremely seriously,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: \"Devon and Cornwall police embraces social media and all staff's responsible use of it.</p> <p>\"The force's main Twitter account has more than 11,500 followers and we value it greatly as a way of communicating with communities and the wider public.</p> <p>\"The PCSO concerned has been given words of advice around the content of tweets, but has not been banned or stopped from tweeting.</p> <p>\"The force has a social media policy which gives clear guidance to all staff on what is deemed appropriate, and in this case, training will now be given to the PCSO so she can better use social media in the future as an innovative communication tool.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that social media is a very quick and effective means which can have pitfalls, but we are committed to ensuring staff have the knowledge and expertise wherever possible to use it properly.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Belfast businessman has made complaints to police on both sides of the Irish border that one of the republic's state-rescued banks offered him around \u20ac1m, which in turn would have deprived the UK tax office of its share of \u20ac3m.</p> <p>A potential Garda Sioch\u00e1na inquiry into the continuing battle between property investor Peter Curistan and the former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/anglo-irish-bank\" title=\"\">Anglo Irish Bank</a> has raised the prospect of the republic's police force carrying out a criminal investigation into a financial institution owned by its own government.</p> <p>Curistan is fighting several legal battles with the bank. It has emerged that one of the claims, relating to a hearing in Dublin last year, alleges that a senior executive at Anglo Irish offered Curistan \u00a3750,000 to dissolve his property company Sheridan Millennium Ltd and thus \"burn\" his main creditors \u2013 Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).</p> <p>The offer of the money has now been reported as a criminal complaint to the Garda Sioch\u00e1na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).</p> <p>Anglo Irish was the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland after the financial crash of 2008. It had become the preferred bank of property developers and speculators, who used billions of loans to fuel the republic's booming commercial sector and housing market. Anglo Irish and other banks were accused of encouraging speculation that left the country saddled with huge bank debts, and resulted in the EU/International Monetary Fund bailout.</p> <p>The fallout from Anglo's collapse has already included <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/20/sean-quinn-nephew-arrest-warrant\" title=\"\">the virtual destruction of a business empire controlled by Ireland's one-time richest man, Sean Quinn</a>, who borrowed heavily from the bank in the Celtic Tiger years.</p> <p>Like Quinn, Curistan has tried to fight back against attempts by the now state-owned bank \u2013 now known as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) \u2013 to seize his assets. Unlike Quinn, the former Hong Kong-based entrepreneur is seeking to turn a financial battle in the courts into a criminal inquiry.</p> <p>He said: \"The reason why they [IBRC] did this was because as part of a plan to dispose of the Odyssey Pavilion [an entertainment venue in Belfast], the bank had agreed to pay almost \u20ac3m [to] creditors, of which HMRC was owed a considerable amount. The \u20ac1m was to encourage me to wind up the company without the bank then needing to make those commitments. Clearly I was totally shocked at how a state-owned bank could blatantly asked me to partake in such activity.</p> <p>\"As a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, I had a duty to report allegations of criminal activity to the appropriate authorities. And this is why both the PSNI and the Garda have been informed of this in recent weeks,\" he said.</p> <p>During a case heard last March and April in Dublin's high court, the IBRC was seeking to seize a property Curistan owned in the Irish capital. A letter was read out in open court that suggested he dispose of another property in Belfast \u2013 the Odyssey Pavilion on the river Lagan. The entertainment centre was under the control of Sheridan Millennium, a Curistan-owned company at the time.</p> <p>An account of a recorded mobile phone conversation between Curistan and the Anglo Irish Bank/IBRC official Joe McWilliams was read out in court. Before nationalisation, McWilliams was a director of lending (Ireland) in the Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>The record of the phone call stated: \"He [McWilliams] rang my mobile at approximately 5pm on Tuesday 3 February 2009. He stated that he had a thought that it may be better to wind up Sheridan Millennium now as he felt there would be continual pressure on the Sheridan Group in the future which may eventually lead to winding up.</p> <p>\"He went on to suggest that I should be given an incentive to the tune of \u00a3500-750,000 to have in my back pocket..\"</p> <p>Under cross-examination in open court by Curistan (who represented himself) in front of Mr Justice Charleton, McWilliams was asked under oath if he would disagree with that account of the phone conversation. To which McWilliams replied: \"No, that was fairly accurate.\" However, he did not confirm the precise amount offered to Curistan.</p> <p>Charleton asked why it was necessary to pay Curistan anything to wind up Sheridan Millennium. \"The normal rule in corporate law is, there is no cakes and ale except for the benefit of the corporation,\" said Charleton.</p> <p>\"The normal rule in corporate law \u2013 Anglo is a corporation \u2013 the corporation is not entitled to spend money on anything which doesn't give the corporation a benefit or a potential benefit. It includes, in terms of commerce, that a corporation doesn't have the capacity to simply give away money.</p> <p>\"I still can't understand why you would actually pay money, three-quarters of a million pounds, that's nearly \u20ac1m, to Mr Curistan for his back pocket. I appreciate it is less than the \u20ac3m you would lend to him for the purpose of dealing with his creditors so that Sheridan Millennium would be able to carry on for a time until you could get an orderly takeover. Windups cause loss to creditors.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the IBRC said it would not comment on Curistan's complaint to the two police forces or the content of the court transcripts because the bank is currently involved in litigation with him.</p>",

  "<p>The archbishop of Canterbury has said that making \"risky and anything but infallible judgments\" is a key part of the job as spiritual head of the Church of England, and that he doubts his successor will disagree.</p> <p>Three months before he is due to leave Lambeth Palace after nearly 10 years in office, Rowan Williams said that although he had certain regrets he believed the role necessitated outspoken interventions. His comments on sharia law in 2008 proved particularly controversial.</p> <p>\"Oh, I do regrets alright,\" said Williams, after a lecture organised by the thinktank Theos. \"But I just don't think that it'll do to be too cautious in a job like this.</p> <p>\"You're here to try and say what you believe you've been given to say \u2026 to try and share a particular picture of what the world is like, of what God is like, which of course leads you into sometimes risky and anything but infallible judgments about particular issues of the day.\"</p> <p>Asked if he would be disappointed if the man taking his place on the throne of St Augustine proved less combative, he replied: \"Looking at the names that have been mentioned as my successor, I don't think any of them [the candidates] is going to have that problem, frankly. I'm very glad of that.\"</p> <p>His remarks came amid continuing uncertainty over the selection of his successor. Despite meeting last week for what had been scheduled to be the final time, the Crown Nominations Commission appears to be divided over which two names to pick as its first-choice and back-up candidate.</p> <p>Speaking in front of a packed lecture theatre, the soon-to-be outgoing archbishop appeared more relaxed than at many previous outings, quoting Edith Piaf, critiquing the BBC reality show The Apprentice and showing a willingness to mock his uber-intellectual persona for quoting liberally from \"that household name\" Vladimir Lossky, a 20th century Orthodox thinker not widely known outside theological circles.</p> <p>He used the comedy show Father Ted to explain his exasperation with the Occupy London protesters whose encampment outside St Paul's cathedral caused a crisis in the Church last year and whose language, he said, was \"so general as to be undemanding\". He added: \"Rather like that episode in Father Ted where the priests demonstrate outside the cinema with a placard saying Down With This Sort of Thing. I just feel we've got to do a bit better than that.\"</p> <p>On the single issue which has perhaps wrought more division in the worldwide Anglican community than any other over the past decade, Williams acknowledged that if the Church was failing to get its message on homosexuality across properly it could cause \"a very serious mental health impact\" on young gay Christians. He said: \"I think that although the Church has in recent years tried quite hard to say we are not condemning a person as such for what their sexual orientation is, and that's a very serious commitment, nonetheless there is of course a hangover, a feeling of 'yes, you're condemned in your entirety for what you are, not for what you do but for what you are.' If people are getting the message that they are condemned for what they are, of course there's a very serious mental health impact. I hope that's not what the Church is doing; I certainly don't think it's what the Church should be doing.\"</p> <p>Williams rejected the suggestion that he had left the Church a more divided organisation than it was at the beginning of his time at Lambeth, saying, to applause: \"There is no golden age in the Church's history, we may think 'oh, it was relatively problem-free then' \u2013 one of the advantages in this job of being a Church historian is that you know that is not true. When I think I have got problems, I think, well, at least it is not the fourth century, at least it is not the 17th century.\"</p> <p>Of his 103 predecessors, Williams said, his favourite was either St Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109, or Michael Ramsey who served from 1961 until 1974. Asked if BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day slot should be opened to atheists, he paused, before saying: \"I think the case still has to be made for an atheist presence there, in that there isn't all that much of a shortage of opportunities for secularist and atheist people to make their point.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 October 2012. The original described Vladimir Lossky as a 19th-century, rather than 20th-century, thinker.</p>"
