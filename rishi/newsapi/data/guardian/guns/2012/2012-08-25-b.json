  "<p>Lady Gaga has almost 30 million, Wayne Rooney nearly five million and David Cameron a more-than-respectable two million plus. But how many of their Twitter followers actually exist?</p> <p>A British start-up company has pledged to root out and expose the phantom, fake and fraudulent followers being used to massage the numbers claimed by celebrities, politicians and the merely insecure within the Twittersphere.</p> <p>It used to be that the number of an individual's Facebook friends was a measure of value in the social media era, but that source of prestige has been supplanted by the Twitter index. The number of followers of an individual Twitter account is seen as a measure of influence that can be translated into financial value by advertisers and marketing companies. Before the Olympics began, many British athletes were encouraged to tweet about products such as cars they had received from sponsors.</p> <p>The company, <a href=\"http://statuspeople.com/\">Status People</a>, has now devised <a href=\"http://fakers.statuspeople.com/\">a software tool that divides followers into the fake, the inactive and the good</a>. Company executive Rob Waller said it had been decided to create the \"fake follower\" tool after reports that former Tory MP Louise Mensch had 40,000 fake followers. The fake follower tool aims to expose the true extent of the problem of phantom Twitter followers.</p> <p>Waller said: \"A fake account is set up to follow people or send out spam. They normally have no followers, but follow large numbers of people. An inactive account is one in which there has been no activity for a while. They could be real people, but we would describe them as consumers of information rather than sharers of information. A good account is everything that remains.\" The tool analyses an account's 100,000 most recent followers, but Waller said they hoped to improve its accuracy. Lady Gaga has only 29% \"good\" followers, Wayne Rooney 30% and David Cameron 37%. Comedians and entertainers also have a relatively small proportion of \"good\" followers: Stephen Fry 36%, Alan Carr 39% and Ricky Gervais 34%.</p> <p>Almost every Twitter account has a small percentage of fake followers because, unlike Facebook, anyone can follow you \u2013 from a genuine friend to a computer-generated account set up to promote pornography. That freedom has created a market for the sale of Twitter followers. Scores of internet sites offer thousands of Twitter followers for small sums of money. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, it would be possible to buy 220,000 followers for \u00a3260.</p> <p>The sites work in two ways. One kind of software identifies Twitter accounts that include keywords such as football, and \"follows\" these accounts in the hope they will reciprocate. Other programmes create artificial accounts and sell them by the thousand. On the Fiverr website, 2,000 followers can be bought for $5.</p> <p>As suspicions have grown about the authenticity of some Twitter follower counts, increasingly high-profile figures are being interrogated about their numbers. After the revelation that she had fake followers, Mensch tweeted: \"I've asked @Twitter in the UK to see if they can remove the 40k spambots and reset me to my 66k count ... need a better filter.\"</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the minister for housing, was recently accused by a political website of using a programme to generate more Twitter followers. Dozens of people said they were \"followed\" and \"unfollowed\" several times by Shapps, which suggested the actions were being executed by a computer programme.</p> <p>Katy Howell, chief executive of Immediate Future, a social media consultancy, said Twitter was still new and people were still working out the rules and etiquette. \"It's a young industry and there is still a lot of immaturity in it. Most celebrities and brands will start off their Twitter accounts by following people who they think might follow them.</p> <p>\"It's a kind of flirtation, but there is a thin line between what is in the spirit of social media and what is gaming the system,\" she said.</p> <p>The accounts of most celebrities and companies are managed by agencies or assistants who may be keen to inflate the numbers of their clients' followers to demonstrate their value, said Howell. \"They lose some control over them. The easiest way to demonstrate success at managing a Twitter account is showing the increase in the number of followers.</p> <p>\"People do it to show off, but the other rationale is that you need a critical mass of followers before some people take you seriously \u2026 you need 20,000 followers before people will look at you.\"</p> <p>But Howell added that the artificial increase in followers might have a superficial attraction, but offers no long-term benefits. \"You need to build a connection and a relationship with people who are interested in what you do.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <em>Observer</em> has obtained a letter to David Cameron and Nick Clegg from former police and intelligence chiefs who say the UK's ability to combat international crime will be severely limited if it turns its back on further European Union crime co-operation.</p> <p>Written by William Hughes, director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency from 2004 to 2010, it is signed by former Metropolitan police commissioners Lords Blair and Imbert, as well as Sir Stephen Lander, the ex-head of MI5, and other eminent figures.</p> <p>Their intervention places them firmly in the camp of the pro-EU Lib Dems, but at loggerheads with the predominantly Eurosceptic Tory party. It follows a letter to the prime minister in February by 102 Conservative backbenchers who demanded he opt out of EU police and justice policies, including the European arrest warrant, to prevent any further loss of sovereignty.</p> <p>With Cameron reluctant to promise a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, an opt-out on justice and home affairs issues is seen by Tory strategists as a possible alternative to appease Eurosceptic backbenchers.</p> <p>The UK must decide by next summer if it wants to remain fully involved with existing EU justice and police measures or opt out. In their letter to Cameron and Clegg, the signatories say the latter course would have disastrous consequences for the fight against international paedophile gangs and investigations into terrorist networks.</p> <p>\"The growth in cross-border criminal activity within Europe is both an inevitable byproduct of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people under the single market, and a serious policing and security challenge,\" they say. \"Responding to an increasingly international criminal environment requires modern international legal and policing tools, fast and effective cross-border co-operation and the ability to raise standards and share best practice with our closest security partners.\"</p> <p>British officers, they say, are at the forefront of shaping effective co-operation. \"British law enforcement bodies&#xa0;are now constantly communicating, co-operating and collaborating with EU agencies and other national policing partners in pursuing serious organised criminal and terrorist networks.\"</p> <p>A key success, they say, was Operation Rescue \u2013 a three-year investigation by Europol across 30 countries between 2008 and 2011 which led to the discovery of the world's largest online paedophile network. There were 184 arrests and 230 children were freed, including 60 in the UK.</p> <p>The former officers say scrapping or opting out of the European arrest warrant would be entirely self-defeating.</p>",
  "<p>Jessica Piln\u00e4s is Swedish, and so, by descent, was Peggy Lee (n\u00e9e Norma Deloris Egstrom). This set of Peggy Lee songs is billed as a tribute, but it's by no means an attempted soundalike. Peggy was actually very American, brought up in the swing era. She sounded gentle but tough. Jessica is altogether more \u2013 well, Swedish. Her version of Peggy's big hit, Fever, with folky-sounding marimba in the background, is fragile and slightly ghostly, and that's the general effect throughout. It's refreshing to have a new perspective on these familiar, and some less-familiar, songs. That's what gives this collection its charm.</p>",
  "<p>Since becoming crown prince of the blues in the late 80s, Cray has won Grammies and played alongside 12-bar aristocrats such as BB King but has often seemed on cruise control. As a suited-up <em>Mad Men</em> cover shot suggests, he has his mojo back. Won't Be Coming Home puts Cray in the driveway watching his woman's tail light vanish, pitting weary vocals against stinging guitar. I'm Done Crying, a slow, soul-soaked epic with strings, has him testifying magnificently. Producer Kevin Shirley keeps things taut and gritty (the sessions took just a fortnight) and Cray burns with urgency.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Born Kane Robinson in Newham, east London, Kano is a grime MC and actor. His fifth solo album is out this year.</strong></p> <p><strong>When did you first get involved with Africa Express? </strong></p> <p>The first one I did was in Liverpool, years ago. I'd worked with Damon Albarn before on one of my records; we had a good relationship. He said: \"Look, it's a gig \u2013 just something we do.\" He told me they'd been to a few different countries and done it, hundreds of musicians coming together from West Africa, the UK, all over the world, basically bridging the gap between African music and European. He said: \"Don't expect to have a time slot. Don't expect to perform one of your own songs necessarily; just jump on. Have a laugh. Expect the unexpected.\" I couldn't imagine what kind of show it was going to be like, but I enjoyed it so much.</p> <p><strong>What happened next?</strong></p> <p>We took over a stage at Glastonbury \u2013 I remember doing a broken-down version of my song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4DlxysdD_s\" title=\"\">Feel Free</a>, with Damon on the piano and a guy called Scratch beat-boxing \u2013 and then we went to Nigeria. Ten days in Lagos \u2013 that was one of the most exciting things I've done. To jam with African musicians, but in <em>their</em> territory\u2026 We performed in Fela Kuti's Shrine with his son, Femi. One of the maddest gigs I've ever played \u2013 Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers playing bass, me rapping over it. Random. Surreal. Wicked, though.</p> <p><strong>Which African artists are you particularly looking forward to this time around?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/08/spoek-mathambo-father-creeper-review\" title=\"Spoek\">Spoek</a> [Mathambo, a South African rapper], definitely. I worked with him at the last show in Brighton. I have fun performing with him, I hope people get to know him.</p> <p><strong>Have the Africa Express experiences you've had to date altered your way of writing or performing?</strong></p> <p>As an MC, I come from a background where the onstage experience is freestyle-based: you never know who's going to join you on stage, or what you're gonna do, or how&#xa0;long you can stay on. You kind of lose that, once you get on to recording albums and going on tour. Doing Africa Express has brought me back to that excitement \u2013&#xa0;for the unexpected.</p> <p><strong>Are there downsides to the project?</strong></p> <p>No one would want to do Africa Express every day, put it that way. [Laughs.] It is stressful at times. Anyone who's been involved with it, they always come away saying it's the weirdest\u2026 best\u2026 worst gig&#xa0;they've ever done.</p> <p><strong>One of the project's aims is to show Africans as \"equals with something to offer\", to share ideas and open eyes \"towards the new and changing Africa\". How might it achieve that?</strong></p> <p>You know, it's not like an African musician is coming over here and trying to break the European market. The African musicians are doing <em>their</em> thing, playing their music on their own instruments in their own clothes.</p> <p>It's not one of these gigs that's an event about Africa \u2013 with no African musicians, you know what I mean? It's not an event about Africa where you think: \"Why is bloody Paul McCartney headlining? How did <em>that</em> happen?\" </p>",
  "<p>When DeShawn Balka was five-and-a-half months pregnant, she was sent to the Clayton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia for a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession. As her pregnancy was high-risk, she was housed in the jail's infirmary. On the night of 18 April 2012 she started experiencing nausea and stomach pain and called for medical assistance. According to her attorney, Mike Mills, and her two cell mates, her cries for help were not only ignored but, she was warned to shut up or else the entire ward would be put on lockdown.</p> <p>Suddenly, DeShawn was screaming and her two cellmates began banging on their cell door. When the guard in charge finally came to her aid, she was found sitting on the toilet in tears. An <a href=\"http://www.news-daily.com/news/2012/jun/27/former-inmate-sues-county-over-dead-baby/\">investigation report issued by the Clayton County Sheriff's office</a> describes in a rather chilling manner, their version of what happened next:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When Sergeant Mayo got to cell&#xa0;3508&#xa0;she saw Inmate Balka sitting on the toilet crying. Sergeant Mayo told Inmate Balka to stand up so she could help the baby. Inmate Balka refused saying it hurt too much to stand. Sergeant Mayo finally convinced Inmate Balka to stand and when she did, Sergeant Mayo observed a baby face down in the toilet. Sergeant Mayo then grabbed the baby and held its face out of the water until medical arrived. LPN Eugene Andry responded and removed the baby from the toilet and started CPR.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It was too late, of course: the baby, Inyx O'Neil Balka, was never to get a shot at living, and his mother is now suing the county for neglect. The county in turn (<a href=\"http://www.correctionsone.com/correctional-healthcare/articles/5909609-AJC-investigates-inmate-care-for-expectant-mothers/\">via their investigation report</a>) deny any wrongdoing. Whatever the outcome of the lawsuit, the case highlights the inherent dangers of placing pregnant women in prison \u2013 and the complete lack of any program or protocol to cater to their particular needs, never mind their unborn babies' welfare, once they get there.</p> <p>Thanks to the war on drugs, and a general 30-year-long incarceration binge, the number of women in prison has increased by over 400%, to the point where America can now make the not-so-proud boast of having the largest female prison population in the world. The vast majority of these women are not only non-violent first-time offenders, they are frequently the victims of violence themselves, and their crimes are often crimes of addiction, either stealing to buy the substance of that addiction, or simply being caught in possession of it. Needless to mention, women of color are far more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts.</p> <p>Yet, however deserving of jail time convicted women may or may not be, their unborn children have done nothing to earn a prison sentence. And they, at the very least, deserve the chance to good-quality pre- and post-natal care, as well as a dignified birth.</p> <p>For most babies born in prison, these inalienable rights are little more than a pipe dream. In 2010, the National Women's Law Center and the Rebecca Project <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/mothers-behind-bars-state-state-report-card-and-analysis-federal-policies-conditions-confin\">issued a report called Mothers behind Bars</a>, a state-by-state report card on the treatment of incarcerated pregnant women and their babies. The report graded each state on three areas: pre-natal care, shackling policies and alternatives to incarceration. Even by the low standard of care for inmates one comes to expect from the US prison system, the conclusions are shocking.</p> <p>Nearly half the states received an overall failing grade, and over two thirds received a failing grade for their lack of pre-natal care. Forty-nine out of 50 states fail to even report all incarcerated women's pregnancies and their outcomes; 43 states do not require medical examinations as a component of pre-natal care; and 36 states still engage in the barbaric practice of shackling pregnant women, often with ankle, wrist and belly chains, before, after and sometimes even during labor.</p> <p>The state of Georgia received an overall D Grade and an F for pre-natal care. This is ironic considering that, around the same time the report was released, the Georgia state legislature were trying to pass one of those now infamous \"personhood\" bills that would have awarded the fetus more rights than the mother carrying it, and would have mandated that any suspect miscarriages be investigated as potential \"pre-natal murder\". <a href=\"http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/fulltext/hb1.htm\">That bizarre bill</a>, thankfully, did not pass. Unfortunately, the state's apparent reverence for the unborn child did not extend to those unwittingly enmeshed in its criminal justice system.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important revelation of the report, though, was what there is no national standard of care, or even a national set of guidelines to help prison officials deal with a problem that clearly falls outside their normal competence. Prisons were not designed to be pre-natal care clinics, labor wards or nurseries. Apparently, this fairly obvious fact has never occurred to any of the government legislators who decided that throwing more women in prison for longer periods was an appropriate way of addressing our social ills; nor do they appear concerned about the innocent children who have suffered as a result.</p> <p>DeShawn Balka is not the only woman in the state of Georgia currently mourning the loss of her child after an unnecessary prison term. Taylor Hogan also lost her baby in a Georgia jail when she was just 24-weeks pregnant. Hogan, who has also filed a lawsuit, claims to have been shackled before and after her baby died. Both of these women were in prison on trivial misdemeanor charges. The time and money the state wasted on their incarceration could have done far more good had they been invested in the disadvantaged communities that provide the US with the bulk of their prison population.</p> <p>The best way to avoid similar tragedies, of course, is to stop needlessly sending women, especially pregnant women, to prison. But if the state is going to do so, one would hope it would take a tad more seriously its moral obligation to ensure that innocent babies are not neglected or harmed.</p>",
  "<p>Colin Farrell is giving someone a right ticking-off, gesticulating with one hand and prodding him in the chest with the index finger of the other. The fellow, a reporter, seems embarrassed but doesn't object; several pokes later he retreats into another room. Farrell follows him, maintaining a frown and daggering the man with suspicious glances. We're both here, in a Mexican hotel, to interview the actor, who is promoting his new film. Farrell has been chipper all day. I wonder what's got his goat.</p> <p>A while later, when I sit down with him, he looks at me aghast. \"Can you fuckin' believe what he said?\" he asks with eyebrows arched. I presume he's referring to the poking scene and confess I don't know what was said. What is it, Colin? \"Well, I couldn't believe it,\" he continues. \"He said that I had a patchwork family. The cheek of it. That's no way to talk about another man's family.\"</p> <p>One can see why Farrell objects to the term, although upon investigation I discover that the offender was German, and that the phrase \"patchwork family\" carries no negative connotations in his native tongue. It's simply a rather neat expression for a family in which the children are born to different parents. The German media regularly employs it as an idiom for Brad and Angelina's brood, for example, and that family is revered. Farrell, however, was not to know.</p> <p>The 36-year-old Dubliner has two sons \u2013 James, born to American model Kim Bordenave in 2003, and Henry, born in 2009 to Polish actor Alicja Bachleda, his co-star in the film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/134880/ondine\" title=\"\"><em>Ondine</em></a>. He's sensitive when talking about his kids, prompted in part by the fact that he was still partying hard when James was a toddler. [James was born with a rare form of cerebral palsy called Angelman Syndrome.] He feels pangs of guilt.</p> <p>\"My first-born was three years of age before I made anything that I would even pretend was a mature decision,\" he says. \"So I can't say that fatherhood immediately changed me. But I'm different to what I was yesterday, and life is quieter now for me than it was a few years ago. I'm cool with that. I love my kids. I'm crazy about them.\"</p> <p>He leans in when he talks, and whispers conspiratorially. It makes you wonder if you're privy to secret information, or whether he simply doesn't want anyone else to hear what he's saying \u2013 because there is another presence in the room. A small, smartly dressed lady is sitting quietly in the corner. She is not clicking away on a BlackBerry, so she can't be a publicist. She entered with Farrell and, if I'm honest, looks like she might be his mum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395168355\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/20/1345480985962/Colin-Farrell-in-Total-Re-008.jpg\" alt=\"Colin Farrell in Total Recall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Farrell in the remake of Total Recall. Photograph: Michael Gibson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Gibson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"So, anyway,\" Farrell whispers, breaking my reverie, \"things have changed. I am happier, more settled now.\" Farrell is here to talk about the big-budget remake of the 1990 sci-fi hit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\"><em>Total Recall</em></a>, in which he takes on the role of Quaid, famously delivered with a string of one-liners by Arnold Schwarzenegger in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/80204/total-recall\" title=\"\">the original film</a>. The Irishman has been here for a few days already, and while most stars hide away, Farrell has been a constant presence at the resort, where large numbers of stars mingle with journalists at the poolside, and at the few parties that spring up each evening.</p> <p>\"All this stuff that has happened over the last couple of days, it's crazy,\" he tells me. \"There is a lot of energy and it's brilliant to be part of it because I know that back in the day I would have dragged myself through this and been as loud as hell, smoking two cigarettes at once and being really obnoxious. But that's not part of my life now and I'm glad.\"</p> <p>Farrell's journeys through obnoxiousness \u2013 fuelled at various stages by heroin, cocaine and alcohol \u2013 have been well documented, and the actor himself has proved a good sport when talking about his troubles. His hilarious admissions on <em>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross</em>,<em> </em>when he confessed he failed to bed septuagenarian Dame Eileen Atkins and offered the truth about his internet 2008 sex tape, are a case in point.</p> <p>\"It's helped to stay away from cocaine and whisky,\" he says, smiling, when we touch on past misdemeanours. \"Life moves in cycles. I'm not going to say there was a particular day or time [when things changed], or even that I'm a different man. I enjoy the work more, I enjoy being a dad more, I enjoy doing things that I never thought I'd enjoy.\" Like what? \"Like yoga,\" he says.</p> <p>Yoga, parenting or enjoying his work, the moves are paying off \u2013 <em>Total Recall</em> is the actor's first big-budget Hollywood picture since 2006's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/111697/miami.vice\" title=\"\"><em>Miami Vice</em></a>. It was after that film wrapped that Farrell checked into rehab, back in December 2005. \"Everything is by design, even if you think it's not,\" he says. \"I can't say that I sat down and said, 'Right, I am going to reinvest.' I know from talking to some friends and different people that it looks as though I've tried to redesign my career but it's not really like that.\"</p> <p>His last blockbusters were both commercial misfires. Oliver Stone's 2004 swords-and-sandals epic, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/102280/alexander\" title=\"\"><em>Alexander</em></a>, in which Farrell tackled the lead role, earned less than $35m at the US box office (against a production budget of around $150m), while Michael Mann's neon-hued <em>Miami Vice</em> fell short of the $65m mark in the States (it cost $135m to make). Farrell's subsequent films were smaller affairs: <em>Cassandra's Dream</em>, <em>Pride and Glory</em>, <em>Ondine</em>. He was on fine form in the blackly comic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/apr/20/thriller.comedy\" title=\"\"><em>In Bruges</em></a>, and also on song in <em>Crazy Heart</em>. More recent outings \u2013 the likes of <em>London Boulevard</em> and <em>Fright Night</em> \u2013 have gone largely unnoticed.</p> <p>\"I had signed up to do quite a few of those films before I went away to rehab after <em>Miami Vice</em>,\" he says of his independent output, \"but I had also done a certain amount of big budget films that didn't perform that well. Consequently, there weren't that many big films that were coming knocking for me.</p> <p>\"I was probably due an arse kicking,\" he continues. \"I really was. I was having too much fun and being too loud about it. I'm not saying that my hand was totally forced but, of the work that then presented itself, I did the most interesting jobs. They were not all particularly good films, and not of all them worked. <em>Cassandra's Dream</em> didn't do so well and <em>Pride and Glory</em> didn't do so well, critically. But then <em>In Bruges</em> did. No one saw <em>Ondine</em>, but I love it.\"</p> <p>The design, to which Farrell earlier referred, now begins to emerge. The actor, as we've seen, cannot identify an epiphany moment, a day where his life turned around, but by shooting smaller films he edged out of the spotlight and, as a consequence, sidled away from many of the pleasures and temptations that follow in its shadow. Whether he sought it or not, the actor has finally found time to work out what he really wants.</p> <p>\"It was a good thing for me to step away from the attention that comes with bigger films,\" he concedes, \"because it really did mean that I could focus and not get distracted by the energy that sometimes surrounds big films. This might sound a superficial way to put it, but one of the worst things in life is to be ignored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395168356\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/20/1345481091948/-Colin-Farrell-and-mother-001.jpg\" alt=\" Colin Farrell and mother\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colin Farrell and his mum, Rita.

I'm not going to that drastic place, but to not be paid that much attention, as I was for a while for a few years, it makes you go, 'OK, so I'm not wondering what people are thinking of me, because they're not thinking of me. So what the fuck do I think of myself?\"'</p> <p>His brown eyes narrow. \"You know what I mean?\" I suppose so. \"So I am living with me more now. You can get caught up with everyone patting you on the back, and some people slagging you off. I am not saying I was ignored and that people didn't answer my phone calls, but it was chaos for seven or eight years.\"</p> <p>The chaos kicked off in the wake of <em>Tigerland</em>, his 2000 breakout that earned him a London Critics' Circle award for British Newcomer of the Year in 2001. He'd already enjoyed some success, having \"fallen into an acting class\" when he was 17, and then snaffled the role of Danny Byrne on the BBC series <em>Ballykissangel</em>. His world started to change.</p> <p>\"When I look back,\" he says, \"my mates \u2013 one installs kitchens and bars in restaurants, one works in a clothes shop \u2013 they knew I had no education and that I was a bit of a mouth and so it made sense to them that I would end up acting. I was always, 'Me, me, me!' wanting to be the centre of attention. It was fun, though, and it was a big deal, being on TV.\"</p> <p>Farrell was born in Dublin, in 1976, the youngest of four, to a father who played football for Shamrock Rovers \u2013 a dream that his youngest son shared, for a while at least. \"My dad was a good player,\" remembers Farrell. \"He played left-half \u2013 and for Ireland. The position doesn't exist today so I guess he'd be somewhere between midfield and a sweeper, him and his brother Tommy. It was what I wanted to do until I was about 14, but then you smoke too many joints and drink too many cans of beer and I really couldn't be arsed with training on Tuesday. I wanted it more in the mind than the heart, but I love the game still.\"</p> <p>He doesn't play football any more but says he feels healthy these days. He was fit and strong before he started work on <em>Alexander</em>, he notes, but was still drinking at the time.</p> <p>\"Yet before <em>Total Recall</em> I felt really strong,\" he says. \"I work out a lot now so I feel pretty fit.\" He doesn't mind recalling the dark days of inebriation and sexual industriousness, because he \"can talk about it objectively. I feel so far away from that, experientially, now. And the rise that I had from the point of <em>Tigerland</em> through all these films, and the money I had thrown at me, and the beds I ended up in, it was crazy.\" It's many blokes' dream, I note, being romantically linked to the likes of Britney Spears, Demi Moore or any one of the more glamorous yet lesser-known models. \"I know, and the fact that I got to experience that was amazing. But I am glad it is done.\"</p> <p>So what's the plan now that he has been welcomed back into the Hollywood fold? \"Well, I have no chip on my shoulder about 'big films are shit' or 'I will do one for them, one for me,'\" he says. \"I'm trying to make things as singular to me as possible. 'What does it mean to my family and me and what do I have to compromise?' If I know why I'm getting into something there's very little compromise to be had. If I do another film with the same scope as <em>Total Recall</em>, I will work just as hard.\"</p> <p>Directed by Len Wiseman (who made <em>Underworld</em> and <em>Live Free or Die Hard</em>), and co-starring Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel, <em>Total Recall </em>draws on the same source material as the 1990 Schwarzenegger film \u2013 the short story <em>We Can Remember It For You Wholesale</em> by Philip K Dick \u2013 although it is bidding to be a darker and more atmospheric action film, eschewing any camp japery.</p> <p>\"When I heard the word that they were remaking <em>Total Recall</em>, I thought, 'Is it really worth it, and what are they going to say about the original?' But I read it and it was a good script. It seems that dystopian worlds create more drama and while I wouldn't say the original film was cheesy, it was camp. You put a bullet in your wife's head and you say,\" he imitates Arnie, 'Consider that a divorce!' I mean, that was good. That was very good. But it's camp and this one is tonally different. It does play as a drama, which just happens to be set in the backdrop of these magnificent cityscapes and these really elaborate action scenes.\"</p> <p>One suspects that Farrell's next films won't be much cheerier. After <em>Total Recall</em> he went straight into <em>Seven Psychopaths</em>, the second feature from <em>In Bruges</em> writer-director Martin McDonagh. \"It has mad amounts of violence, blood and profanity, and no shortage of racist and homophobic things. Oh man!\"</p> <p>Tomorrow he's flying out to start work on <em>Dead Man Down</em> with Noomi Rapace, for director Niels Arden Oplev, who shot the Swedish-language version of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131882/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo\" title=\"\"><em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em></a>. \"It's also dark, heavy stuff. There's not any laughter in it at all really.\"</p> <p>At this point the small, smartly dressed lady who's been sitting in the corner suddenly appears at the actor's elbow. \"This is my mum,\" says Farrell, confirming my earlier suspicion. \"She's here to make sure you don't write anything mean,\" he half-jokes. His mum, Rita, then fixes me with a steely look and offers an inscrutable smile. I say my goodbyes and hope that she likes the piece.</p> <p>\u2022 Total Recall<em> is released on 29 August</em></p>",
  "<p>The director of the gripping Belfast-set thriller <em>Shadow Dancer</em>, James Marsh, and its screenwriter, Tom Bradby, both have one foot in fact and the other in fiction. Marsh is best known for his imaginative feature-length documentaries, <em>Man on Wire</em>, which won an Oscar in 2009, and <em>Project Nim</em>, as well as his TV film <em>Red Riding: 1980</em>. The TV journalist and novelist Bradby reported from Northern Ireland for ITN in the 1990s, the setting of <em>Shadow Dancer</em>, the first of his six thrillers. Their film centres on the perennially interesting relationship between the spy or informer or undercover agent and the person in authority who controls them. The characters are trapped between the complicated moral realities around them and the fictions that fate imposes on them, and the situation goes back at least as far as Joseph Conrad's <em>The Secret Agent</em> more than a century ago. But the two films that most immediately came to my mind on seeing <em>Shadow Dancer</em> both appeared shortly after the second world war. The first is Hitchcock's masterly <em>Notorious</em>, where FBI agent Cary Grant blackmails guilt-ridden Ingrid Bergman into infiltrating a Nazi spy ring in Rio. The second, written and directed by two former Hitchcock associates, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, is the comedy-thriller <em>I See a Dark Stranger</em>, starring Deborah Kerr as an Irish girl raised to hate the English, who tries to join the IRA, is recruited by Nazis and ends up being turned by a British intelligence officer.</p> <p>The first 20 minutes of <em>Shadow Dancer</em> are a textbook demonstration of visual storytelling with minimal dialogue. On a Belfast estate in 1973 the 12-year-old Colette McVeigh is told by her father to run to the shops and buy him a pack of fags. Otherwise occupied, she passes the errand to her little brother. There's a commotion outside involving soldiers and civilians, and the boy's dead body is carried into the parlour, killed in the crossfire. The father closes the door on the guilt-ridden Colette, and the film jumps 20 years to London, 1993. The now adult Colette (Andrea Riseborough) is gingerly carrying a case on the underground. We don't need to be told it contains a bomb. She leaves it on a staircase and dashes away, making her escape via an emergency exit, climbing a dark narrow shaft that resemblances an entrance to hell. Scarcely a word has been spoken when she's arrested by two strong-arm men in a back street, driven to an anonymous destination and handed over to an MI5 agent, a commanding figure identified only as \"Mac\" (Clive Owen). He starts manipulating her from the moment he tells her that her brother was actually shot by an IRA bullet. Then he gives her a choice \u2013 to go to jail for 25 years for carrying the bomb and be separated from her small son, or return to her family as a police informer with Mac as her controller.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-394408207\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/8/SDTrailer-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/8/SDTrailer_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/8/SDTrailer_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/SDTrailer/SDTrailer.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>This crisp, economic opening, a remarkable combination of the stylised and the realistic, takes us into the deeply divided world of Belfast. This is the time when the peace process is about to begin. John Major is bringing a hopeful new voice, both literally and figuratively, to the proceedings after the intransigence of Thatcher. But after a quarter of a century the Troubles have become a way of life, and they've shaped and distorted the three generations of the McVeigh family who share the same council house. At the head is the worn, worried, widowed mother (a performance of painful sadness from Brid Brennan). Then there are her two sons, the truculent Gerry (Aidan Gillen) and the sad Connor (Domhnall Gleeson), both committed IRA gunmen, and their sister Colette, and the rising generation represented by Colette's little son Mark, already showing beneath the childish surface the effects of a clouded upbringing. The film brilliantly captures a twilight world of violence and suspicion, dominated by the IRA's Kevin Mulville (David Wilmot), a ruthless zealot enforcing discipline and constantly searching for traitors.</p> <p>The other side of the coin is represented by a divided law enforcement system. MI5, the Special Branch, the SAS and the RUC appear to be at odds with one another, conducting their own policies and not sharing information. \"Relax, we're all in this together,\" the cool senior MI5 officer (Gillian Anderson) tells the decent, principled Mac, though the nature of \"this\" is unclear. Is it the furtherance of national interests and the pursuit of a just settlement? Or is it an unholy, insoluble mess and the confused human condition? After the simple, lucid start, the film becomes a labyrinthine tale of cat and mouse, of deception and double cross, of betrayal and confused allegiances. There are exciting clandestine meetings and exposures narrowly diverted. There's a magnificently staged stand-off between the IRA and the RUC in a narrow terraced street during which the former stage a defiant, impromptu military funeral for a terrorist.</p> <p>The acting is excellent, especially the central performance of Andrea Riseborough, who manages to express Colette's doubts and anxieties while retaining a core of moral mystery. There is a mortifying final revelation towards which the film's title enigmatically points. But nothing is quite as good as the film's opening sequences, and the movie is a little too dogged in avoiding substantive politics. As Kevin Rockett, Luke Gibbons and John Hill observed in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/businessandfinance/9780415026550/cinema-and-ireland\" title=\"\"><em>Cinema and Ireland</em></a>, first published back in 1987 and still the best book on the subject, British films about Ireland have mostly \"opted to focus on Irish violence while failing to place it in the social and political context which would permit its explanation. And, by doing so, they too have rendered the events with which they deal largely unintelligible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stand on Blue Bell Hill, a grassy mound high above Nottingham, and it is easy to understand the city's appeal to television dramatists.</p> <p>All human life lies below. In the distance squats the city centre, framed by ugly 1960s office blocks and concrete car parks, its skyline dominated by the Gothic spires of imposing redbrick Victorian buildings. Here, <em>Get Carter</em> meets <em>Harry Potter</em>. This cityscape will become familiar to television viewers tonight in a BBC2 crime drama, <em>Murder</em>, which was filmed in parts of Nottingham. Directed by Birger Larsen, the man behind the acclaimed Danish drama <em>The Killing</em>, <em>Murder</em> is promising to bring Scandinavian noir to the east Midlands.</p> <p>It is not difficult to imagine Nottinghamshire's answer to detective Sarah Lund feeling at home in the city. At night Nottingham's canals and its warehouses look like backdrops to <em>The Killing</em>, which made extensive use of location shots of Copenhagen's waterfront.</p> <p>It's also easy to imagine Troels Hartmann, <em>The Killing'</em>s charismatic mayor, living in one of the penthouse flats overlooking the city's Victoria Gardens. The low buildings that once comprised the old Lace Market would make a suitably cavernous warren to hide a body or two.</p> <p>However, while Oxford's residents were never going to be worried about what the body count in <em>Morse</em> would do for the reputation of their city, not everyone in Nottingham is happy about the subject matter of the drama. <em>Murder</em> is a gritty affair that will pick at the scab of Nottingham's troubled past. Such was the city's reputation for violence a decade ago, it was known as Shottingham. A former shadow home secretary, David Davis, declared that Nottingham was reminiscent of 1930s Chicago. Some of the city's wards, notably St Ann's, were once perceived as no-go areas.</p> <p>\"I first came to St Ann's on a date six years ago,\" said Paula Cargill, a community outreach worker who lives in the city. \"I said to [my date]: 'I want to get out alive.' There had been stuff in the press that put me off. It made it sound like it was gun capital around here.\"</p> <p>Cargill recalled a time of postcode wars between rival gangs. \"It was quite blatant,\" she said. \"There would be young boys going round with one trouser leg rolled up to show they were in a particular gang.\"</p> <p>Much of the violence was down to two brothers, Colin and David Gunn, whose Bestwood Cartel dominated the city, even paying police officers to act as informants. Today the Gunns are behind bars, money and resources have lifted once troubled parts like St Ann's, and Nottingham is no longer known as \"assassination city\".</p> <p>Even that reputation was unfairly earned, say local councillors who claim it was based on an incorrect interpretation of statistics.</p> <p>Since 2003 Nottingham's crime rate has fallen by 60%, according to Labour councillor Alex Norris. But <em>Murder</em> now threatens to dredge up the city's dark past. \"Like any big city, we still have problems, but we are worried the series is perpetuating a myth,\" Norris said.</p> <p>Larsen has not helped to ease anxieties. He explained that he filmed the drama through a red filter, to help capture what he saw was the predominant mood in the city. \"We used the colour of blood,\" he said. \"I don't know Nottingham, so it was a huge surprise to me when I went there for the exterior filming we did. I sensed this hostile vibe.\"</p> <p>The comments provoked alarm at the city's council, which wrote to the BBC seeking to correct the impression. But the damage may have been done. The city's tourism office confirmed it had received \"lots of emails\" from people alarmed by Larsen's comments. Stephan Richeux, the council's media manager, said he hoped visitors would be able to separate fact from fiction. \"Wollaton Hall featured in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, but kids don't expect to go there and see Batman,\" he said.</p> <p>Erin Huckle, PR manager for Experience Notts, which promotes the city, moved to Nottingham a year ago having lived in Sydney, perennially voted one of the world's great cities to live in. She pointed out that Nottingham has been awarded a Purple Flag \u2013 given to city centres considered safe at night \u2013 for the third year in a row. \"It's such a friendly city, but the mud sticks,\" she said.</p> <p>Norris expressed hope that the drama could even be good for tourism in the long run \u2013 he pointed out that visits to Malm\u00f6 in Sweden rose after the screening of another Scandinavian murder drama, <em>The Bridge</em>.</p> <p>But a killing a couple of weeks ago in one of the city's wards, Sneinton, offered a reminder that Nottingham will always have its problems. The local paper on Friday carried several stories about armed robberies and street attacks.</p> <p>In 2010 Nottinghamshire had the third-highest crime rate of the 43 forces in England and Wales. Last year HM Inspectorate of Constabulary sent in an elite investigation unit after declaring it had \"significant concerns\" about the performance of Nottinghamshire police.</p> <p>And this is before most of the city's budget cuts kick in. Norris suggested that Nottingham had been able to shed its gangster image because of extensive public spending between 1997 and 2010 on schools, infrastructure and the police. \"Now we've got to find \u00a3115m in cuts over the next five years,\" he said. \"I'm worried things could roll back.\"</p> <p>This fear is implicit in the city's wary reaction to <em>Murder</em>. It is not its past that Nottingham is worried about so much as its future.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, George Hayford, an IT consultant from London who visits Nottingham regularly, was enjoying the fun fair in the city's Market Square. \"The first time I came to this place was eight years ago,\" he said. \"I tried to get a taxi from the station but not one of them would take me. Turned out some taxi drivers had been robbed on previous nights. So \u2026\"</p> <p>His voice tailed off. A classic Rolls-Royce was decanting a bride at the town hall. A busker broke into Here Comes the Sun. Children queued for candyfloss. Hayford gestured at the fair. \"It's got a whole lot better since then.\"</p>",
  "<p>The metropolitan cathedral church of St Andrew in Glasgow will never be regarded as the most ornate piece of episcopal architecture the world has ever seen. Built in 1816 on the north bank of the River Clyde at a time when the Catholic faith in Scotland was in the process of re-establishing itself after more than two centuries of persecution, it is not magnificent, but handsome.</p> <p>In keeping with the status of the church at that time it is also modest, taciturn and unprepossessing. There are no gargoyles with lolling tongues, nor bearded saints, and no serpents being crushed under the dainty heel of the virgin queen of heaven. There is, dare I say it, Presbyterian rectitude in its masonry. For it is what it is: a Catholic church in a Protestant country.</p> <p>Last year saw the completion of a \u00a35m facelift for the cathedral, and though the work was long overdue, I cannot have been alone in wondering if the archdiocese of Glasgow had slightly lost the plot when we all got to view the finished product. The renovation included an expensive gold leaf restoration and the installation of specially commissioned bronze doors.</p> <p>A new painting by the acclaimed Glasgow artist <a href=\"http://www.peterhowson.co.uk/Press.aspx#\" title=\"\">Peter Howson</a> was also commissioned to hang over the altar. This depicted the martyrdom of St John Ogilvie in 1615 at nearby Glasgow Cross and, well\u2026 perhaps after many visits you may acquire a taste for it all. I was expecting something a little less gaudy than all these trinkets, but perhaps I am being churlish and unduly&#xa0;rebarbative.</p> <p>To complement all this Mediterranean rouge, something called an Italian <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-13400727\" title=\"\">memorial garden</a> was landscaped on a plot beside the cathedral. This was dedicated to the hundred or so Scots-Italians who died when their ship, the Arandora Star, was sunk by a German U-boat near Ireland in 1940. An Italian choir was flown over to help inaugurate the garden and there was an opera singer to add a bit more drama to the pantomime.</p> <p>Not half a mile east of our new painted cathedral lie some of the most deprived and troubled streets in Europe. This neighbourhood is home to tens of thousands of Catholics of Irish descent whose antecedents flooded into Glasgow in the decades that followed the construction of the cathedral. Most had fled disease and starvation from Ireland's great famine to find refuge in Glasgow. And it was their labours and ill-afforded financial contributions that set the archdiocese of Glasgow on a sound footing.</p> <p>A memorial commemorating <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)\" title=\"\">an Gorta M\u00f3r</a> and its place in Glasgow's history would have been a much more fitting monument than this Italian vanity project. The only gold leaf they ever saw was the name on the side of their grandfathers' favourite tobacco for their rolled cigarettes. The entire cathedral restoration project, though, is simply the physical manifestation of something that has been evident for a few years now; that the Catholic church in Scotland is losing touch with reality.</p> <p>Further credence was given to this view when the church announced that it was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9486603/Scottish-government-faces-wall-of-silence-from-church-over-gay-marriage.html\" title=\"\">ceasing all official dialogue</a> with the Scottish government over the issue of same-sex marriage. Having lost the battle to prevent such unions becoming law, the Catholic hierarchy, like a drunk man trying to get past wine bar bouncers on a Friday night, keeps coming back for more. As such, it is blind to the potential consequences of its absurd obsession with homosexual unions. These will be far more damaging than the prospect of a few hundred gay people upgrading their civil partnership to a marriage.</p> <p>The church's opposition to gay marriage is entirely valid and rooted in the central role that the sacrament of matrimony plays in Christian life. It has every right to express its opposition and not to be branded homophobic by Scotland's liberal fundamentalists. What started, though, as reasonable opposition to proposed legislation with which it fundamentally disagreed has become a bitter and spittle-flecked campaign.</p> <p>Thus we had the unedifying sight of the church's director of communications appearing to espouse the absurd view that homosexuals, by dint of their wretched lifestyle, have a shorter life expectancy than other people. This followed the revelation that the new archbishop of Glasgow had suggested that the untimely death, at 44, of David Cairns, the Scots Labour MP and former priest, had somehow been linked to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/archbishop-of-glasgow-gay-mp\" title=\"\">a gay lifestyle</a>. We were then treated to a grotesque Monty Python vignette involving one of Glasgow's most senior priests, a skinful of the old altar wine and some clumsy (and unwanted) advances toward his male dining companion. It seems the poor chap had merely forgotten himself in the bevvy and succumbed to his inner Quentin Crisp.</p> <p>There are districts of Glasgow where <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143850/Glasgow-neighbourhood-9-10-adults-welfare-crowned-benefits-capital-Britain.html\" title=\"\">nine out of 10 adults</a> are on benefits and which top all those international league tables which measure the indicators of multi-deprivation. The obscenity of poverty strikes at the very heart of the Christian message that all men are created equal. This inequality cries out to God for vengeance much more than a few hundred gay people who want to have their union endorsed by a marriage certificate.</p> <p>The Catholic church in Scotland enjoys many rights earned by hard-working men and women at a time when their faith was under attack. Among them are the right to educate its children, on the state's account, in separate Catholic schools and the right to veto the appointment of teachers in these schools if their beliefs are deemed contrary to the Catholic ethos.</p> <p>Others might suggest that, in a pluralist and secular state, there should be no room for privileges such as these. Yet there is a small cabal of ultras in my church, who, distressingly, enjoy far too much influence in its affairs. Their actions, words and attitude are in danger of provoking a backlash which would seek to withdraw its privileges.</p> <p>There is something rotten at the heart of the Catholic church in Scotland right now and I fear that it is about to engulf it.</p>",
  "<p>Th e first official assessment of human trafficking in the UK reveals the increasingly diverse reasons people are being smuggled into the country, including domestic servitude, sexual and criminal exploitation, and organ harvesting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.soca.gov.uk/about-soca/about-the-ukhtc\" title=\"\">The United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre's</a> 2011 baseline assessment concludes that 11% of victims were trafficked for the purposes of domestic servitude; 1% for organ harvesting; 5% for multiple exploitation; 17% for criminal exploitation; 22% for labour exploitation; and 31% for sexual exploitation. The remaining 13% were trafficked for reasons unknown.</p> <p>The report, which is compiled from information submitted by police forces, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, the UK Border Agency and other organisations, suggests that last year some 2,077 potential victims of human trafficking were identified in the UK.</p> <p>The picture that emerges contrasts strongly with the popular perception that trafficking is predominantly for the purposes of prostitution.</p> <p>The assessment revealed that, \"for the first time, two potential victims reported that they had been trafficked specifically for organ harvesting,\" and noted a third person was also suspected to have been trafficked for such a purpose.</p> <p>According to the UKHTC, \"the illegal trade is dominated by kidneys, which are in the greatest demand and are the only major organs that can be wholly transplanted with relatively few risks to the life of the donor\".</p> <p>Klara Skrivankova, Anti-Slavery International's trafficking programme co-ordinator, said: \"The UKHTC 2011's assessment shows that more than 50% of trafficking in the UK happens for purposes other than sexual exploitation.</p> <p>\"The prevalence of trafficking for forced labour in industries like agriculture, construction or food processing is a problem we have been pointing to for a number of years. It is important that the law enforcement authorities now increase efforts to arrest those who profit from forced labour and ensure that all victims of trafficking see their exploiters brought to justice.\"</p> <p>The five most common countries of origin for victims of trafficking were Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Nigeria.</p> <p>The assessment reported evidence that 99 UK citizens were trafficked within the UK last year, of whom 52 were trafficked for sexual exploitation, with more than 80% identified as female children. However, an <em>Observer</em> analysis of trafficking figures recorded by the Serious and Organised Crime Agency's National Referral Mechanism database provides an alternative snapshot.</p> <p>Between 1 April 2009, when the database started recording trafficked incidents, until March 2012, the latest set of figures available, some 2,445 people were suspected, or were found, to have been trafficked into the UK.</p> <p>The figures reveal 1,566 were female, 596 were male and the remainder were children. Some 431 people were believed to have been trafficked from Nigeria, compared with 255 from Vietnam, the second most active trafficker of people to the UK. China was the third largest trafficker, responsible for bringing a suspected 224 people to the UK.</p> <p>Europol, the international police agency, has identified Nigerian organised crime as one of the largest law enforcement challenges to European governments. In many cases, Nigerian victims are trafficked after a friend or family member offers a child a chance for a better life abroad.</p> <p>On accepting the offer, the victim will have a \"juju\" ceremony performed by a witchdoctor to ensure success in their new life. Victims fear they will be magically harmed should they report their plight to the authorities, meaning the true scale of the abuse remains hidden.</p> <p>A 2010 report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre identified the trafficking of Vietnamese children into the UK as another key trend. The majority were forced to work in cannabis farms, with others being exploited in brothels and nail bars, or pressed into committing street crimes such as selling illegally copied DVDs or breaking and entering.</p> <p>The UKHTC assessment found many trafficked victims were told that they owed debts of up to \u20ac70,000 (\u00a355,400) for their travel costs. It notes: \"They are then subjected to labour exploitation, sexual exploitation or criminal exploitation until they are perceived to have repaid their debt. In some cases, the debt increases through a combination of high costs for food and accommodation and low wages, and the victim is unable to reduce or repay the money owed.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the trays of cheese and wine begin to circulate for this autumn's book launch season, one of the UK's biggest publishing houses will be pinning its hopes not on a hardback, but on an app designed for tablet computers.</p> <p>Alongside celebrity autobiographies from Victoria Pendleton and Cheryl Cole, and John Major's history of music&#xa0;hall, HarperCollins will be unveiling a digital reinvention of the <em>Collins World Atlas</em>. \"It's the culmination of years of work, and it's going to be really ground-breaking,\" says Victoria Barnsley, UK and international chief executive of the book publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.</p> <p>The app presents a collection of globes suspended in space. One shows a satellite view; others are themed by population, energy or telecommunications. A few swipes, and the world lights up according to which areas have mobile coverage, or consume most oil. The information is, of course, always up to date.</p> <p>\"We can't think of ourselves as book publishers any longer. We have to see ourselves as, you know,\" Barnsley hesitates to use the clich\u00e9, \"multimedia content producers.\"</p> <p>Her flower-scented Hammersmith office, with its plush upholstery and charcoal-grey walls so dark the eyes have to adjust, is a world away from the warehouses across town on east London's Silicon Roundabout, where most new digital products are being produced.</p> <p>But HarperCollins appears to have wholeheartedly embraced the e-book revolution that followed the arrival of Amazon's Kindle reader in the UK in 2009. Barnsley predicts that within 18 months, over half of revenues from her fiction titles will be digital: they already are in America. While sales of HarperCollins's paper books are flat year on year at about \u00a3120m, according to Nielsen Bookscan, digital titles are up 250% and now account for 20% of UK income.</p> <p>With self-published <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> author EL James as its poster child, romantic fiction is by far the biggest-selling digital category. Nearly half of sales at HarperCollins's Avon imprint, which specialises in the genre, are now in e-book format. It has responded with a me-too <em>50 Ways to Play</em> and the revival of a 10-year-old title, <em>The Bride Stripped Bare</em>, but more importantly with \"dynamic pricing\".</p> <p>Barnsley's biggest new signing is not a Booker prizewinner, but a Spanish data analyst: she refers to Eloy Sasot, recruited from American Express, as her \"secret weapon\". His team monitors sales around the clock, making the discounts or mark-ups needed to stay ahead of the competition.</p> <p>This is all possible because of the controversial \"agency deal\" system created by HarperCollins and four other majors to curb Amazon's relentless discounting. It means publishers rather than retailers now set the prices of e-books.</p> <p>Agency deals kicked in two years ago and their impact has been significant in the US: Amazon, which had controlled 90% of e-book sales thanks in part to low prices, has been pushed back. Bricks and mortar retailer Barnes &amp; Noble, which has just announced the arrival of its Nook e-reader and online bookstore in the UK, was able to grab up to 30% market share. Apple's iTunes is also a major player.The deals had less impact in the UK, where there was no retailer able to take the fight to Amazon, and the online giant still holds an estimated 90% of digital sales.</p> <p>The Nook's UK debut may come too late to change that. publishers could be about to lose their control over pricing because the agency system is under investigation by regulators in Europe and America. HarperCollins has joined others in offering to settle after the US department of justice came down against agency deals. But it has done so through gritted teeth. \"It was the wrong decision,\" says Barnsley. \"It's going to be bad for the industry and bad for competition, but I'm sure we'll survive.\"</p> <p>She has run HarperCollins since 2000, after selling Fourth Estate, the independent publishing house she founded at the age of 30, to News Corporation. \"When I got this job, Ed Victor the literary agent said it was like asking somebody who had sailed a racing dinghy to become captain of the QE2,\" she laughs. But business is in her blood: her father, an accountant, was chief executive of engineering holding company Tube Investments.</p> <p>Married to the Hon Nicholas Howard, whose family seat is Castle Howard in Yorkshire, her early days at HarperCollins were all about the arrival of a new kind of aristocracy: celebrities and their best-selling autobiographies. She paid \u00a32m for David Beckham's.</p> <p>Asked to name the defining books of her HarperCollins career, she turns away to consider her answer. There is Pamela Stephenson's biography of her husband Billy Connolly, which helped start the celebrity publishing phenomenon; Hilary Mantel's recent Oliver Cromwell novel <em>Wolf Hall</em>; and the works of JRR Tolkien, which have found new audiences thanks to Peter Jackson's films.</p> <p>But Barnsley is reluctant to mention any others. \"Singling out authors is a very dangerous thing for a publisher to do,\" she says with a smile.</p> <p>Later years have been marked by the internet, which has led to the demise of the high street bookseller, the increasing clout of the self-published author and the arrival of the e-book.</p> <p>\"It's not been boring. I don't feel I've been doing the same job for 12 years. In some respects, publishing 12 years ago had more in common with publishing in the last century than it has now.\"</p> <p>There have been accolades, including \"publisher of the year\" in May, but one thing that has not changed, despite Barnsley's best efforts, is HarperCollins's UK ranking \u2013 in fourth position behind Penguin, Random House and Hachette.</p> <p>The reorganisation triggered at News Corporation by the phone-hacking scandal could help. The group is to be split in two, with television and film studios in one division and HarperCollins joining the newspapers and the Dow Jones Newswire service in another, where it will stand out as the most profitable business. Barnsley hopes this will mean more focus and more investment.</p> <p>\"I have to say I'm very glad I'm a publisher and not running a newspaper,\" she chuckles. \"What consumers have proved with e-books is they may not be willing to pay as much as for a physical book \u2013 but they will pay for them.\"</p> <p>She is blunt about the fact that publishers' revenues will fall over time: piracy is ever-present, and e-books cost less than paper ones. While no technology company has found a way to replace her role, this is no guarantee of survival.</p> <p>\"The idea that the publishing industry might be destroyed by tech companies is a rather frightening thought. Our job is to work with great authors and it's very important culturally and socially. I can't imagine doing anything different.\"</p>",
  "<p>Regatta is a large gated compound set aside for foreign business executives on the coast west of Tripoli. Most of its homes lie empty, many ransacked by militias, and sand blown in from the seafront forms little dunes on its roads. It wasn't meant to be like this.</p> <p>It is now a year since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, which triggered seemingly endless predictions by the likes of UK defence secretary Philip Hammond that British executives would be \"packing their suitcases\" to share in a reconstruction bonanza. Yet Regatta stubbornly refuses to become anything but a ghost town \u2013 if not a laboured symbol for the state of Libya's business life.</p> <p>\"Nobody is coming back here: it's not safe,\" admits one of the compound's few residents, a German engineer. Those foreign companies that are again operating skeleton staffs say their executives refuse to bring their families.</p> <p>In April, the UK's ambassador to Libya, Sir Dominic Asquith, addressed a delegation of the Libyan British Business Council (LBBC) in Tripoli. The trade body reported to members that he \"spoke vehemently of his surprise and disappointment at British firms' slow response to the business opportunities\".</p> <p>Then in May, UK-listed oil giant Shell added to the sense of disengagement when it said it was abandoning its wells and stopping exploration in Libya. Meanwhile, pumps supplier Weir Group has so far refused to return to Libya \u2013 it had been working on a multimillion-pound power plant refurbishment in Misrata. Oil services firm Wood Group, which last week revealed it had just received a payment of $5.8m (\u00a33.7m) from the new Libyan government for work performed for the previous regime, is also cautious: \"The pattern to look at [to predict how Libya will develop] is Iraq. There was a great deal of discussion about the potential there, but it is only now that people are starting to get engaged.\"</p> <p>However, the LBBC is slightly more positive when addressing the wider world. Director general Robin Lamb insists British firms are keeping their end up: \"Someone said 'where are the Brits?', but we're not lagging behind. There are three branches of Next, branches of BHS, Topshop, M&amp;S\u2026\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395190341\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/24/1345833852046/libya-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"libya map\" width=\"460\" height=\"445\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">libya map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among other hopeful signs is the return of BP \u2013 which announced a deal to explore for Libyan oil in 2007 only to withdraw during the Arab spring. \"We are preparing to pick up our exploration programme where we left off in early 2011 and we've started assigning contracts,\" says a spokesman. \"It will take time to rebuild our capabilities and we don't expect any drilling to start until next year.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, Heritage Oil, a FTSE-250 prospector, has long-term permits and licences to supply the country's oilfields after acquiring a 51% share in oil services group Sahara in October. \"Sahara is active but so far has not generated any revenues,\" the company says. \"We are working on various tenders and have held discussions with senior members of government and state oil companies.\"</p> <p>Still, none of these projects currently looks like forming part of the bonanza envisaged 12 months ago. So why is the reconstruction taking so long?</p> <p>Security remains a problem: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/libya-car-bomb-attacks-tripoli\" title=\"\">two car bombs earlier this month in Tripoli</a> set nerves on edge. Tribal fighting also continues in towns to the south, and western diplomatic missions have been attacked in Benghazi, Libya's second city.</p> <p>\"A string of assassinations, mainly of individuals linked to the Gaddafi regime, and attacks on western targets have sent a worrying message,\" says Jonathan Terry of risk consultancy Maplecroft. \"Libyan officials have repeatedly said that companies from countries such as Britain, France and the US who supported the intervention would be 'rewarded', but the extent to which this promise will be upheld has yet to be seen.\"</p> <p>For many, the slow progress is down to westerners not understanding the pace at which Libya works. One seasoned middle-eastern oil executive says: \"The [Libyan] National Transition Council was very careful not to say it was going to give any long-term contracts until after a democratically elected government was formed. There was never going to be this rush for contracts.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/10/mohammed-el-megarif-libya-president\" title=\"\">Elections took place in July</a>, and though they passed off peacefully, a new cabinet has yet to be formed. \"It's taken a while for the Libyan government to get organised,\" says Maryann Maguire of UK-based consultancy InterCultures.</p> <p>Nowhere illustrates the stagnation better than Tripoli's stock market. In a country supposedly hungry for reconstruction, financial traders should be rushed off their feet. Instead, they spend their days staring at chains of orange zeroes on big wall-mounted screens.</p> <p>Brokers say the government, staffed by officials of the former dictatorship, is not equipped to make the transition to a free market. Stock market trading director Mohammed Salabi has a series of bulky files containing a model regulatory law drafted by his own officials and drawing on experience in bourses in London, Paris and New York. Even now, he claims, the administration has made no move to implement his regulations which, he says, would give investors confidence to buy shares.</p> <p>\"The economics minister still does not understand the importance of the Libyan stock market,\" he says. \"We made the regulations\u2026 We cook the food, we make the dish, we give the fork and the knife and ask him please, just eat it.\"</p> <p>Yet other foreign firms are beginning to tuck in. France's Nexans was recently awarded an \u00a380m electric cable contract, and Germany's Wintershall has begun work on a major new oil pipeline. \"France, Italy, Turkey and Germany have a completely different culture to doing business,\" says InterCultures' Maguire. \"British business culture is more reserved.\"</p> <p>Some nationalities have definitely demonstrated more corporate aggression in Libya, though it remains to be seen how effective these strategies will be.</p> <p>Hans Meier-Ewert of the German-African Business Association made his first visit during the war, flying in five tonnes of medical aid and a plane-load of executives while fighting still raged. \"We want to be the early bird,\" he says. \"It's not important to have the deals immediately; its important we go and see them.\"</p> <p>Apart from British reserve, other more tangible barriers to Britain's business remain. A regular complaint from companies is the line taken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which counsels against \"all but essential travel\" to Libya. This bumps up insurance costs and puts firms off making the trip.</p> <p>Still, the LBBC's Lamb is optimistic, arguing that the bonanza is delayed, not abandoned. He hopes the new government will speed reform: \"Our own advice is that going to Libya for business purposes is now 'essential',\" he says.</p> <p>The sales pitch certainly sounds alluring. After 40 years of idiosyncratic dictatorship, Libya's six million people are hungry for everything from roads and hospitals to phones and fashion. The country has no railway and no public bus service. UK Trade and Investment estimates Libya will eventually spend more than \u00a3125bn on reconstruction.</p> <p>\"Libya is virgin land: any business coming here will be a success,\" says Ehab Abdelo-Meged, manager of a branch of the US bakery chain Cinnabon \u2013 the sole foreign-owned fast food franchise to open in Tripoli in 12 months. \"Look at retail. All the guys here buy their clothes from aboard. Why would they go abroad if they could buy them here?\"</p> <p>If they could, no doubt they would. But sceptics wonder for how long fashion-conscious Libyans will have to \u2013 literally \u2013 embark on shopping trips, while others worry that the bloodshed may still have years to run. \"Nothing will happen [commercially] until things settle down, and that could take years,\" says one expert. \"The Libyans are settling old scores and will probably go through further tribal battles, and possibly civil war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Justice Leveson has reserved his right to summon an extra witness or two this autumn. In which case, step forward Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales (aka Harry). You've shown a great gift for crystallising the conundrum Leveson can't cope with \u2013 an issue of common sense and legal ridiculousness far more serious than any ritual <em>Sun</em> cavorting.</p> <p>Here are Captain Wales and a couple of chums out on the town in Las Vegas. They splash around in a pool with assorted girls in bikinis. They booze. They retire to Harry's room for a game of a non-Olympic sport called \"strip billiards\". Whereupon, some bright, invited, spark with a mobile takes pictures of the Oik Prince naked and sells them to TMZ, America's number-two-but-trying-harder celebrity website. The photos are fuzzy. So, at first blush, are the issues they raise as they whiz round the online globe.</p> <p>Enter St James's Palace via Harbottle &amp; Lewis, writers of heavy solicitors' letters, and the Press Complaints Commission, deliverer of such missives. Remember the editor's code, making hotel bedrooms areas where \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\" exists, newspapers are warned.</p> <p>Think how those words may be interpreted, too, in English law. Only prurience, surely, argues for publication. Whereupon, after a little chuntering about terrorist threats and boorish behaviour, the printed press subsides for a day, wrapped in a Leveson comfort blanket \u2013 until the <em>Sun</em> and its \"souvenir edition\" thinks again, putting these \"vital\" pictures in print at last.</p> <p>Vital? Not in one sense, because most of the country (indeed most of our interlinked world) has seen them already. But \"vital\" isn't an altogether stupid word where principle and the supposed rule of law are concerned. If Harry and drunken mates had been stripping in, say, a Brighton hotel bedroom, they'd have had that \"reasonable expectation of [code-blessed] privacy\", no photographs allowed \u2013 though much of the larking around the pool would probably have been different.</p> <p>But Las Vegas is not Brighton. The people who buy photos for TMZ are subject to American, not British, law. And US privacy law extends none of the supposed protections or tortuous balances of its Anglo-European cousin. It says (as a crude simplification) that public figures, choosing to seek celebrity or political fame, are on their own. They've forfeited the right to cry privacy.</p> <p>Ordinary members of the American public still have a right to be left alone, but film and TV stars, gold medal winners, pop singers, senators and carousing members of the British royal family have no such defences. They're fair game for \"citizen paparazzi\". They need to watch their backs. Harbottle &amp; Lewis's writ does not run.</p> <p>Privacy, moreover, isn't libel. Privacy guards a secret that can instantly be blown wide open \u2013 in print or online \u2013 and never regain its secret state. I (probably like most of you) made eight quick keystrokes when, via a rather excited BBC news bulletin, I first heard about the woes of Wales. I didn't have to wait for the <em>Bun</em> to get its currants together. An instant, unstoppable, world had swept on. There is no privacy in one continent, let alone one country, any longer. The essential issue of <em>Spycatcher</em>, long ago, lives on in cyberspace.</p> <p>Was it sensible for Margaret Thatcher to try to prevent publication of Peter Wright's MI5 memoirs when the rest of the world could buy and read them \u2013 even in Scotland, but not England, at the close? No: it was plain daft, the folly of lawyers never raising their eyes. Now see the digital version of this drama played out day by day on a laptop near you in an era of open journalism.</p> <p>If Sir Brian Leveson, brooding over his first draft, tries to construct some kind of magisterial new regime, then the likes of TMZ or Perez Hilton can and surely will make it seem idiotic within minutes. If he seeks to go further and make his codes statutory, then one more Harry debacle will render such quasi-law an absolute ass.</p> <p>For real answers, look elsewhere. Maybe the prince had best keep his trousers buttoned \u2013 or choose Aldershot ahead of the Strip for his holidays. Maybe, at 27, he still needs self-protection officers. Maybe we should invent a new Boris class of privacy, one to be greeted with a guffaw rather than a frown. But there is no conventional solution here unless US privacy law and the European Convention on Human Rights (article eight) can be brought harmoniously together, creating a level playing field of discretion.</p> <p>Unless and until they are, and such areas of law become international not national, the internet and its accoutrements offer only frustration to authority dreaming old, impossible dreams. The trouble with Harry is that we, the debate and Leveson have to move on.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is facing a revolt in his own Oxfordshire \"backyard\" as local Tories join a national outcry over council tax reforms that they say will cost people on low earnings more than \u00a3420 a year from next April.</p> <p>Tory-run West Oxfordshire district council, which covers the prime minister's Witney constituency, has decided to go it alone and keep the existing system throughout next year, effectively snubbing Cameron's government.</p> <p>Plans to scrap council tax benefit and leave it to individual councils to devise their own support schemes from April next year are part of the government's drive to devolve power to the local level, while slashing costs at the same time. In 2010-11 council tax benefit was paid to 5.8 million people at a cost of \u00a34.82bn. At the moment Whitehall covers 100% of each local authority's costs for the benefit. But from next year they will be given 10% less to run their own schemes.</p> <p>West Oxfordshire and other councils across the country are protesting, however, that after they have met legal obligations to protect pensioners, the disabled and families with children, the 10% cut will mean that people on low earnings will be hit disproportionately. It estimates that working-age people who currently pay nothing will suddenly have to find \u00a3420 a year from their other state benefits.</p> <p>In an internal report, West Oxfordshire officials state: \"This approach does not meet the policy intention of incentivising work. Because of the way the benefit would be reduced progressively as incomes rise, councils argue the reform will deter many from seeking work.\"</p> <p>The report also suggests that the cost and inconvenience of collecting small sums from people without the means to pay will make the whole system unworkable. The council will therefore defy government and postpone any change until 2014, making up the financial shortfall from other parts of the budget.</p> <p>Across the country there are similar protests. In June council leaders from 12 councils in Surrey wrote to the chairman of the Local Government Association, Sir Merrick Cockell, voicing their dismay at a policy that was rushed and badly thought through. \"We are concerned at the level of impact on working-age claimants with the 10% funding reduction in actual fact translating to more like a 20% or 25% reduction [in relief] being required after allowing for pensioners and other protected groups,\" they told Cockell.</p> <p>\"We feel a rushed implementation of a new scheme might lead to penalising claimants who already go out to work, which has the opposite effect of what the coalition government wants. This does not seem joined up with the current emphasis on helping 'troubled families'.\"</p> <p>Dave Prentis, general secretary of the public sector union Unison, said the changes, if implemented, would be the last straw for 800,000 low-paid workers. \"The Tories are shooting themselves in the foot by cutting help for low-paid workers, because it leaves them with even less money and reduces the financial benefits of being in work. This is not just being said by Unison; it is the advice of Conservative council leaders and the local council in David Cameron's own constituency.\"</p> <p>The \"social injustice\" of the policy was all the greater as it would come into effect on the same day as the top rate of tax was cut from 50p to 45p for high earners.</p> <p>At the end of July, Councillor John Weighell, the leader of North Yorkshire county council, wrote to the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, complaining that the plans would lead to a \"postcode lottery\", with charges dependent on the local pensioner population. \"The lottery element of a council's demographic makeup makes an impossibility of creating a local scheme which is sensitive to the needs of local residents,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, said: \"When even David Cameron's own council says it's unfair to increase council tax on the poorest on the very same day that high earners will get a whopping great reduction in income tax, we know just how out of touch the prime minister has become.</p> <p>\"In the last two years, it is the least well-off councils that have faced the biggest cuts from central government. It will be much harder for these authorities to make up for this additional cut in council tax benefit funding, which is being imposed on their poorest residents by Eric Pickles when times are tough enough as it is.\"</p>",
  "<p>I know that Tony Nicklinson wanted to die. I know this because the 58-year-old sufferer of locked-in syndrome said so \u2013 to any journalist or politician or disability rights campaigner who crossed his path. I know this because despite what it cost him \u2013 emotionally and physically \u2013 he pursued a lengthy legal battle to give him the right to terminate his own life. I know this because he loved his family very much, yet his suffering was so intense that he could contemplate leaving his family behind.</p> <p>Since suffering a catastrophic stroke on a business trip to Athens in 2005, Tony had seven years to think about it: seven years locked in a corporeal prison, paralysed from the neck down, cared for 24 hours a day by his wife, Jane, and unable to communicate except through blinking. When he was told that his high court attempt had been in vain, the television cameras captured Tony emitting a howl of anguish so intense that no one \u2013 not even his many opponents \u2013 could have listened to it without experiencing the tiniest sliver of fellow feeling or compassion or even anger.</p> <p>In June, I conducted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/23/tony-nicklinson-assisted-suicide-twitter-interview\" title=\"\">an interview</a> with Tony via Twitter for this newspaper. Over the course of a week, Tony replied to a barrage of questions with forthrightness and eloquence. When asked if he had any fear of dying, he replied: \"No, but I have a fear of living like this when I am old and frail.\"</p> <p>After the article was published, Tony and I kept in touch. He admitted to missing \"our odd exchanges\" and we emailed each other fairly regularly in the weeks leading up to the high court ruling. He had an idea for something called the \"Nicklinson challenge\" whereby a series of volunteers, including his most high-profile opponents, would consent to living a day in his shoes to experience the brutal reality of what it was like.</p> <p>I got to know him a little. We never met in person but in a way that helped: Tony disliked the fact that the stroke had left him incapacitated and unable to regulate his own emotions. He hated being patronised. The computer screen meant there was no physical barrier to our interactions: his body might have been trapped but his mind was free to roam. And what a mind it was \u2013 insightful, clever, rational, sometimes combative but always rigorously focused.</p> <p>He was caring, too, even in the midst of profound personal torment. After the high court ruling on 16 August, I hadn't wanted to email him straight away. I knew that he would be inundated with media requests and would probably want some time alone with his family to come to terms with the judgment. As it turned out, he was the first to email, anxious that he might have unwittingly offended me.</p> <p>\"Have I somehow upset you?\" he wrote on 17 August. \"If I have, I am sorry.\" He hadn't, of course, and I told him so. It upsets me now that he might have thought otherwise.</p> <p>One of our last exchanges concerned a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/editorial-let-tony-micklinson-die\" title=\"\">leader column</a> I was writing on his case for last Sunday's paper. I asked him for his analysis of the legal ruling. At this point, Tony must already have been weak, his health in decline, and yet there wasn't a hint of it in his email. He made five brief points, all of them typically cogent, underwritten by a sort of blazing logic that I had come to realise was his hallmark.</p> <p>\"Opponents of giving me the ability to choose life or death will tell you that it will fundamentally alter the doctor-patient relationship,\" he wrote. \"Why? The vast majority of a GP's patients already have the ability to commit suicide so it's the norm.\"</p> <p>In the event, Tony's death took six days. After the high court verdict, he started refusing food, contracted pneumonia and went rapidly downhill. He died last Wednesday. And although I know that he wanted to die, I can't help but feel sad.</p> <p>Is that a paradox?</p> <p>Maybe not. One can feel relief that he is released from his suffering while also feeling sadness for his extraordinary family \u2013 Jane, his sister, Ginny, his daughters, Lauren and Beth. Although they supported his fight to be allowed to die, they must also now be facing the suddenness of his absence, the emptiness in the room, the numbness of a long-suspended grief.</p> <p>It is profoundly sad that, despite the speed of his decline, it is not a pleasant way to die: Tony would have drowned in his own phlegm. He would have suffocated as a result of his lungs slowly shutting down. He could have been spared that pain.</p> <p>Also, the campaign he led with such resilience and bravery has lost its public face. Tony went to the high court alongside another man with locked-in syndrome who chose to remain anonymous. It was Tony who took on the fight, who fielded the interview requests, who allowed photographers into his home and who invited his opponents to talk, face to face.</p> <p>Many of those who disagreed with Tony and who continue to oppose the right to die hold carefully considered opinions that are just as heartfelt as his were. They argue that a change in the law would endanger the vulnerable or the elderly who might be made to feel they are a burden on society.</p> <p>While these views are to be respected, my belief&#xa0;is that Tony was being denied the right to take his own life \u2013 a right that, had he been able-bodied, would automatically have been his. There have been recent moves to make the law on&#xa0;assisted dying more compassionate for the terminally ill and public support for such an initiative is high.</p> <p>It is troubling, however, that people such as Tony, who are not terminally ill, should be condemned to a life of suffering, especially when advances in medical science, which might keep similarly afflicted people alive longer, mean that similar situations might, in the future, affect many of us. Of course the safeguards need to be set high. Of course we do not want a blanket change in the law. But we can hope the matter is now discussed properly in Parliament, perhaps with a view to setting up some form of panel, comprising representatives from the medical and legal professions, who could make an informed and compassionate decision on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Tony asked me if last weekend's leader column could include a link to an online petition to support his right to die. I said I didn't think that would be possible but that I'd try my best.</p> <p>He emailed back: \"Thanks. Your best is all I or anybody can ask.\"</p>",

That's the first piece of excellent news about <strong>Parade's End</strong>. Saturday morning, there must have been legions of Boden-clad sandal-criminals zombieing their way round Homebase, mouths fluttering like those of guppies, still trying to work out\u2026 but who was <em>that</em> one? And&#xa0;why did the other one, the one with the <em>hair</em>\u2026? And where were the cartoon <em>fingers</em>? Marvellous.</p> <p>Second fine piece of news about it is that Tom Stoppard's adaptation of the unaccountably forgotten Ford Madox Ford tetralogy \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/grahamgreene\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> called it the finest novel in English to come from the Great War \u2013 is a triumph. Directed by Susanna White, subtle, sweeping, piercingly intelligent, beautifully slow-fast-slow, it's already taking us on a magical little dance through Edwardia in those last odd little years before that war, those last fast little sunny, snobby, grateful years before the black, when some of Britain's finest \u2013 albeit moneyed, privileged \u2013 minds wanted to&#xa0;unpamper themselves long enough to think deep about women, class, nation states, poverty and the very complex moral problem of the \"duty of&#xa0;care\" from rich to poor. Issues which&#xa0;would define the coming century, and become themselves redefined by two wars, but the guys were already on the right track.</p> <p>Third, of course, is that one of these better guys, Christopher Tietjens, a brilliant Home Office statistician, a rich man, a clever man, a quiet man, a moral man, a kind man, and a cuckold \u2013 is being played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Much has been written of late about big Benny, thanks to a mad little non-row about class, but let's leave aside the man for a moment, <em>what</em> a bloody actor. He marries the fat brain of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sherlock\" title=\"\"><em>Sherlock</em></a> to a lead character, Tietjens, who speaks mainly with his silences. And, ah, what silences they are. As he quietly outmanoeuvres venal Home Office pocket-stuffers, quietly if enthusiastically bangs a beautiful stranger, soon to be his wife, in a bucking old Pullman carriage, quietly bites the bullet of subsequent marriage to the dementedly flighty Sylvia for form's sake, then quietly and for ever loves the son who he knows isn't, actually, his. We've seen&#xa0;Cumberbatch enthral before with fast-gab brilliance, but this is him simply acting with his face. I don't know why this hasn't struck me before, but there's something of the Alan Rickman about him; one drowsy droop of an eyelid, one slip of the planes of his face, can convey either wry honest amusement or withering contempt. When he does speak, it's rusting anchors in smoking brown dust, the sound of the end of a world.</p> <p>And when his great chum Macmaster begins a tirade against his decision to take back wife Sylvia after such a very public cuckolding, she having raced off to Europe with a mustachioed tit, Tietjens/ Cumberbatch insists he will again do the right thing, and nor will he himself be anything but monogamous. \"For a gentleman there is such a thing as\u2026 call it Parade.\" And that&#xa0;is, of course, about to end, as he meets the feisty young suffragette Valentine Wannop (Adelaide Clemens), kind and clever and unhaughty and simply so right for him, and thus\u2026</p> <p>Or <em>is</em> Parade about to end? The fourth magnificence of this, quite probably the best television I've seen this year, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/rebecca-hall\" title=\"\">Rebecca Hall</a> as the dreadful, haughty, flighty Sylivia. The scene in which she sloughed off said mustachioed tit in a French hotel \u2013 \"Oh, Potty, I do hope you're not going to behave <em>badly</em>. I miss my husband. He's a block of wood, but it's like being with a grown-up man, rather than trying to entertain a schoolboy. Do I\u2026 what\u2026 do I love you?\"&#xa0;Her lower left lip performs gymnastic curls. \"What\u2026 the dullness, the not speaking French, the drinking too much or too little, the being all over&#xa0;me\u2026 it's all like reading a book you've read before.\" Potty Perowne pulls out a gun. \"I say, you're not going to kill yourself, are you, Potty?\" she murmurs, over her shoulder, as bothered as one might be by a faintly chafing cuff, before returning to her \"shamingly\" d\u00e9class\u00e9 hotel notepaper to invite herself back to Christopher. Perowne crumbles, weeps. Sylvia goes home \u2013 and don't write her off yet. There is a strength, and a real if&#xa0;complex love for Tietjens there, and&#xa0;four glorious episodes to come, and&#xa0;it's all so smart and clever and sexy, and the bevelled prisms of those Edwardian mirrors are the perfect edges to refract the lies of the times.</p> <p>For those, not necessarily the <em>Downton</em> bunnies, who miss a fine drama on a Sunday night, ITV is again here to help. Gosh, aren't we just wonderfully served these days, not least by our actors? Rupert Penry-Jones and Shaun Evans kicked off wonderfully in <strong>The Last Weekend</strong> as two college mates who weren't really friends, but still pretended. The pretence was horrendous: the acting, from those two and Genevieve O'Reilly and Claire Keelan as the wives, itchily good; and the class travails as unresolved as a century before. Writer Mick Ford, from the book by Blake Morrison, has given us stereotypes of complexity, which is a nice trick \u2013 they're recognisable, yet still fascinating \u2013 and a savage undercurrent of threat. The passive-aggressive golf game between \"old chums\" Ollie and Ian had every twitch of the tension of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanayckbourn\" title=\"\">Ayckbourn</a> endgame without the leavening humour, and this was a good thing: gripping, and I realise I am in terrible danger of saying that we've again got the finest TV in the world.</p> <p>So thank goodness for Channel 4's dire <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/funny-fortnight/articles/funny-fortnight\" title=\"\"><strong>Funny Fortnight</strong></a>. I know what they're trying to do \u2013 cram a few new pilots together over two weeks and let us make the decisions, because apparently Channel 4 doesn't have any editors with the courage of their convictions.

  "<p>On Saturday, 17 January 1920, the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> reported with mild incredulity on one of the most extraordinary experiments in modern democratic history. \"One minute after midnight tonight,\" the story began, \"America will become an entirely arid desert as far as alcoholics are concerned, any drinkable containing more than half of 1 per cent alcohol being forbidden.\" In fact, the Volstead Act \u2013 which prohibited the sale of \"intoxicating liquors\" \u2013 had come into operation at midnight the day before. But the authorities had granted drinkers one last day, one last session at the bar, before the iron shutters of Prohibition came down.</p> <p>Across the United States, many bars and restaurants marked the demise of the demon drink by handing out free glasses of wine, brandy and whisky. Others saw one last opportunity to make a killing, charging an eye-watering \"20 to 30 dollars for a bottle of champagne, or a dollar to two dollars for a drink of whisky\". In some establishments, mournful dirges played while coffins were carried through the crowds of drinkers; in others, the walls were hung with black crepe. And in the most prestigious establishments, the <em>Guardian</em> noted, placards carried the ominous words: \"Exit booze. Doors close on Saturday.\"</p> <p>In an age when individual freedom is all, it comes as something of a shock to reflect that in the world's most prosperous and dynamic country the prohibition of alcohol lasted for almost 14 years. Today we often think of Prohibition as a deluded experiment, instinctively associating it with images of Al&#xa0;Capone, the mafia and the Valentine's Day Massacre. In fact, the campaign to prohibit alcohol had been deeply rooted in Anglo-American society for some two centuries. The American Society for the Promotion of Temperance, for example, was founded in 1826, and by the following decade as many as a million Americans belonged to an anti-alcohol group of some kind.</p> <p>Far from being repressive authoritarians, Prohibition's largely Protestant champions \u2013 a large proportion of whom were high-minded middle-class women \u2013 were the do-gooders of the day. Often deeply religious, they saw Prohibition as a kind of social reform, a crusade to clean up the American city and restore the founding virtues of the godly republic. Many were involved in other progressive campaigns, too, notably the anti-slavery movement of the 1850s. And as American cities boomed after the civil war, swollen with immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, the campaigners' hatred of alcohol became steadily more ferocious. They looked in horror on the new saloons of the expanding cities, with their card games and fist fights, their bad boys and good-time girls. In particular, they became convinced that alcohol was a deadly threat to the health and virtue of American womanhood \u2013 not, perhaps, entirely erroneously, since papers of the time were full of stories of battered wives and broken&#xa0;marriages.</p> <p>The first state to outlaw alcohol entirely was, not surprisingly, a Protestant stronghold, the New England state of Maine, which introduced Prohibition in 1851. (Few people now realise that, thanks to the influence of the Lancashire temperance movement, Maine Road, the street where Manchester City's famous old stadium was based, was named in honour of the state that pioneered Prohibition. It had been formerly known as Dog Kennel Lane, which would probably have been an unfortunate name for a football ground.) At the national level, though, Prohibition took a long time to get off the ground, and the Maine law was repealed only five years later. Many activists felt they had no choice but to take the law into their own hands: a good example was the ferocious evangelical Christian Carrie Nation, who stood almost 6ft tall. As Mrs Nation readily accepted, she had a daunting appearance: she once compared herself to a \"bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what he doesn't like\". Her activities ranged from serenading the patrons of Kansas saloons to smashing up bars with rocks and hatchets, often accompanied by dozens of hymn-singing women. Arrested more than 30 times before her death in 1911, she found the money for her fines from the sale of souvenir hatchets.</p> <p>By the time of Carrie Nation's death, though, the campaign for Prohibition was gathering momentum. This was the heyday of progressive reform: to a generation of Protestant reformers, using the power of the state to regulate the anarchy of the industrial city and improve the lot of ordinary workers seemed only natural and reasonable. Outlawing alcohol, which they associated with disease and disorder, fitted nicely into this agenda. As early as 1916, some 26 out of 48 states were already dry, and once the United States entered the first world war, Prohibition became identified with patriotism \u2013 not least because German Americans, with their brewing traditions, were often against it. By December 1917, with the war in full swing, both houses of Congress had approved a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol. In January 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified by 36 states, and that October, the Volstead Act \u2013 passed over President Woodrow Wilson's attempted veto \u2013 gave the federal authorities the power to stop the manufacture, sale or importation of \"intoxicating liquor\".</p> <p>Now prohibition was law. Unfortunately for its advocates, however, the federal government was never really equipped to enforce it. By the time the Volstead Act came into force, the heyday of progressive reform had already passed. The Republican presidents of the 1920s, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, were both small-government conservatives, who shrank from high spending and federal intervention. Almost incredibly, only 1,500 federal agents were given the job of enforcing Prohibition \u2013 that is, about 30 for every state in the union. On top of that, the new regime never had unanimous public support, while neighbouring countries remained defiantly wet. Neither Mexico nor Canada had any intention of clamping down on breweries and distilleries near the American border; indeed, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Winston Churchill, thought that Prohibition was \"an affront to the whole history of mankind\".</p> <p>Above all, many Americans with a taste for liquor were determined to get hold of a drink one way or another. Illegal drinking dens had long flourished in big cities; indeed, the word \"speakeasy\" probably dates from the late 1880s. But now they bloomed as never before; historians estimate that by 1925, there were as many as 100,000 illegal bars in New York City alone, many of them tiny, spit-and-sawdust joints, others catering to the rich and well-connected. In Detroit, tantalisingly close to the Canadian border, smugglers used \"false floorboards in automobiles, second gas tanks, hidden compartments, even false-bottomed shopping baskets and suitcases, not to mention camouflaged flasks and hot water bottles\", as one account has it, to bring alcohol into the city. And somehow it speaks volumes that when the Michigan state police raided one Detroit bar, they found the local congressman, the local sheriff and the city's mayor all enjoying a drink.</p> <p>The big winners from Prohibition were, of course, the nation's gangsters. The law had only been in operation for an hour when the police recorded the first attempt to break it, with six armed men stealing some $100,000-worth of \"medicinal\" whisky from a train in Chicago. From the very beginning, criminals had recognised that Prohibition represented a marvellous business opportunity; in major cities, indeed, gangs had quietly been stockpiling booze supplies for weeks. Legend has it that the first gangster to grasp the real commercial potential of Prohibition, though, was racketeer Arnold Rothstein, whose agents had been responsible for rigging the baseball World Series in 1919. Establishing his&#xa0;\"office\" at Lindy's Restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, Rothstein brought alcohol across the Great Lakes and down the Hudson from Canada, and supplied it \u2013 at a handsome profit \u2013 to the city's gangsters.</p> <p>In 1928, Rothstein was murdered after a gambling dispute, but by then his fame was such that F Scott Fitzgerald used him as the model for Jay Gatsby's friend Meyer Wolfsheim in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, a \"small, flatnosed Jew\" with cufflinks made from human teeth. Indeed, Gatsby himself \u2013 the quintessential self-made American hero \u2013 is alleged to have made his fortune from organised crime. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter,\" says Tom Buchanan. \"I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn't far wrong.\"</p> <p>By far the most celebrated gangster of the day, though, was Al Capone, a New York-born hoodlum who controlled much of the Chicago underworld in the mid-1920s. Living in splendour in the city's Lexington hotel, he was said to be raking in some $100m a year from casinos and speakeasies. To many people, he seemed a real-life Robin Hood, opening soup kitchens for the unemployed and giving large sums to charity. Unlike Sherwood Forest's finest, however, Capone had a pronounced taste for the good life, wearing smart suits and drinking expensive Templeton Rye whisky. \"I'm just a businessman,\" he used to say, \"giving the public what they want.\" But when, in 1929, Capone ordered the brutal machine-gunning of seven Chicago rivals in the Valentine's Day Massacre, public sympathy evaporated. That same year, Prohibition agent Eliot Ness began to investigate Capone's affairs, and in October 1931 \u2013 after Capone's efforts to nobble the jury had been defeated \u2013 he was sentenced to 11 years for tax evasion. He eventually died in prison of a heart attack; appropriately, perhaps, for the nation's most famous vice baron, his health had been eroded by syphilis.</p> <p>By the time Capone went down, support for Prohibition was already ebbing away. With newspapers alleging that as many as eight out of 10 congressmen drank on the quiet, it was obvious that the attempt to outlaw alcohol had failed. In March 1933, just weeks after he had been inaugurated, President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an amendment to the Volstead Act permitting the sale and consumption of beer with no more than 3.2% alcohol content. The Depression was in full swing, national morale was at rock bottom and, as Roosevelt put it, \"I think we could all do with a beer.\" And on 5 December 1933, Utah approved the Twenty-first Amendment, providing a majority for ratification and consigning national Prohibition to the history books.</p> <p>Yet although the age of Prohibition now feels very remote, the idea lives on. Alcohol is not, after all, the only drug to have been prohibited by law; many people who regard Prohibition as bizarre and misguided think nothing of outlawing, say, heroin or cocaine. We often forget, too, that many states chose to remain dry after 1933. Mississippi, the last entirely dry state, only repealed Prohibition in 1966. Even today, more than 500 municipalities across the United States are dry, often in strongly evangelical states. In a famously delicious irony, they include Moore County, Tennessee, the home of the Jack Daniel's distillery, although visitors are allowed to buy a \"commemorative\" bottle.</p> <p>The truth is that in many corners of the United States, opposition to alcohol dies hard. When Barack Obama was photographed with a very weak beer in hand at a Washington Wizards game, the phone-in lines smouldered with anger. \"The president is the president 24 hours a day,\" one caller said. \"I don't think he should drink on the job.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nick Cave is explaining why <em>Lawless</em>, a film punctuated by scenes of brutal violence, could have been even more visceral. \"In my original draft of the script, the opening scene culminated with a pig having its throat cut,\" he says, chuckling. \"It was bloody and shocking and it kind of signalled what was to come, but they discovered you just can't pull a pig's snout back without it going crazy. This,\" he says drily, \"is the kind of stuff that film-making teaches you.\"</p> <p>We are sitting, sipping tea, in the bright and spacious kitchen of the large Regency house in Brighton where Cave, 54, lives with his wife, former model Susie Bick, and their twin sons, Arthur and Earl. There are books, a mono record player, a piano and several paintings of strange-looking cats on the walls. Cave is dressed in his characteristically sharp sartorial style \u2013 tailored pinstripe trousers, immaculately shiny shoes, an open-necked shirt with a big collar \u2013 and looks lean and healthy, seeming to thrive on a work-rate that, as he grows older, becomes ever more prodigious. In the last year, he has written several drafts of the script for <em>Lawless</em> as well as the songs for a new album with his longtime band, the Bad Seeds.</p> <p>\"I spent eight months on those songs,\" he says, shaking his head, \"which is a hell of a long time for me. Screenwriting is just not like that. You write a scene and it works or it doesn't. It's immediate. I can really bat that stuff out fast and it feels totally natural to do that. To tell the truth, it's a huge relief after the labour of songwriting. In a way, it sometimes feels like what I was put on Earth to do.\"</p> <p><em>Lawless</em> is the second script that Cave has written for director John Hillcoat, his longtime friend and Australian-born fellow traveller, best known for his recent adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's dystopian novel, <em>The Road</em>. In 2005, Cave and Hillcoat collaborated on critically acclaimed outback western <em>The Proposition</em>. Way back in 1988, Cave co-wrote and acted in Hillcoat's debut&#xa0;feature, <em>Ghosts\u2026 of the Civil Dead</em>, a brooding prison drama in which the singer played a violent psychopath with a degree of relish that suggested some disturbingly deep connection with the role.</p> <p>If his acting debut did not exactly set Hollywood alight, Cave now finds himself in considerable demand as a scriptwriter. \"There's a pile of stuff waiting for me in my office,\" he says. (Cave famously works 9am to 5pm daily in his basement office.) \"All I seem to read at the moment is novels that have been optioned or ideas for scripts. I'm in this strange position right now insofar as I have to decide whether I continue working only with John, which I really enjoy doing, or make a leap into being a screenwriter for hire. I'm not sure that's where I want to go. It seems like a step too far into that world. I can see myself suddenly waking up one morning and asking myself, 'What the fuck am I doing this for?'\"</p> <p>Cave has already dubbed <em>Lawless</em> a \"wangster\" movie, a rather unfortunate label for a film that deftly merges the tropes of the urban gangster and the rural western with considerable style. With nods to Arthur Penn's <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> and Sam Peckinpah's <em>The Wild Bunch</em>, it stars Tom Hardy as the leader of the three Bondurant brothers, backwoods bootleggers who battle the law and anyone else who crosses their path in Prohibition-era Virginia. Gary Oldman shines as Floyd Banner, a city gangster whose criminal empire is spreading inexorably into Franklin County, where the Bondurants are revered as local legends, but it is the arrival of a malevolent marshal, Charlie Rakes, played by Guy Pearce, that ignites the war of attrition that escalates throughout the film's long narrative arc.</p> <p><em>Lawless</em> also merges the lyrical and the ultra-violent, with a pair of protracted romances providing welcome light relief from the often bloody set-pieces. (Paradoxically, in a film full of extravagant male acting, it is Jessica Chastain as the sexy, but haunted, Maggie, and the brilliant Mia Wasikowska as the innocent, but mischievous, Bertha, that command most attention with their understated performances.) Revenge is the driving force of the story and the world the brothers inhabit often seems as brutal and unforgiving as a certain kind of broodingly melodramatic Nick Cave song \u2013 The Mercy Seat, say, or Your Funeral\u2026 My Trial.</p> <p>\"Well, the violence was there in the book, which is pretty savage in places,\" says Cave, somewhat defensively, when I mention this. (The film is based on <em>The Wettest County in the World</em>, subsequently republished as <em>Lawless</em>, a historical novel by Matt Bondurant, a grandson of Jack, the youngest brother, who is played by Shia LaBeouf.) \"In fact, a lot of the truly brutal stuff did not make it through into the film. In the book, you get lulled by the beautiful lyricism of the writing, then suddenly you are slapped in the face by a graphic description of a killing. I tried to be true to that as much as I could.\"</p> <p>The film, like the book, plays with the mythology of the seemingly invincible outlaw, in this instance Forrest Bondurant, the middle brother, who, as the violence around him escalates, somehow survives against the odds to fight again. \"It's not so much a true story as a true myth,\" says Cave. \"Forrest is a bit like Ned Kelly: he just keeps on coming back.\"</p> <p>Hardy plays Forrest as a kind of taciturn patriarch, all grunts and sighs and very few words, someone who is passive in all respects apart from one \u2013 his capacity for brutal vengeance. \"Tom really interpreted the character in such a different way than what was on the page,\" says Cave. \"It confounded John to begin with, but he really created something interesting. I was totally impressed by his unique way of thinking. At one point, he said to me: 'I just want to play it like an old lesbian.' That blew me away. He saw the role as being essentially maternal, so when Maggie [Jessica Chastain] comes in, there's a tension in the family. It was a lesson for me in how far an actor can go in interpreting a role.\"</p> <p>Pearce, another Australian, also ups the ante with his portrayal of special agent Rakes, a city cop with some simmering psychosexual issues that predictably manifest themselves in moments of sadistic violence. In the novel, Rakes is a redneck country cop. Where did all the other baggage come from? \"Well, initially, Guy Pearce said he would play the role if I made it more memorable,\" says Cave, grinning. \"So, I just based it loosely on myself.\"</p> <p>More than once, Cave mentions how much he has learned from screenwriting. This begs the obvious question: how different is film-making from music-making? \"Oh, it's another world. With <em>Lawless</em>, I saw what it was like to work at the cliff face of film-making. It's tough and it's taxing and you wonder how they get through it. There are so many people involved, for a start. There isn't that sense of anxiety about making a record. There is something beautiful about going into the studio with your friends and making music together. It's essentially a beautiful thing \u2013 if it works. As far as I can see, there is never that moment in a film where it's just you and what you have created.\"</p> <p>Following on from <em>The Proposition</em> and <em>The Road</em>, Cave has also composed the soundtrack for <em>Lawless</em> with his now-constant collaborator, Warren Ellis, violinist with the Bad Seeds. Using a core group of friends called the Bootleggers, they invited several guest vocalists, including Emmylou Harris and Mark Lanegan, to interpret standards such as Link Wray's Fire and Brimstone and the Velvet Underground's White Light, White Heat. Over the closing credits, the latter is dramatically reinterpreted as a trad-country ballad about bootlegging by bluegrass veteran Ralph Stanley. It works, but Stanley took some persuading.</p> <p>\"It was extraordinary the way that happened,\" says Cave, shaking his head as if he still has not quite made sense of the encounter. \"Initially, we sent him some version we had recorded that we thought he could sing on, but he was like: 'What is this shit? I can't fucking sing over this!' Not exactly those words, right, but that was the general impression that came back to us. But we didn't want to make a pristine score. People kept saying, 'Wait until we get to LA, then we can get some real musicians to play the songs properly,' and we were like, 'Fuck you. We're going to play them the way we want to play them.'\"</p> <p>Things became even more surreal when they hooked up with Stanley and his guitarist on Skype. \"Ralph is a serious guy and his guitarist is even more so. We asked him to cover Link Wray's Fire and Brimstone and he did it in 3/4 time, with a swing, because that's what he knows. So, there's Warren and me trying to explain that we want it in 4/4 time \u2013 rock'n'roll. Ralph is saying nothing and the guitarist is just looking at us as like he wants to string us up. It was like: 'Who the hell are these freaks telling Ralph Stanley how to sing?'\"</p> <p>In the end, they employed the services of renowned musical curator and producer Hal Willner, who had the good sense to let Stanley sing the songs in his own way. The result, particularly on White Light, White Heat, is pure gold. \"Hal got in touch with Lou Reed [who wrote the song], who was working in a studio down the road in LA. We played it to him and he was just blown away. It was an amazing moment.\"</p> <p>I ask Nick Cave, in conclusion, if writing scripts has made writing songs any easier. \"Sadly, I don't think so. Songwriting is a much more intangible thing. It comes out of a place that I don't really understand and I am always grappling with it. Often, it feels more like it's in the hands of the gods, insofar as you never really know if what you are working on is any good. But, you know, songwriting is what I do. Making music is still the primary function. In a way,\" he says, smiling, \"screenwriting is something to do between records.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Born in California, Jessica Chastain trained at the Juilliard school in New York and made her name in theatre before her film career. In 2011, her performance in <em>The Tree of Life</em> brought widespread attention and since then she has been a striking presence in <em>The Help, Take Shelter, The Debt and Coriolanus</em>.</strong></p> <p><strong>In Lawless, you play Maggie, a femme fatale, with a mysterious past. What attracted you to the role?</strong></p> <p>I love the relationship between Maggie and Forrest. Maggie is a woman who is very used to being around men \u2013 she was a burlesque dancer \u2013 and she's probably been hurt by a lot of men, physically and emotionally. When she shows up at this little town, she's an oddity for the brothers and especially Forrest. He's used to violence but not being around women. So she becomes almost the aggressor in the relationship, in the way she pursues him.</p> <p><strong>Director John Hillcoat suggested that Maggie was the strongest character in the film. Is that how you saw her?</strong></p> <p>I did see her as very strong. Nick Cave [who wrote the screenplay] suggested that I watch <em>Once Upon a Time in the West</em> to understand her better. There's a great line that Claudia Cardinale's character says after she sleeps with the man who killed her husband: \"It's nothing that a hot bath won't wash away.\" And there's something of that attitude in Maggie. She doesn't drown in her sorrows. She's always moving forward. When she meets Forrest it's the first time she's not able to pick up her bag and walk away.</p> <p><strong>I've heard you do a lot of research into each role you take on. How did you research Maggie?</strong></p> <p>I read a lot about 1930s Chicago and watched films like <em>Angels with Dirty Faces</em>. I was lucky because I'd just worked on <em>Texas Killing Fields</em>, which Michael Mann produced. I knew he had just made <em>Public Enemies</em> so I sent him an email asking if he could recommend any books about the period. Within an hour I got a call saying: \"We'd like to schedule an appointment for you to sit down with Michael Mann tomorrow,\" and when I showed up, he had binders of stuff from <em>Public Enemies</em> for me. That was helpful.</p> <p><strong>Your character walks into a very male environment in the film, and you must have had a similar experience when you arrived on set. How did you cope?</strong></p> <p>At first I was like, \"This is amazing!\" I love being around men \u2013 I love fake fighting and all that rough-house stuff \u2013 but after a while I really missed my girlfriends. The day [<em>Lawless</em> co-star] Mia Wasikowska arrived, I ran into the make-up trailer and yelled out: \"It's a girl!\" And I threw my arms around her, like, \"Thank God you're here!\"</p> <p><strong>At Cannes, people were comparing Tom Hardy to Marlon Brando and he seemed slightly embarrassed. What did you make of the comparison?</strong></p> <p>It is actually really embarrassing when those comparisons start to come forward. I think Tom will always be plagued by that. But I actually hope he's not the next Marlon Brando, because even though Brando was brilliant, he had a troubled life and I'm hoping that Tom won't. He has a beautiful fiancee and they're really happy together. He's able to play these troubled characters now and have a stable life.</p> <p><strong>You've worked with some huge stars, including Brad Pitt on <em>The Tree of Life</em>. Are you easily starstruck?</strong></p> <p>Yes. I love being around great actors and film-makers, and I try to hide the fact that I'm in awe of them. I try to pretend with Al Pacino or Helen Mirren that, you know, we're just part of the same team, we're all in this together, but really, secretly, the whole time my heart is beating very fast.</p> <p><strong>A couple of years ago you were unknown, and now you seem to be in every second film that comes out\u2026 </strong></p> <p>Last year was incredible. I had two films at most of the festivals, and then I had six movies released, and I made two more films. Yeah, I'm still in shock.</p> <p><strong>Has your life changed? Is it hard to walk down the street without being noticed?</strong></p> <p>It hasn't changed much and I think that's because I've been working. I was rehearsing Kathryn Bigelow's film&#xa0;[<em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>] in Jordan before&#xa0;the Oscars and then went straight back and filmed it. Now I'm filming in New York and I do notice the difference a bit: when I'm shooting a scene, outside there's paparazzi, which I've never experienced. For the most part, though, people don't know and don't care.</p>",
  "<p>James Meek's 2005 novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781841957067/the-peoples-act-of-love\" title=\"\"><em>The People's Act of Love</em></a>, was critically acclaimed, shortlisted for the Man Booker prize and sold in 30 countries; in 2008 he published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/03/fiction.features1\" title=\"\"><em>We Are Now Beginning Our Descent</em></a>, which went on to win the Prince Maurice prize \u2013 I was a Man Booker judge that year and tried in vain to get it on the longlist. Yet McEwan- or Barnes-style fame has as yet eluded him, which is baffling. Here is a novelist writing fat, complex but readable novels that have something serious to say about the way we live now and the society we live in. Along with Philip Hensher, he is the nearest British fiction has to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/search/results?query=John+Irving&amp;searchBy=all\" title=\"\">John&#xa0;Irving</a>.</p> <p>There are two elements that characterise Meek's work: his use of humour and his range. <em>The Heart Broke In</em> opens with married TV producer and ex-rock star Ritchie Shepherd realising that the mobile phone he uses to call his teenage girlfriend has become lost in the long grass at the family home; a comic set piece follows as Ritchie tries to reclaim the phone from his children. Ritchie is a believably revolting type of middle-aged male; high-earning with a beautiful wife and home, throwing a young mistress into the mix, more because of his own sense of entitlement than lust.</p> <p>One of the endearing qualities of Meek's writing is that he seems to despair of his own gender. Ritchie's sister Bec is everything her brother isn't: an idealistic scientist who has devoted her life to finding a vaccine against malaria, even going so far as to infect herself with a parasite that may blind her in the services of her quest. Meek's grasp of his research is superb: you really do believe that Bec is the kind of woman who is happier sleeping in the lab fully clothed than dating her wealthy newspaper editor boyfriend.</p> <p>The boyfriend, Val Oatman, a deranged religious fanatic, is a less convincing character. When he leaves his job as a result of mental illness, he sets up a website called Moral Foundation that publishes allegations against well-known figures, unless they provide salacious details about someone else's failings. Oatman's desire for revenge against Bec after she refuses to marry him provides the narrative impulse behind the book. It's a plot device that is really just the excuse for a detailed examination of personal betrayal. When Ritchie's affair is revealed to the Moral Foundation, the odious Oatman offers him a choice \u2013 give me some dirt on your sister or I will expose you. How far will Ritchie go to save his own skin?</p> <p>Meek's background as an acclaimed foreign correspondent feeds pleasingly into his fiction: he is as comfortable writing a scene set in the bush in Tanzania as he is writing one set in a London pub. Bec's strand of the narrative moves from the UK to Africa and back. Meanwhile, her worm of a brother sets out to redeem himself by making a film about the Irish republican executioner who tortured and killed their hero father, Captain Gregory Shepherd of the Special Boat Service, but Ritchie's every attempt to make himself feel better about his behaviour drags him deeper into a moral quagmire.</p> <p>The biting wit and social satire that characterised <em>We Are Now Beginning Our Descent</em> manifests itself in this novel with an entertaining cast of minor characters. Bec and Ritchie's mother Stephanie is a vain sixtysomething, obsessed with endless health and beauty regimes. When she justifies this by saying she has no intention of dying young, her tactless daughter responds: \"Mum, it's too late for you to die young.\"</p> <p>The huge cast list diffuses the narrative drive somewhat but if there is a fault in this book, it's more to do with Meek's chosen form than his skill at executing it. The multiple-point-of-view novel can often seem a slow burn as character after character is introduced and each strand of the story set up. When part one ends with the dramatic development of Oatman's blackmail plot, it is quite annoying to be introduced to the back story of Alex, an old bandmate of Ritchie's. Alex will turn out to be one of&#xa0;the main characters \u2013 Bec's true love, in fact \u2013 but we don't know that at the time.</p> <p>It's an occupational hazard of writing the fat narrative that the end result can sometimes seem a little flabby. <em>The Heart Broke In</em> has a Dickensian cast list, identifiable more by their eccentricities than plausible character traits; but in a literary culture that rewards narrow little books by sixtysomething white men about what it's like to be a sixtysomething white man, Meek's range, humour and boldness are a joy. <em>The Heart Broke In</em> doesn't always have the narrative grip of <em>The People's Act of Love</em> or the emotional power of <em>We Are Now Beginning Our Descent</em>, but it's a readable addition to this justifiably acclaimed writer's oeuvre.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Sofia Djama does not consider herself a feminist. It's not because she doesn't believe in equal rights for women \u2013 as a 33-year-old female director in Algeria, she is already a trailblazer. It's more that, as she puts it: \"The rights of women in Algeria are such that you can't be feminist in the traditional sense. There are things you can't even discuss or negotiate.\"</p> <p>The main problem, as Djama sees it, lies in the interstices between legal and social morality in her country.</p> <p>\"On one hand, I consider myself totally free,\" she says, speaking over the phone from Paris, where she spends some of her time. \"I have a right to wear a skirt, to go to the beach \u2013 the law doesn't ban me from doing so. If I don't want to fast during Ramadan, the law doesn't oblige me to. But from the perspective of social morality, it's absolutely forbidden.\"</p> <p>It is this nuanced tension that Djama explores in her second short film, <em>Softly One Saturday Morning</em> (<em>Mollement, un samedi matin</em>), which scooped two prizes at the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=157\" title=\"\">Clermont-Ferrand international short film festival</a> earlier this year.</p> <p>Djama's film tells the story of Myassa, who is returning home late one night after work and is the victim of an attempted rape. Her attacker pins her against the wall of her Algiers apartment building, but fails to get an erection. The next day, Myassa is faced with a choice: to report the assault to the police or to forget it ever happened.</p> <p>\"It's not a film that is anti-men,\" says Djama. \"I wanted to concentrate more on the failure of the system: we're at a stage in Algeria where young people are undergoing a complete crisis of identity. There are no jobs; they have no room to express themselves freely in a cultural space; they are forced to live at home with their parents; as a result, they are turning to Islam in search of an identity.</p> <p>\"The current government in Algeria no longer relates to its youth and these young people are full of hatred and violence. That's what I explore in the film: both the woman who is assaulted and the man who assaults her are victims.\"</p> <p><em>Softly One Saturday Morning</em> is beautifully shot and subtly directed in a way that enables Djama to portray the reality of modern-day Algeria. It is an existence filled with petty frustrations (the difficulty of getting a plumber to fix a broken tank) and humiliation at the hands of incompetent state authorities. When Myassa reports her attempted rape to the police chief, his first response is to laugh. Throughout, there is an undercurrent of machismo.</p> <p>\"A few people have mentioned the name of [feminist film director] Virginie Despentes to me but she has quite a violent approach, whereas I'm not about settling scores,\" says Djama.\"I just want to put it all on the table.\"</p> <p>In fact, she cites her most powerful influence as Ken Loach: \"I adore him and that kind of social realism.\"</p> <p>For all her success, the film industry in Algeria is still in its infancy. According to Djama, there are no film schools in her home country, which makes it almost impossible to employ Algerian technicians. S<em>oftly One Saturday Morning</em> had to be made with financial backing from Europe. Was she worried about how the film would be received in Algeria?</p> <p>\"Yes, but the Algerian Press Service [the equivalent of the Press Association] was the first to cover its release. It does the authorities no favours to be seen as censors. What's happening in Algeria is much more subtle than that: it's auto-censorship.\"</p> <p>As one of the few women working in her field, Djama is keen to be a role model for aspiring film-makers. \"There are no heroes in Algeria, only martyrs,\" she says. \"When [Algerian athlete] Taoufik Makhloufi won the 1500m at the Olympics, the race wasn't even shown on domestic television. He wasn't supported by his country.\"</p> <p>Djama says she would like to be \"internationally recognised\". At the same time, she feels \"completely African but also Maghrebi \u2013 my influences are Arab and Muslim. And I'm very happy about that.\" </p> <h2><strong>Djama's directors to watch out for</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Tariq Teguia</strong>, director of <em>Inland</em>, a poetic reflection on the state of contemporary Algeria.</p> <p><strong>Nadir Mokn\u00e8che</strong>, whose drama <em>Viva Algeria</em> focuses on three women caught between the modern world and fundamentalist Islam.</p> <p><strong>Malek Bensma\u00efl</strong>, director of <em>La Chine est encore loin</em>, which chronicles everyday life in the village where the war for Algerian independence began.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing in Mary Sibande's background suggested she would one day be <a href=\"http://www.gallerymomo.com/artists/mary-sibande/images/index/\" title=\"\">one of South Africa's most interesting artists</a>. Brought up by her grandparents in the township of Barberton, Mpumalanga, she went to a school at which art wasn't even taught. And then Nelson Mandela was released. \"I was 11 at the time. We'd been brought up with the attitude that things were the way they were and we should just deal with it. If our mothers questioned things, they were thrown in jail. But suddenly we were able to question things. Part of what I'm doing is celebrating questioning.\"</p> <p>In the new South Africa, black children could go to white schools, which Sibande promptly did. \"I guess that's where my aspirations came from. I wanted to be like them. I wanted to blend in. But I couldn't because of my skin colour.\"</p> <p>In her fourth year at university \u2013 she went to study fashion but ended up in fine art \u2013 her grandmother started talking to her about being a maid. \"I knew this, but it didn't stick. You think it's normal. All the women in my family were maids. And here I am, born in 1982, and my destiny is totally different and I have this freedom to be what I want to be. But my grandmother, she spoke about all the things she wished she could have been.\"</p> <p>It was this that gave Sibande the idea for \"Sophie\", an idealised maid dressed in Victorian crinolines. She had a mannequin cast from her own body and shot it in different poses. \"With her eyes closed. That, for me, illustrated the idea of aspiring and wishing.\" The photographs were then blown up as <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/10/view/11641/mary-sibande.html\" title=\"\">billboards</a> and exhibited around Johannesburg during the World Cup.</p> <p>\"I was playing with the idea of the dead queen. As soon as she dies, she's replaced with another one so the throne is forever occupied. I was looking at this relay of maids from one generation to another. My mother had to pass it on. But things are changing in South Africa so I didn't inherit it. Instead, I felt this need to celebrate these women.\"</p> <p>People were confused by the pictures. \"They wondered if they were adverts, because they used the same language as advertising. And why, if she's a maid, was she wearing such a big dress. There was an amazing reaction from people.\"</p> <p>Sibande has had <a href=\"http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-awards-13-artist-research-fellowships\" title=\"\">a residency at the Smithsonian </a>in Washington and exhibited in Europe, but being an artist in South Africa is different and challenging, she says, though also exciting . \"The market is just emerging here. It's growing. And we can grow with it. It's a beautiful space. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.\"</p> <p><strong>Three South African artists she admires</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/nicholas_hlobo/\" title=\"\"><strong>Nicholas Hlobo</strong></a>, from Johannesburg.</p> <p><a href=\"http://seshee.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Dineo Bopape</strong></a>, who uses video, collage and installation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://davidkrutprojects.com/artists/lawrence-lemaoana\" title=\"\"><strong>Lawrence Lemaoana</strong></a>, a rugby player turned artist, who explores ideas of masculinity.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a teenager, my mother overheard me telling my peers that I was Jamaican, a clearly absurd statement from a half-Ghanaian, half-English girl whose first name is one of the most common in a major African language.</p> <p>My mother, born and raised in Ghana, was mortified. Although in part I was living out the now well-documented struggle of mixed race youngsters to grasp their identity, mainly I was just embarrassed. It wasn't cool to be African in those days and in my ignorant teenage way, I was acting out a much bigger crisis of confidence, one that had been swallowing Africans and spitting them out as permanent economic migrants in Europe and America ever since the end of colonialism.</p> <p>My family left Ghana in 1962, and in those days, leaving was permanent. Flights were few and expensive and spare cash was instead sent back home, establishing a remittance economy that exists to this day. Life abroad, in London in the case of my mother's family, meant access to a stable income, reliable healthcare, plentiful food and a credible education. Meanwhile, many African states began falling apart.</p> <p>The 90s, when I was so quick to deny any association with Africa, was the decade when wars from Sierra Leone to Rwanda formed one of the most lethal periods in African history since the end of the slave trade. It culminated in the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/333429\" title=\"\"><em>Economist</em></a> dedicating a notorious cover in 2000 to what it described as \"the hopeless continent\", claiming that across Africa \"floods, famine\u2026 government-sponsored thuggery, and poverty and pestilence continue unabated\".</p> <p>Revolving door alternations between civilian and military rule continued in countries ranging from Nigeria to Burundi, Chad to Congo. The World Bank was offering financial bailouts, but with the condition that countries accepted the humiliating label of \"highly indebted poor country\". In Ghana <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20236241~menuPK:488504~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:258644,00.html\" title=\"\">HIPC</a>, as it was popularly known, became a term of derision and a symbol of battered pride.</p> <p>The sparkling literary talent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a> has said: \"If I had not grown up in Nigeria, if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I, too, would think Africa was a place of beautiful landscape, beautiful animals and incomprehensible people fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and Aids, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind white foreigner.</p> <p>\"The consequence of the single story is this,\" Adichie continues. \"It robs people of dignity.\"</p> <p>For many Africans, the whole ideology that the western world was more sophisticated became internalised into a kind of inferiority complex. One of my uncles, when he returned to London after a period of schooling in Ghana, simply exclaimed: \"Back to civilisation.\" Anyone who could left and the subsequent brain drain only served to make matters worse.</p> <p>The flight of Africans from their own nations fuelled cartoon-like perceptions of the continent abroad, in which the <em>Economist</em> was far from alone. And this was the context in which I grew up. Pretending to be Jamaican seemed a sensible solution at the time.</p> <p>For my mother, that was the wake-up call she needed to organise our first trip to the west African land of her birth, an essential re-education in our roots. In 1995, we visited the Ghanaian capital, Accra, for the first time. I remember the usual things that people comment on when visiting equatorial African nations for the first time \u2013 the assault of hot air when stepping off the plane, which I confused with engine heat, the smell of spice and smoked fish on the air, and \u2013 most significantly for me \u2013 the fact that everyone was black. It sounds obvious but I had never really seen officials in uniform \u2013 immigration authorities, police, customs officers \u2013 with black skin. I don't think I had realised that there was a world in which black people could be in charge.</p> <p>That first trip shaped my future in ways I could never have imagined. In the almost two decades that followed, I have moulded all educational and professional decisions into the form of a road that would lead me back to Africa. I devoured African literature, studied African politics, wrote my thesis on African women and political power, worked in development, law and now journalism, all with a focus on Africa. A decade ago, a job with an international development foundation led me to Senegal, where I lived for two years. Then, in February, I moved to west Africa for the second time, now setting up shop in the city of my very first trip to the continent, Accra.</p> <p>Friends and relatives in the UK, even those who share my Ghanaian heritage, have repeatedly expressed astonishment at my desire to live in Africa. But the view from Ghana could not be more different. Far from being original, I find myself part of a narrative told with increasing fluency, as a steady stream of other European and American passport holders of African descent arrive at Ghana's Kotoka International airport, collect their worldly possessions from shipping containers at Tema port and search for homes in Accra's popular residential areas \u2013 Cantonments, East Legon and the Spintex Road.</p> <p>They pay up to two years' rent upfront in dollars, at London prices, and find jobs with the growing number of international companies and professional service providers in Ghana or, more commonly, start their own business. At some point, this ceased to be an individual journey and instead became a phenomenon with its own label \u2013 \"returnee\".</p> <p>There is a symmetry to the journey that returnees are making, which speaks volumes about the state of Africa today. Our parents left \u2013 exactly 50 years ago in my case \u2013 fleeing deteriorating economic conditions and limited opportunities at home. Now their children are forming an exodus from the crisis-ridden eurozone, four years of recession and the dogged perception of inequality and discrimination in the west. \"Who needs the glass ceiling when you could be running your own business in one of the world's fastest-growing economies, enjoying the warm weather and surrounded by your own people?\" one returnee to Ghana told me. \"There is no contest.\"</p> <p>The facts about Africa's change in fortunes are dazzling. Dubbed the \"next Asia\" for its rapid growth, the IMF forecasts that seven of the world's fastest-growing economies over the next five years will be in Africa; Ethiopia, Mozambique,&#xa0;Tanzania, Congo, Ghana, Zambia and Nigeria are expected to expand by more than 6% a year until 2015.</p> <p>The resource-rich continent has benefited from a boom in commodity prices, ranging from cocoa to gold, but has also increased manufacturing output, which has doubled over the past decade. Surveys by firms such as Ernst &amp; Young, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey all describe how the telecom, banking, retail, construction and oil and gas industries are booming, sending foreign direct investment to dramatic new highs, while themselves representing an eagerness among global firms to attract business in Africa.</p> <p>In Ghana, whose <a href=\"http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ghana-and-nigeria-among-worlds-fastest-growing-economies-in-20122013/16062/\" title=\"\">economy is one of the strongest</a>, with current growth of around 9%, the City of London is arriving in force. Investment banks, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_(law)\" title=\"\">magic circle</a> law firms and international consultancies are permanent fixtures at Accra's plush hotels, where they are literally queuing up to tout for business.</p> <p>With the growth in GDP comes a burgeoning middle class. The number of households earning more than $3,000 per year is expected to reach 100 million by 2015, putting the continent on a par with India. A recent report by the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/\" title=\"\">African Development Bank</a> on Africa over the next 50 years predicts that \"most African countries will attain upper middle income status, and the extreme forms of poverty will have been eliminated\".</p> <p>It's hard to overstate the impact of mobile technology on this transformation. Mobile penetration in Africa is now around 50%, forming the fastest-growing mobile market in the world. There are 100 million in Nigeria alone, a country that 20 years ago had only 100,000 phone lines. Telecoms companies now compete fiercely for almost 700 million consumers, not just to make calls, but for mobile money transfers, banking or even tracking agricultural and commodities data for farmers.</p> <p>Seven per cent of Africans have access to broadband, but this is expected to reach 99% by 2060. New infrastructure such as the fibre-optic submarine cables now connecting south and east Africa, and due to connect west Africa this year, are playing a role in transforming productivity and making online technology realistic for African&#xa0;nations.</p> <p>There are comical collisions between new technology and old problems. In Ghana, whose impressive GDP growth has not been met with the requisite increase in national grid capacity, people are using Twitter to monitor the frequency of power outages. \"Lights off\", as it is colloquially, almost affectionately known, is endemic in many countries. Ghana's power failures pale in comparison to Nigeria, where Lagossians say that if they have four hours of continuous mains electricity, then it is a good day.</p> <p>These contradictions are the reality in most African countries. Economic growth is neither designed nor distributed evenly. And, in reality, it has not been matched by the kind of improvement in living conditions that many of my grandparents' generation expected when they witnessed independence from colonial rule.</p> <p>The reality is that many African governments still serve primarily as agencies for the distribution of foreign aid. As the Ugandan journalist Andrew Mwenda has said: \"Most of the rich countries are attracted to Africa's poverty rather than its wealth. And in the process they end up subsidising our failures, rather than rewarding our&#xa0;accomplishments.\"</p> <p>There is plenty of poverty to be attracted to. Average life expectancy is still only 56 years, child mortality remains high at 127 per 1,000 live births in 2010, and overall literacy rates are only 67%. Africa's economic growth is often described as \"jobless\" for its failure to create jobs, in particular for the 60% of Africans aged between 15 and 24 who are unemployed and who, a recent report found, have given up on finding work.</p> <p>With these seemingly incompatible realities existing side by side, there is increasingly a PR war for the image of Africa overseas. The <em>Economist</em>, still apologising for its <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/333429\" title=\"\">\"hopeless continent\" issue in 2000</a>, recently branded Africa \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21541015\" title=\"\">hopeful</a>\" instead. Most international news outlets now have programmes or seasons specifically designed to champion positive news stories in Africa. The BBC runs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15340893\" title=\"\"><em>African Dream</em></a>, a series about successful African entrepreneurs, while CNN has <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/africanvoices/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>African Voices</em></a>.</p> <p>But it is not the role of the media to sell a rebranded version of Africa, any more than it was right to paint it as the heart of darkness in the past. The problems remain and they are real. Since I moved to Ghana in February as west Africa correspondent for the Guardian and Observer, there have been two military coups. Everyone living in Ghana \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 is lumped together in a permanent jumble of terrible traffic, unreliable water and frequent power outages. Poverty is real here, there is hunger and disease, and there is no welfare state. Far from setting out policies that promise any real social change, many African governments are focused instead on administering foreign aid and directing showcase infrastructure projects that do little to benefit ordinary people.</p> <p>As a journalist, I navigate both these worlds, and it is not always easy. When I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/afua-hirsch-ghana-sex-attitudes\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> column</a> about attitudes towards sex in Ghana, I was bombarded with criticism from both ends of the spectrum. On one side, Ghanaians claimed I perpetuated outdated stereotypes by describing sex as taboo and often transactional in nature. On the other were NGO workers who complained that I had failed to mention female genital mutilation and maternal mortality, in their view central features of the African sexual experience.</p> <p>The battle for the image of Africa \u2013 helpless and underdeveloped versus rapidly emerging economic giant \u2013 often gets personal. Journalists frequently, and rightly, draw criticism for describing a continent of 54 nations and breathtaking diversity as one country. But some commentators are quick to employ a definition of what it means to be African that excludes returnees like me for being too fair-skinned, too British or too westernised.</p> <p>But being African is an increasingly complex identity. As someone who has been told she is too black to be British, and too British to be African, I am strongly against the notion that identity can be policed by some external standard. And I am not alone. The term \"Afropolitan\" is beginning to enter the mainstream; one definition describes it as: \"An African from the continent of dual nationality, an African born in the diaspora, or an African who identifies with their African and European heritage and mixed culture.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter whether they are born abroad or not; the important thing is their global perspective on issues, as well as their mixed cultural identity.\"</p> <p>The enthusiasm with which people of African heritage around the world are embracing their roots has reached the level of a cultural resurgence. In stark contrast to my teenage Africa-denial, a significant number of international cultural icons are now African. The black British music scene is dominated by rappers with Ghanaian heritage \u2013 Tinchy Stryder, Dizzee Rascal and Sway. Azonto, a popular Ghanaian dance, has begun colonising clubs in London, a growing number of which now include Afrobeat on regular rotation.</p> <p>This is not to dismiss the inequalities that still exist between Africa's increasingly visible international, urban elite \u2013 a category many returnees fall into \u2013 and the vast majority of Africans.</p> <p>The reality is that, on so many levels, access to the west is still a fault line for determining privilege. For example, entrepreneurs in west Africa currently find that borrowing money for their businesses typically comes with interest rates of up to 30%, an unrealistic burden by any standard. Returnees, on the other hand, who have access to loans from foreign banks, can enjoy single-digit interest rates, effectively dominating local markets.</p> <p>Africa is entering its new dawn, like all societies, with these divisions and inequalities as part of the story. For me, there is a very literal sense with which the past meets the future. On the weekends, from my home in Accra, I often visit a town in the mountains behind the city \u2013 Aburi \u2013 where my ancestors lived. My grandmother tells me the story of how her grandmother used to roll palm oil in barrels down the hill and on to the coast. These days, I like to visit a restaurant there, set up by a British Ghanaian returnee, and eat Ghanaian food \u2013 or pizza, depending on my mood \u2013 alongside so many other fugitives from the polluted city, enjoying the cool mountain air.</p> <p>When she reached the ocean, my great-great grandmother would board a boat westwards along the coast to Takoradi, where she was from. These days, Takoradi is a hub of activity for barrels of a different kind of oil \u2013 crude \u2013 which have transformed Ghana's economy into one of the fastest growing in the world. I think she would be happy that her great-great granddaughter had returned to see that transformation for herself.</p>",
  "<p>If <a href=\"http://www.riaadmoosa.co.za/public/index.php?ads=index\" title=\"\">Riaad Moosa</a> ever performs standup at the Edinburgh festival, he says, this could be useful material. \"What do you mean you're Muslim and Indian and you're from South Africa? That could be a peg to build a whole show around.\"</p> <p>Moosa has other identities as a doctor and an actor: he starred in the&#xa0;hit comedy <a href=\"http://www.materialmovie.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Material</em></a> and is currently filming an adaptation of Nelson Mandela's autobiography <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/19/mandela-idris-elba-south-africa\" title=\"\"><em>Long&#xa0;Walk to Freedom</em></a>.</p> <p>He also belongs to a <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/tag/comedy\" title=\"\">wildly popular generation of comedians</a> who, far from tiptoeing around South Africa's fraught racial politics, dive in headfirst to defuse the hatred with humour.</p> <p>His talent for comedy was evident in gigs while he was studying at medical school. He started work as a doctor but recalls: \"What I wanted to do was the comedy and I found that. I found my bliss, I think.\" Now he wins awards, plays to sell-out audiences with shows such as <em>Strictly Halaal</em> and <em>Riaad Moosa for the Baracka</em> and has a slot on the satirical TV show <em>Late Nite News</em>. He has tackled thorny subjects such as Islamophobia after the 11 September terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Eighteen years after apartheid, South Africa remains one of the world's most unequal societies but, as London's Olympic opening ceremony suggested, a sign of a nation's political maturity is its ability to laugh at itself.</p> <p>Moosa reflects: \"Racial humour is very predominant in South African standup, but I think that's as a result of our history and us coming to terms with what we've been through. When we started standup, we would mostly perform for white audiences and over the years we've started to see a wider variety of people and even specific genres where you have specifically Indian shows and Xhosa or Zulu or Afrikaans shows. \"However, things are changing again as now we are beginning to have more common experience as&#xa0;South Africans. Remember, we really&#xa0;grew up separately; our life experience was very different because of segregation. So I think comedy is a good space to work those things out and educate everyone about the different experiences and different race groups in South Africa.\"</p> <p>His humour exploits identity politics to the full. \"I use myself as a template for my comedy. So first my background as a Muslim man, my being a doctor, I talk about my family quite a lot, my kids. Anything that resonates with me I talk about. The important thing is it should be able&#xa0;to work in a family setting.\"</p> <p>Comedy thrives on mocking the powerful, he continues, but in South Africa everyone still considers themselves an underdog. \"The hierarchy hasn't really been sorted out as yet. It depends on perspective, what people will laugh at. We were working these things out as a nation. I think comedy tells a lot; you can tell what people think by what they laugh at.\"</p> <p>The dominance of American and British culture on South African TV means that comedians from those countries can make local references and still raise a laugh. The reverse is not yet true for comedians from South Africa. But this can change, Moosa believes. \"I think the more we go out and the more we do our shows and talk about our experience, the better it will become. It's down to South Africans to start performing on an international stage more and more.\"</p> <p><strong>South African comedians he most admires</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.trevornoah.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></a>, who made a successful <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/trevor-noah-stand-up-1612/1377327/\" title=\"\">guest appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno</a> and is looking to make it big in America. \"He's already made a huge impact.

  "<h2><strong>1 HIPPO WATER ROLLER</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>The <a href=\"http://hipporoller.org/\" title=\"\">Hippo water roller</a> is a&#xa0;drum that can be rolled on the ground, making it easier for those without access to taps to haul larger amounts of water faster.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Two out of every five people in Africa have no nearby water facilities and are forced to walk long distances to reach water sources. Traditional methods of balancing heavy loads of water on the head limit the amount people can carry, and cause long-term spinal injuries. Women and children usually carry out these time-consuming tasks, missing out on educational and economic opportunities. In extreme cases, they can be at increased risks of assault or rape when travelling long distances.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>The Hippo roller can be filled with water which is then pushed or pulled using a handle. The weight of the water is spread evenly so a full drum carries almost five times more than traditional containers, but weighs in at half the usual 20kg, allowing it to be transported faster. A steel handle has been designed to allow two&#xa0;pushers for steeper hills. \"Essentially it alleviates the suffering people endure just to collect water and take it home. Boreholes or wells can dry out but people can still use the same roller [in other wells]. One roller will typically serve a household of seven for five to seven years,\" said project manager Grant Gibbs.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Around 42,000 Hippo rollers have been sold in 21 African countries and demand exceeds supply. Costing $125 each, they are distributed through NGOs. A mobile manufacturing unit is set to begin making them in Tanzania. Nelson Mandela has made a \"personal appeal\" for supporting for the project, saying it \"will positively change the lives of millions of our fellow South&#xa0;Africans\". <strong>Monica Mark</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>2 THE iCOW APP </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>To harness the power of mobile phones to encourage best practice for dairy farmers and increase milk production.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Small-scale dairy farmers often living in remote areas don't have access to valuable information about latest prices of milk or cattle, and they may not keep accurate records of important details such as their cows' gestation periods or their livestock's lineage \u2013 often resulting in inbreeding and disease.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Created by Kenyan farmer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wD8pzIcCJk\" title=\"\">Su&#xa0;Kahumbu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a> is an app that works on the type of basic mobile phones farmers own. Each animal is registered with the service, which then sends SMS reminders to the farmer about milking schedules, immunisation dates and tips about nutrition and breeding or information about local vets or artificial insemination providers. UK-based foundation the <a href=\"http://indigotrust.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Indigo Trust</a> helped fund iCow's development. Its executive Loren Treisman says: \"It's exciting to see a technology-driven project targeting such an unexpected constituency. Farmers have been empowered to improve their own lives through accessing critical agricultural information as opposed to depending on aid. What particularly excited us is that as a social enterprise, the iCow team have a sustainable business model which will enable them to expand rapidly and maximise their reach and impact without dependence on ongoing&#xa0;funding.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> \"The wonderful thing with iCow is that by the time you have used the app and adhered to all the instructions, your cows end up healthier, bigger and stronger. They can easily fetch you more money in the marketplace. Every smart farmer will use iCow,\" a small-scale farmer based in the cental highlands of Kenya told <em>Forbes </em>magazine. <strong>Ian Tucker</strong></p> <h2><strong>3 FARMER MANAGED NATURAL REGENERATION </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR), which restores existing trees on drought-stricken land, to improve Senegal's dwindling harvests.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Senegal is suffering its third drought of the decade, resulting in reduced crops and inflated food prices. The World Food Programme assisted more than 9 million people in the Sahel region of West Africa this year, including 800,000 in Senegal.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Attempts to tackle the resulting problem of soil fertility have largely flopped so far. Trees planted as part of reforestation schemes have seen only a 5% success rate and fallowing is not an option, with 80% of African farmers owning under two hectares of land, which need to be utilised year in, year out. This puts the emphasis on reinvigorating the stumps of nitrogen-fixing trees, which were formerly cleared to maximise crop space. Farmers are thus encouraged to prune the stems and branches of trees like <em>Faidherbia albida</em>, giving new life to the vegetation already there.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> FMNR is an inexpensive way for farmers to make improvements with the resources they already have, increasing millet harvests from 430kg to 750kg a hectare, and saving money on fertilisers, with restored trees producing leaf litter (forming humus) and giving shade to livestock (for manure). It gives the ecosystem a holistic boost, encouraging wildlife like bush pigeons and rabbits to return, and providing welcome human benefits such as wood cuttings&#xa0;for cooking and new food sources such as tamarind. <strong>Mina Holland</strong></p> <h2><strong>4 PORTABLE WATER PUMPS </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Portable irrigation technology helping sub-Saharan smallholder farmers grow crops out of season.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> When it comes to food supply, Africa faces enormous instability due to unpredictable climate and poor resources. Only 6% of Africa's cultivated land is irrigated, limiting the volume of crops that can be grown out of season, but increased access to irrigation systems stands to increase food productivity by up to&#xa0;50%.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org/\" title=\"\">Kick Start</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in irrigation technology, is making portable water pumps accessible to farming communities across Africa \u2013 most significantly in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali. These cost anything from $35 to $95 but, putting the emphasis on entrepreneurship, Kick Start are selling the pumps to farmers rather than giving them away.</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Kick Start told <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Atlantic</em> </a>that, since 1991, their pumps have lifted 667,000 people out of poverty, helping to \"create an entrepreneurial middle class, starting with the family farm\". They have pumped new revenues equivalent to 0.6% of the GDP in Kenya&#xa0;alone. <strong>MH</strong></p> <h2><strong>5 THE CARDIOPAD </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>A computer tablet diagnoses heart disease in rural households with limited access to medical services.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cardiovascular diseases kill some 17 million worldwide annually. In many African countries, those at risk often have to spend huge amounts of money and travel hundreds of miles to reach heart specialists concentrated in main urban centres. The Cameroon Heart Foundation has noted a \"sharp spike\" in heart disease among its 20 million-strong population, which is served by fewer than 40 heart&#xa0;specialists.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>A program on the Cardiopad, designed by 24-year-old Cameroonian engineer Arthur Zang, collects signals generated by the rhythmic contraction&#xa0;and expansion of a patient's heart. Electrodes are fixed near the patient's heart. Africa's first fully touch-screen medical tablet then produces a moving graphical depiction of the cardiac cycle, which is wirelessly&#xa0;transmitted over GSM networks to a cardiologist for interpretation and diagnosis. \"I&#xa0;designed the Cardiopad to resolve a&#xa0;pressing problem. If a cardiac exam is prescribed for a patient in Garoua in the north of the country, they are&#xa0;obliged to travel&#xa0;a distance&#xa0;of over 900km to Yaound\u00e9 or Douala,\" Zang says.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>At the Laquintinie, one of the country's biggest hospitals, cardiologist Dr Daniel Lemogoum said that, in a recent survey, three in every five persons who uses&#xa0;the Cardiopad has been&#xa0;diagnosed as hypertensive, or at risk of heart diseases. \"These are people who&#xa0;would not necessarily have been aware they are hypertensive. It means sudden&#xa0;deaths might be&#xa0;preventable.\" <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>6 NIGERIAN COMPUTER TABLET</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> <strong>Idea: </strong><a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/pre-order-inye-tablet/\" title=\"\">The Inye computer tablet</a> that can connect to the internet via a dongle surmounts the price and infrastructure barriers in one go.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tech-savvy youths, who make up the bulk of the continent's population, face being left behind by a growing \"digital divide\". While much of Africa has skipped the desktop internet era and gone straight to mobile tech, big name brands retail in price ranges that remain out of reach for a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Infrastructure is also straining under rapid population growth, and wireless and broadband technology is not yet widely available in many public places.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>Co-founders Saheed Adepoju and Anibe Agamah, aimed to plug a gap in affordable mobile devices with the Inye tablet in Nigeria. They say its strongest selling point is its price \u2013 currently around \u00a3200. Run on Android systems, it can be connected to the internet via widely used dongles rather than wirelessly. IT provider <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/\" title=\"\">Encipher</a> also offers add-on bundles from games to specifically tailored apps. Local developers are designing apps that address issues such as HIV, water and sanitation and education.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>The group is now retailing its <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/inye2/\" title=\"\">Inye 2 model</a> to popular demand. Long-term, there are plans to expand beyond Africa's most populous country. <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>7 ETHANOL COOKING OIL PLANT</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Refining locally sourced cassava into ethanol fuel to provide cleaner cooking fuel.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Forests in Africa are being cut down at a rate of 4m hectares a year, more than twice the worldwide average rate. Some of this is fuelled by demand for wood and charcoal, which the UN estimates is still used in almost 80% of African homes as a cheaper option to gas. The smoke from cooking using these solid fuels also triggers respiratory problems that cause nearly 2 million deaths in the developing world each year.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong><a href=\"http://www.cleanstarmozambique.com/\" title=\"\">CleanStar Mozambique</a>, a partnership between CleanStar and Danish industrial enzymes producer <a href=\"http://www.novozymes.com/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Novozymes</a>, has opened the world's first sustainable cooking-fuel plant in Mozambique. CleanStar has steered clear of monoculture crops in favour of sustainable farming methods. One-sixth of the final yield comes from locally harvested cassava, which requires farmers to plant in rotation with other edible crops to keep the soil fertile. A Sofala Province-based plant transforms the products into ethanol, which is sold on the local market along with adapted cooking stoves also produced by the company.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>\"City women are tired of watching charcoal prices rise, carrying dirty fuel, and waiting for the day that they can afford a safe gas stove and a reliable supply of imported cylinders,\" CleanStar marketing director Thelma Venichand said. \"They are ready to buy a modern cooking device that uses clean, locally made fuel, performs well and saves them time and money.\" The plant aims to produce 2m litres of fuel annually, and reach 120,000 households within three years. <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>8 REFUGEES UNITED</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Danish brothers David and Christopher Mikkelsen founded <a href=\"http://www.refunite.org/\" title=\"\">Refugees United</a> in 2008 after they helped a young Afghan refugee in Copenhagen search for lost family members. Realising the futile paper trail that many refugees were faced with when looking for missing relatives, the brothers wanted to find an easier way that refugees could trace their families.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are 43 million forcibly displaced people worldwide with hundreds of thousands of refugee families scattered across the globe. Before 2008 all family tracing was done by refugee agencies, which still rely on paper forms and postal systems to try to locate people. There was no online global data bank that could be accessed or used by refugees themselves.</p> <p><strong>Technique: </strong>Refugees United is an online search tool, where refugees can create a free profile and start their search for family via an online database using the internet or a mobile phone. It works through an open-source model, partnering with not-for-profit refugee organisations including the Red Cross and the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a> as well as corporate tech partners such as Erickson and Google.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>More than 100,000 people are registered on the Refugees United family tracing platform. It is available in dozens of different languages and contains searchable information on refugees from more than 82 countries. It is currently helping 15,000 people trace family in the Kakuma refugee camp, home to 80,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, in Kenya. The main challenge is actually reaching the refugees, often the poorest of the poor, who don't have ready access to computers or mobile phones. <strong>Annie Kelly</strong></p> <h2>9 <strong>DIY AID SUPPLIES</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To make Africa self-sufficient in emergency relief supplies.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> For a continent so in need of quick, affordable emergency relief, not to mention so riddled with unemployment, there's a cruel irony about the provenance of emergency supplies. Smaller African manufacturers have traditionally been unable to compete with Chinese prices, or to meet the vast demand for emergency goods within Africa. As a result, aid agencies such as <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a> have forged links with foreign producers better able to produce these supplies at the scale, cost and quality required. Yet this inevitably requires longer lead times and higher transportation costs than sourcing goods locally \u2013 and Africans lose out on the work.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> is an organisation that wants to make aid destined for Africa available within Africa, from blankets and mosquito nets to basic cooking equipment and hygiene kits. The organisation acts as an intermediary between large aid agencies and African producers, putting together packages of aid supplies sourced locally. This has been very effective in Kenya, where <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> have supplied 5,000 locally sourced emergency kits to <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.org.uk/\" title=\"\">World Vision</a> and another 14,000 jerry cans to <a href=\"http://crs.org/africa/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, who distributed them in Dadaab, the refugee camp near the Somalian border.</p> <p>Founder <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/david-dickie/\" title=\"\">David Dickie</a> says: \"Aid is not working. I'm trying to turn the market on its head by creating jobs in Africa. Building this capacity in Africa will make a real difference to agencies, to the beneficiaries of the aid and to local businesses\u2026 [It] is a very efficient way of bringing together the development and humanitarian agendas.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Advance Aid's work in Kenya in 2011 marks the first time that emergency relief goods produced in Africa have been provided for an African emergency, with 80% of goods sourced within the country. It put $1.5bn into the Kenyan economy and brought orders to 12 local manufacturers. <strong>MH</strong></p> <h2><strong>10 SICKLE CELL DISEASE RESEARCH</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To carry out scientific research on sickle cell disease (SCD) and show that large-scale, cutting-edge genomic studies are possible in Africa.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Every year, 300,000 children worldwide are born with SCD, a genetic blood disorder that can result in severe anaemia. Seventy percent of these children, or 210,000, are born in Africa. Tanzania has one of the highest annual birth rates of SCD in the world and without treatment up to 90% of these children will die in early childhood. However, many of these deaths could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. A better understanding of the genetic and environmental mechanisms of the&#xa0;disease will lead to improved diagnosis and therapies.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/julie-makani\" title=\"\">Dr Julie Makani</a> from Muhimbili University in Tanzania is working with the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellcome Trust</a> to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better understand the genetic and environmental factors affecting SCD. The Muhimbili Wellcome Programme originally aimed to follow 400 children but is now following 2,500, making it one of the largest, biomedical SCD resources in the world. Dr Makani says that the work \"provides validation that it is possible to conduct genomic research in Africa\".</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/people/lorna-casselton/\" title=\"\">Professor Lorna Casselton</a> from the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\" title=\"\">Royal Society</a> says: \"SCD has a severe toll on Africa, and high-quality research to lessen the burden is much needed. Dr Makani stands as a role model for other young African scientists wishing to make a difference.\" <strong>Olivia Honigsbaum</strong></p> <h2><strong>11 M-PEPEA</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To offer emergency credit through mobile phones to people who don't have access to credit cards or bank loans.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Credit cards are still rarely available to Kenyans and bank loans are only authorised for large amounts of cash or as investments for buying homes or starting businesses. Often the only source of emergency cash is loan sharks, increasingly big business in Kenya, with borrowers signing ambiguous photocopied contracts and tying themselves into interest rates of 50% or more. <a href=\"http://raven.co.ke/mpepea%20services.html\" title=\"\">M-Pepea</a> was launched to try to bridge this gap.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>M-Pepea, set up in late 2010, provides its customers with emergency funds within a few hours. It partners with Kenyan businesses, with employees then able to use M-Pepea to get immediate loans of up to 20% of their monthly salary. The money is accessed through their mobile phones, with M-Pepea sending a special pin code to be used in cash machines. Money can also be collected at branches of <a href=\"https://www.safaricom.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Safaricom</a>, one of Kenya's largest mobile phone operators, and then deducted from the borrower's pay packet at&#xa0;the end of the month. M-Pepea charges around 10% interest rates on the loans, which are paid in full at the end of the&#xa0;month.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>M-Pepea has currently partnered with 20 businesses and has around 300 subscribers, and is hoping to have increased this to 20,000 by the end of 2013. Its partnership with Safaricom is encouraging but the company has run into problems with businesses defaulting. \"We're still in our initial phase, but we've seen how positively people have responded to the service,\" says David Munga, M-Pepea's 33-year-old founder. \"If, like&#xa0;many Kenyans, you've found yourself at the side of the road with a broken car, no credit card and no money in the bank, it's a way of getting yourself that money without having to get into trouble.\" <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><strong>12 THE TUTU VAN </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> The brightly coloured <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/page/prevention:%20tutu%20tester%20mobile%20unit/\" title=\"\">\"Tutu Tester\" van</a> is a mobile clinic that incorporates screening for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV into a general health check-up in order to overcome the stigma associated with these diseases.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> South Africa is at the centre of an epidemic of TB/HIV co-infections. An estimated 5.7 million people are infected with HIV and, fuelled by HIV, the country's rate of TB has increased over the last 20 years to the point where it now has the third highest TB burden in the world. In the case of HIV, <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/publications/irc-pub01/jc379-vct_en.pdf\" title=\"\">voluntary counselling and testing (VCT)</a> is vital for preventing and treating the disease. However, data from the <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/\" title=\"\">Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation</a> conducted in communities most affected by HIV shows that VCT is often inaccessible or inadequately performed. This results in missed opportunities for prevention and increased morbidity and mortality \u2013 hence the need for new control strategies to keep the epidemic in check.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> The Tutu Tester is a mobile clinic that takes sophisticated testing equipment and trained staff (including a nurse, a counsellor and an educator) into areas without adequate health facilities. By framing TB and HIV screening within a battery of other healthy living tests, including pregnancy, diabetes and hypertension, people are encouraged to get tested for the diseases. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, a leading scientist working with the foundation, says that data from these screens shows that \"the increase in TB has quite clearly tracked the increase in HIV&#xa0;rates\". Further, the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/treatment/en/\" title=\"\">Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</a> for HIV has also led to a decline in the incidence of TB. This suggests that ART programs, if sufficiently implemented, may greatly assist in reducing TB mortality.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> There is still a stigma attached to HIV and TB. But as Liz Thebus, a healthcare worker at the Tutu Tester says: \"The outside world does not know whether someone wants to be screened for HIV or diabetes. They are in that respect much more&#xa0;anonymous.\" <strong>OH</strong></p> <h2><strong>13 ORANGE SWEET POTATO</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Breeding sweet potatoes to contain betacarotene, to help in the fight against childhood blindness.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> More than 3 million children in Africa suffer from blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency; in Uganda it is estimated that 28% of children are deficient. Currently aid agencies combat this problem by giving children vitamin A supplements, but addressing this issue with a locally grown food would be more sustainable.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> A new strain of sweet potato was conventionally bred which contains between four and six times as much betacarotene as a regular sweet potato \u2013 betacarotene is converted by the body into vitamin A. The <a href=\"http://www.harvestplus.org/content/orange-sweet-potato-makes-case-biofortification-works\" title=\"\">OSP (orange sweet potato)</a> was distributed to 10,000 farming households in Uganda; at the end of the two-year study vitamin A deficiency in non-breastfeeding children aged between 12 and 35 months fell from nearly 50% to 12%. Dr Christine Holz from the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/\" title=\"\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> who led the project said: \"Overall, these results add to the growing evidence base that OSP provides large amounts of vitamin&#xa0;A in the diet.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Similar results were obtained from a sister project in Mozambique; now the scheme is being scaled up to reach 225,000 households by 2016. <strong>IT</strong></p> <h2><strong>14 SPEAKING BOOKS</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> A range of easy-to-use audio books designed to get potentially life-saving health messages out to millions of isolated people struggling with depression and mental health problems.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>In 2003, Zane Wilson, the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.sadag.org/\" title=\"\">South African Depression &amp; Anxiety Group</a> (Sadag), the country's largest mental health initiative, was horrified at how suicide rates among young South Africans were spiking. Mental health carries a huge social stigma across Africa and information booklets designed to help people with depression or mental health problems simply weren't working, especially in remote communities with high illiteracy rates.&#xa0;People weren't getting the help they needed \u2013 a 2009 study showed that only a quarter of the 16.5% of South Africans suffering from&#xa0;mental health problems had received any kind of treatment.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>Speaking Books created a range of free books with simple audio buttons talking the user through each page. The first Speaking Book, voiced by South African actress and celebrity Lillian Dube, was called <em>Suicide Shouldn't Be a Secret</em> and focused on how depression is a real and treatable illness, encouraging people to get help when they need it.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Speaking Books have now produced 48 titles in 24 different languages and are now used in 20 African countries across the continent. The books now tackle a number of critical healthcare issues outside of suicide prevention such as HIV and Aids, malaria, maternal health and clinical trials. Speaking Books has also expanded to China, India and South America. \"The situation we face in rural South Africa is the same in any other African country \u2013 low literacy compounded by lack of access to services and affordable healthcare,\" says Wilson. \"This means that patients are often not able to get help for many health problems. We believe that this interactive, durable, high-quality, hardcover book engages the user or patient, and allows them to build self-confidence and skills with a simple action plan\". <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><strong>15 NARRATIVE EXPOSURE THERAPY</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Narrative exposure therapy (NET) for Uganda's former child soldiers, encouraging storytelling to help&#xa0;come to terms with their experiences.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Abducted and forced into conscription by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/joseph-kony-lords-resistance-army\" title=\"\">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA), over 25,000 Ugandan children were pushed into violent atrocities during a civil war that lasted 22 years, often killing their own families. The majority were left with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \u2013 with symptoms including depression, flashbacks and suicidal thoughts. Moreover, hostility from their former communities has left countless child soldiers alienated, making PTSD a longer, lonelier battle.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>NET was introduced to Ugandan child soldiers as a means of making conscious their deeply repressed traumas. The technique highlights the importance of story, creating a kind of fiction from real-life experience as a vehicle for coming to terms with it. <a href=\"http://www.nicktaussig.com/about\" title=\"\">Nick Taussig</a>, co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.mtaala.org/Mtaala_Foundation.html\" title=\"\">Mtaala Foundation</a> \u2013 a charity that sets up educational communities in Uganda, empowering Ugandans to help their own youth \u2013 says that narrative exposure, though not a new concept, appeals to Ugandan culture, \"There's a strong oral tradition in Uganda, and these treatments build on that by committing the children's stories to paper, investing them with added meaning.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong><a href=\"http://www.preventionaction.org/research/power-storytelling-treating-trauma-child-soldiers/5833\" title=\"\">A study of 85 former child soldiers</a> conducted by Bielefeld University, Germany, demonstrated that 80% of those who underwent NET showed clinical improvements. <strong>MH</strong></p>",
  "<p>Having inspected more than 2,000 physical education departments in secondary schools and evaluated the practice in primary schools and initial teacher training as one of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools, the recent coverage of the \"school sport\" issue has left feelings of deflation.</p> <p>The flood of recent comment reveals a low level of understanding. The debate is currently defined around \"competitive team games\" and \"Indian dance\" (or whatever) with no hint of any understanding of why these aspects are educationally \"good\" or \"less good\". Games and dance form only a part of the process needed to develop children's physical competence, or \"literacy\", a term that may assist non-specialists to get on the inside of the process.</p> <p>The superficiality of the debate has leant on thinking from the 19th century, focusing on the \"character-building\" nature of games, but dismisses dance as a pastime irrelevant to pupils' development. But in physical education, dance is a critical component; there is nothing else in the PE curriculum that develops pupils' ability to use the body to communicate moods, feelings and ideas \u2013 and these concepts merge into study of the arts. The chance fact that \"Indian dance\" was selected also shows a certain disdain for the movement patterns developed in other cultures; rather unfortunate to say the least.

Successive governments have failed to enact proper legislation and it appears that the current government is simply kicking the can further down the road.</p> <p>In July, I brought in a 10-minute rule bill that set out the areas in which legislation and minimum standards are required. It called for: a ban on the advertising of cosmetic surgery \u2013 a ban already in place in France; a compulsory register of practitioners and implants; an official industry regulatory body; and the approval of injected fillers such as Botox as medical device implants.

  "<p>Even people with short memories can probably just recall the excited way in which certain commentators and politicians tried to draw hopeful lessons for the British economy from the unexpected (by the very same people) success of the London Olympics.</p> <p>Personally, I shall believe the application of those lessons when I see them. But it is a Bank Holiday weekend, and before we approach what promises to be a dire economic autumn, let us pause for reflection.</p> <p>From time to time over the years I have written about the adventures of the mythical Whitehall mandarin Sir Douglas Corridor in these columns. Sir Douglas had a loyal following, although there were the usual dissenters. Humour is a funny business.</p> <p>Alas, fewer and fewer people seem to connect with that old Whitehall world, and Sir Douglas no longer comes up to town so often. So I thought it was about time to come clean with readers and offer a brief word about his&#xa0;origin.</p> <p>It all began in the 1970s, when three of the most senior officials at the Treasury were called Douglas \u2013 all of them \"Sir\", of course. There was Sir Douglas Allen, Sir Douglas Henley and Sir Douglas Wass.</p> <p>Wass succeeded Allen as permanent secretary to the Treasury, and the two that I got to know particularly well were Sir Douglas Allen (later Lord Croham) and Sir Douglas Wass. There are those who say that the character of Sir Douglas Corridor was based on Sir Douglas Wass: they may think that, but I could not possibly comment.</p> <p>Now, I recently heard a good story about Croham and Wass which I believe is of some interest in demonstrating the importance of a Rolls-Royce civil service machine, run by supremely talented people with minds of their own \u2013 the sort that the present government would like to replace with party hacks.</p> <p>The scene was the early 1970s Conservative government, under prime minister Edward, later Sir Edward, Heath. He used to be known to one and all as Ted, and was sometimes confused with the British big band leader of that&#xa0;name.</p> <p>As readers will be aware, economic policy proceeds in phases in this country. Fashions come; fashions go; fashions return. As part of the perennial battle to control inflation, the Labour governments of Harold Wilson had tried to restrain the rate of growth of incomes; indeed, \"incomes policies\" were considered a weapon in the armoury of economic policymakers.</p> <p>When the Heath government was elected in 1970, with a form of what many observers subsequently thought was \"proto-Thatcherism\", the Conservatives were going through one of their \"market forces are always best\" phases and would have nothing to do with incomes policy.</p> <p>But, hey presto, a couple of years later, inflation was once again becoming a serious problem, unemployment was rising to uncomfortable and embarrassing levels, and things looked pretty grim.</p> <p>As became increasingly obvious in later years, prime minister Heath did not have his heart in the extreme free-market policies he initially espoused during his premiership (I have no record of the views of bandleader Heath in these matters, but my goodness, he led a very good band).</p> <p>It was under Heath's premiership that the metaphor \"U-turn\" was first used to describe a change of policy. Heath called a meeting of ministers and senior civil servants (I seem to recall it was at Chequers) and said he thought that it was time to introduce an incomes policy.</p> <p>He looked directly at Sir Douglas Allen and asked: could the Treasury work on it? Yes, came the answer. Next prime ministerial question: How long would it take? My understanding is that Sir Douglas's reply was something to the effect of \"a week or so\", and that even the notoriously grumpy and impatient Heath was impressed by this.</p> <p>At this stage, dear reader, you will, I am sure, have guessed why this redoubtable Treasury mandarin was able to be so confident in his reply. Long before Heath's U-turn, Allen had called together a few of his officials, led by another Douglas, told them that current policy was bound to end in tears, and asked them to prepare plans for an incomes policy.</p> <p>There was also the episode during Wilson's 1964-70 premiership when the prime minister ordered the destruction of all documents relating to devaluation. But when that eventuality was finally forced upon the government in November 1967, Wilson felt in need of such documents.</p> <p>Luckily, the Rolls-Royce Treasury machine had disobeyed orders and locked them away in a safe. Unluckily, the official who knew the combination code had by then left the Treasury and was working as economics editor for the <em>Times</em>. My old friend Peter Jay duly did the decent thing and gave the Treasury the code \u2013 which was, if I remember correctly, the date of the 1949 devaluation of the pound \u2013 backwards!</p> <p>Well, here we are again, with a government driving itself into a cul-de-sac and needing to conduct a U-turn. Is the civil service ready to oblige? I only&#xa0;ask\u2026</p>",

  "<p>\"La Coru\u00f1a is one long sea front,\" said my taxi driver as we rounded the headland towards Riazor,&#xa0;the huge urban beach that is the major natural feature of this northern Spanish city. On the sand, surfers were polishing their boards and pale-skinned families, enjoying the sudden Atlantic summer, were energetically doing what families do on beaches.</p> <p>From my hotel, I could see the crouching form of Riazor stadium, home of Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a (\"el Depor\") and one of Spain's cathedrals of football.&#xa0;And at the end of the beach, the new Museo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (Muncyt),&#xa0; glittering in the afternoon sun. The museum, opened in May, is a masterpiece of take-no-prisoners modernism by architects Victoria Acebo and Angel Alonso, and the city's most talked-about new attraction. Outwardly it is a stunning concatenation of glass and concrete; inwardly, it's an engaging attempt to make Spain feel good about its technological heritage.</p> <p>La Coru\u00f1a is hardly a great techno-metropolis, but it has the big-town brashness of a place that still lives mainly on manufacturing. It also has the bracing saltiness of a harbour city, and a Brighton-like feel in the bric-a-brac and street-fashion shops of the grungy Orz\u00e1n district behind Riazor beach. For centuries it lived under the long shadow of Santiago de Compostela,&#xa0; whose clerical pomp and cultural dominion it fiercely resented.&#xa0;But La Coru\u00f1a is fighting back. For two summers (in 2010 and 2011) it hosted a satellite version of Barcelona's S\u00f3nar festival, capitalising on the busy local club scene. Now the city is hoping that the Muncyt will put it on the map, Guggenheim-style, as an exhilarating and original short-break destination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395220581\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/20/1345469737160/Shellfish-supper--in-LA-C-001.jpg\" alt=\"Shellfish supper,  in LA CORUNA \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shellfish supper in La Coru\u00f1a</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As night fell I set out for Calle Estrella, La Coru\u00f1a's prime tapas territory.&#xa0; It was Monday, but the bars on Estrella were heaving, the mild July night filling the terrace tables with good-natured, raucous crowds.&#xa0;At Cunqueiro, a cheery old tavern with slate floors and stone walls, I ate a first-night supper of octopus with potatoes (<em>pulpo \u00e1 feira</em>) accompanied by a glass of Albari\u00f1o. It felt like a culinary \"welcome to Galicia\".&#xa0;</p> <p>El Depor recently won promotion from the Spanish second division, but in gastronomic terms La Coru\u00f1a is always in the <em>primera liga</em>.&#xa0;From the cheap-as-chips <em>tascas</em> of Calle Barrera, where locals go for china bowls of Ribeiro wine and platters of winkles, to top-end <em>marisquer\u00edas</em> (shellfish joints) and <em>restaurantes de autor</em> (chef-driven restaurants) such as Domus and Alborada, there is quality at every level.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The city is handsome yet somehow rough-hewn, with islands of gentrification around Plaza de Lugo, where a decorative <em>modernista</em> style adorns the facades of early-20th-century mansion blocks, and the picture-pretty medieval Ciudad Vieja.&#xa0;</p> <p>La Coru\u00f1a has a number of surprising strings to its bow \u2013 not least the Zara connection.&#xa0;The global-village high-street fashion brand was born here, and rag-trade aficionados might want to check out the first-ever Zara store (opened in 1975 at Calle Juan Fl\u00f3rez) and the old-town house of Amancio Ortega, godfather of the brand, who started out selling aprons to housewives and is now one of the world's 10 richest men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395220582\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/8/20/1345469779622/Sculpture-of-an-octopus-o-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sculpture of an octopus on the waterfront in La Coru\u00f1a Galicia Spain\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sculpture of an octopus on the waterfront in La Coru\u00f1a</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For insight into La Coru\u00f1a's history and culture, I called Suso Martinez, whose tours of his city are more like theatrical performances.&#xa0;For the first of three sorties, Suso appeared in fancy dress as Sir John Moore, the British general fatally wounded at the battle of La Coru\u00f1a in 1809, to lead me round the general's granite mausoleum in the garden of San Carlos, high above the battlements.&#xa0;</p> <p>On the second day he materialised as Mil Esp\u00e1ne, a mythological warrior in helmet and skimpy kilt, to illustrate the importance of La Coru\u00f1a to the ancient Celts. \"To the lighthouse!\" he intoned gravely as we headed for the square-sided Torre de H\u00e9rcules, the world's only functioning Roman lighthouse and a symbol of the city on its lonely promontory.</p> <p>In Suso's most convincing role, that of 19th-century philanthropist Eugenio da Guarda, he brilliantly conjured up the liberal, economically buoyant La Coru\u00f1a which the Picasso family found when they arrived from M\u00e1laga in 1890.&#xa0;Here is another of the city's surprises: the Pablo Picasso connection.&#xa0;The artist lived here for five years when his father was a master at the art school.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>For three days the weather in La Coru\u00f1a had defied Galicia's (increasingly unjustified) reputation for inclemency. From a bakery I picked up one of the world's best picnic foods, an <em>empanada</em> \u2013 a flat pie with a range of fillings from tuna and peppers to ground meat and onions \u2013 and headed to Riazor beach with a few cold cans of Estrella Galicia, La Coru\u00f1a's signature beer. I nipped between the surfers and the families and plunged into the sea. The water was, rather like the city and its people, a good deal less chilly than you might think.&#xa0;La Coru\u00f1a is, in every sense, a breath of fresh air. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Essentials<br></h2> <p>Paul Richardson was a guest of Turismo La Coru\u00f1a (<a href=\"http://turismocoruna.com/web/\" title=\"\">turismocoruna.com</a>) and the Hotel Meli\u00e1 Maria Pita, Avda de Pedro Barri\u00e9 de la Maza 1 (+34 981 205000, <a href=\"http://www.melia.com/\" title=\"\">melia.com</a>, doubles from \u20ac69).

  "<p>Hatim Bensalha is a rapper in <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/hkayne\" title=\"\">H-Kayne</a>, a four-piece hip-hop group from Meknes, Morocco; they have been instrumental in popularising hip-hop in the country.</p> <p><strong>How did you get involved in Africa Express?</strong></p> <p>A journalist contacted one of my friends in England who does electro music, who then told me all about it. I was instantly interested and went straight to the website. What's great is that I am passionate about trains \u2013 I love travelling by train! Plus I've never been to England, and the fact that there are loads of different musicians taking part\u2026 Basically, I just really liked the whole concept.</p> <p><strong>What form will your contribution take?</strong></p> <p>I'm going to try and bring my own touch to it. I don't play any instruments but I rap in French and Arabic and I've got loads of different melodies in my head that I can bring to Africa Express. Sadly I'll be the only one representing H-Kayne \u2013 we'd have loved to do it as a four but apparently it was complicated to get us all involved.</p> <p><strong>One of your fans has said that H-Kayne's music \"is about problems that all young people in Morocco understand\". Do you see yourself as a spokesperson for young Moroccans?</strong></p> <p>Honestly, I would never claim that. When we started to write, the first thing that naturally came out of our writing was what we felt, our problems, hopes and dreams. Seeing as we are young Moroccans too, young people who have the same ideas as us find themselves represented in our music. But we can't say that we speak on behalf of a whole generation.</p> <p><strong>What inspires your music?</strong></p> <p>Quite a lot of west-coast American rap has inspired us, not in our own music but more for what we like listening to. We also like lots of Moroccan music from previous generations, and we try to infuse some of that into our own music. We listen to Indian music too \u2013 we're influenced by music from everywhere, really. We don't tell ourselves we should have a specific sound.</p> <p><strong>How did you decide to become a rapper?</strong></p> <p>It happened when I was about 15 or 16 years old. Rap happened to me by accident \u2013 it was something that no one really knew much about. We found it through breakdancing, which we used to do a lot of. But after a while it really made your back hurt so instead we all just picked up our pens and got writing. I'd tell my friends, \"Hey, check out these lyrics from MC Solaar!\" but really it was my own words. That's how embarrassed about it I was at first \u2013 we all were. It was something that didn't really fit in with our own culture \u2013 even though in Morocco we have a very oral culture. Rap had real connotations of thugs, street life, all that. But it was my original passion and got my first lyrics off the ground. They probably weren't very good, but at least they were real, and told the story of our lives.</p>",
  "<p>Born in Nigeria in 1981, <a href=\"http://www.adolphusopara.com/\" title=\"\">Adolphus Opara</a> originally worked as a graphic designer for the small but influential <a href=\"http://www.bogobiri.com/nimbus.php\" title=\"\">Nimbus studio and art gallery</a> in Lagos, a hub for local artists and photographers. \"I bought a film camera in early 2005, but I threw it away after a month because the pictures I took were so terrible,\" he says, laughing. The following year, armed with a digital camera (<a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilms3pro\" title=\"\">a Fuji Finepix S3Pro</a>) bought from his friend, the acclaimed Nigerian documentary photographer <a href=\"http://georgeosodi.photoshelter.com/\" title=\"\">George Osodi</a>, Opara travelled by road&nbsp;to Senegal and back, \"shooting all the way, totally trigger crazy\". Looking at the photographs on his return, he realised then that he had a love for photography but \"no real understanding of what a series was or how to create one\". That came soon afterwards with a project called <a href=\"http://www.adolphusopara.com/?page_id=295\" title=\"\">Rugball</a>, which captured in impressionistic black and white a bunch of young Nigerians on a beach in Lagos playing the rough-and-tumble hybrid game that merges the rules of rugby, basketball, soccer and even wrestling.</p> <p>Opara describes himself as \"first and foremost a storyteller\". The stories he tells with his camera have, he says, deepened and widened since he began taking photographs in 2005. \"I never plan anything. I follow my instincts and often my projects start off as quite small, intimate explorations that grow into something more. By the end, there is always a bigger story underneath about Nigeria or Africa, about the forces that shape us either from within or from the outside.\" His most well-known series to date is the grandly titled <a href=\"http://www.adolphusopara.com/?page_id=548\" title=\"\">Emissaries of an Iconic Religion</a>, painterly portraits of the chief priests and diviners of the traditional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yor%C3%B9b%C3%A1_religion\" title=\"\">Yor\u00f9b\u00e1</a> religion, which was shown as part of a group show, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-14376043\" title=\"\">Contested Terrains</a>, at Tate Modern last year. The exhibition focused on \"artists working in Africa who explore and subvert narratives about the past and present\".</p> <p>The project began, Opara says, \"from a conversation with a friend who was a traditional Christian and, like many Christians, thought that Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 was a bad religion like voodoo. I began to think about how quickly we can leave our beliefs and culture behind us. I visited shrines all around the country and, as people came to trust me, they began to tell their stories. It is a story about Africa's past but also about Africa today.\"</p> <p>One of Opara's ongoing projects is called <a href=\"http://www.storytaxi.com/news/\" title=\"\">Shrinking Shores</a>. \"It is about where I live, Lagos, and how it has been affected by climate change and oil spills. There are 30 abandoned shipwrecks on our shores and all tell a tale of destruction, of villages destroyed, people displaced.\"</p> <p>When asked if he is weary of how Africa is portrayed by photographers from outside the continent, Opara is diplomatic. \"As someone who trained and works as a journalist, I can see why people go where there is disaster and war, but there is another Africa, many other Africas.\"</p> <p>Is he optimistic for the future of his country? \"Well, Nigerians are naturally optimistic, but we can never agree on anything. It is out strength and our weakness. It takes us too long to say, 'This is enough.' There are people who have been in power too long. In a way, we are too tolerant. We need real change. It does not just happen, it needs action to make it happen.\"</p> <h2><strong>Other photographers he admires</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.michaeltsegaye.com/portfolio\" title=\"\"><strong>Michael Tsegaye</strong></a> from Ethiopia.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.andrewesiebo.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Andrew Esiebo</strong></a> from Nigeria.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.danielnaude.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Daniel Naude</strong></a> A young South African.</p>",
  "<p>Before <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/bright-simons\" title=\"\">Bright Simons</a> became one of Africa's most dynamic technology innovators, he was an astrophysicist. He won a scholarship to Durham University but decided in the end that it was \"not sufficiently practical\".</p> <p>\"I had been in student politics and I had this idea I could help change things,\" he says. He turned instead to migration studies, winning another EU scholarship, having decided that he wanted to help refugees. \"But I felt that even that wasn't practical enough.\"</p> <p>To change things effectively, he realised that he would have to return to Ghana and create his own enterprise. \"I realised I needed to become an entrepreneur. And I had no money. So I needed to find an area where I could make an impact without a lot of money. And that is where technology came in.\"</p> <p>His big realisation was that the greatest investment in technological infrastructure in Africa was coming from mobile telecom companies. \"They'd invested a huge amount of money. All you needed was a good idea to convince them to give you access to this infrastructure.\"</p> <p>The good idea he came up with was to tackle the problem of counterfeit medicine. Fake pills and pharmaceuticals are a massive problem in the developing world. The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a> estimates that they account for 30% of all medicines on sale, and kill up to 2,000 people daily worldwide, though other studies suggest the figure is even higher. Simons's idea was to put a code on all packaging, enabling consumers to check if it was authentic or not with a simple text message.</p> <p>His organisation, <a href=\"http://www.mpedigree.net/mpedigree/index.php\" title=\"\">mPedigree</a>, now works with 20 telecoms companies and is in discussions with two dozen more. Its system has appeared on 6.5m packs of medicine and been adopted as the national standard in three different countries.</p> <p>Most exciting, perhaps, is that the system is now being taken beyond Africa. It's become a model for the industry in India and is being extended across south Asia. \"It's the first time that innovations from Africa are going to other parts of the world,\" says Simons. \"It's changing the traditional story about the continent and demonstrating that Africa can be the source of groundbreaking innovations. \"This is a genuine reversal of the usual narrative.\"</p> <p>Simons is hopeful that it's just the start. Innovation, he believes, has the power to transform Africa. \"And it's not going to be about shiny gimmickry as it often is in the west. It'll be about innovation that has an impact on human lives.\"</p> <p>It hasn't been easy going. The old stereotypes about Africa \"absolutely\" still exist. When it came to approaching multinationals, Simons encountered stiff resistance to the idea that innovation could come from Africa rather than go to it, added to which there \"is almost no institutional funding for innovation in Africa\". There's no bank money, no aid money. And the greatest challenge is \"scale\".</p> <p>\"There are a billion people in Africa. And the majority of them are young and they need jobs. We need to create the infrastructure to induce productivity. And this can't be done by micro-interventions. We need leadership. Better allocation of resources. New infrastructures.\"</p> <p>What Simons has shown is that it's not impossible. MPedigree has had an astonishing amount of success with very little resources. Studying in the UK, Simons says, gave him the confidence that entrepreneurs can change society. But it also \"made it obvious to me how peripheral Africa is on a global scale. It's what provided me with the impulse to return to the continent and reverse this narrative.\"</p> <p><strong>Businesses </strong></p> <h2><strong>he most admires</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ushahidi</strong></a> Kenyan developers who have created a crisis management platform.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa\" title=\"\"><strong>M-Pesa</strong></a>, a successful Kenyan mobile payments system, with 17 million subscribers in that country alone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.apopo.org/home.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Apopo</strong></a>, an NGO that uses African giant pouched rats to sniff out anti-personnel landmines and detect TB.</p>",

Whatever the reason, it was a decidedly low turn-out this month: only 181 entries, though with no mistakes apart from a couple of failures to complete the grid or slips of the pen (obviously wrong letters entered), inadvertent. I\u2019m sure. I do urge everyone to check their entries before putting them in the envelope. It only takes a few seconds. Then there was the silly error, made at post-proof stage, which resulted in the puzzle being wrongly numbered 2,092 instead of 2,096. I received an apology from The Observer about this, and got Stephen Pritchard to mention it in his \u2018Errors\u2019 section the following Sunday, though I dare say many solvers were blissfully unaware of the mistake. (It was correct in the online version, though there may have been discrepancies elsewhere. Matching the two versions exactly is a recurrent headache.) All of that said, I\u2019m pleased, and I hope you are too, that the puzzle, with its fancy new pink header, is now located with the other games and puzzles and consequently much easier to find. (The unworthy thought crosses my mind that some would-be solvers may have looked for Azed among the book reviews and lost interest when they failed to find it. Surely not.)</p> <p>Favourite clue of the month (of 13 nominated one or more times) was \u2018One game in Scotland in which there\u2019s very little between the two sides\u2019 for LAMITER, two votes ahead of \u2018Blowing kiss king\u2019s mistress turned in after a change of sheets?\u2019 (REMADE). One regular queried the capital initial M in \u2018Pay out from urn excited Murray?\u2019 (UNREEL), where the reference was to murray (moray) eels. I\u2019ve mentioned before that, following Ximenes, I regard such upcasing as just about acceptable (see Mr Hesketh\u2019s \u2018Jiffy\u2019 above), but not the opposite, i.e. downcasing initial letters of proper names where this suits the reading of the clue. Another general query concerned the use of question marks, mainly at the end of clues, there being quite a few of these in the present puzzle. It\u2019s a point well raised, and I\u2019d like to give it some thought before giving a considered response. It may well be that I overdo them somewhat, though at the time of writing such clues they seem called for. One to come back to.</p> <p>I was a bit nervous about giving you TRICK, but (as so often) I needn\u2019t have worried. Olympic Games clues abounded, of course, (especially with the enticing \u2018Mo\u2019a possibility) and the word\u2019s many diverse meanings clearly offered plenty of scope. Clues quote above amply demonstrate this, I hope. I just wish the entry had been a lot bigger.</p> <p>And here\u2019s a charming footnote. One regular competitor (half of a duo) writes to tells me that he has recently finished building a motor launch which he has named \u2018Highly Commended\u2019 in honour of the Azed puzzle. Isn\u2019t that nice?</p>",
  "<p>It was not an expected setting in which Neil Armstrong found himself when giving his final interview earlier this year. But perhaps that was appropriate, given his achievements. In May, the Certified Practicing Accountants of Australia secured almost an hour of the former astronaut's time to discuss his 1969 expedition to the moon.</p> <p>Chief executive Alex Malley masterminded the scoop by appealing to Armstrong's family background \u2013 his father Stephen worked as an auditor for the Ohio state government.</p> <p>Armstrong, who rarely gave interviews, regaled his audience with news of how he thought Apollo 11, which carried him, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon, only had a \"50-50 chance\" of landing safely on its surface and a 90% chance of returning home.</p> <p>He said it was \"sad\" that the current US government's ambitions for Nasa were so reduced compared with the achievements of the 1960s.</p> <p>\"Nasa has been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achieve,\" said Armstrong. \"It's sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation it provides to young people.\"</p> <p>He said the short-term nature of decision-making was doing a disservice to the agency, adding: \"I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the US where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be. They're sort of playing a game and Nasa is the shuttlecock that they're hitting back and forth.\"</p> <p>Armstrong had opened up about his parents, his boyhood fascination with flight and his experiences of flying fighter planes in the Korean war.</p> <p>He also expressed a sense of fate about his work as a test pilot and astronaut, refusing to worry about future tasks because he thought something would go wrong first and he'd be otherwise engaged firing the ejection seat or scrambling to repair a valve.</p> <p>As the launch day approached, Armstrong said preparations were on schedule. \"A month before the launch of Apollo 11, we decided that we were confident enough we could try and attempt \u2026 a descent to the surface.\"</p> <p>Armstrong remembered the moment when he got the call to ask him if the rest of the crew of Apollo 11 were ready to land on the moon.</p> <p>\"The bosses asked, 'Do you think you and your guys are ready?' I said it'd be nice to have another month, but we're in a race here and we had to take the opportunity when we had it. I had to say we are ready, we are ready to go.\"</p> <p>He described the crew's harrowing 12-minute descent to the moon, when he realised that the Eagle lunar module's auto-pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater. \"The computer showed us where it intended to land, and it was a very bad location, on the side of a large crater about 100-150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders \u2013 not a good place to land at all,\" he said.</p> <p>Armstrong took over the craft manually and managed to land it like a helicopter in a smoother area to the west with just 20 seconds of fuel left.</p> <p>As for \"that's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind,\" Armstrong says he didn't think of those words until after they'd landed safely.</p> <p>Of his time on the moon's surface, he said: \"It was special and memorable but it was only instantaneous because there was work to do. We weren't there to meditate. We were there to get things done. So we got on with it.\"</p> <p>Armstrong even had time to respond to the conspiracy theorists' favourite question: Was the moon landing faked?</p> <p>\"People love conspiracy theories,\" he replied. \"I mean, they are very attractive. But it was never a concern to me because I know one day, somebody is going to go fly back up there and pick up that camera I left.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool may have got off to a losing start in the league at West Bromwich Albion last week but Brendan Rodgers is hopeful Nuri Sahin will be present at Anfield to watch Sunday afternoon's game against Manchester City. As the loanee from Real Madrid could just as easily have joined Arsenal, that represents a first win of the season for the new Merseyside regime against top four clubs.</p> <p>\"The player had his mind set on going to Arsenal and we had to convince him to join us instead,\" Rodgers explains. \"As soon as we realised he might be available it became our task to change the direction of the deal that was going through and wrestle the momentum away from Arsenal.</p> <p>\"As you can imagine, that was very difficult, because Arsenal are a wonderful club, they can offer Champions League football and they play a style of football suited to his qualities. But we've been able to persuade him to come here. He's a clever guy, he's done a lot of homework on the club and myself as a manager, and he's made a decision that this is the best route at this stage of his career.\"</p> <p>Rodgers did a fair amount of homework on Sahin too, speaking at length to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and making use of a friendship forged at Chelsea to establish whether or not the Turkey midfielder would be a good fit for Liverpool. \"Shinji Kagawa was the player of the season in Germany last year, and the year before that it was Nuri Sahin,\" Rodgers points out. \"All my contacts spoke very highly of him and Jos\u00e9 has been fantastic in talking about his qualities and strengths. But obviously he hasn't played so much there. It's a great opportunity for us to bring in a top technician. He's got good experience too, for a player of 23 \u2013 it's important to have players who can cope with the game.\"</p> <p>Yes, but slow down a bit, Brendan. How exactly do you persuade a player who has not been getting enough game time at the Bernab\u00e9u to pass on a move to the Emirates and guaranteed Champions League appearances, in favour of a club still trying to get back into the top four and with only Europa League football to offer? It is just over two years since Swansea of the Championship made the then jobless Rodgers an offer that took him to South Wales instead of taking up an invitation to join the Manchester City coaching staff under Roberto Mancini. To say his rise has been meteoric would be understating the case, but it now sounds as though he could qualify as salesman of the year as well.</p> <p>\"When I talk to players, I promise them three things,\" Rodgers says. \"The first is communication. I won't bluff players, I'll be totally honest and open with them. The second is that they'll become better, that I'll make sure the quality of work will improve them as players. And third I promise ambition. I want to be the best I possibly can. I grew from nothing into something through sheer ambition, work and determination.</p> <p>\"So I can promise them all those things, and I can guarantee they're playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world with some of the greatest supporters in the world, in a style and culture that will suit them and in a city where their family can grow and enjoy their life. If they don't go for that I'll just take out my guitar and sing them some Irish songs! You can't win them all. We lost the boy Sigurdsson to Tottenham, but there's no drama, you just get on with your job.\"</p> <p>Rodgers' preliminary discussions with City went as far as flying out to Italy to meet Mancini and being given a tour of the club's facilities by Brian Marwood, so although he always knew he would prefer to manage in his own right rather than work as an assistant, he had a particular interest in Swansea's games against the eventual champions last season. They lost at City but won at home, though it is Rodgers's contention that for three-quarters of both games Swansea were the better team.</p> <p>\"In the first game they brought on Sergio Ag\u00fcero and he cost more than our stadium,\" he says. \"For an hour at City we played very well and then their sheer quality came through. Ag\u00fcero is a phenomenal player. At home we were the better side and we won the game 1-0, and that showed the improvement we had made. City have quality players and once you have won the league it gives you greater confidence. But for us, if we are going to do anything this year we need to ensure that Anfield is a real cauldron, a difficult place for opponents to come to, and that starts this weekend.\"</p> <p>With Andy Carroll's future still uncertain \u2013 though both Rodgers and City's Joe Hart said independently of each other that the centre-forward is a lovely bloke and a dedicated professional \u2013 there are bound to be questions over Liverpool's goalscoring ability, particularly as they drew a blank on opening day and needed an own goal to overcome Hearts in midweek. \"I've been asked if we have someone who can get us 30 goals this season,\" Rodgers says. \"I don't think it matters whether we do or not. If we are going to get into the Champions League we need to score 65 plus, and to achieve that we need the whole team to be scoring. Centre-halves, full-backs, midfielders are all going to have to weigh in. I think we have enough quality at the front to get goals but they have to come from other areas as well. City scored 93 goals last year, United 89, Arsenal 74 and Tottenham 69. So that's the target area, that's what we need to work towards.\"</p> <p>Rodgers recites those figures without recourse to notes or a reference book, as though they have been buzzing in his head all summer. Most managers in his position would be daunted by them, or at least tempted to stock up with a striker or two, though Rodgers maintains his belief that midfield is the key area.</p> <p>\"We are always going to carry more central midfield players than most, because I will always play with three and a couple might get injured at the same time,\" he says. \"I want our game to be based on possession with penetration, always looking to control the ball and dominate, so the midfield is crucial.</p> <p>\"I want to go with three strikers this season, and that's what I have at the moment in Andy, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Fabio Borini. If that's the situation when the transfer window closes I won't complain. I'll just be immensely glad, like every other manager I imagine, because then I can stop commenting on rumours and gossip and get on with working with the players.\"</p>",

  "<p>As Boris Johnson finally digressed on Friday from a lengthy dissection of the Latin derivation of the word <em>agitos</em> \u2013 the three symbols that represents the Paralympic movement \u2013 he caught the mood of all those involved in the Games.</p> <p>Thousands of athletes, support staff, media and officials pouring into London have described their excitement at the Games \"coming home\" to the place where they were born, the thrill of anticipation of 11 days of elite sport and varying degrees of hope that they will lead to a lasting shift in perceptions.</p> <p>More than anything, they share a belief that the fever which gripped the country during the Olympics and the warmth felt for London by the rest of the world will be sustained through the Paralympics that follow.</p> <p>\"The Paralympic Games will be something that captures people's imaginations this year in a way that four years ago the Beijing Games didn't quite,\" the London mayor tells the <em>Observer</em>. \"For some people it will be even more exciting and some people will be switched on in a way they weren't to the Olympic Games,\" says Johnson, who is particularly looking forward to the \"aggro\" of wheelchair basketball.</p> <p>Ade Adepitan, the Paralympian who won a bronze medal in that sport in Athens and will front Channel 4's prime-time coverage alongside Clare Balding, says the organisers are in a better position than even an evangelist like him could have dreamed.</p> <p>Even before the giddy success of Team GB at the Olympics turbocharged demand, organisers had sold more Paralympic tickets than for any Games in history. Over 2.3m tickets have been sold, with around 200,000 more due to be drip-fed on to the website as venue configurations are finalised. Around half of those tickets will have been sold by the time 116 teams travel through the night to deliver the Paralympic flame from Stoke Mandeville to Stratford for Wednesday's opening ceremony.</p> <p>Locog have driven demand by offering good value tickets and encouraging families and large groups \u2013 the London Games organisers will raise just \u00a325m from Paralympic ticket sales compared with over \u00a3500m from the Olympics \u2013 but the very fact that everyone who is there has paid to get in is a first for the Paralympics.</p> <p>Lord Coe, the chairman, has long argued that the British public \"get\" Paralympic sport, feeling that an umbilical connection with the birth of the movement in Stoke Mandeville in 1948, as dramatised recently by the BBC, would mean people turning out in their droves. He has been proved right.</p> <p>Adepitan says: \"We're in a better position than even I could ever have imagined. If you'd have told me in 2005 that we'd have almost sold out the tickets, that there'd be billboards featuring Paralympians all over the country and such a buzz about the Games, I'd have been pretty sceptical.\"</p> <p>The 4,200 athletes competing at the Games will, believe those at the sharp end, not only enchant the hundreds of thousands in the venues and the millions more that Channel 4 hopes will tune into 150-plus hours of coverage but challenge perceptions of disability more widely.</p> <p>There are hopes that the sheer volume of coverage will mean the long-running debate about whether the focus should be purely on the elite sporting action on show or dwell also on the \"backstories\" of those involved will become null and void, just as the acres of coverage devoted to Mo Farah dealt with the minutae of his tactics and training as well as his background and life story.</p> <p>\"I think this is going to be the first really big mass-market Paralympics,\" says the sports minister, Hugh Robertson. \"If you look at the number of tickets sold, if you look at the way people here relate to the Paralympics for historical reasons and because of the success of the British team, I think this will be the Games that really catapult it forward.\"</p> <p>Philip Craven, the Bolton-born five-times Paralympian who is president of the International Paralympic Committee, says: \"Thinking back to my economics A-levels, Adam Smith talked about the take-off into sustained growth and I think that is what London is going to provide for the Paralympic movement. It is a wonderful moment to live through.\"</p> <p>Robertson said that funding for Paralympic sport was already guaranteed to Rio and argued the impetus from the London Games had already led to greater integration at elite level and in schools, as well as dedicated funding for the grassroots for the first time.</p> <p>\"There is no one killer bullet in that. But if you look at it as a package, it is a significant step forward for disability sport. If you're a young aspiring Paralympian watching at home, I'm absolutely confident you'll have a much, much better chance of succeeding in your sport than any of your predecessors would have done.\"</p> <p>Tim Hollingsworth, the British Paralympic Association chief executive, says the \"L-word\" has been banned at its offices. \"Legacy means you have reached a point that you are looking to sustain. We certainly don't think we've reached a point we want to sustain. This is something we see as a launchpad, so the word that works for us is momentum.\"</p> <p>The first priority would be maintaining the level of elite performance that has seen the British team finish in the top two in the medal table at the last three Games in the face of ever increasing competition from around the world.</p> <p>In return for the \u00a349m in Lottery and exchequer funding invested in Paralympic sport over the past four years, ParalympicsGB has promised to deliver 103 medals from at least 12 sports and maintain second place in the medal table.</p> <p>\"A real aim for us in 2016 and 2020 is to remain a world force in Paralympic sport. It is undoubtedly getting tougher. The threat from other parts of the world is growing,\" says Hollingsworth.</p> <p>But he adds that there is also a wider goal, both in enabling more disabled people to take up sport and in encouraging a shift in perceptions in society at large.</p> <p>\"I would always defend the athletes' right to compete in and of itself. But more than any other area of sport, Paralympic sport can be inspirational. It not only inspires in the wonder of excellence and the achievement of brilliance, but in the nature of the individuals and the recognition of the impairment they have and what they have managed to overcome to reach that pinnacle.\"</p> <p>Part of that inspiration needed to be translated into a belief among other disabled people that sport was for them, says Hollingsworth, quoting Tanni Grey-Thompson's aim to \"defend the right for disabled people to be rubbish at sport\".</p> <p>Those watching needed to believe it could be \"a pastime and a leisure activity and not only done by a minority with ambition to be Paralympians\", Hollingsworth stresses. Just as the avalanche of medals for Team GB sparked issues around school sport and brought the grassroots to the fore, so the achievements of ParalympicsGB are likely to do the same.</p> <p>Paul Deighton, Locog's chief executive, says the stage is set: the Olympic rings have been replaced with the Paralympic Agitos (whatever their derivation), a brand new venue has been opened at Eton Manor to host wheelchair tennis, the village has been adapted for 4,200 Paralympians and Ottobock has set up a workshop at the Park containing four and a half tonnes of wheelchair equipment.</p> <p>When \"Blade Runner\" Oscar Pistorius, his big US rival Jerome Singleton and the British world record holder Jonnie Peacock line up to contest a T44 100m that promises to be as tense and tightly fought as its Olympic counterpart, they are unlikely to be thinking of much more than hitting the line. But Hollingsworth says he expects their achievements \u2013 and those of Paralympians across 20 sports \u2013 to resonate far beyond London E20.</p> <p>\"There is a much bigger point around the attitude of non-disabled people and their perception of disability. How can we challenge the way people generally think, behave and feel towards disability? Can you challenge the sense that people are defined by what they're unable to do? What Paralympic sport brings to life very clearly is a demonstration of what they are able to do.\"</p>",

The whole thing is so unfair on pupils whose lives will be affected by these results. I am confident we can get things changed for the better.\"</p> <p>Previously it had been thought schools would appeal only in respect of individual pupils who they felt had been particularly harshly treated.</p> <p>The ASCL, which represents over 17,000 heads, deputy heads and other school leaders, is also intending to take legal action against the exam authorities for imposing the higher grade boundaries on pupils who took English exams in June than those who did so in January. In the last 24 hours more than 600 secondary schools (close to 20%), have filled in an ASCL survey which is gathering evidence.</p> <p>Anger among pupils, parents and teachers has risen after it emerged that more than 4,000 GCSE students expecting a grade C in English were downgraded to a D \u2013 meaning many will struggle to get on to college courses or into apprenticeships next month.</p> <p>Many thousands more failed to reach their predicted grades, entirely because the grade boundaries had been raised before the June marking took place.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395226252\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/26/120826HuntGCSEs-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/26/120826HuntGCSEs_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120826HuntGCSEs/120826HuntGCSEs.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/26/120826HuntGCSEs-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/26/120826HuntGCSEs_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>On Saturday night, as threats of legal action mounted, the exams regulator, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/video/2012/aug/26/gcse-results-exams-regulator-gradings-video\">Ofqual, said it would look again at GCSE gradings</a>. In a letter to the National Association of Head Teachers, Ofqual's chief regulator, Glenys Stacey, wrote: \"We recognise the continuing concerns among students, parents and teachers about this year's GCSE English results.</p> <p>\"We will look closely at how the results were arrived at. We will do this quickly, but thoroughly, so that we ensure confidence is maintained in our exam system.\"</p> <p>Mike Griffiths, headteacher at Northampton School for Boys, the first high-performing school to become an academy after Gove became secretary of state for education in May 2010, said the issue would not only have a potentially disastrous effect on pupils who failed to get a necessary C grade in English, but also on those hoping to study at elite institutions who fell short of getting As or A*s.</p> <p>\"If you are applying to a Russell Group university, for instance, to study medicine or law, and all the applicants have a string of A*s, they will look back to the GCSEs and see a B in English \u2013 and that could decide your fate,\" he said. \"It is the only way to differentiate. It could well be the reason they don't get into the university they have set their hearts on.\"</p> <p>Griffiths said headteachers were determined to rectify the situation \"because we have a duty of care to our students.\" He added: \"It was clear as soon as we opened the results that something was wrong.\"</p> <p>McVittie, who is head of Woodside High School, an academy in Haringey, north London where 80% of pupils do not speak English as their first language, said her school had been praised by David Cameron last year as a model institution only to be dealt a huge blow by this year's marking decision.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/26/gcse-exams-woodside-high-school-joan-mcvittie\" title=\"\">Writing online in the <em>Observer</em></a>, she says that after years of efforts to raise standards and morale, her pupils were shattered when they failed to achieve crucial C grades, which is essential for many courses.</p> <p>\"For the first time in six years, we had students crying on results day as they had failed to be awarded the grades my staff had advised them they were on target to achieve,\" she says.</p> <p>She predicts that more than 1,000 schools will demand that all English papers be re-marked, in the hope that those judged on the June boundaries are given the same grade as those marked in January. The legal challenges against exam boards and Ofqual are being mounted on the grounds that one group of students has been treated more generously than others, breaching the obligation to treat all pupils the same.</p> <p>The row is a major headache for Gove, who is keen to see an end to so-called grade inflation. Gove has denied any political interference to lower grades. But with MPs on the education selection committee set to consider launching an inquiry, he could face detailed questioning on the issue in coming weeks.</p> <p>The decision by schools to demand mass re-marking of papers takes the dispute to new levels, as it would involve a huge, costly and time-consuming exercise at the start of the new school term.</p> <p>Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg welcomed Ofqual's announcement but said it had to address \"the unfairness of similar work getting a C in January and a D in May.\" An independent cross-parliamentary inquiry was still necessary, in addition, he said.</p>",
  "<p>As a headteacher, I welcome the move towards increased rigour in examinations and as president of the Association of School and College Leaders have advised government officials as to how this can be achieved. However what I cannot tolerate, together with hundreds of my colleagues, is unfairness and this is what we experienced last Thursday from the AQA exam board</p> <p>We had students crying on results day as they had failed to be awarded the grades my staff had advised them they were on target to achieve. I have colleagues in schools in more affluent areas where their students failed to achieve the higher grades predicted. This will mean they cannot study A-level English but will be able to access university for other subjects; however for my students this will mean a barrier to university.</p> <p>Woodside High is an 11-16 secondary school. It was previously considered to be a failing school as Ofsted had placed it in special measures and the exam results were dreadful. I was appointed as head in January 2006. Since then we have raised student attainment and achievement by recruiting and developing excellent teachers and raising aspirations. We run extra classes after school and in the holidays and staff and students give their time without question to ensure that our students, who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, achieve to the best of their ability.</p> <p>Since 2006, our results have improved year on year and this was recognised by Ofsted who awarded us an outstanding grade in February 2011. For the past two years we have been placed in the DfE's top 100 most improved schools (22nd in 2010 and 33rd in 2011). David Cameron acknowledged this in a speech last summer where he talked about two schools which were succeeding in deprived areas, of which we were one.</p> <p>But last week all our pupils' hard work was undermined by a blatant unfairness which came from moving the goalposts in the middle of a school year. Students taking a GCSE in English language with the AQA board in 2012 took three units, a written exam, a speaking and listening test and controlled assessments. The latter two were graded in school and moderated externally. The written exam taken under exam conditions was sent off and marked by the AQA exam board. They were able to sit the written exam in January or June. If the students cashed in their GCSE in January \u2013 ie, submitted their internally graded marks \u2013 then they required 25 on the speaking and listening, 43 on the controlled assessment and 43 on the written paper to achieve a C grade. If they waited till June, they required 28 and 46 for the internally assessed grades but the exam \u2013 taken in January \u2013 now required 53 marks for a C grade. So by submitting the school-assessed marks in January they achieved a whole grade higher than that awarded in June.</p> <p>In a school such as mine where almost 80% of the students have English as an additional language we submit our speaking and listening grades in June. This gives our students an extra two terms to work and improve their spoken English so that they can achieve the best grade possible. This delay meant they had to gain 10 extra marks on the exam and six extra marks on the grades the school assessed; so an extra 16 marks to achieve a C grade. This is a difference of one whole grade across the board.</p> <p>This boundary change after they had taken the exam meant that 22 of my students achieved D instead of C grades and now cannot get on to the college courses they had chosen. We will have to rely on a range of colleges who do not know my students understanding this anomaly before my students will be given places on their courses.</p> <p>In my 14 years as a head I have never come across such an arbitrary decision which has had such a damaging effect on the life chances of young people particularly those from a deprived background. This makes a mockery of the supposed rhetoric around social mobility.

  "<p>President Barack Obama has laid into his would-be White House replacement in a fervent attack on Mitt Romney's policies and character designed to knock his challenger off course ahead of a crucial convention speech.</p> <p>In a calculated move timed just days before Republican delegates meet in Florida to nod through Romney as their presidential candidate, Obama accused his rival of holding \"extreme positions\" and failing to \"own up\" to responsibilities.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/25/obama-romney-extreme-positions-elections\">an interview with the Associated Press</a>, the president said that contrary to common belief, he had no beef with the former Massachusetts governor on a personal level, adding: \"I don't really know him well.\"</p> <p>But he attacked Romney on positions the candidate has taken that tie him to the right wing of his party, and cast aspersion over whether the Republican presidential hope had adopted stances out of conviction or through political expediency.</p> <p>In the interview conducted Thursday but released on Saturday, Obama said: \"I can't speak to governor Romney's motivations,\" adding: \"What I can say is that he has signed up for positions, extreme positions, that are very consistent with positions that a number of House Republicans have taken.</p> <p>\"And whether he actually believes in those or not, I have no doubt that he would carry forward some of the things that he's talked about.\"</p> <p>The president cited Romney's insistence on tax relief for America' super-rich as evidence of his \"extreme\" positions.</p> <p>He also sought to tie the Republican presidential challenger to the recent furore surrounding conservative a Senate candidate, Missouri's Todd Akin.</p> <p>Akin has been roundly condemned for comments he made suggesting that \"legitimate rape\" rarely leads to pregnancy.</p> <p>Romney himself has described the remarks as \"inexcusable\" and led party calls for him to step down as a Senate candidate. And he is on record as not opposing abortion in cases of rape and incest or if it will save the mother's life.</p> <p>But Obama noted in the Associated Press interview that calls for a \"no exceptions rule\" in regards to a ban on abortion \u2013 the position Akin was ham-fistedly trying to defend \u2013 are part of the Republican platform in Tampa</p> <p>The White House incumbent also predicted that a President Romney would not \"stand in the way\" if Congress gave him a bill that stripped away women's control over their reproductive health.</p> <p>The comments reflect a belief in Democratic circles that conservative positions adopted by Republicans on social issues could alienate the party from moderate and independent voters.</p> <p>The president also aimed a blow at Romney's personal tax arrangements \u2013 another common area of attack in recent months.</p> <p>Romney refusal to release more tax returns for public inspection displayed a \"lack of willingness to take responsibility for what this job entails\".</p> <p>As to his own record, Obama agreed that in regards to the economy, America was not \"where we need to be\".</p> <p>But he added: \"Governor Romney's policies would make things worse for middle-class families and offer no prospect for long-term opportunity for those striving to get into the middle class.\"</p> <p>The timing of the interview \u2013 just 10 weeks out from the general election and days before the Republican convention is due to begin \u2013 is clearly designed to steal a march on Romney ahead of his big week in Florida.</p> <p>A GfK poll released on Saturday suggest that the White House race is still on a knife-edge, with 47% of respondent saying they plan to back Obama and 46% opting for Romney.</p> <p>But despite the even split in voter intention, most people still expect Obama to win. The GfK survey found that 58% believe the Democrat will remain in power, with just 32% saying they thought the White House keys would exchange hands in November.</p> <p>In the Associated Press interview, Obama expressed confidence that voters would stick with him in the general election.</p> <p>\"If they saw governor Romney offering serious proposals that offered some sort of concrete ways in which middle-class families would be helped, then I could understand them thinking about that choice,\" Obama said.</p> <p>\"But that's not what's happening,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Apple will seek injunctions against the sale in the US of dozens of Samsung smartphones and tablets, including its Galaxy brand, and could triple the $1bn damages it was awarded in a high-profile patent trial after the jury decided the South Korean company \"wilfully\" infringed its patents .</p> <p>The injunctions will be the next step after Apple <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/25/apple-samsung-patent-infringement-trial\">won on almost every count against Samsung</a>, which failed to win any of its counterclaims against the Cupertino-based company.</p> <p>Apple, which makes the iPhone and iPad, could apply for injunctions as early as next week, after winning a significant victory in the battle over the fast-growing smartphone and tablet market, worth $219bn globally.</p> <p>Removing the infringing products may have only a limited effect on Samsung's US business, where it <a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/all-products\">offers 152 different phones</a> through a number of different carriers. The injunctions, if effected, would hit about 24 different devices.</p> <p>Judge Lucy Koh, who is presiding over the trial, could also triple the damages of $1.05bn awarded by the nine-strong jury, because they decided that the infringements of Apple's patents \u2013 some to do with the devices' behaviour, and others to do with close resemblances to the iPhone \u2013 were \"willful\". US law permits a tripling of damages in such cases. Even so Samsung, whose electronics division made an operating profit of $5.2bn in the second quarter of the year, can bear such a payment.</p> <p>It may also offer tweaked devices to get around any injunction: \"Samsung has already made some design changes to new products since the litigation first started more than a year ago,\" said Seo Won-seok, an analyst at Korea Investment &amp; Securities. \"With the ruling, they are now more likely to make further changes; or they could simply decide to raise product prices to cover patent-related payments.\" </p> <p>But lawyers for the South Korean company indicated that they will ask Koh to throw out the verdict, and that if that fails they will appeal the case to a higher court. \"This decision should not be allowed to stand because it would discourage innovation and limit the rights of consumers to make choices for themselves,\" Samsung lead lawyer John Quinn said. </p> <p>Koh will give her decision in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Meanwhile analysts think that Google, which writes the Android mobile software used by Samsung and dozens of others, may have to indemnify handset makers against such lawsuits. They also fear it could mean fewer smartphone options for consumers.</p> <p>\"Some of these device makers might end up saying 'We love Android, but we really don't want to fight with Apple anymore,'\" said Christopher Marlett, CEO of MDB Capital Group, an investment bank specialising in intellectual property. \"I think it may ultimately come down to Google having to indemnify these guys, if it wants them to continue using Android.\"</p> <p>Horace Dediu, of the Asymco consultancy, said that he thinks there is no chance of Google offering such an indemnity. Google has instead acquired Motorola Mobility (MMI) for $12.5bn, bringing with it an extensive patent portfolio which it hopes to use to fend off Apple's attacks on Android handset makers.</p> <p>Nomura analyst CW Chung, speaking before the verdict, predicted it could take \"many years\" for Apple and Samsung to settle the case, whatever the result of the latest round, leaving the two firmly in control of the global smartphone market. </p> <p>\"The litigation may end up with both parties entering a cross-licensing agreement, which should enable them to build a higher patent wall in the smartphone market,\" said Chung. \"This would have a positive impact on the share prices of Samsung and Apple, while posing a substantial threat to other competitors.\" Apple had testified that it previously offered the allegedly infringed patents for licence to Samsung for about $30 per device. Samsung declined at the time.</p> <p>Apple filed its patent infringement lawsuit in April 2011 and engaged the country's highest-paid patent lawyers to demand $2.5bn from its top smartphone competitor. Samsung Electronics fired back with its own lawsuit seeking $399m.</p> <p>The jury on Friday rejected all of Samsung's claims against Apple, but also decided against some of Apple's claims involving the two dozen Samsung devices at issue.</p> <p>The nine-strong group, which included people with experience at companies including Intel, found that several Samsung products illegally used such Apple creations as the \"bounce-back\" feature when a user scrolls to the end of a list, and the ability to zoom text with a tap of a finger. But they decided that Samsung's Galaxy Tab tablets did not mimic the \"trade dress\", or appearance of Apple's iPad in a way that could confuse consumers. </p> <p>The US case was the latest skirmish in a global legal battle between the two tech giants. Its outcome is likely to have ripple effects in the smartphone market. Other device makers relying on Android, the mobile operating system that Google has given for free to Samsung and other phone makers, may be more reluctant to use the software and risk getting dragged into court.</p> <p>During closing arguments, Apple attorney Harold McElhinny claimed Samsung had a \"crisis of design\" after the 2007 launch of the iPhone, and that its executives were determined to cash in illegally on the success of the revolutionary device.</p> <p>Samsung's lawyers countered that it was legally giving consumers what they want: smartphones with big screens. They said Samsung didn't violate Apple's patents and alleged innovations claimed by Apple were created by other companies.</p> <p>Samsung said after the verdict that it was \"unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners\".</p> <p>\"This is by no means the final word in this case,\" Quinn said in a statement. \"Patent law should not be twisted so as to give one company a monopoly over the shape of smartphones.\" The jury had determined that Samsung did infringe the iPhone's \"trade dress\" with a number of its products.</p> <p>The jurors' determination that Samsung took Apple's ideas probably matters more to the companies than the monetary damages, Marlett said.</p> <p>\"I don't know if $1bn is hugely significant to Apple or Samsung,\" Marlett said. \"But there is a social cost here. As a company, you don't want to be known as someone who steals from someone else. I am sure Samsung wants to be known as an innovator, especially since a lot of Asian companies have become known for copying the designs of innovators.\"</p> <p>DJ Jung, representative patent attorney for SU Intellectual Property, said: \"The impact on Samsung will be quite limited, as affected models are mostly legacy products and its new products did make some design changes to avoid potential litigation. Still ... it's a sweeping loss in the most important market. It's inevitable that Samsung's brand will be negatively affected - Samsung could be perceived as a copycat.\" </p> <p>Apple and Samsung together account for more than half of global smartphone sales. Samsung said in court that it sold 22.7m smartphones and tablets that Apple had claimed use its technology. McElhinny said those devices accounted for $8.16bn in sales since June 2010.</p> <p>Samsung's Galaxy line of phones run on Android, and ISI Group analysts viewed the verdict as a blow to Android as much as Samsung.</p> <p>If Android loses ground in the mobile computing market, that would hurt Google, because it relies on Android to drive mobile traffic to its search engine and services to sell more advertising. Apple presently uses Google's search on the iPhone and iPad, but observers have wondered whether that will persist as Apple has removed more and more Google defaults from the iPhone and iPad. Its upcoming software for the devices will replace Google's maps with Apple's own, and stop offering a YouTube video player.</p> <p>Google entered the smartphone market while its then-CEO Eric Schmidt was on Apple's board, infuriating Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who considered elements of Android to be blatant rip-offs of the iPhone's innovations.</p> <p>After shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Jobs vowed that Apple would resort to \"thermonuclear war\" to destroy Android and its allies.</p> <p>The Apple-Samsung trial came after each side filed a blizzard of legal motions and refused advisories by the judge to settle the dispute out of court. Legal experts and Wall Street analysts had viewed Samsung as the trial's underdog. Apple's headquarters is just 10 miles from the San Jose courthouse, and jurors were picked from the heart of Silicon Valley, where Jobs is a revered technological pioneer.</p> <p>A verdict came after less than three days of deliberations, surprising observers who expected longer deliberations because of the case's complexity.</p> <p>While the issues were complex, patent expert Alexander I Poltorak had said the case would likely boil down to whether jurors believed Samsung's products look and feel like Apple's iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>Samsung's lawyers argued that many of Apple's claims of innovation were either obvious concepts or ideas stolen from Sony Corp and others. Experts called that line of argument a high-risk strategy because of Apple's reputation as an innovator.</p> <p>Apple's lawyers argued there is almost no difference between Samsung products and those of Apple, and presented internal Samsung documents they said showed it copied Apple designs. Samsung lawyers insisted that several other companies and inventors had developed much of the Apple technology at issue.</p> <p>Apple and Samsung have filed similar lawsuits in South Korea, Germany, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, France and Australia.</p> <p>\"This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, some of which have already rejected many of Apple's claims,\" Samsung said in its statement.</p> <p>Samsung <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/24/apple-samsung-fined-patent-breaches?newsfeed\\u003dtrue\">won a home court ruling earlier on Friday in the global patent battle</a> against Apple. Judges in Seoul said Samsung didn't copy the look and feel of the iPhone and ruled that Apple infringed on Samsung's wireless technology.</p> <p>But like the jury in California, South Korean judges said Samsung violated Apple's technology behind the \"bounce-back\" feature. Both sides were ordered to pay limited damages.</p> <p>The Seoul ruling was a rare victory for Samsung in its arguments that Apple has infringed on its wireless technology patents. Samsung's claims previously were shot down by courts in Europe, where judges ruled that Samsung patents must be licensed under fair terms to competitors. Europe's antitrust lawyers are now investigating whether Samsung abused its position of having \"standards-essential patents\" and failing to license them.</p> <p>The US case is one of 50 lawsuits among myriad telecommunications companies jockeying for position in the global smartphone and tablet markets.</p>",

  "<p>Wayne Rooney began this game on the bench and ended it on a stretcher. Considerations of how much Manchester United had actually been improved by his arrival for the last 20 minutes \u2013 both he and Robin van Persie were largely anonymous during the time they shared on the pitch \u2013 were suspended when the England striker suffered a badly gashed knee in stoppage time after colliding with Hugo Rodallega's studs.</p> <p>That means Sir Alex Ferguson will have to continue to work through his attacking options, but the point since the arrival of Van Persie and Shinji Kagawa \u2013 both of whom scored \u2013 is that United now have attacking options. Not too long ago they were being derided for over-reliance on Rooney. As Fulham discovered to their cost they can now dispense with him and still play like the old United, not only creating a succession of chances but accepting enough of them to make their superiority count.</p> <p>Van Persie will probably score more goals and command more headlines, yet Kagawa is the sort of clever technician, both industrious and precise, that Ferguson has been seeking for a while. When he made way for Rooney he did so to applause.</p> <p>For all that, United started in a trance. The danger with having Usain Bolt and his gold medals on the pitch before the kick-off is that your own efforts are bound to look pedestrian in comparison, and United were certainly slow out of the blocks in allowing Fulham to take the lead three minutes into the game. No one picked up Damien Duff as Bryan Ruiz rolled a low free-kick across the goalmouth, and though the Irishman almost overran the ball he still managed to dig out a shot that surprised David de Gea.</p> <p>Bolt was still taking his seat as the goal went in \u2013 no one ever set a personal best in the South Stand \u2013 though at least he was in place to get a good view of Van Persie's first goal for his new club. A pretty impressive one it was too, the former Arsenal striker clipping a stunning left-foot half-volley past Mark Schwarzer from Patrice Evra's left wing cross to equalise after 10 minutes. That in turn was followed by Kagawa's first goal for United, a tap-in from two yards after Schwarzer had failed to hold Tom Cleverley's shot following a half-cleared Van Persie corner.</p> <p>The Fulham players complained with some justification that Kagawa had scored from an offside position, having failed to move up as promptly as the defenders, though the linesman was in an ideal position following the corner and kept his flag down.</p> <p>He raised it, quite correctly, two minutes later to deny Rafael da Silva a goal after Kagawa had struck a post, though United's busy right-back was not to be kept quiet for long.</p> <p>Four minutes before the interval he climbed powerfully at the far post to beat Mladen Petric to the ball and force a header past Schwarzer from Ashley Young's inviting cross.</p> <p>They were winners by five goals last week but it looked like it was Fulham's turn to take a hiding, though they were not about to take it lying down. Duff brought a save from De Gea just before the break, and when Petric attempted to drive home the rebound the goalkeeper reacted well again to divert the shot on to the bar and out to safety.</p> <p>De Gea's confidence is a fragile thing, however, and, though Nemanja Vidic was credited with the own goal that brought Fulham back into the game just after the hour, fault clearly lay with the goalkeeper for coming for the ball and failing to claim it, punch it or deal in any way with it. At best it was a mix-up between the two players, yet with only Petric to worry about between them the goalkeeper should never have let Matthew Briggs's cross even reach his fellow defender.</p> <p>While Rooney and Danny Welbeck were enthusiastically received by the home crowd their arrival coincided with a creative lull, possibly a result of Kagawa's departure, until Rafael brought the game to life again with a rasping drive that Schwarzer had to stretch to tip over.</p> <p>Remarkably the game was quite finely poised at this point and Fulham realised a draw was now possible and gave the United defence one or two scares, notably at the death when De Gea punched Ruiz's header off the line. In the end United had to rely on their first-half efforts to see them through, which was a slight worry before Rooney became a major one.</p> <p>\"The intensity we showed in the first half was terrific,\" Ferguson said. \"But once again we saw the two sides of Manchester United.</p> <p>\"In the first half we were on cruise control, we should have been four or five goals up and out of sight, but then we concede a stupid goal with a terrible mistake and suddenly we are hanging on. I was quite pleased with some of the football we produced, though, and Robin van Persie's goal was fantastic. Considering it was his first full game for the club he is bound to improve as he develops a better understanding with the other players.\"</p>",

  "<p>Amnesty International said it had received credible reports that Gambia executed nine death-row prisoners on Friday.</p> <p>The human rights organisation said eight men and one woman were removed from their prison cells and killed, and warned that dozens more executions could be imminent.</p> <p>The Civil Society Associations of Gambia said it was not clear how inmates were killed. \"What is however clear is that inmates were rounded up at 9.30pm on Thursday 23 August and that by the morning of 24 August, the bodies were actually lying in the Mile Two Prison yard,\" it said.</p> <p>The Gambian government has not officially confirmed reports but a statement issued late on Friday said: \"All persons on death row have been tried by the Gambian courts of competent jurisdiction and thereof convicted and sentenced to death in accordance with the law. They have exhausted all their legal rights of appeal as provided by the law.\"</p> <p>It added: \"The peace and stability of our beloved nation as regards to protection of the lives, liberty and property of individuals must at all cost be preserved and jealously guarded.\"</p> <p>The country's president, Yahya Jammeh, announced earlier this month that all prisoners on death row would be executed by mid-September to tackle a rising crime rate and to dissuade people from committing \"heinous crimes\".</p> <p>Speaking in a televised broadcast to mark the Muslim festival of Eid, Jammeh said: \"All those guilty of serious crimes and are condemned will face the full force of the law. All punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve: that is, that those who kill are killed&#xa0;\u2026 By the middle of next month, all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter.\"</p> <p>The African Union was among those who called on Jammeh to row back on his announcement and along with the UK, French and Nigerian governments have expressed shock at the latest reports. Jammeh made a similar threat in September 2009 but no executions were carried out.</p> <p>According to Amnesty there were 47 inmates on death row before Friday's reports, and three of the nine who were reportedly executed had been sentenced for treason.</p> <p>Death sentences can be handed down for murder and treason, including coup-plotting, which has led to fears that executions could be used to remove political opponents. <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/blog/2010_10_07_Blog_/\" title=\"\">Reprieve also said in 2010 that the death penalty had been introduced</a> for individuals in possession of more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin.</p> <p>A Gambian security source told the AFP news agency that all 47 death row prisoners had been \"transferred to one place\", leading to warnings that all those on death row are under imminent threat. \"[Jammeh] is determined to execute the prisoners and he will do so,\" the source said.</p> <p>The alleged executions are the first in Gambia since 1985 but although Gambia reinstated the death penalty in 1995, shortly after Jammeh took power in a military coup, no prisoners are believed to have been killed until now, Amnesty said.</p> <p>Amnesty said the executions, if confirmed, would be \"a hugely retrograde step\" that would put the Gambia in the minority of African states that impose the death penalty.</p> <p>Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International's Africa director, described Jammeh's aim to execute prisoners as \"deeply troubling\".</p> <p>\"Any attempt to carry out this threat would be both deeply shocking and a major setback for human rights in Gambia,\" she said. The president's statement is in stark contrast to the trend, both in west Africa and globally, towards ending the use of the death penalty.</p> <p>Unfair trials are commonplace in the country, where death sentences are known to be used as a tool against the political opposition and international standards on fair trials are not respected.</p> <p>She added: \"The number of grossly unfair trials is shocking and an especially serious concern in cases where the death penalty is handed down.\"</p> <p>In October 2009, Gambia's director of public prosecutions was reported to have said that all prisoners who were sentenced to death <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20292\" title=\"\">would be executed by hanging</a>.</p> <p>Recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/29/death-penalty-countries-world\" title=\"\">statistics showed that China, together with Iran, North Korea, Yemen and the US</a> (the only G7 country to still execute people) carried out the most executions last year.</p> <p>In Gambia, 13 people were handed the death penalty in 2010, the same as the previous year.</p>",
  "<p>After many false starts, and leather-laden attempts to further the cause by Madonna, Rihanna and Lady Gaga, it seems that bondage and discipline, sadism and masochism (BDSM) has finally become mainstream. And while it's great that people are having fun exploring their sexuality, the fact that <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> has cemented so many preconceptions about both submissive women and their dominants frustrates me hugely.</p> <p>At this point I must admit to a vested interest: I am a submissive. When you put it that way it sounds terribly big and significant, not least because if everything you know about BDSM comes from EL James's trilogy then you're probably assuming I spend most of my life connected by a digital umbilical cord to my dominant, only a helicopter ride away from fulfilling his every sexual whim.</p> <p>But being submissive is only one facet of the person I am \u2013 and not even the most important. I'm a 33-year-old girlfriend, daughter, sister, friend, journalist, Scrabble fiend, caffeine addict and dozens of other things besides. And, despite what you might have read to the contrary, my sexual urges don't overshadow every other aspect of my personality and life. I'm also, and this might be a tougher sell in some quarters, a feminist.</p> <p>So why do I submit? The first thing to say is that I'm not broken. I grew up in a nice middle-class home in the home counties. There's no deep-seated trauma in my past or anything missing in my formative years that has exacerbated my love of being degraded. I have no daddy issues, there was no angst in my home life and my childhood was \u2013 happily for me, but probably not that excitingly for anyone else \u2013 a loving one. I don't use drugs or drink to excess and have no medical issues, psychological or physical, that more ill-informed people might point to as an explanation for my urges. I just enjoy it, OK?</p> <p>To address some of the other pesky stereotypes: I am neither a doormat nor a simpleton. I don't roll my eyes or gnaw on my lip or yearn to spend my day in the kitchen while someone hunts and gathers for me and I keep the home fires burning, which is just as well as I'm not that great a cook apart from a baking obsession (yes, complete with cliched love for <em>The Great British Bake Off's</em> Paul Hollywood \u2013 it's something about his eyes).</p> <p>Looking back, my submissive tendencies started young, although I wouldn't have called them that then because at that point I barely knew what sex was. I was drawn to the myths of Robin Hood. Maid Marian was boring most of the time, tending the campfire and looking pensively into the middle distance, but I was fascinated by her in peril, as a prisoner, captured, tied up or in chains. I didn't know why, but those stories made my heart race. It's hard to explain my interest in BDSM any more intellectually than that \u2013 I know that I find erotic many things that other people would balk at, but there's no reason I can come up with for why I find them hot, in the same way I can't tell you why I like geeky looking types in glasses, or find Damian Lewis attractive. It's just part of my makeup.</p> <p>My first sexual experiences were pretty vanilla. My early exploration developed into more intense encounters \u2013 although undoubtedly to some folk who indulge in these kind of things I'll still be considered a bit of a lightweight (there's always judging and someone who does it \"better\"). But as I dated I began to realise I thrived on the challenge of submitting to someone else.</p> <p>It might seem strange if you're not that way inclined, but I enjoy the catharsis of the pain \u2013 which, trust me, feels very different in an erotic situation as otherwise I'm the sort of woman who can't cope with a leg wax because it hurts too much. I find being challenged and humiliated hot. Without being big headed, in my day-to-day life I can pretty much handle whatever the universe throws at me, so being on the back foot (although not passive, another misconception of what being submissive means) and reacting often brings about an adrenaline high in its own right. Like sky diving but with more nakedness and no plummeting to the ground.</p> <p>I understand that some schools of feminist thought are going to have problems with submission as a concept. One of my big frustrations with the success of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> is that there is so much of the main relationship that plays into the misconception that a sexual relationship based around BDSM is, at its core, an abusive one. As such, feminists, quite rightly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/fifty-shades-grey-domestic-violence-campaigners\" title=\"\">have a massive problem with it</a>. But while I'd agree with their summation of that (admittedly fictional) relationship, it's as different to my relationship with my partner as night is to day.</p> <p>For a start he's not a po-faced micro-manager \u2013 actually I do most of the organisation of our lives day to day. We live together happily and are partners in every aspect, bicker about doing the washing, look after each other when we're ill, work hard, and sometimes are too exhausted for any sex at all. But when the mood strikes us, he takes total control, inflicting pain, pleasure, or often a mixture of both. It's exhilarating, fun, and admittedly often intense, but has brought about a level of communication between us that I think is one of the core strengths of our relationship. After all, if you can talk to someone about all the taboo things that excite you, then nothing is out of bounds.</p> <p>Despite what I like to do in bed I consider myself a feminist and find it very depressing that because of my informed sexual choices there are women who'd want to wave \"down with this sort of thing\" placards in my direction. Don't get me wrong, I understand that what I enjoy is \u2013 in a different context \u2013 potentially another woman's worst nightmare. It's not something everyone might indulge in, but should I wish to, within safe, sane and consensual circumstances and in privacy with my trusted partner, I'm very uncomfortable with anyone telling me I can't or I shouldn't.</p> <p>The sexual aspect of my relationship is completely separate from other aspects of it \u2013 I am in control of my finances, my reproductive health, my career, my social life and all the other things that feminism has fought for. I genuinely believe it's the fundamental misunderstanding of what BDSM is that contributes a lot to feminists' opposition to dominant/submissive relationships \u2013 and this misunderstanding is perpetuated in epic fashion across EL James's trilogy.</p> <p>For me, the book is as much a fetishisation of capitalism as it is a discourse on BDSM. Christian Grey may be a stalkerish sort with epic amounts of emotional baggage, but the accoutrements of wealth he offers \u2013 designer labels, helicopters and expensive gifts \u2013 are deemed enough that our virginal heroine should stick with him, endure his peccadilloes and keep trying to change him. It's very much focused on ending up married and settled and financially secure \u2013 Mills &amp; Boon with butt plugs.</p> <p>So far so anodyne, but ultimately harmless. Except that a lot of what happens in the main relationship of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey </em>is domestic abuse, both physical and emotional, and for people whose entire understanding of BDSM now comes from jiggle balls and rooms of pain this is a dangerous misconception to foster. It comes back to the nature of consent, the fact that I am enjoying rather than enduring what we're doing and that fundamentally the power remains with me. I decide who to submit to, how much control to give them and what my limits are. And if I use my safe word then it stops immediately. Also, it's about context. Feeling challenged, even feeling demeaned within this sexual context is different to domestic abuse.</p> <p>Domestic abuse is fundamentally indefensible and suggesting BDSM somehow endorses or encourages sexual violence is not only wrong but \u2013 after a week when George Galloway et al<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/20/george-galloway-julian-assange-rape\" title=\"\"> have tried to underplay rape</a> in disgusting fashion \u2013 a frustrating red herring that needs clarification. Women do not make men rapists or physical abusers, and this subtextual blame culture (also encompassed by US congressman Todd Akin and his pronouncements about \"legitimate rape\") is much more damaging to women than anything I get up to in bed.</p> <p>BDSM might be mainstream now, but it has a new PR problem. I blame Christian Grey.</p> <p><em>The Diary of a Submissive, by Sophie Morgan, is published by Penguin on 30 August, \u00a37.99 </em></p>",
  "<p>Some of them believe Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Others want to force raped women who become pregnant to have their child. There are those who vilify Obama as a socialist and want to do away with most of the federal government. A fair few doubt the theory of evolution or hold that gays can be \"cured\".</p> <p>As Mitt Romney arrives at the <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\" title=\"\">Republican national convention </a>in Tampa, Florida, where he will be nominated to run for president, he faces the difficult task of dealing with a party base that has become one of the most radical in recent American history.</p> <p>Convulsed by the rise of the anti-government Tea Party and dominated by socially conservative Christians, the Republican party has continued to move right in recent years. That means the carefully laid plans for a Tampa convention aimed at introducing a voter-friendly version of Romney could easily be upset by the party's more extreme elements.</p> <p>\"They don't want anyone to look behind the curtain,\" said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California, Riverside. \"You want the party base to turn up, give money and keep quiet. But it is hard to keep them quiet.\" However, the curtain has already been lifted to some degree.</p> <p>The week leading up to the convention was supposed to see a media rollout of Romney as a president-in-waiting. Instead it was dominated by an ugly row centred on a Republican Missouri Senate candidate,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/akin-under-pressure-to-quit\" title=\"\"> congressman Todd Akin</a>, who used the phrase \"legitimate rape\" while talking about denying abortions to pregnant rape victims.</p> <p>Romney called on him to leave the race and the Republican national committee chairman, Reince Priebus, asked him not to come to Tampa. But in a sign of how little control the party's elite has over its base, Akin refused to step down and last week was spotted in Tampa meeting social conservative groups. At the same time it was revealed that Akin supporters had coughed up $100,000 for his campaign funds in two days.</p> <p>But party bigwigs should perhaps not be surprised. Though Akin's language was shocking, his views are <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79945.html\" title=\"\">not too different from the party's official policy platform</a> \u2013 in defiance of Romney. Indeed that extreme position on abortion is one historically shared by Paul Ryan, the outspoken Wisconsin conservative picked by Romney as his running mate.</p> <p>There is a real consequence to such disputes over contentious social issues. Romney's support among women, perhaps influenced by recent spats over abortion and reproductive rights, has plummeted. A survey last week showed Romney lagging by 13% with women voters in six key battleground states. Obama was beating Romney by 52% to 39% and about half of women voters said they were less likely to vote for Romney since he chose Ryan.</p> <p>Nor is it just this issue that is likely to hamper Romney as he tries to pull off the complicated double act of using the Tampa convention to appeal to America's middle ground, while also appeasing a conservative base that doesn't trust him.</p> <p>Gay marriage is guaranteed to fire up the base and Tampa will see some vocal opponents making a great deal of noise. Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman and former Romney presidential rival, will be speaking at numerous events. They include a \"Unity Rally 2012\" that is going to be held at a church tomorrow night. Bachmann has spoken out vociferously on gay rights, once referring to homosexuality as \"part of Satan\".</p> <p>Appearing alongside Bachmann will be former pizza magnate Herman Cain, another former rival to Romney, who caused eyebrows to be raised when he briefly became the frontrunner in the bitter party nomination race, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ana-marie-cox-blog/2011/dec/05/herman-cain-loss-newt-gingrich-gain\" title=\"\">only to drop out</a> over sexual harassment allegations. But he remains popular with many in the Tea Party, who admire his impassioned support for slashing government spending and instituting a controversial flat tax plan.</p> <p>Other Tea Party darlings will include <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-moore/ted-cruz-david-dewhurst_b_1723099.html\" title=\"\">Ted Cruz</a>, a Senate candidate in Texas who is being touted as a future party leader and has been given a high-profile speaking slot at the convention. Yet Cruz holds beliefs far outside the mainstream. He has warned that Islamic sharia law is an \"enormous problem\" in America, says elected officials should not march in gay pride parades and believes the UN is secretly trying to undermine America's economy and sovereignty.</p> <p>And then there is another Tea Party favourite who has been given a prominent role in Tampa: real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump.</p> <p>Trump has told his fans to prepare for a surprise at Tampa, which is likely to be a video in which he sacks an Obama impersonator and deploys his famous \"You're fired!\" catchphrase. But having Trump so visible is a political risk. He is one of the leading proponents <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/donald-trump-birther-obama-birth-certificate_n_1749257.html\" title=\"\">of the \"Birther\" movement,</a> which questions whether Obama was born in America. His presence is hardly designed to show an air of moderation or seriousness.</p> <p>A final thorn in Romney's side could be Texan congressman Ron Paul. Libertarian-leaning Paul is bowing out of national politics, but his followers are going to be vocal in Tampa, highlighting their beliefs in minimal government, an anti-war foreign policy and getting rid of the Federal Reserve. Though Paul won no individual states while he was running against Romney, his campaign later tried to exploit arcane party rules to send as many Paul-supporting delegates to the convention as possible. Fights over that \"stealth strategy\" have ended up in the courts and, in Louisiana, resulted in arrests and physical injuries.</p> <p>Now thousands of Paul supporters are holding a three-day festival in Tampa in his honour. Paul himself will speak tomorrow night at a rally at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome. Coverage is hardly likely to leave the impression that Romney heads a united or a moderate party.</p> <p>One thing that could dampen things is Hurricane Isaac, which is barrelling towards Florida and may yet force some of the convention to be delayed or cancelled. \"For Romney, that is probably a blessing in disguise,\" said Bowler.</p>",
  "<p>As the Edinburgh International Book Festival enters its final weekend we heed the insistent call of the world outside. The Guardian's Jonathan Steele joins the barrister Sadakat Kadri to examine the tragedy of Afghanistan and the myths which surround sharia law. Steele argues that the US-led invasion of 2001 was condemned to repeat the failures of the Soviet invasion of 1979 because of a series of misunderstandings, of which the most pernicious was perhaps that the west had abandoned the country after the Soviet withdrawal. Kadri tells how interpreters of Islamic law have become progressively more ready to justify aggresion over the last three decades and what that means for the future.</p> <p>The Argentine novelist Carlos Gamerro tells us how he just couldn't avoid the Falklands war in his first novel, The Islands, which has just been published in English. He examines how fiction can measure up to the horrors of a dictatorship and how the detective is the perfect vehicle for a literary investigation of society.</p> <h2>Reading list<br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/history/9781846274312/ghosts-of-afghanistan-the-haunted-battleground\">Ghosts of Afghanistan</a> by Jonathan Steele (Portobello)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/religion/9781847920164/heaven-on-earth-a-journey-through-sharia-law\">Heaven on Earth</a> by Sadakat Kadri (Bodley Head)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781908276087/the-islands\">The Islands</a> by Carlos Gamerro (And Other Stories)</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have launched a \u00a32m emergency plan to tackle a cholera epidemic sweeping through Sierra Leone.</p> <p>It is the first time the Department for International Development has activated its Rapid Response Facility, which will tap into a network of private businesses and aid organisations to deliver emergency medical, water and sanitation to people affected by the epidemic.</p> <p>The water-borne disease, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea, has already killed more than 200 people, with more than 12,000 infected across the west African country. It is expected to peak in three weeks' time.</p> <p>DfID said the \u00a32m would go towards providing clean water and sanitation to nearly 2 million people and would also fund direct treatment for up to 4,500 people affected by the disease. Anti-cholera drugs and water purification kits will also be shipped to the country.</p> <p>The international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said: \"The cholera epidemic in Sierra Leone is fast becoming a crisis, with millions potentially at risk. The UK is \u2013 for the first time \u2013 activating the Rapid Response Facility, its network of private sector and aid experts to make sure we get aid to where it is needed, fast.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We will monitor closely to make sure every penny of British aid achieves results and supports those in dire need.\"</p> <p>Save the Children, Oxfam, Care International and the British Red Cross have all been drafted in as part of the emergency response. DfID said the department's private sector partners, which includes Standard Chartered Bank, Guava International and global satellite company AST Systems, would supply the majority of the aid organisations' relief supplies and logistics.</p> <p>The network was established in March and allows the UK government \"to commit to rapid humanitarian funding\" within 72 hours in response to disasters and rapidly escalating humanitarian emergencies.</p> <p>Save the Children said it was scaling up its response to support government cholera treatment units and increase the number of trained community health workers.</p> <p>The outbreak has affected other parts of west Africa but Sierra Leone has been worst hit, especially in the capital Freetown, where poor sanitation and dirty water in slum areas has contributed to the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Heather Kerr, Save the Children's Sierra Leone country director, said children were particularly vulnerable. \"If we can't get this outbreak under control quickly and comprehensively, it has the potential to kill many more children,\" she said. \"Children die very quickly from cholera if they don't receive immediate medical help. The sheer volume of people who are contracting the disease means that aid agencies need more funding now to respond more efficiently to this devastating outbreak.\"</p>",
  "<p>On China's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qixi_Festival\" title=\"\">Valentine's Day</a> (the seventh day of the seventh lunar month in the Chinese calendar, which fell on 23 August this year), 30 migrant workers were taken by surprise when they were invited to a business networking dinner by several college students in Shanghai who, during their summer internships, had happened to see the migrants' miserable working life on the city's construction sites. The move by the students, who wore T-shirts saying \"Invite a Migrant Worker to a Meal\" was televised as a primetime entertainment..</p> <p>This says much about the social attitudes towards migrant workers, who often come from the vast interior of the country. They make up half of China's urban workforce and account for half of the country's GDP. They are indispensable, and yet are the most socially marginalised group of workers in China.</p> <p>Yet rural migrants continue to suffer from deep-seated prejudice and discrimination. Not only are they denied access to public services in the cities due to the <em>hukou </em>(household registration) system, they are also subjected to day-to-day exclusion and abuse. You see them being talked to and shouted at like children in public places; you see them banned from hotel lobbies and posh restaurants. And as an angry blogger pointed out when observing open discrimination against rural migrants, he said that the \"No Dogs or Chinese\" signs put up by western colonialists in the 1920s and 1930s have been replaced by the \"No Dogs or Peasants\" signs at shopping malls in the cities. How have these become acceptable?</p> <p>Since Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening-up (<em>gaige kaifang</em>) era, the media has led the way in manufacturing images about rural migrants and reinforcing prejudice against them. The word \"peasant\" (<em>nongmin</em>) has always had negative connotations, either implying ignorance and lack of education or carrying a patronising tone, addressing passive masses receiving benevolence from the rulers. Since the 1980s and 1990s, the media began to widely use to the term \"blind flow\" (<em>mangliu</em>) to describe rural-to-urban migration, portraying an irrational, senseless and out-of-control migration of labour into the cities. This negative language has long shaped public views and sentiments towards rural migrants and further deepened the prejudice against them.</p> <p>Nongmin is a permanent social status that entails someone's inferior educational and cultural background as well as economic capabilities. As a segregated social class, nongmin carry the subordinated status with them wherever they migrate. I had a Chinese publisher questioning me about the dialogue I wrote for a rural migrant when he discussed politics. She said: \"How can a peasant speak like that? They aren't intelligent enough to analyse things that way.\" I also had a Chinese reporter saying to me: \"Don't trust what the peasants tell you; they would mislead you.\" Neither of them has had any experience working with anyone in the rural communities.</p> <p>This raises the question about the media's distance and lack of knowledge of the \"rural\" of which social imagery they have been shaping. Interestingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a>, in his Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class, talked about a similar process where the media lacks contact with and knowledge of the class they are belittling. The media take on the role of demonising the working class, Jones says, and providing moral justification for the state to deny that class of entitlements.</p> <p>Similarly, the Chinese media manufacture \"inherent\" moral deficiency and characteristics of the nongmin in order to justify their lack of rights and entitlements. Thus the idea that nongmin are inherently much less intelligent and unable to make sense of their own reality; thus the idea that nongmin are \"a blind flow of labour crowding into the cities\" and they \"create social and economic problems\" for the urbanite. It is the equivalent of the Daily Mail in the UK \u2013 Jones quotes the Mail's remarks on the \"council-estate working class\": \"These are the people who are getting sentimental about a vicious killer; they have no values, no morality and are so thick that they are beyond redemption.\"</p> <p>And then see Chinese bloggers condemning migrant workers in Yunnan who held a protest with their children holding placards \"Hand over my parents' sweat and blood money!\" in order to claim back owed wages. One blogger sneered: \"What kind of parent would let their kids beg money for them?\"</p> <p>As China's rural migrants have had this class distinction stamped on them permanently, the only way their demands for social justice and equal rights can be justified is through the promotion of national economic interests and the greater good. One way to advance the rural migrants' case for better access to public services in the cities is to argue that they could power consumer spending growth in China. As China Daily <a href=\"http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2012-08/21/content_15693053.htm\" title=\"\">reports</a> this week, \"The 230 million-strong migrant workforce drives China's economy, but a lack of access to education, health and other services \u2026 forces massive saving, restraining Beijing's efforts to shift growth's focus to consumption from investment.\" No media are able to talk about migrant workers' basic rights.</p> <p>Social attitudes will take a long time to change in China, and the media is guilty of delaying that change. Rural migrants need to be treated as citizens, like everyone else, not as passive nongmin to be receiving occasional goodwill and charity. Much more needs to be done than taking migrants to a Chinese Valentine's dinner.</p>",
  "<p>In modest imitation of Charles Dickens' early work, the <em>Guardian Northerner</em> runs occasional reports of life in our three regions' courts. The first, including a claim for the record of the UK's fastest jury trial in modern times, or possibly ever, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/13/courts-aliens-teesside-burglary-jury-record-hull\">is here</a>.</p> <p>And here is the second; starting with a schoolboy who appeared before magistrates this week on <a href=\"http://www.visitmiddlesbrough.com/\">Teesside</a> accused of going to school.</p> <p>In legal terms, the charge was causing a nuisance or disturbance on school premises but the story is a wider morality tale, as was so <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/feb/22/charles-dickens-abel-magwitch-transportation\">often the case</a> in Dickens' work. The boy, who cannot be named any more than the school can because he is under age and the proceedings were in Teesside youth court, was hardly doing anything which would normally warrant lawyers.</p> <p>He had gone in to a friend's technology class to help him with his woodwork, but the trouble was, that he had been excluded from the school two years ago and still is. The technology teacher, who had not been in the job long, did not recognise him although someone else did pretty smartly. The court heard that he had been challenged at 8.45am.</p> <p>Kate Hills, prosecuting, told the court: </p> <blockquote> <p>He had gone into the technology room and was assisting one of his friends with his work. Police were called and he was removed from the school and interviewed.</p> </blockquote> <p>She added that the boy had a history while at school of swearing and throwing furniture around which had led to his exclusion.</p> <p>John Clish, defending, came to the morality tale part of the case. The boy was bored. Whatever the frustrations of school, he was not enjoying life without it.</p> <blockquote> <p>At the time of the offence he was not doing anything meaningful and was maybe envious of his friends who had the benefit of education.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>His entry into the school had been 'relatively straightforward', he pleaded guilty and appreciated that he shouldn't have done it and he had sent a letter apologising. </p> <p>The boy was given a three month referral order to regular sessions which, if not quite the same as school, will try to address the problems facing him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395191051\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2010/9/8/1283968820464/Middlesbrough-at-sunset-001.jpg\" alt=\"Middlesbrough at sunset\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middlesbrough at sunset: the area has been named as the most vulnerable in England to government spending cuts.

I would like a prison sentence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Recorder adjourned while Harrison had a brief discussion with his solicitor Gordon Brown who then told the court that he would accept the original sentence after all.

  "<p>Questions have been raised over the New York police department's handling of a shooting near the Empire State Building after armed officers injured nine passers-by as they pursued a gunman who had just shot dead his former boss.</p> <p>One of those injured by police told the Guardian that officers appeared to fire \"randomly\" as they confronted Jeffrey Johnson, 58, minutes after a workplace dispute escalated into a chaotic shootout in one of the busiest parts of Manhattan.</p> <p>Reports suggest that while Johnson drew his gun when he was confronted by officers, he did not fire; all those injured appear to have been shot by police. The New York police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, said officers had no choice but to act as they did: police discharged 14 rounds and the gunman died at the scene.</p> <p>The incident began just after 9am on Friday when Johnson, described as a \"disgruntled former employee\", walked up to Steve Ercolino, 41, his former manager at Hazan Imports, a business that operates from premises in Midtown, near the Empire State Building. Johnson shot him three times before calmly walking away.</p> <p>A construction worker alterted two police officers stationed at the landmark. They appear to have attempted to stop Johnson, who dropped a bag and pulled out his gun, according to witnesses. In the ensuing shootout, Johnson died.</p> <p>Panic soon ensued in the tourist-heavy streets around the Empire State Building, with fears that another mass shooting was under way. However, it became clear that it was not a random attack when police revealed the victim was targeted. Johnson had previously been fired from the business.</p> <p>Robert Asika was among those wounded, shot in the elbow from a distance of around eight feet by one of the two police officers who confronted Johnson. He accused police of \"shooting randomly\", and said he saw at least two others hit by police bullets.</p> <p>\"If you're gonna aim try and aim perfectly. If you wanna aim at the target, you got to know what you're doing because it's the street,\" Asika said. \"I could have been dead right now. I could have been dead.\"</p> <p>Asika was working on 5th Avenue on Friday morning, selling tickets for tour buses and the building's observation deck. He had only been in the job a week, after having been unemployed for over a year. \"I was just standing there and I saw people running. I didn't want to run because I wanted to know why people were running so I turned around and I saw this guy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"He was suited up, he had like a tie and a briefcase. If you see him, you'd probably think he was like a doctor, or maybe a lawyer, a business guy. He just looked like a normal guy.\"</p> <p>Johnson, who was wearing a light-coloured suit, had just killed his former boss and was walking calmly away. \"Jeffrey just came from behind two cars, pulled out his gun, put it up to Steve's head and shot him,\" said Carol Timan, whose daughter, Irene, was walking to Hazan Imports at the time with Ercolino. A construction worker saw the shooting and told two police officers who were stationed outside the Empire State Building. </p> <p>The mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg \u2013 a vocal critic of America's lax firearm controls \u2013 said: \"Once again, there are an awful lot of guns out there.\" He added that although homicides in New York were on the decline, \"we are not immune to the problem of gun violence\".</p> <p>Police said Johnson been employed for six years as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Imports. Kelly said during a press conference that he was laid off as part of a downsizing at the firm. Kelly described the gunman as a \"disgruntled former employee\" who came back to confront his former manager. \"He shot and killed the former co-worker, striking him three times,\" Kelly said.</p> <p>Johnson moved to draw his weapon, a .45 caliber handgun, as the officers approached, police said. There are conflicting reports as to what happened next. \"The [police] tape clearly shows that the gunman had the gun out, and was trying to kill the officers,\" Bloomberg said. Other officials at the scene reportedly said the man had not fired on police.</p> <p>The two police officers discharged 14 rounds, killing Johnson outside the entrance to the Empire State Building. Kelly at first said Johnson fired on officers, but police later said they were trying to determine whether Johnson fired. \"These officers ... had absolutely no choice,\" Kelly said. \"This individual took a gun out very close to them and perhaps fired at them.\"</p> <p>Johnson legally bought the gun in Sarasota, Florida, in 1991, but he did not have a required permit to possess the weapon in New York City, police said.</p> <p>Four women and five men were taken to city hospitals with gunshot wounds, but none was believed to be in a life-threatening condition. Police shut down nearby streets as forensic teams checked the gunman's body. The FBI were quick to confirm that the attack was not an act of terrorism.</p> <p>Askia described the scene when officers caught up with Johnson. He said the gunman stopped six feet away from him, with two officers about eight feet in the other direction. \"All of a sudden the guy stopped, and he was facing a cop who was following him,\" Asika said.</p> <p>\"He just reached in his suit and took out the gun, and I saw him pull it [towards] the cops. I'm like, is this guy for real? One of the cops was trying to shoot back at him and one of them shot me while the other one shot the guy.\"</p> <p>\"As soon as the bullet hit me, I felt like I didn't feel it. But then as soon as I tried to get up, I couldn't get up. I looked there and the blood was gushing out,\" Asika said.</p> <p>\"I was crawling, trying to get across the street, to the safe side of the street. I got across the street and I just fell at the bus stop and I was laying there and I couldn't get up no more. I was so tired, I was so scared. I've never been scared like that in my whole life.\"</p> <p>Asika said Bloomberg visited him in hospital, but he received no apology from police. He was discharged with his arm bandaged and in a sling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F57410489&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Erica Solar, a mother of two who works as a receptionist on 37th Street, was hit in the back of the leg as she made her way to Dunkin' Donuts. Solar's friend, Christopher Collins, found her lying on the street as he got off a bus on his way to work.</p> <p>\"She was basically in shock. She didn't know if she had gotten stabbed or if she had gotten shot, but she just knew she was bleeding, and I was just there trying to keep her calm until paramedics arrived,\" Collins told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"It was chaotic. Everybody was running, cops were there immediately,\" Collins said. Solar was taken to Bellevue hospital, about a mile from the Empire State Building.</p> <p>Another among the wounded was Media Rosario, from Brooklyn, who like Solar was hit in the back of the leg. She said that everything happened so fast, she saw people running, and when she turned around to see what happened, she was already shot,\" said her sister-in-law, Auselis Rosario.</p> <p>Johnson lived alone in the Upper East Side, his superintendent, Guillermo Suarez confirmed to the Associated Press. Suarez described Johnson as a \"very likeable guy\" who always wore a suit. \"He was always alone,\" said Gisela Casella, who lived a few floors above him. \"I always felt bad. I said 'Doesn't he have a girlfriend?' I never saw him with anybody.\"</p> <p>City officials were quick to praise the response by police and the construction worker who followed Johnson from the site of the initial shooting.</p> <p>Bloomberg said: \"We all use the word 'hero' \u2013 he did what he should have done.\" The mayor added: \"He saw something, he said something\" \u2013 the phrase has become the backbone of efforts to get New York residents to be vigilant ever since the September 11 attacks. The actions of both the worker and police officers may have prevented further injuries, Bloomberg and Kelly said.</p> <p>The incident puts gun crime in America back in the spotlight. As with other high-profile summer shootings in the US \u2013 at a movie theatre in Colorado on 20 July and at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin earlier this month \u2013 it is thought unlikely that Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will address the issue in an election year.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Samsung-ordered-to-pay-Apple-1-05B-in-patent-case-3813619.php\">A home-town jury has given Apple the world</a>, or at least the United States, in its campaign to control the smart phone and tablet markets.</p> <p>Samsung, which decisively lost the highest-profile case to date in Apple's sue-everywhere strategy against the Android operating system, will surely appeal the verdict handed down the San Jose, California, federal court on Friday afternoon. And even if <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/samsung-apple-reactions/\">Samsung ultimately has to pay the $1bn judgement</a>, the company can afford it.</p> <p>But we're likely to see a ban on many mobile devices from Samsung and other manufacturers in the wake of this case, as an emboldened Apple tries to create an unprecedented monopoly. If so, the ultimate loser will be competition in the technology marketplace, with even more power accruing to a company that already has too much.</p> <p>The jury's quick decision \u2013 just two days of deliberations in an immensely complex case, with more than 100 pages of instructions from the judge \u2013 surely means the panel members had made up their minds in the courtroom and <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/23/3260463/apple-samsung-jury-verdict-form-nightmare/in/2971889\">spent most of their time in the jury room filling out a 20-page form</a> of checkboxes and granular detail. And on almost every point that mattered, they gave Apple what it wanted. The jury tossed out virtually all of Samsung's counter-claims against Apple for infringement on its own patents, and awarded no damages to Samsung.</p> <p>Crucially, the jury found none of Apple's patents invalid, despite substantial evidence that others anticipated many of the innovations that Apple put together when it released its first iPhone. This is a shame, because Apple's abuse of our out-of-control patent system has given Apple its chief ammunition in its global campaign to destroy Google's Android operating system, which Samsung (and many others) adopted for its smart phones.</p> <p>The California jury's decision came a day after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/24/apple-samsung-fined-patent-breaches\">three Korean judges handed down a mixed decision in a similar case</a>, saying both companies had violated some patents and ordering several products \u2013 mostly older ones that barely figure in today's market \u2013 off store shelves.</p> <p>Now, I'm not a fan of Samsung. Like so many others in the technology world, it has has behaved in ethically questionable ways. And it quite plainly did mimic much of the functionality of the iPhone \u2013 though it was Apple's longtime CEO, Steve Jobs, who famously quoted Picasso's adage that good artists copy and great artists steal.</p> <p>But in recent years, I have become even less a fan of Apple. It is now the uber-bully of the technology industry, and is using its surging authority \u2013 and vast amounts of cash \u2013 in ways that are designed to lock down our future computing and communications in the newest frontier of smart phones and tablets.</p> <p>In the end, Apple will settle for nothing less than outright capitulation by Samsung \u2013 and, by extension, other Android device makers \u2013 in what Jobs called a \"thermonuclear war\", which he planned, before his death, to wage on Android. If Apple is successful, either all Android manufacturers will pay Apple a license fee, or Apple will simply make it too expensive, via lawsuits, for other phone makers to compete. And if that happens, Apple's financial dominance in smart phones (Android leads in overall numbers of units sold) and overwhelming dominance in the tablet market could be insurmountable. Users of technology should worry about that scenario, for many reasons.</p> <p>Even more than Microsoft during that company's most ruthless days in the 1990s, Apple wants control over how we use technology. It locks down the iOS, requiring that apps be offered or sold only though its own portal, and limits competition when a developer is doing anything that might have an impact on its own business. And as Apple expands into living rooms \u2013 a TV is widely believed to be on the horizon \u2013 and beyond, we have to ask: do we want a single company with such influence?</p> <p>It's only fair to note that Apple fans are ecstatic at the prospect. They are eager to live in the embrace of their favorite company, and believe they get a safer and smoother experience by doing so. But those of us who believe we should be able to use what we buy the way we want to use it are less enthralled. We don't want Apple, or any other company, dictating \u2013 in fundamental ways \u2013 how we compute and communicate. Yet, that is precisely where we may be heading.</p> <p>And what of the patent process that has given Apple such leverage?</p> <p>Richard Posner, a well-respected federal judge in another Apple-versus-Android case (this one, which he threw out of court, involved Google's Motorola unit), <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/why-there-are-too-many-patents-in-america/259725/#.T_7jUH2JTJg.facebook\">has famously called</a> said there are \"serious problems\" with the current patent system, warranting an overhaul. We're stuck with what we have for the moment, however.</p> <p>And if Apple can abuse that off-the-rails system to thwart innovation and the iterative process that sees all tech companies build on the successes of the past, the most valuable company in the world will have more power than what it has richly earned through smart business practices.</p> <p>The cases in Seoul, San Jose and around the world are about everyone's future. For people who believe in competition in technology, and freedom in how we use it, Friday's events were bleak, indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Apple has been awarded more than $1bn (\u00a3632m) in damages after its rival smartphone and tablet manufacturer Samsung was found to have copied critical features of its iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>The US jury stunned observers by returning a decision after just two and a half days' deliberation following four weeks of legal argument.</p> <p>The jurors rejected every single one of the South Korean company's patent claims, and backed Apple's claim that Samsung had breached US antitrust laws by trying to keep its wireless patents as a monopoly.</p> <p>The decision means that Apple has gained a major weapon in its fight against Samsung, which is the biggest maker of smartphones and mobile phones in the world, and the biggest of the Android handset makers.</p> <p>The verdict will also be a key platform in Apple's ongoing court battles with other Android smartphone companies, including HTC and Motorola.</p> <p>Samsung and Apple have been at war through the courts since April 2011, when Apple filed a suit in the US alleging that a number of Samsung smartphones and tablets used some of its patented technologies \u2013 such as the \"rubber band\" effect when scrolling a long list of items \u2013 and mimicked its \"trade dress\", the general cosmetic appearance of its iPhone and iPad, in a way that could confuse potential customers.</p> <p>On Friday Samsung issued a statement saying: \"Today's verdict should not be viewed as a win for Apple, but as a loss for the American consumer. It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices. It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies.</p> <p>\"Consumers have the right to choices, and they know what they are buying when they purchase Samsung products. This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, some of which have already rejected many of Apple's claims. Samsung will continue to innovate and offer choices for the consumer.\"</p> <p>Apple's founder, Steve Jobs, kicked off the battle, telling his biographer Walter Isaacson that he would go \"thermonuclear\" in his battle against Android <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/21/steve-jobs-destroy-android\" title=\"'Steve Jobs swore to destroy Android'\">because he felt that it had copied elements of the iPhone's behaviour</a>. That started with HTC's implementation in 2010 of Android.</p> <p>\"I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40bn in the bank, to right this wrong,\" Jobs told Isaacson. \"I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.\"</p> <p>An attempted peace pact between Jobs and Eric Schmidt, then Google's chief executive, came to nothing. But Apple's war against Google has been indirect \u2014 targeting the handset makers that use Android rather than the search giant which writes the software itself.</p> <p>Evidence of Jobs's antipathy to Android was excluded from the evidence heard in court.</p> <p>Samsung, in this case, responded that Apple had used its patented technology for 3G wireless connectivity without permission, and that it used some of its patented methods, such as sending photos from a camera-equipped phone. Those claims were rejected by the jury.</p> <p>Samsung had also insisted that Apple's technology patents were invalid because of previous inventions by rival firms, which it demonstrated in the court. It said that the \"trade dress\" claims were nonsensical, and that customers were not confused.</p> <p>An area of relief for Samsung was that the jury decided its Galaxy tablets did not look so much like the iPad as to breach \"trade dress\". But they hit it with a billion-dollar damages decision for infringing Apple's \"utility\" patents on its behaviour.</p> <p>Samsung is expected to appeal to a higher court. But the victory for Apple is a publicity coup as the battle for control of the smartphone and tablet market intensifies ahead of the Christmas period \u2014 during which Apple is expected to have a new iPhone on release, and possibly a new, smaller version of the iPad.</p> <p>Apple and Samsung are suing each other in more than 30 cases around the world in Europe, Australia and the US. Apple, based in Cupertino \u2014 just 10 miles from the San Jose court where lawyers for the two sides made their case \u2014 is fighting multiple cases against rival smartphone makers which use Google's Android software, including Samsung, HTC and Motorola \u2014 the latter now owned by Google.</p> <p>The decision is a critical blow in the smartphone wars now going on around the world between Apple and Samsung, and by proxy between Apple and other makers of smartphones using Google's Android software. Samsung is the biggest mobile, smartphone and Android mobile company \u2014 meaning that this decision will resound throughout the industry.</p> <p>Reaching a decision had looked like a labyrinthine process. Judge Lucy Koh's instructions on how to decide ran to 109 pages and took over two hours to read out after the two companies had spent four weeks arguing in court.</p> <p>The jury then had to negotiate a verdict paper consisting of 20 pages with 33 questions which offered, in total, about 700 options \u2013 although it all boiled down to four: were Apple's claimed patents infringed and if so how much was it owed? And: were Samsung's claimed patents infringed, and if so how much was it owed?</p> <p>Yet they reached their verdict after barely two days' deliberation, surprising legal experts who had thought that the decision could take weeks. The jury for the high-profile trial in which Oracle sued Google alleging that the Android mobile operating system infringed its patents. The jury then took two weeks to reach a verdict that largely exonerated Google.</p> <p>Apple brought a high-profile array of executives to testify including Phil Schiller, its longtime head of marketing, and Scott Forstall, who heads its iPhone and iPad software division. Apple also showed prototypes of the iPhone and iPad dating back to 2003, as well as an internal Samsung document comparing the iPhone's behaviour with that of Samsung's smartphone, which described the difference as \"Heaven and Earth\" and noted hundreds of items of difference where Samsung needed to improve.</p> <p>The jury of seven men and two women, all from California, included four who have worked for technology companies including chipmaker Intel and phone business AT&amp;T, and two engineers. <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57499944-37/how-qualified-is-the-apple-samsung-jury-we-found-out/\" title=\"How qualified is the Apple-Samsung jury? We found out\">One member owns multiple Apple and Samsung products, according to CNet</a>. Five are over 50; three were born outside the US \u2013 one in India and two in the Philippines.</p> <p>The result came just hours after a South Korean court had ruled against both Apple and Samsung, deciding that they had each infringed each others' patents. Both were fined and told to take some of their products off the shelves in that country.</p>"
