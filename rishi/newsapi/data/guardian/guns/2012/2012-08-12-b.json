  "<p>Even as Emeli Sand\u00e9 kicked off the closing ceremony, rumours circulated about what the show would entail. Some of them seemed redolent of the spirit of wild optimism that the Olympics seem to have engendered in the UK.</p> <p>Had the organisers convinced Kate Bush to perform live, 33 years after her last solo gigs? Was the heavily-pregnant Adele really going to appear, a performance that would have carried with it the possibility of the Olympics being concluded with the sight of a woman giving birth live onstage? And would Ed Sheeran be performing with a reformed Pink Floyd? He said yes, the former members of Pink Floyd said not and the former members of Pink Floyd turned out to be right: as with all the other rumours, it turned out to be false.</p> <p>Perhaps his backing band \u2013 which in fairness contained the drummer from Pink Floyd \u2013 just told him they were Pink Floyd and, buoyed by the positive atmosphere of the past fortnight, he bought it.</p> <p>Other rumours suggested that things were getting back to normal, and that a certain cynicism was once more creeping back into the British mindset. Would the Spice Girls sing live? \"I'm dreading the cacophony of moaning if they mime,\" offered one Spice supporter on Twitter, thus raising the fearful thought of the cacophony if they didn't mime.</p> <p>As it turned out, miming or not, they arrived hot on the heels of Jessie J, performing Price Tag from the back of a moving car you rather wished would keep going straight out of the stadium, and were thus greeted with an almost hysterical gratitude.</p> <p>Occasionally, the music at the Opening Ceremony was noticeably more recherche than you might have expected: before their track Olympian came blaring out of the speakers, you would have got fairly long odds on an appearance by leftfield electronic duo Fuck Buttons, no matter how appositely their material was titled. But, with the greatest of respect to the musicians involved, at the opening ceremony the soundtrack played a supporting role to the spectacle. In the closing ceremony it was significantly foregrounded, which meant nothing similar was ever likely to happen, lest it bring about a pronounced case of the nonplussed WTFs? among the global viewing audience. They stuck with big acts doing their biggest hits, or indeed other people's: you could argue that amounted to playing it safe, but equally, if you've got to have Liam Gallagher, you might as well have him singing Wonderwall.</p> <p>And who doesn't want to see the Pet Shop Boys performing West End Girls, particularly when they do it wearing gigantic conical hats while circling the stadium in the back of two rickshaws covered in fluorescent orange origami? Only George Michael favoured the watching world with a new song, thus answering at a stroke the question of what it would take to dampen the spirits lifted by the preceding fortnight's events.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Elbow performed Open Arms \u2013 there's something sweetly improbable about the world's athletes flooding into the stadium to the strains of a song about a community centre in Bury \u2013 as well adhering to the strictly-enforced law that demands no televised sporting event can be allowed to conclude without the playing of One Day Like This. It tells you something about the loveliness of the song itself that it still retains an ability to tug at the heartstrings despite its ubiquity.</p> <p>Stuck with the famously thankless task of trying to please all the people all the time, the closing ceremony certainly wasn't an event without some fairly substantial musical longeurs. There were moments when you began to wonder if the Olympics were the only thing we had to hand over to Rio: could the Brazilians not be coerced into taking Russell Brand off our hands while they were about it?</p> <p>At other times, you started to think wistfully about some of the wilder rumours that had circulated, and wishing they'd come to pass, however improbable they seemed. Not least the one involving Queen performing with Freddie Mercury in hologram form. As it turned out, they performed with Jessie J, which couldn't help but seem a bit anti-climactic if you'd expected the spectre of rock's greatest showman flickering in 3D.</p> <p>The Who closed proceedings, but the sense that the night was lacking a genuinely gasp-inducing moment hung around. Then again, you could argue that there's been enough of them over the last couple of weeks to last anyone a lifetime. The closing ceremony didn't quite live up to what had preceded it. Perhaps nothing could.</p>",
  "<p>By early Sunday, the excitement levels among the closing ceremonies cast had gone nuclear. Team GB had surpassed all expectations, everyone was on a sporting high, the sun was shining and London 2012 was the best Olympics ever. Now we had to close the Games. An audience of half a billion? Bring it on.</p> <p>We only met in May, but have since had an extraordinary shared experience \u2013 being transformed from a rag-tag bunch of Londoners to a well-drilled dance troupe. There were times when the choreography had all seemed too difficult. Not any more. We were dying to get on with it. \"Only two more sleeps \u2026\"</p> <p>I was perfectly placed to volunteer \u2013 I live just down the road from the Olympic stadium and I'm on a sabbatical, so attending rehearsals wasn't a problem. The auditions were at the end of last year: two afternoons of copying professional dancers, while cameramen filmed my every move. I was lucky enough to be offered a part in January. We started rehearsals in May.</p> <p>At the first session, at the pre-Games command centre at east London's 3 Mills Studios, we were sat down before a row of TV screens while the artistic director, Kim Gavin (a Royal Ballet School alumnus, who produced Take That's latest stadium tours and the Concert for Diana), walked us through his plan for the closing ceremony. Everyone sat in open-mouthed amazement. We'd had no idea how spectacular it was going to be.</p> <p>Then we were all given parts. \"Policeman\" and \"military man\" sounded like they'd have cool costumes (they would). Wasn't sure about \"neck brace\". Not me. Phew. They finally called my number. I was to be one of six \"pub lads\".</p> <p>I was in a pod of 25 \u2013 on the pink truck in the street party that opens the ceremony. We started rehearsing in a group of 100 then, over the following three months, the groups got relentlessly bigger as the various elements of the show were bolted together.</p> <p>During the opening four songs (Madness, Blur, the Pet Shop Boys and One Direction), we were tasked with an intricate set of dance moves, which were initially daunting. Nobody wanted to look like a prat in front of hundreds of millions of people. However, the dance \"captains\" took us through it one step at a time. Then it was repetition, repetition, repetition \u2026</p> <p>All the cast were a credit to their home countries, which on the pink truck included China, Japan, Hungary and the US. Rehearsals were a huge commitment and there were many moments of tedium, but few grumbles.</p> <p>Only one person on our truck didn't embrace the Olympic spirit, alternately complaining and missing rehearsals. The last time he attended, he was moaning about getting to Dagenham at 9am. He then bragged that he would move to America and \"make it\" in the movies, even though he couldn't '\"make it\" to Dagenham on Sunday morning. Good luck, mate. We didn't see him after that.</p> <p>The importance of secrecy was drummed in early. Personally, I didn't breathe a word, despite constant requests for clues. It would have been easy to break the embargo of silence for the cheap thrill of looking cool, but who wants to be the weakest link? Enter stage right: the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>Their expos\u00e9 in July left the creative team spitting blood and momentarily demoralised.</p> <p>By the time the whole show was coming together during the final dress rehearsals, the experience was bordering on the surreal. There's a point when we pub lads (wearing newspaper overcoats) emerge from a giant mock-up of London's landmarks and jump into a taxi on a colossal wooden ramp, while similarly newspaper-covered commuters prance, skateboard and method-act around us. The only place equally weird stuff happens is in dreams.</p> <p>After the opening, we knew our ceremony would be less conceptual and more in-your-face \u2013 a glittering assortment of A-list talent and a symphony of British music. By this weekend, after two weeks of the Olympics swirling around us and three months of practice, we cast members were ready to pop.</p> <p>Check this, world. We are London. This is how we party. If you're reading this on Monday morning, I'll either still be dancing in Stratford somewhere or passed out under a Union flag. I hope you enjoyed the show. I'm know I will have.</p> <p><em>Peter Baker is a volunteer cast member for the London 2012 Olympic closing ceremony and the author of </em><a href=\"http://thejollypilgrim.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The Jolly Pilgrim</em></a><em>, by SRA books.</em></p>",
  "<h2>Archery by Eddie Butler</h2> <p>After the women's individual competition at Lord's, the silver medallist, A\u00edda Rom\u00e1n, and bronze medallist, Mariana Avitia, took a call from the president of Mexico, who wished to congratulate them on becoming their country's first ever medal winners in archery. The two women went to the press conference and delightedly took their place on either side of Ki Bo-bae of South Korea, the gold medal winner. Ki promptly burst into tears and apologised to her country for winning \u2013 in a sudden-death one\u2011arrow shoot-off \u2013 with a score of 8. \"Koreans do not shoot 8s,\" said the champion.</p> <p>It was a slightly unusual way to celebrate Korea's domination of the sport, especially since Ki is generally seen as the more happily demonstrative face of archery in a part of Asia where it is taken very seriously. Oh Jin-hyek, Ki's boyfriend and known as \"Soft Drink Pig\" for his taste for fizzy refreshments, won the men's individual competition, and the women's team took their seventh gold medal in seven Games.</p> <p>Italy, thanks to a 10 with a last arrow \u2013 no other score would have sufficed \u2013 from the ever so slightly paunchy Michele Frangilli, took the men's team event. Italy celebrated with Mexican delight. Britain's archers took their failure to go further than Larry Godfrey's place in the last 16 with a solemnity worthy of the Koreans.</p> <h2>Athletics by Anna Kessel</h2> <p>Athletics is always labelled the blue riband event of an Olympic Games, and in the case of London 2012 the billing was entirely justified. Although rowing and cycling sent a wave of excitement across the nation during the first week, it was the first Saturday of the athletics that set the Games alight. An unprecedented three British gold medals in 45 minutes, from Jessica Ennis in the heptathlon, Greg Rutherford in the long jump and Mo Farah in the 10,000m, provided a thrilling opener to the track and field events as the British public whooped and swooned. On that evening it seemed impossible to imagine that such noise could be repeated, let alone bettered in the following days.</p> <p>But that kind of thinking did not factor in the Usain Bolt effect. When he entered the picture along with an impressive team of Jamaica sprinters, the anticipation in the Olympic Stadium went stratospheric. Bolt's team-mate Yohan Blake, the 100m and 200m Olympic silver medallist, described it best when he talked about the Jamaica sprint relay team dropping in from outer space \u2013 not quite human, direct from Mars. Bolt joked that Blake was off his head but the 22\u2011year\u2011old did not have it far wrong.</p> <p>When Bolt, despite question marks over his fitness, tore apart the competition to defend both of his sprint titles and earn himself legendary status, the watching public were overawed. Bolt became the centre of the party, and everyone wanted a piece of him. Whether he was posturing on the track, or posing with three female Swedish handball players in his bedroom, Bolt was front\u2011page news. Helping his team to a world record in the 4x100m relay was no more than icing on the cake as the quartet clocked 36.84sec, smashing their old mark by 0.2sec and leaving the USA trailing on the home straight, as Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Blake and Bolt brought home the baton for the fourth athletics world record of the Games.</p> <p>Perhaps most pleasing of all for the sport was the emergence of new stars. David Rudisha was the standout candidate for global recognition as the 800m runner pulled off arguably the athletics performance of London 2012. Rudisha, a shy 23-year-old from the Maasai tribe in Kenya, broke his own world record in a time of 1min 40.91sec. But it was the manner in which he did so that caught the imagination. Sprinting from the outset he indicated that he was not content to simply win his first Olympic gold medal but that he wanted to do it in style. Caught up in the excitement spectators leapt to their feet, urging him on as he kicked once, and then twice, the field chasing him, dragged to their own personal bests and national records.</p> <p>Just when it had seemed as though nothing could top these moments, as though nothing could ever make the crowd cheer louder, Farah came back to the Olympic Stadium to win his second title in the 5,000m. As he sprinted for the line, the roars that accompanied his long elegant strides were deafening. Dropping to the track to perform a drill of sit-ups, the 29-year-old clowned around Bolt-style, and the crowd were enthralled. The entire stadium stayed on to watch Farah receive his gold medal, chanting: \"We want Mo!\" while they waited. Their patience was rewarded as not only Farah but his long-time friend Bolt returned to the arena to stand on the podium together, an iconic image that will last long in the memory.</p> <h2>Badminton by Peter Walker</h2> <p>One of the more low-key Olympic sports received some unwelcome global exposure following farcical scenes in which four mixed doubles pairings \u2013 the Chinese top seeds, plus two South Korean duos and one from Indonesia \u2013 very obviously tried to lose their last matches in the opening group stage to ensure kinder knockout ties. Crowds at the Wembley Arena venue booed and jeered as some of the world's top players repeatedly hit serves into the net or wildly out.</p> <p>All were disqualified the next day, as it emerged the sport's governing body had been warned repeatedly by players and coaches that the new group stage could lead to such scenes. The Badminton World Federation apologised, but insisted the group stage system still had its merits.</p> <p>One of the Chinese players thrown out, 26-year-old Yu Yang, took to the Chinese social media site Weibo to announce her retirement, saying the organisers had \"heartlessly shattered our dreams\".</p> <p>This drama done, it was very much business as usual as China still won all five gold medals \u2013 the Chinese second seeds took the mixed title \u2013 as well as two silvers and a bronze. The other medals went mainly to traditional strongholds such as Denmark, Japan and India.</p> <h2>Basketball by Owen Gibson</h2> <p>It still seems a lot of money to spend on a venue that is going to be taken down immediately afterwards, but the pillow-like basketball arena on the Olympic Park created one of the best atmospheres of the Games. Inevitably, the focus was on the USA throughout but the fervour with which rowdy Spanish and Lithuanian fans, in particular, followed their teams meant the temporary venue rocked even in the early stages of competition. A particularly bad-tempered quarter-final between France and Spain was criticised for betraying the values of the Olympic movements. But there will be inevitable questions about the competitiveness of some of the games in the early group stages, as demonstrated by the fact that the USA topped group A with a points difference of +191 while Nigeria finished fifth with a points difference of -118. Great Britain did not embarrass themselves, but did not live up to ambitious pre-Games hopes that they might qualify.</p> <p>Inspired by Luol Deng they did, however, overcome China in their final group game by 90 points to 58. Once the competition got serious in the quarter-final stage, the action moved to the North Greenwich Arena and the USA moved inexorably towards a final against Spain. In the women's competition, USA were also dominant, beating France 86-50 in the final.</p> <h2>Beach volleyball by Owen Gibson</h2> <p>Before the Games, the beach volleyball tournament became a symbol of what London hoped to achieve. A tight arena crammed into an iconic location on Horse Guards Parade, played on the 5,000 tonnes of sand brought in for the occasion and presented with as much razzmatazz as organisers could muster, it was one of the feelgood destinations of the Games. Whether the dancers, the Benny Hill theme and the Kiss Cam added up to an experience that was more entertainment than sport didn't seem to detain the 16,000 packed into the venue every day, and it became a magnet for celebrities and royals. But on the court the action was intense and frantic. The German pair of Jonas Reckermann and Julius Brink won the men's competition but the US continued their longstanding dominance of the women's tournament. Following an all-American final, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings won their third gold medal at consecutive Games. British women's pair Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin failed to make the last 16 after being defeated by an Austrian couple in a \"lucky loser\" play-off. But both paid tribute to an atmosphere that they said would remain with them for ever. \"Every time I stepped on court, it's given me goose pimples,\" said Dampney. The future of the sport in Britain is uncertain, but the 5,000 tonnes of sand will be used to create 30 new courts within the M25. With the sport heading for the more traditional setting of Copacabana beach for the next Games in Rio, it seems safe to assume it will again be one of the more high profile draws.</p> <h2>Boxing by Kevin Mitchell</h2> <p>To finish ahead of Cuba, Russia and the old \"East\" in Olympic boxing \u2013 not to mention the USA men going home potless \u2013 describes a quite wonderful London Games for this dedicated and talented Great Britain squad.</p> <p>Three golds, one silver and a bronze: to outstrip the deeds of the 1956 team, whose golden heroes, Terry Spinks and Dick McTaggart, were for years held aloft in boxing like the 1966 World Cup team; to do better than the Beijing battlers, who came home with a gold and two bronze \u2026 and to do it at home, these are considerable achievements.</p> <p>Whether the host broadcaster, the arbiter of our national conscience for the past fortnight, elevates boxing alongside the lesser deeds of the divers and horsey folk, the wonderful cyclists and the rowers, well, that is doubtful given the marginalisation of the sport in the BBC's main bulletins. Boxing still frightens the middle classes.</p> <p>Yet nothing can dilute the experience for Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell, Nicola Adams, Freddie Evans and Anthony Ogogo \u2013 as well as the five who did not get a medal. Campbell, the bantamweight king, described it best. \"We live together, we eat together, we travel the world together.\"</p> <p>The Americans, meanwhile, who have won more Olympic boxing gold than even the Cubans, do very little together and had only the gold of Claressa Shields to console them after their worst performance.</p> <p>The memory that will resonate will be aural as much as visual: that wall of sound that turned the ExCeL into a half\u2011lit bearpit of excitement over the past fortnight.</p> <p>Nearly every day and night session was sold out, unheard of in modern times. But they did not just come to see the Cubans, or even the British boxers, but the exceptional competitors from Europe and beyond and, most noisily, the Irish. The Daily Telegraph even thought Katie Taylor was British; as did the Russian sports minister. Now they know.</p> <p>It was the women who surprised us all. This was their inaugural Olympic tournament and their excellence and good humour were a revelation to many who knew little about their sport. Natasha Jonas and Adams smiled from start to finish, through disappointment and triumph, and poor Savannah Marshall was dumbstruck in defeat, as was the team captain, Tom Stalker, who could find no words to express his disgust at losing a fight he was sure he had won.</p> <p>That was one of many debated decisions \u2013 although Joshua and Ogogo will admit they also benefited from close calls. The sport is dogged by incompetence and pig-headedness. Change is coming, though. There is talk of introducing 10-9 rounds, as in the pros, and five three-minute rounds are virtually nailed on for the next Olympics. Headguards have already been done away with in the semi-pro World Series of Boxing and that will be a feature of Rio in 2016 too, as the amateur game converges with the professional. Then we will have blood to go with the glory, the money \u2013 and the noise.</p> <h2>Canoeing by Robert Kitson</h2> <p>From the white water of Lee Valley to the calmer waters of Eton Dorney, this was another sport that took full advantage of its rare moment in the sun. It helped that Britain scored an unprecedented medal one-two in the two-man slalom, with Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott enjoying the run of their lives to pip compatriots David Florence and Richard Hounslow to the gold.</p> <p>There was success, too, in the sprint kayak for the sensationally quick Ed \"The Cleaver\" McKeever, who added Olympic gold to the world and European titles he won in 2010. GB canoeing's national performance coach Brendan Purcell reckons McKeever could be kayaking's equivalent of Sir Chris Hoy, with the potential to compete strongly at the next two Olympics.</p> <p>Given Tim Brabants's gold in Beijing in 2008 was the first by any British canoeist in Olympic history, it has been some transformation.</p> <p>Liam Heath and Jon Schofield also collected bronze in the two-man kayak to give the normally dominant paddlers of eastern Europe something else to chew on. With Australia winning a surprise gold in the K4 category, only their third medal in the sport's 74-year history at the Games, there has been a small but significant shift in the world order. Overall, though, the leading nation honours were predictably shared by Hungary and Germany, who collected three golds and six medals apiece, followed by Ukraine and Russia. There is no question the GB team enjoyed an uplift from home advantage but, as with the rowers, it was by no means the sole explanation for their success.The introduction of 200m sprint racing seemed popular with the public, although buying tickets for 36 seconds of action may not be everyone's idea of a wise investment.</p> <h2>Cycling by William Fotheringham</h2> <p>Nine out of 10. That number dominates any reckoning of cycling at the London Games, simply because Great Britain's hit rate from the track was so spectacular, the contest over the six days so completely one-sided, the flood of world records so overwhelming. Since Beijing, followers of Dave Brailsford's troupe have assumed that 2008 could never be topped. How could it? Well, win seven out of 10 golds, add in a silver and bronze and a disqualification, then factor in demented, deafening, ecstatic full houses and inch-perfect organisation, and if sporting nirvana exists, what we saw in the velodrome from August 2-7 was not far from it.</p> <p>If Brailsford and his coaches, and Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Ed Clancy and the others deserve praise, it's for holding their nerve. In Hoy and Pendleton's case, in one final push in the face of adversity; in Clancy's, in his and his team pursuiters' capacity to take on the dominant Australians; in the sprint coaches', for not giving up when the team sprint conundrum seemed impossible. Brailsford and Sutton didn't shy at the hardest decision of all, to drop Hoy from the sprint, and it paid off; they also gambled on the nascent talent of Laura Trott and Philip Hindes at the vital moment.</p> <p>Despite disappointing world championships from 2009 to 2011, the mantra remained constant: Olympic events are all that matter. It wore thin, but was ultimately vindicated. In addition, Brailsford had cover. The goalposts were moved, but not far; the loss of two timed events \u2013 men's and women's pursuits \u2013 from Beijing was compensated for by the omnium, in which \u2013 guess what? \u2013 timed events account for half the points. The two other disciplines dropped from Beijing, the points and madison, were less suited to the British methodology, and produced a single bronze between them in 2008.</p> <p>The opposition came lulled by the slow British buildup and went away humiliated. But rather than allegations of magic wheels, or indulging in a bitter-Tweet symphony \u2014 to cite only the French \u2014 the opposition should take a long hard look at themselves. The Dane Lasse Hansen's victory in the omnium and Anna Meares's gold in the women's sprint were examples of occasions when fine competitors simply knew no fear; the German win in the team sprint a rare instance of Brailsford's boffins failing to dot every 'i'.</p> <p>British success aside, what to retain of things two-wheeled at London 2012? On the plus side, unprecedented and immense support for the men's and women's road events, of such quality that it's hard to imagine that this is only the fifth Games in which the best \u2013 professional \u2013 road cyclists have been eligible to compete. If there was ever an argument for investment in women's cycling, this was it. On the minus side, BMX increasingly looks like a demolition derby unworthy of the Games and Team GB's domination in the velodrome should not make us ignore the flaws in the rejigged track programme, which is now too thin and too dependent on timed events, underlined in London by spreading five days of competition into six.</p> <h2>Diving by Esther Addley</h2> <p>The despair on the face of the world champion, Qiu Bo, said it all. Beaten into second place by a dazzling performance by the American David Boudia in the 10m platform final, the Chinese diver buried his face in the tiles of the shower, inconsolable. Such is the exceptional standard of Chinese diving, and so great are the expectations on the country's divers, that even against the best of the rest of the world, performing at their very highest, silver is not good enough.</p> <p>Some members of China's diving delegation were in tears, too \u2013 a remarkable sight given that the country's tally in London 2012's eight diving contests ended at six golds, three silvers and a bronze. At Beijing four years ago the country had come even closer to a gold clean sweep, denied only after a brilliant final dive by the Australian Matthew Mitcham won him the individual 10m contest. On the platform and the springboard, alone and in pairs, men and women, China remains utterly dominant in the sport. It left some very strong diving nations looking as if they were fighting over the leftovers. Mexico did well with two silvers, while Russia claimed the remaining gold in the men's individual 3m springboard. Boudia had already won a bronze for the US with Nicholas McCrory in the synchronised platform event.</p> <p>For Britain's performance director, Alexei Evangulov, the picture from London is reasonably positive. Tom Daley's bronze proved that he is much more than a pretty face, and meant the squad hit its pre-Games target of between one and three medals. Daley and synchro partner Pete Waterfield had missed the podium in the synchro event only by one place after a single mistake.</p> <p>There were fifth-place finishes in the women's synchro platform and men's synchro springboard, from a squad which, at 12, was the largest team of British divers to qualify for the Olympics since 1908. Most encouraging, perhaps, is the young talent who now have Olympic experience: aside from Daley, who is still just 18, Alicia Blagg is 15, Jack Laugher, 17, Chris Mears, 19. Roll on Rio.</p> <h2>Equestrian by Stephen Moss</h2> <p>Many pundits were critical of the decision to stage equestrianism at Greenwich Park and even after 10 days of fabulous, mostly sun-blessed action in which Britain exceeded expectations by winning three golds, a silver and a bronze there were still a few naysayers. \"Where's the legacy?\" they cried.</p> <p>In many ways they were right. The wonderful arena will now be dismantled; the cross-country course has already gone, with the obstacles distributed to other venues. Soon it will all be a memory and Greenwich's angry dog walkers will have back their park. But what a memory!</p> <p>Britain's double dressage gold will certainly have a legacy in terms of coverage, participants and sponsors. Soon we will all be able to distinguish piaffe from passage. Team GB's surprise team showjumping gold got plenty of headlines, too, though there was further disappointment for Nick Skelton in the individual competition. The format was bizarre: Skelton jumped four clear rounds in qualifying but none counted on the day of the final. So why have them? It was absurdly convoluted, a sign that the sport has forgotten how to communicate with the public.</p> <p>The eventing, with which the horsefest began, was dominated to a ludicrous degree by Zara Phillips, who at least had the good grace to be embarrassed. Zara-mania obscured the fact there was a genius riding \u2013 Michael Jung, right,who on his 30th birthday secured individual gold and became the first rider to hold the world, Olympic and European titles simultaneously.</p> <p>He also led Germany to team gold, with Britain taking silver. Tina Cook and the veteran Mary King, who like the 54-year-old Skelton vowed to be in Rio, performed heroically but the world No1, William Fox-Pitt, and Lionheart failed to roar.</p> <p>So Britain won three golds, Germany two and the 30-year-old Swiss rider Steve Guerdat took the individual showjumping gold when Skelton's Big Star had the Cutty Sark fence down when trying to force a jump-off.</p> <p>Skelton's blue eyes blazed defiance but he was desperately disappointed. Spare a thought, too, for the Dutch, who had victory in the team showjumping in their grasp before Gerco Schr\u00f6der had a fence down, and who felt robbed of gold in the individual dressage. They added colour, passion and good sportsmanship to a fantastic fortnight.</p> <p>The arena may soon be history but some grand spirits will forever inhabit Greenwich Park.</p> <h2>Fencing by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>One of the five core Olympic sports to feature in every modern Games, the event was headed by Italy, who collected three golds to the two of South Korea and China. With its darkened hall, competitors' futuristic white suits and a hood studded with LEDs that flash when hit, this is a kind of combat Star Wars for the sports fan.</p> <p>There was also fencing's 15 minutes of Olympic fame when South Korea's Shin A-lam staged a sit-down following her last-second loss in the women's epee. After 75 long minutes she left the piste but still protested, unsuccessfully, that Britta Heidemann semi-final win should be reversed as she had made two attempts to strike without the clock changing.</p> <p>GB interest seemed to be heading for the file marked anonymous until Richard Kruse, James Davis, Husayn Rosowsky and Laurence Halsted gave Italy a major scare in the quarter-finals.</p> <h2>Football by Daniel Taylor</h2> <p>A success overall, but only to a point. Football was always going to feel slightly peripheral, especially when the crowds were so sparse and some of the venues so far away. Add to that the roll\u2011your\u2011eyes predictability of Great Britain's men going out to South Korea on penalties on the night of Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford.</p> <p>But the past few weeks should have done the women's game a lot of good. The crowd for GB's defeat of Brazil at Wembley was 70,584, destroying the previous record. That was good but the outstanding memory came in the semi-final when Canada led three times, USA clawed it back three times and pinched it at the death, after 123 minutes, courtesy of Alex Morgan's header. Every tournament needs a classic match and this ticked every box.</p> <h2>Judo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>From the opening Saturday to the following Friday the sport proved a story machine. The prime mover here was Densign White, the British Judo chairman, who was premature with his scathing criticism of home disappointments. When White spoke, only Colin Oates of the eight judoka who had competed had managed a win. Cue Gemma Gibbons winning silver in the women's 78kg \u2013 GB's first judo medal in 12 years \u2013 plus Karina Bryant claiming bronze in the 78kg+, to make this Britain's best Olympic yield since 1992.</p> <p>White's awkward week hardly improved when Winston Gordon, who made the 90kg last-16, said of him: \"My grandmother told me there is a saying \u2013 when a fish rots, it rots from the head.\" Gibbons refused eye contact with White during her medal ceremony.</p> <p>This was all before the astonishing revelation that Mongolia's Tuvshinbayar Naidan had contested the 100kg final despite tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in the semi\u2011final.</p> <h2>Gymnastics by Emma John</h2> <p>Despite the unforgivable raft of empty seats, the North Greenwich Arena turned out to be one of the most intensely atmospheric venues of the Games and it delivered the performances to match.</p> <p>This Games will go down as the one when British gymnastics came good. Four medals \u2013 more than twice the sport's stated target \u2013 proved that Britain are, for the first time in history, a force to be reckoned with. Louis Smith's pommel horse silver was the best result and Beth Tweddle's longed-for bronze \u2013 the first individual medal for a British woman \u2013 the most significant but there was joy too in seeing the strength of the teams and the emergence of new talent like Max Whitlock.</p> <p>The artistic gymnastics combined wins for dead certs with some shocking upsets. And USA were involved in both: their much-hyped women's team destroyed the field in the team contest and took five medals in all, yet their two surest things \u2013 Jordyn Wieber in the all-around and McKayla Maroney in the vault \u2013 missed out on golds that supposedly had their names already inscribed. Japan's Kohei Uchimura, the only man to win three back-to-back world all-around championships, took his expected Olympic title only after proving himself mortal: Britain's Kristian Thomas beat him in qualifying.</p> <p>Trampolining, which also took place at the NGA, could not have asked for more to raise its profile than a champion with the unforgettable name of Dong Dong. The Chinese world champion had a fantastically acrobatic routine to match and, though there was disappointment for the home favourite Kat Driscoll \u2013the former world No1 did not qualify for the final \u2013 the feeling was of a sport that had found its perfect showcase.</p> <p>But while the rhythmic gymnastics at Wembley Arena dazzled with its costumed finery, its kitsch connotations of majorettes could not quite catch the British imagination in the same way. Russia's dominance did not allow for much drama. Evgenia Kanaeva became the first rhythmic Olympic champion to retain her title and Britain came last in both team and individual event, which is perhaps one reason why we still struggle to take it to our hearts.</p> <h2>Handball by Peter Walker</h2> <p>A sport with very little tradition in the UK became one of the spectator successes of the Games, the dedicated Copper Box arena packed every day with a mixture of continental diehards fans and curious locals. The latter had the novelty of seeing the first-ever British teams to play Olympic handball, although both men and women lost every single group game, most by significant margins. The narrowest loss was the women's six-point defeat to Angola. Once the minor nations had been swatted aside, handball bigwigs Norway, Montenegro, Sweden and France competed in the finals, with Norway (women) and France (men) triumphant.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>Hockey by Peter Walker</h2> <p>Not since the days of the British men's run to hockey gold in the 1988 Olympics has the sport proved so popular with a domestic audience. This was in part due to a measure of home success \u2013 the GB women won bronze; the men were fourth \u2013 but also due to some fantastically dramatic matches and clever staging. The 16,000-capacity Riverbank Stadium, though just a temporary scaffolding structure, was one of the more noisy and visceral Olympic venues with its steeply raked seating and innovative pink acrylic pitch, designed to make the ball easier to see.</p> <p>Both British teams did well to progress from strong groups into the semi-finals, pulling off some exceptional moments along the way, not least the men's unlikely late fightback from 3-0 down against Australia to secure a draw. More dramatic still was the Dutch women's semi-final win over New Zealand, which went to a shootout.</p> <p>When it came to the knockout stages the traditional hierarchies of hockey remained in place. The GB women lost to Argentina, who in turn took silver to the Netherlands. The Dutch men dispatched their British peers 9-2 in the semi but lost in the final to Germany.</p> <h2>Modern pentathlon by Stephen Moss</h2> <p>The modern pentathlon was created by Baron de Coubertin and first took its place in the Olympics of 1912. Its centenary passed with little ceremony and what looks a rather distinguished slot \u2013 the final weekend and, in the case of the women, the final medal to be awarded. But it is, in reality, a cul de sac. The athletes dislike having to wait so long and it gets overshadowed by the last day of the athletics and the closing ceremony.</p> <p>The sport has revamped itself \u2013 women were given their own event in 2000 and the competition now ends with what is seen as a more spectator-friendly combined shooting-and-running event. But stories persist that some movers and shakers want it removed from the Olympics, seeing it as anachronistic.</p> <p>It would be good if it stays. It is pleasingly eccentric \u2013 decamping from Stratford to Greenwich for the second half of what was quite a long day of competition \u2013 and enshrines many of De Coubertin's chivalrous virtues, except in the fencing where the competitors are not above disputing with the judges whether a hit has been made.</p> <p>The eastern Europeans remain the ones to beat, with David Svoboda of the Czech Republic winning the men's event and a posse of Hungarians and Russians close behind, and Laura Asadauskaite of Lithuania taking gold in the women's event.</p> <p>The silver-medal winners, Cao Zhongrong and Samantha Murray, show that the Chinese and Great Britain are on board but it would help the sport if it spread the gospel to the United States, traditionally weak in the event. The Olympics would be poorer without the modern pentathlon.</p> <h2>Rowing by Robert Kitson</h2> <p>Much was expected of British rowing on Dorney Lake and great things duly unfolded. The rest of the world could be forgiven for wondering what on earth their \u2013 and the GB cyclists' \u2013 secret was. The final tally of four golds, two silvers and three bronzes comfortably exceeded the pre-Games target of six and represented the most successful haul by a GB squad at any Olympic regatta in history.</p> <p>The \"Dorney roar\" was raucous from the outset, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning memorably securing the first home gold of the Games.</p> <p>Katherine Grainger, partnered by Anna Watkins, finally added an emotional gold to the three silvers she had previously earned and a third female duo, Sophie Hosking and Kat Copeland, leapt out of the shadows to win the lightweight women's double sculls. All three results reflected splendidly on the GB women's coaches.</p> <p>There could easily have been more lightweight success for the men's four and men's double sculls, both of whom had to settle for silver by the narrowest of margins. Instead it fell to the men's four of Andy Triggs Hodge, Pete Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory to retain their Olympic title and extend the rich legacy of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Nowadays Redgrave's primary role is to hoist shattered athletes back ashore, a role for which no one on the planet is better suited. Lottery funding and the relentless excellence of J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler, below, have clearly helped but Redgrave's dedication has set the benchmark by which everyone else measures themselves.</p> <p>It was not just a Brit fest. The German men's eight won a spectacularly hard-fought final and the Kiwi men's pair of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond were as unstoppable as the All Blacks in full cry.</p> <p>Perhaps most symbolic of all was South Africa's gold medal in the lightweight men's four. Their crew included Sizwe Ndlovu, rowing's first black gold medallist. The sport is still perceived in certain quarters as a haven for posh white men; here was the perfect riposte.</p> <p>It may be a while, even so, before there is a place on the podium for Hamadou Djibo Issaka of Niger, the Games's unlikeliest participant.</p> <p>Hailing from a country which incorporates a large chunk of the Sahara Desert and has no rowing boats, \"Issaka the Otter\" was a converted swimmer whose previous experience of pulling oars amounted to three months. He, and Great Britain's record-breakers, both plan to be back in 2016.</p> <h2>Sailing by Steven Morris</h2> <p>Sailing has long been seen as a sport practised by few, watched by even fewer. The Dorset branch of the London 2012 Games may have changed that forever.</p> <p>For a start, 15 countries shared the 30 medals. The powerhouses of sailing, Team GB and Australia, ended up with the most medals, nine between them. To the chagrin of the GB team, Australia got the better of them for the first time since 1992. Spain also squeezed ahead of GB with two golds medals to Ben Ainslie's one.</p> <p>But there were medals, too, for the likes of Poland and Argentina. China won their first gold medal in a boat rather than on a board and Cyprus secured their first medal in any Olympic event in the Laser dinghy class.</p> <p>Sailing's world governing body, ISAF, was pleased that nations not known for Olympic sailing were represented. The Cook Islands sent a competitor, as did Trinidad &amp; Tobago. ISAF hopes they will return and spread the word to other nations in the Pacific and Caribbean.</p> <p>The governing body is optimistic that by Rio 2016 more African and Asian countries will be at the Olympic regatta. Countries including Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia are close to being ready to take on the bigger nations.</p> <p>Another success of the regatta has been Weymouth's Nothe Fort spectator area. Some 4,500 people have sat on the grassy slopes every day to watch races taking place a few hundred metres off shore, the action explained via big screens and expert commentary.</p> <p>Most seem to have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Those without tickets have found spots on beaches, cliff-tops and Weymouth's stone pier. It is estimated that 70,000 people were there to witness Ainslie win his fourth&#xa0;gold.</p> <p>One reservation expressed by some sailors was the proximity of the Nothe course \u2013 one of four used \u2013 to the shore. Because it was so close, the wind could be unreliable. Some sailors complained that it made the medal races, which all took place on the Nothe course, too open to chance.</p> <p>The teams who have struggled will have lots to think about between now and Rio. Partly inspired by the Nothe, the Brazilians are planning to create a course close to the shore at the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria and build a stand for 10,000 people.</p> <p>But as well as being about elite sport, the Olympics must be about bringing in more people. Hundreds of children tried sailing and windsurfing on Weymouth beach during the Games. Sailing clubs are reporting an increase in inquiries from people keen to have a go. The legacy may be that, in time, sailing could come to be regarded as not just the plaything of the rich few and also an exciting spectator sport.</p> <h2>Shooting by Barney Ronay</h2> <p>The Royal Artillery Barracks staged an excellent Olympic shooting competition. There were gripes beforehand from British shooters excluded from the main Olympic Park in favour of suburban Woolwich but the venue itself was a triumph, a dimpled plastic spaceship set in appealing leafiness and praised by competitors for its scale and crowd-magnifying acoustics. It was a fine Olympic competition too, bringing the first gold medal of the Games, for the supernaturally unerring Yi Siling of China, who snatched first place in the women's 10m air rifle with the shooting equivalent of a sprint finish in the final round.</p> <p>Shooting also provided one of the early stories of the Games, the appearance of eight-month pregnant Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi, the first Olympian to compete in such an advanced state of incubation (she finished 34th). The medals were shared mainly between South Korea, USA, China and Italy but there were also medals here for Kuwait, Qatar and billion-strong Olympic minnows India, not to mention a gold for Team GB's shooting farmer Peter Wilson in the double-trap.</p> <p>Shooting guns at targets doesn't get much better than this. A barrack-bound Olympic success.</p> <h2>Swimming by Andy Bull</h2> <p>The grumpy frump on the fringe of the party, British Swimming had a poor Olympics. The official medal target was between five and seven but the performance director, Michael Scott, had repeatedly said that he wanted to match the tally from Beijing, where the team won six medals including two&#xa0;golds.</p> <p>They did not get close to either target, finishing with one silver, from Michael Jamieson, and two bronzes, both won by Becky Adlington. The sport will surely have its funding cut and Scott has admitted he will have to make the team \"leaner and meaner\" as a result. Absurdly, he was awarded a new four-year contract just before the Games.</p> <p>Six medals was not an unrealistic target. The squad included three world champions in Liam Tancock, Adlington and Keri-Anne Payne, two world silver medallists in Ellen Gandy and Hannah Miley, and nine swimmers ranked inside the world's top five in their events. This was the most talented squad British Swimming has had in a generation, which is why they got 23 swimmers into Olympics finals. The trouble was that their return from that was so meagre. As Scott said: \"Success is measured in podium places.\"</p> <p>Medals are not the only measure, of course. But it was even more disappointing that so few of the top British swimmers set personal bests, or even matched the times they had set at the Olympic trials, held in the same pool back in March. Collectively, the squad seemed to peak too soon. For Adlington, for example, there was no shame in being beaten by the brilliant 15-year-old Katie Ledecky in the 800m freestyle. What was puzzling, as she said herself, was that eight weeks beforehand, in Barcelona, she had swum quicker than she managed on the night. She suggested that the team were suffering with a touch of stage fright. Scott refused to accept that. He thinks that they did not have enough \"race toughness\" and that they had should have competed more in the runup. It is too late now. These swimmers missed out on the chance of a lifetime.</p> <p>One conspicuous exception was Jamieson, a man who has what Tom Wolfe called \"the right stuff\". He broke the British record three times: in the heats, semi-finals, and final of the 200m breaststroke. Hungary's Daniel Gyurta had to set a world record to beat Jamieson to gold. The Scot was one of the very few who seemed to be buoyed up by the occasion, rather than bowed down by the pressure of it.</p> <p>There were other good performances too, but not enough of them. Elizabeth Simmonds did well in the 200m backstroke, as did Robbie Renwick in the 200m freestyle. The obvious link between the three is that none of them was expected to deliver a medal.</p> <p>It would be wrong to blame the press and public for putting the stars under too much pressure, though there was every reason to have high expectations. The synchronised swimming team, on the other hand, were allowed the luxury of being content with coming sixth. In doing that, they met the target set by their coach.</p> <h2>Table-tennis by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Beneath a final medal table dominated by China \u2013 all four golds, plus two silvers \u2013 lay the offering of human stories that form the deep well of true Olympic spirit. Vanuatu's Anolyn Lulu may have lost her preliminary round game 4-0 to Ligia Silva of Brazil too fast for her sense of competitive pride, but the 33-year-old had begun the Games by carrying the flag of the South Pacific island nation into the Olympic Stadium. This added further lustre to her fame in her homeland where everyone already recognises her, and provided rich memories to warm her on her return to Vanuatu.</p> <h2>Taekwondo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Martin Stamper, Jade Jones, Sarah Stevenson and Lutalo Muhammad were GB's entrants and all offered compelling yarns. Stamper made the semi-finals of the 68kg division, while Jones won a stunning gold in the 57kg class, then said: \"There was a lot of pressure on taekwondo to do well, because we have got the potential. The whole team has come a long way in a short period of time. We are getting bigger and better. Hopefully now more people can get into taekwondo.\"</p> <p>The expectation Jones mentioned appeared to have mortally affected Muhammad, whose golden opportunity arrived inside the biggest poisoned chalice of recent memory. Chosen ahead of Aaron Cook, the world No1, in the 80kg division, Muhammad was required to win a medal to vindicate GB Taekwondo. After losing in the quarter\u2011finals, the Londoner was reprieved via a repechage and proved his courage by going on to claim bronze. Stevenson, the 67kg world champion, crashed out after losing her opening fight. But after losing both parents during the previous 18 months, perspective was a comfort.</p> <p>In the broader sense this was the Games where taekwondo entered the wider sporting consciousness.</p> <h2>Tennis by Kevin Mitchell</h2> <p>It wasn't just Andy Murray winning a gold medal that made the Olympic tennis special. It was witnessing the organic shift in mood at Wimbledon.</p> <p>There was a weirdness about the place that struck everyone who went there. For a start, the Army had moved in, and steel barriers across the roads gave the genteel suburb an air of Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, a bit of a jolt for Hyacinth and her neighbours. Yet there was no menace, just a sense of imposed order, with squaddies roaming through the packed avenues between the courts, some of them armed, many of them here for the first time, no doubt, and gawping at the splendour of the All England Club while supposedly also keeping an eye out for who-knows-what. It was as if we were all in an Alfred Hitchcock movie without realising it.</p> <p>In the seats, there was good humour and noise \u2013 plenty of it, more than is normally allowed, certainly on Centre Court. The Belarus flag made its way into the Royal Box during the mixed doubles final and, if the committee did not splutter at the sight, it surely jotted down a reminder that this might be taking hospitality too far.</p> <p>To give the crusty old burghers their due, Wimbledon embraced the Olympics. The arrivistes, by and large, ogled respectfully at this quaint old beast of an institution and everyone had a jolly good time.</p> <p>There was talk among the tennis hacks about the merits of three-set matches up to the final \u2013 not a bad idea, so it's doubtful it will be taken up \u2013 and there was celebration of a fine new Olympic champion in the men's singles, and the recoronation of another in the women's, Serena Williams.</p> <p>The tennis was good, the weather behaved itself, the food \u2013 apart from a passably good sausage on a roll from a van below the players' lounge \u2013 was predictably dire.</p> <p>We won't see its like again and Wimbledon will slip its blazer back on soon enough. But, all in all, it was worth it.</p> <h2>Triathlon by Sean Ingle</h2> <p>Triathlon has been the fastest growing sport in the UK for more than a decade but it must have gathered plenty more converts over four days during London 2012, especially after the performance of Alistair Brownlee. He followed a 1500m swim and 43km bike ride with a 10km run in 29.07min \u2013 only 97 seconds slower than Mo Farah's time to win gold in the men's 10,000m. It was Britain's first triathlon medal at the Olympics and it was soon followed by bronze for Alistair's brother Jonny, who survived a 15-second penalty for climbing on his bike a centimetre too early and a violent bout of post-race sickness to take his place on the podium. The women's race, meanwhile, was decided by photo-finish after one of the closest and greatest triathlons in history. Switzerland's Nicola Spirig got gold, with only the width of her vest separating her from Sweden's Lisa Norden, who took silver.</p> <p>Britain's Helen Jenkins defied an injured knee to finish fifth, falling back behind the leaders only in the last kilometre. Afterwards she said the crowds around Hyde Park, often 10 or 12 deep, had kept her going. Expect lots of men and women in ill-fitting lycra tri\u2011suits to try the sport for the first time in 2013 \u2013 and more Brownlee dominance in the years ahead.</p> <h2>Water polo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>A kind of soaking wet murder ball, water polo is a perpetual motion of attacks consisting of whizz-paced passes controlled instantly and bionic-wristed one-hand shots that move like cannonballs at opposing goalkeepers. That's the tame stuff. Beneath the surface is where it's really at: just about anything goes in a skulduggery-fest of which the GB captain, Fran Leighton, admitted: \"Its all about having the face of an angel above the water while all the fighting goes on underneath.\" GB women could take losing narrowly to Russia, 7-6, but going down 16-3 to the auld enemy Australia was as palatable as a belly full of chlorine.</p> <h2>Wrestling (Greco-Roman and freestyle) by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Kyrgyzstan's Aisuluu Tynybekova became the first woman wrestler to represent her country and defeat in her first match did not dilute the achievement of competing here. The 19-year-old 63kg freestyle entrant had overcome a lack of female competition in her homeland \u2013 she practises against men \u2013 and the \"stingy\" diet provided by her Olympic committee, to qualify for the Games. As a sport freestyle wrestling, which allows grabbing from below the waist, felt too similar to judo, while the Greco-Roman discipline \u2013 no below-waist action allowed \u2013 was the purer experience. Russia, Japan and Iran headed the gold medal count, with three each.</p> <h2>Volleyball by Sean Ingle</h2> <p>Seeds were planted at these Games, even if volleyball is unlikely to grow into a mainstream UK sport. Crowds of first-timers, eager to try something new, were entranced by the set and spike \u2013 as well as the outrageous athleticism on display. The atmosphere was usually excellent too, helped by the large pockets of away fans and the cheap tickets. And while Team GB's men were unable to win one of their five matches, the women \u2013 ranked 69th in the world and without lottery funding \u2013 did beat Algeria, 43 places above them. The challenge now will be to get the sport into the schools, and keep some level of elite-level funding.</p> <h2>Weightlifting by Simon Hattenstone</h2> <p>Forty-four Olympic and world records were broken over the course of the Games \u2013 along with a fair few hearts, and very nearly Matthias Steiner's neck after a 196kg barbell crashed down on the defending champion (he was extremely sore, but thankfully OK). Behdad Salimikordasiabi from Iran proved himself the strongest Olympian in the world, lifting a ludicrous total of 449kg to win the men's super-heavyweight. For the first time, and to some consternation, a lifter won from the B final. Was North Korea's Om Yun-cho deliberately underplaying his strength? And, if so, was this an acceptable form of gamesmanship? To be fair to the little lad, he did become only the fifth man in history to lift more than triple his bodyweight in the 56kg category.</p> <p>Zoe Smith acquitted herself admirably, scored a personal best and showed Britain might have a future in weightlifting. My personal highlight was seeing the Welsh refuse wagon driver Natasha Perdue make a total. She was knackered, nervous, injured and desperate to post a score for her father, Terry Perdue, who had weightlifted twice in the Olympics and died in 1998. When it came to the clean and jerk, she could barely walk let alone lift. She heaved the barbell up bit by bit, in such agony that her face was squeezed in half. After a wobble that lasted an eternity Perdue held it still above her head. She had managed it, and it was an incredibly moving moment.</p>",

  "<p>The Olympics has got us excited about less mainstream sports, such as weightlifting, according to the <a href=\"http://www.iwf.net/\" title=\"\">International Weightlifting Federation</a>. <a href=\"http://www.espnstar.com/olympics/weightlifting/news/detail/item836247/IWF-delighted-with-weightlifting-success/\" title=\"\">An IWF spokesman commented</a>: \"Weightlifting has recaptured British people's hearts after a very long time.\" But rather than just watch it, research says we should be taking up weightlifting ourselves. A new paper in the Archives of Internal Medicine by Harvard School of Public Health shows that pumping iron five times a week can <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by a third</a>.</p> <p>Diabetes is common: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/oct/25/uk-shocking-diabetes-obesity\" title=\"\">one in 20 people</a> now have it in the UK. Type 2 is the most common and affects mostly middle aged and older people. It is due to a lack of insulin, either because the pancreas stops making enough or the cells in the body become resistant to it. If uncontrolled, it can reduce life expectancy (for example through heart or kidney failure) <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-life-expectancy.html\" title=\"\">by up to 10 years</a>.</p> <p>A poor diet and lack of exercise can increase the chances of getting type 2 diabetes. But what's so special about doing weightlifting rather than jogging?</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> <p>The study looked at 32,000 men who are part of ongoing analysis \u2013 so it does not necessarily mean weightlifting reduces the risk in women but is likely to. It also showed aerobic exercise of any sort reduced the risk, but a combination with weights worked better. One advantage of weightlifting is that you don't have to be fit to do it, whereas many people find aerobic exercise hard to do.</p> <p>Weightlifting, if done properly, should increase muscle mass in as little as <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/455223-how-long-does-muscle-toning-take/\" title=\"\">eight weeks</a>. Other studies have suggested that for people at a high risk of diabetes, weight training increases the amount of muscle in the body, and also reduces the levels of plasma-free fatty acids. It has also been shown <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=194184\" title=\"\">that weight training can control (ie lower) blood sugar levels</a> of people who already have diabetes. Researchers in one study found that lifting weights regularly (45 minutes three times a week on machines), reduced blood sugar levels by 1%, resulting in <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=736439\" title=\"\">up to a 20% reduction in heart attacks and strokes</a>.</p> <p>But weight training may have benefits beyond reducing the risks of diabetes. Muscle mass decreases with age, and while aerobic exercise is good for many things, it does not build muscle. Having strong muscles protects your joints from injury, and also aids balance and weight control. Lifting weights (free or on a machine) also strengthens bones and improves your stamina.</p> <p>To avoid injury, start by warming up, then lift a weight you can handle and repeat for up to 15 times, in a controlled and steady way. Ask for advice on how to do it at a local gym. Have a day of rest between exercising muscle groups. You can gradually build up the weights once you can do more than 15 repetitions easily. Then book your place at Rio 2016.</p>",
  "<p>A clarification. Last week, in an article about the jollity at Jamaica House on the occasion of Usain Bolt's retention of the 100 metre sprint title, I described how revellers lost the plot in the midst of crazed celebrations.</p> <p>They wore their \"hearts on their sleeves\", I said, painting a picture of all the whooping , the stomping and the whistling. Scrupulously objective, but it wasn't quite the truth, dear reader. I missed out the bit about the bloke who couldn't quite breathe as the gun&#xa0;was fired, who stopped breathing completely when Bolt moved sluggishly from his block. The guy who screamed and clicked his fingers in that way he does when overexcited, as Bolt flicked on the turbo charger. That was&#xa0;me.</p> <p>It happened when Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won the 100 metres. And it happened again last Thursday when the sublime became ridiculous and three Jamaicans, led by Bolt, grabbed the top slots in the 200 metres. Pointing, shouting, delirious chants of: \"One, two, three!\"</p> <p>I'm not Jamaican. I was born in east London. I am British. I like it here, for all the complications, flaws and disappointments. I go to Jamaica once a year to see my dad and I've come to like the place a lot. But why the whooping?</p> <p>I think it is because all of us in the diaspora understand that for Jamaica, this sort of thing matters. It has been marvellous to watch Britain win all these medals, and wonderful to feel the bonhomie in the capital since the opening ceremony. But a year from now, had we failed to win a single medal, it wouldn't have mattered. We would still have had that sense of ourselves as a rich nation, as a world player, as an economic powerhouse. In the absence of these certainties, excellence in sport and in the arts is what allows Jamaica to punch above its weight in the world. I also think I care because the people I care about over there care. I know it chips away at the psyche when we lazily portray life in Jamaica as all poverty and gun crime. When so many stories that feature black faces are negative.</p> <p>It creeps on you; the inner Jamaican. And when Warren Weir, the youngest of the 200&#xa0;metre winners, said: \"I was honoured to be able to do what my country wanted,\" I was ready for a little cry.</p>",
  "<p>What a difference a day makes. Samantha Murray had begun the modern pentathlon with a tentative display in the fencing event that seemed destined to knock her out of the running. She finished it on the podium with a silver medal round her neck.</p> <p>The 22-year-old took Britain's final medal of these Games after a thrilling finish against Brazil's Yane Marques in the Greenwich Arena. Her efforts in the first three events had put her in fourth place going into the final discipline, a combined running and shooting event, and with a handicap of only eight seconds behind the leader Laura Asadauskaite, the Lithuanian world No1, who took the gold here.</p> <p>In the four-lap finale, a 3,000m cross- country run interspersed with three rounds of target shooting on a 10-metre range, Murray lost several positions as she struggled to shoot down her five targets and finished the first lap in seventh place. But she made up places on the second lap until she had only Asadauskaite and Marques ahead of her.</p> <p>With Marques's legs beginning to look wobbly on the third 1km lap, Murray caught the 26-year-old Brazilian as they approached the shooting range for the last time. A brilliant final round and a burst of leg speed as she left the shooting area put her second and simultaneously broke Marques's resistance. As the Preston lass ran into the arena for the last time she was seconds ahead and the crowd's cheers of encouragement had turned to triumph.</p> <p>\"It was a complete dream to have a home crowd screaming for me and just lift me up like that,\" Murray said. \"I could have carried on running for another 10 minutes because I was loving it so much. I was just so proud. I've had a tough day but it's been a good day.\"</p> <p>This marked Britain's fifth of nine modern pentathlon medals contested at the Olympics since its introduction as a women's sport in 2000, an unusual dominance in a sport largely competed for by eastern Europeans. But the high expectations also led to crushing disappointment for Mhairi Spence, Murray's team-mate. Spence is the current world champion \u2013 a title she won in Rome in May, where Murray took bronze \u2013 but she finished 21st here and said afterwards that, while the sport was a great leveller, \"it definitely knows how to break your spirit sometimes\".</p> <p>Nicknamed \"Fencey Spencey\" for her favourite discipline, the world No4 was expected to shine in the first event at the Copper Box, where the competitors are required to fence every one of their opponents in a one-minute bout, the first hit winning. She started strongly, playing cat and mouse with her opponents in her trademark style, but three hours is a long time to fence \u2013 the athletes play no fewer than 35 bouts \u2013 and her frustration became evident as the usually smiley athlete argued with her coach, having lost her bout to the defending champion, Lena Sch\u00f6neborn.</p> <p>Although Spence repaired some of the damage and remained in 11th place after the swim, four downed fences in the showjumping and a failure to hit her shooting targets sent her plummeting through the field. \"Everything just kind of went wrong today,\" she said, \"and obviously I'm gutted because I proved a couple of months ago that I'm good enough to stand on the podium \u2026 I don't feel like I'm a world champion right now.\"</p> <p>Murray herself had suffered a terrible start to the day. She lost seven straight bouts in the fencing before gradually, very gradually, improving her standing. In joint 16th after the first discipline, she seemed to have left herself a mountain to climb. And mountain climbing is not even on the programme.</p> <p>But as any regular observer of the sport will tell you \u2013 if you can find one \u2013 a day is a long time in modern pentathlon. Eleven hours, in fact. And by hour five, Murray had dragged herself into bronze medal position thanks to an outstanding performance in the 200m swim. The Hungarian Sarolta Kovacs went out fast and Murray clung to her shoulder and, when Kovacs set a new Olympic record of 2min 08.20sec, Murray was only nine hundredths of a second behind her. Surprisingly Murray declared herself disappointed with her swim later:</p> <p>The showjumping round provided, as ever, the most dramatic contest of the day. Modern pentathletes have only 20 minutes to introduce themselves to the horses they will ride, who are drawn by lot, and a number of riders found the relationship wanting \u2013 not least Tamara Vega of Mexico. Her mount threw her on the second part of a triple and she ended up jumping the third part dangling from the underside of his neck.</p> <p>When Ukraine's Iryna Khokhlova, who had been lying 14th, put in the first clear round of the contest, gaining herself a perfect score of 1,200, the pressure was on for the remaining riders. No one else could match her feat, although Asadauskaite put in a masterly ride with only one fence deduction \u2013 her horse was so proud he leapt over the exit gate on his way out of the arena.</p> <p>Spence, who came to modern pentathlon through horseriding, had drawn a dark grey called Coronado's Son and, while pentathletes are given briefing notes on their mounts, his made no mention of his burning eagerness to complete the course. It took all of Spence's determination to keep him in check and the four fences he knocked down along the way put her ultimately out of medal contention. \"I was just pointing and hoping for the best,\" she said later, \"doing the best I could with what I got. That's life, isn't it?\"</p> <p>But a good ride from Murray took her into the final round only 32 points behind Asadauskaite. She attributed her calm performance at the end to the psychological training she has undergone: \"I could have bottled it and thrown it away,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Holding a pistol when you've just run 2km, co-ordinating your breathing, you've got sweaty palms, your heart's racing \u2013 it's tough, it's a challenge. But I've pictured and trained my mind for that moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>In June <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2012/06/19/british-airways-olympics-ad-tells-brits-not-fly-during-london-2012\" title=\"\">British Airways premiered a TV advert</a> intended to ram home its status as the \"official airline partner\" of the Olympics and Paralympics: 61 slightly alarming seconds, in which airliners taxied around the streets of London, and we were treated to the consummately postmodern trick of advertising masquerading as non-advertising: \"Stay at home, support Team GB,\" ran the tagline.</p> <p>The soundtrack, strangely enough, was the Clash's London Calling. There it was, heavily edited, blasting out in the midst of union flags and a vision of the capital restored to its swinging London-ish pomp, despite the fact that its lyrics suggested the exact reverse: \"phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust \u2026 we ain't got no swing \u2026 London is drowning, and I live by the river.\"</p> <p>What to do? Wring your hands? Or acknowledge that this particular die was cast when the same band's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tBop3IKBdQ\" title=\"\">Should I Stay Or Should I Go was used by Levi's</a> jeans in 1991, and accept that popular music has long been an absurd carry-on in which hardened meanings are as transient as success, and it's axiomatic that nothing is sacred? Any lingering view to the contrary surely died in 2000, when Nick Drake's impossibly sad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOW9fLT9eY\" title=\"\">Pink Moon was captured by Volkswagen</a> and used to advertise its Cabrio range, soundtracking a gang of hipsters marvelling at the night sky, motoring to a party and then putting the car in reverse and deciding to marvel at the night sky again \u2013 as usual, bohemia as reimagined by unutterable squares.</p> <p>Last week, however, there came news of one person who wanted nothing to do with any of this. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19206509\" title=\"\">The Beastie Boys' Adam Yauch</a> died of cancer in May, having played his part in the creation of 25 years of music that any ad exec would pay millions to get hold of. We now know that his will contained one very interesting clause: \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event may my image or name or any music or any artistic property created by me be used for advertising purposes.\"</p> <p>Now, it would be easy to view this as one more act of self-righteousness from a group who often seemed to specialise in them. [With an estate valued at around $6m, and guaranteed royalties from his group's biggest-selling records that will swell his posthumous earnings, Yauch could afford such a stance \u2013 unlike the thousands of musicians who, with their industry nosediving, sometimes seem to sell their souls in order to eat. In Britain, moreover, any sniff of moralism from The Beastie Boys has long been met with the retelling of a tale from 1998, when the same people who had created Licensed To Ill \u2014 a brilliant album, but also home to some of the most sexist lyrics ever written \u2014 placed themselves on moral high ground to which they had no right, contacting the Prodigy and requesting them to desist from playing a largely instrumental track titled Smack My Bitch Up (\"what a pious bunch of cunts,\" said The Manic Street Preachers' Nicky Wire, and he had a point)]</p> <p>.But this move really counts for something. It chimes with much the same stance taken by Radiohead, Beck and REM. There are echoes of the statement issued by the surviving Beatles when <a href=\"http://www.pophistorydig.com/?p=702\" title=\"\">Nike used the original recording of Revolution to sell trainers</a>, and the argument that they \"wrote and recorded these songs as artists and not as pitch- men for any product\". Even if you're a musician stuck a few hundred rungs down the ladder, knowing that the music industry is on its uppers and the use of your music in an ad might get you through another year, it's not a bad ideal to bear in mind. If you're lucky enough to break big, it should be imprinted on your brain.</p> <p>The trouble is that holding the line against the blurring of creativity and advertising can now look almost impossible. Sponsorship is ubiquitous, as proved by this coming weekend's annual V festivals \u2013 two days of promotion for the Virgin group, who push their trains, mobile phones and the rest \u2013 and Scotland's T in the Park, which pushes the great contributions to that country's culture and public health of Tennent's Lager. Jack Daniel's whiskey now pays for bands to do intimate gigs in the their hometowns (because, notwithstanding its parent company's annual revenues of $3bn, its brand is all about \"roots\"). By way of an illustration, consider the case of the White Stripes' Jack White, who pledged to restore music's soul and wound up writing a song for Coca-Cola entitled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/apr/28/arts.advertising\" title=\"\">Love Is the Truth</a>, which was nice.</p> <p>And once a musician is dead, God help them \u2013 not least because, while US law gives the estates of dead stars control over the use of their image, in the UK no approval is required. With Yoko Ono's say-so, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1255446/John-Lennons-son-defends-mother-allowing-Citroen-use-images-father-car-ad.html\" title=\"\">John Lennon's image has been used to sell Citroen cars</a>. Most mind-boggling of all, in 2008, a portrait of <a href=\"http://www.punknews.org/article/27898/sid-vicious-ian-curtis-billie-joe-armstrong-to-pitch-converse-in-new-campaign\" title=\"\">Ian Curtis of Joy Division</a> apparently wearing a pair of Converse trainers (a brand owned by Nike) was hurled around the globe. Did a man whose songs include Atrocity Exhibition and Dead Souls actually wear Converse? Even if he did, would he have been comfortable being reduced to selling them? There again, who cares?</p> <p>Actually, I do. As I've acknowledged before, moaning about the state of pop music at the age of 42 is probably a futile and undignified thing. But if my ongoing sadness about the plight of such a beautiful, democratic form comes down to one thing, it is this: the washing away of all meaning, so that most contemporary musicians apparently have no language with which to convincingly sing about the world, and their forebears end up as nothing more than poster boys (and girls) for other people's very marketable notions of cool. To argue against all this may sound hopelessly naive; in such a dire financial climate for musicians, it also implies any future Beatles or Beastie Boys probably having to endure long years of penury, which is easy for me to advocate. But I stand by the basic point: to even start to avenge music's bland-out requires one thing \u2013 musicians distancing themselves from the machine, and returning to the noble ideal of art for art's sake.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the Clash, a song from the London Calling album entitled Death or Glory, and a golden Joe Strummer couplet: \"Every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock'n'roll / Grabs the mike to tell us he'll die before he's sold.\" His contention, aimed at himself as much as anyone, was that principles soon dissolve into mere poses, and the fast buck is always grabbed, sooner or later. But Adam Yauch proved otherwise. \"I might stick around or I might be a fad / But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad,\" went a Beastie Boys song titled Putting Shame in Your Game. As it turns out, he meant it. And how great is that?</p>",

On that evening 16 days ago, the astonishment of <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/jul/28/olympics-2012-danny-boyle\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's triumph</a> had grown and grown, until I didn't think anything could surprise me. And then there before our eyes, leading out luminaries from Ban-Ki Moon to Muhammad Ali, carrying the Olympic flag towards the ceremony's climax \u2013 suddenly there was <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/doreen-lawrence\" title=\"\">Doreen Lawrence</a>.</p> <p>From London to Jamaica, family and friends did a double take in disbelief. The only two people in the world who had known she would be there were her surviving children, watching in the stadium. For many, myself included, that was the moment of surrender to tears. But as I watched it crossed my mind that somewhere in England, in two prison cells, two of the men who murdered her son were very probably watching too. The <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/lawrence\" title=\"\">legacy of what they did</a> with their friends 19 years ago was being witnessed by billions all over the world.</p> <p>Lawence hadn't been sure she should take take part when she was first approached. She spoke to <a href=\"Shami Chakribati\" title=\"\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>, the director of <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Liberty</a>, who had also been invited, and both wondered whether their activism could be compromised. \"When you're a campaigner, there are times you're worried about where you place yourself.\" In the end it was Lawrence who decided they had nothing to worry about.</p> <p>\"There are times when these things happen and ordinary people don't get involved. It's always a celebrity. They're up there somewhere, and the people are down there, and it's like never the two will meet. So I saw it as an opportunity to represent the community as a whole, so people can see that we are a part of society, and not just on the fringe. And within the black community, many times you don't get an opportunity to do anything like that.\"</p> <p>Lawrence still couldn't quite believe Boyle even knew who she was. Her world is the <a href=\" http://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/\" title=\"\">charitable trust</a> in south London she founded in her son Stephen's name, and when we meet there she conveys an immediate air of unimpressionable, quiet self\u2011possession. \"Danny Boyle is a name from directing a big movie where he got an Oscar. I kept thinking: he doesn't know me from Adam.\" As it turned out, though, his preparations sound less like a slick Hollywood operation than a charmingly British muddle.</p> <p>Most of the Olympic flagbearers gathered at a hotel the day before the event, to set off for the rehearsal together. \"We were having a nice chat about what each of us had done over the years, quite happy sitting there chatting, while aides were running around looking for people.\" Eventually, it dawned on them that the veteran Ethiopian runner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/29/athletics\" title=\"\">Haile Gebrselassie</a> was outside sitting in the coach. \"Over an hour this poor man and his daughter were sitting out there, when they could be inside the hotel where it was a nice and cool, having a drink of water or something. We had no idea.\" She chuckles. \"You think it will all be precision, like an army, but it wasn't like that at all.\"</p> <p>When their coach got to the Olympic park two hours late they weren't allowed in because they didn't have their passes. Finally they got to their dressing rooms, which had code names on the doors to keep their identities secret. \"Mine was London Bridge. I thought, how appropriate, because we used to have an office in London Bridge.\" Only when they were shown how to carry the flag, which turned out to be trickier than she'd imagined, and made her thumb go numb, did the magnitude of the occasion begin to sink in.</p> <p>It still didn't fully hit her until the following night. \"That was when the reality really struck.\" Hadn't she thought about the billions who would be watching? \"No I didn't. I just didn't, I didn't. But then suddenly, it was, 'Oh God.'\" As the flagbearers were called into makeup, \"we were all very quiet. We weren't very chatty.\" Then it was a race to get changed, and a panic to get the white linen outfit on without smearing makeup on it. \"It was at that point, yes, I was getting a bit nervous. I got quite emotional. And I'm just thinking: 'Hold it together, hold it together, hold it together.\" Ban-Ki Moon only arrived at the last minute, slipping into position just as they were lining up. Then Lawrence led them out into the stadium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685005\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/10/1344618173010/Doreen-Lawrence-bottom-ri-008.jpg\" alt=\"Doreen Lawrence, bottom right, with the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doreen Lawrence, bottom right, with the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony.

There's nothing breathless about her recollections of the night \u2013 no giddy wonder or excitement \u2013 but I suspect this is about as effusive as Lawrence ever allows herself to be.</p> <p>\"It wasn't until I thought to myself, all the countries' flags have gone past and this is like the pinnacle of everything. The Olympic flag. This is the most important flag that's going to be raised. This is going to be the most important thing, and here I'm the one helping to carry it.\"</p> <p>Nineteen years ago, Lawrence was an ordinary<strong> </strong>mother from Jamaica, raising her sons and daughter with her husband, Neville, in the humdrum anonymity of any family. Since Stephen's murder, and the spectacular failure of the initial police investigation into it, she has become not just a powerful public campaigner but a kind of national talisman \u2013 the repository of both our shame and our hope. It's an identity she has had to get used to \u2013 but never quite come to terms with.</p> <p>\"People tend to struggle with me to get me to a position where I accept that this is it, and this is my life. But I'd still rather not be there, if you understand what I mean. I've always struggled with it. There are times when I've felt, 'OK, well this is it,' but then the minute I start saying, 'Yes, I'm fine with it', I seem to revert back to thinking: 'I can't take it'. And I'm not sure when I would ever accept it.\"</p> <p>On the night Lawrence lost her son, she didn't realise she would also lose her privacy. She had no idea that almost two decades later, people on the street would still whisper, 'Oh that's Doreen Lawrence', as she passed. \"I don't turn around. I just keep walking.\" She always tries to smile \u2013 \"Because people are pleased to meet me, and I've got to understand that from their point of me. But for me I don't see that great significance.\"</p> <p>At a recent family function a young girl approached and told her she'd done an A-level project about Stephen and her. \"And I was just thinking: 'This is all I need just now.' My privacy has been taken away from me \u2013 I can't just be a face in the crowd \u2013 and I think that's a sad thing. Because if the police had done their job on the night Stephen died, nobody would ever know who I am. I would have been forgotten about, and people would have moved on. But because of the struggle, and the fight for justice over the years, that hasn't been possible.\"</p> <p>Had she known back then what her struggle for justice would cost her, would she still have campaigned? \"If it means me having to do that in order to get justice for Stephen then yes, because my child is important to me. But I'd probably think quite hard about it, and think: 'How do I protect myself?' But it was just something that happened, and it rolled.\" She has fought to protect her other children's privacy, though \u2013 not least for fear that her remaining son could become a prize target for racists.</p> <p>In the months and years following his death she found herself addressing senior politicians, police and others in authority. Back then she knew nothing of public advocacy, so I ask if she ever felt daunted, or even out of her depth. \"I never had any of that, because I think I was too angry. My thought is, nobody's born with a title \u2013 apart from the royal family and people like that. They're just ordinary people, and that's how I saw them. So when I speak to the prime minister, or the commissioner of police, that made no difference to me. A lot of people perceive that we, as ordinary people, should behave in a certain way; that we should be grateful that they make a point for us to come and see them. And I didn't see it like that. The authorities seemed to think we were asking for something special, when we were just asking for what everyone else has. As far as I was concerned, someone's taken my son's life, and you were supposed to get justice for him, and you didn't, so I want to know why. That's how I saw it.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">1999 Macpherson report</a> was supposed to be a watershed moment in British policing history. When Lawrence read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/16/met-police-cases-alleged-racism\" title=\"\">all the reports</a> earlier this year of police officers beating up young black men, and calling them \"niggers\", did she wonder how much had really changed?</p> <p>\"I think their PR has changed quite a bit. All eyes are on them, so their language has changed. But the officers on the street, they haven't changed.\" She pauses to consider her words. \"I can't say that nothing's changed because that wouldn't be true. But when you still hear the same stories about individual families who are still experiencing racism, you question that. And they don't know where to take their complaints, because they can't take it to the police, because the police are the problem. So I hear it, and I question how we are going to move forward on this.\"</p> <p>In January this year, two of the five original suspects were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/03/justice-for-stephen-lawrence\" title=\"\">finally convicted </a>of Stephen's murder. Having waited so long to hear the word, \"guilty\", Lawrence at the time said she still couldn't quite believe it. The verdict had eluded her family for so long, it had assumed in her mind an almost mythical quality \u2013 an impossible fantasy \u2013 so that when it finally happened, it was quite literally incredible. I wonder whether the convictions have yet become real for her.</p> <p>\"Well, we're still in limbo, because of the appeals.\" Both men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, have lodged applications for leave to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/30/stephen-lawrence-killers-launch-appeal\" title=\"\">appeal</a>. \"And you still don't know what a judge is going to make of that.\" She thinks the trial judge was deliberately accommodating towards the defence to make sure they could have no possible grounds for appeal \u2013 but until the ruling is delivered, she cannot relax.</p> <p>When sentencing the pair, the judge took the unusual step of exhorting police to continue their investigation, until all of Stephen's killers are brought to court. Does Lawrence think that will ever happen? As she considers her answer, indefatigability wrestles with pessimism in her expression. \"Well, there are lines of inquiry. But there is a rumour that there are those in the police force who want to draw a line. That they don't want to go any further. I think some of those officers have gone back to that place again where they don't want to do anything else; that we should be grateful that we got this much. I'm sorry, but I don't take that view. My son was killed by a group of men, and it is your duty and your responsibility that those individuals, regardless of their background and whoever they are, are caught. That's what your job is, and it doesn't matter how long it takes for you to do that.\"</p> <p>When the Lawrence family emerged from court following the two convictions, Stephen's parents exchanged not so much as a glance. Their marriage was another casualty of his murder \u2013 as is the way with roughly half of all murdered children's parents, a heartbreaking statistic I imagine she must have soon become aware of. I ask if she had once thought they could beat the odds.</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" she says quietly. \"Because I always said it's family that's important. That's how I see it.\" She says she read the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2176914/Soham-tragedy-Parents-Holly-Wells-speak-10-years-murdered-Ian-Huntley.html\" title=\"\">recent interviews</a> with the parents of one of the Soham murder victims, who described their determination to remain together. \"And it was quite heartwarming,\" she adds softly. \"I wish that was us.\"</p> <p>I think the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust represents her own signifier of survival. Among other things, the trust offers bursaries to ethnic minority youngsters to study architecture, the profession her son had been training for. The last Labour government provided financial support, but since the coalition took office it has offered not a penny of Home Office money. The home secretary, Theresa May, did pay the trust a visit, and Lawrence made its financial crisis clear to her.</p> <p>\"I said to her, a small organisation like us, we are desperately, desperately in need of money. We had 15 full-time staff; we're now down to three, including myself. We get donations from ordinary people. But it's really hard, it's really hard. How long is it going to be able to survive? If we're still here this time next year, it will be because of a miracle.\"</p> <p>Lawrence's ex-husband, Neville, has moved back to Jamaica. Her two children are now grown up, and so today she lives alone. She said <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01jqb8t/Desert_Island_Discs_Doreen_Lawrence/\" title=\"\">recently</a> that her daughter keeps nagging her to try to start dating again, but somehow it just feels beyond her. For all Lawrence's ambivalence about her public identity, thoughts of any personal life still seem to come second.</p> <p>As a mother, she doesn't even see that as a choice. She attended John Terry's recent trial, and when I ask why she says simply: \"I did that from one mother to another. Just to give Anton Ferdinand's mother support.\"</p> <p>I'm curious to know how she feels about the parents of all the men accused of her son's murder. There has been speculation that Norris and Dobson's parents, having given alibis under oath for their sons that night, may be <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9082439/Parents-of-Stephen-Lawrence-killers-could-face-investigation.html\" title=\"\">tried for perjury</a>. Would Lawrence like to see them prosecuted?</p> <p>\"Definitely. Definitely.\" Had it been her own son accused of murder, she just cannot believe she would have tried to protect him from justice. \"I couldn't live with myself, because that would be living a lie. My conscience wouldn't allow me to \u2013 and my children know this.\"</p> <p>I ask if she thinks they truly believe in their sons' innocence. She sighs.</p> <p>\"Well I think those types of people, they're\u2026\" She breaks off. After a long pause, \"It's like they feel that they have the right, or their sons have the right, to do whatever they want to do.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You can donate to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust at <a href=\"http://stephenlawrence.org.uk\" title=\"\">stephenlawrence.org.uk</a> or by phoning 020 8100 2800.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 August 2012.

  "<p>I'm running a slight fever, so this might not make sense, but you can read it anyway if you like. Continue?</p> <p>OK. About an hour ago I yelled at a machine. Told it, pointlessly, to shut up. The machine was a phone, the idiot. The previous day I'd set an alarm on it to remind me to do something and now here it was, moronically&#xa0;doing its duty, ringing and thrumming and thrumming and ringing. Since present-moment me had already done the thing that yesterday me had been so pant-pissingly angsty about missing; the reminder was irritating. Doubly irritating because at the time, I was trying to deal with a screaming baby. Old man needs a lie down.</p> <p>I don't mention the baby in a bid to deliberately sicken you \u2013 much as the notion delights me \u2013 but because for a moment I realised I was trapped between two things that were yelling at me for reasons they couldn't possibly comprehend. Seconds earlier the baby, who is just shy of five months, had been gurgling delightedly like a dumb cartoon dog as I held him up under the arms so he could put his legs on the ground and practise \"standing\". He laughed and laughed and laughed, until his mind apparently snapped, and the laughs morphed into whimpers, followed closely by howls. There's no point telling a baby to make its mind up. It can't co-ordinate its mind any better than it could co-ordinate an Apache attack helicopter.</p> <p>As far as I could tell he wasn't hungry, tired, or understandably outraged at the sight of me; he was \"over-stimulated\"; a regular and unavoidable occurrence when a baby's developing brain is intermittently swamped by the ever-present cacophony of existence and it screams in anguish at the sheer prospect of having to live a single minute longer. Think of this as a form of pure artistic expression and most reasonable adults can resist the urge to fling the child across the&#xa0;room.</p> <p>No such holding back required with a phone. You can scream at a phone for six months straight and Philip Larkin won't accuse you of fucking it up. A phone doesn't know, because it's full of cogs made of light or something, whereas a baby is filled with a kind of haunted meat, probably. I&#xa0;don't know. Old man needs a lie down.</p> <p>Anyway, as the shout tromboned its way out of my gob, I suddenly had a chilling vision of my son's future, which was abstract, but felt like this:&#xa0;unless some cataclysmic event reduces his world to a fizzing pit of ashes, for him, the over-stimulation will never stop. It'll amplify and accelerate. Already everywhere is chitter-chatter, flashing lights and LOOKEE HERE. You can walk away from the computer, take a break from Twitter, lose your phone on purpose and it's&#xa0;still there, in the atmosphere, somehow, because this decade-long festival of stimuli has rewired your attention span to the point where trying to entertain just one thought at a time feels like trying to focus on a reflective disc lodged between the spokes of a spinning bike wheel. By the time he's five, even the paving slabs he'll have just learned to walk on will have been replaced by footprint-operated touchscreens that try to log him into Facebook. He'll cope with it fine; the young do. But by that point I'll probably be on my knees, clutching my head, foaming at the mouth.</p> <p>But then that's my clapped-out never-was mess of a brain talking. I'm 41 and irrelevant. And tired. I used to play vertical-scrolling shoot-em-ups in which a blizzard of angry pixels swirled around the screen like a synchronised galaxy impersonating a flock of starlings, accompanied by a melodic soundtrack of pops and whistles apparently performed by an orchestra of frenzied Bop-It&#xa0;machines. But at least then you could&#xa0;press pause. Now I find it hard to cope with seeing a banner ad slowly fading from red&#xa0;to green while the The One Show's on in the background, which is why over the past few weeks I've ratcheted down my engagement with anything not made of wood. There's a baby to attend to, and his old man needs a lie down.</p> <p>Because the alternative is to surround myself with technology designed specifically for shouting at. And that's the more uplifting feature of the horrible future I pictured for this baby I'm talking about, the baby I vowed to never mention in print because to do so would instantly&#xa0;mark me out as a prick: in the future, we'll have specially designed anguish-venting machines \u2013 unfeeling robots wearing bewildered faces for older people to scream into like adult babies, just to let out all the stress caused by constant exposure to yappering, feverish stimuli. Tomorrow will consist of flashing lights and off-the-shelf digital punchbags, consumed by a generation better equipped to deal with it than me, which won't matter because by then I will have withdrawn entirely from the digital world: an old man, enjoying his lie down.</p>",
  "<p>California fell in love with food trucks \u2013 a phenomenon it exported across the US \u2013 amid hopes they would bring together disparate communities in a culture of outdoor dining.</p> <p>Strangers do indeed queue for the gourmet fare in a convivial atmosphere, but it turns out the food truck owners are now the ones in need of some unity. A row over regulation has pitted rival factions in angry accusations of bullying, scare tactics and dire warnings that the entire industry faces destruction.</p> <p>In one corner is Matt Geller, chief executive officer of the Southern California Mobile Food Vendors Association, who opposes regulation as anathema.</p> <p>His organisation's 150 members, sprinkled from Santa Barbara to San Diego, say city and state authorities have no right to restrict their businesses beyond public safety codes.</p> <p>In the other corner is the newly formed California Mobile Food Association, or CMFA, in Sacramento, which says food truck owners should cooperate with regulation attempts.</p> <p>Earlier this month, CMFA's president Chris Jarosz announced he was cooperating with state assembly members on a proposed law allowing cities to regulate food trucks.</p> <p>This came amid a spirit of compromise in which Sacramento's food truck owners agreed with restaurants \u2013 who feared losing out to wheeled competitors \u2013 over where and when trucks could operate. The CMFA's compliance triggered an alarmed letter from Geller to local truck owners in which he all but accused the organisation of treachery.</p> <p>Support of state legislation would reverse the accomplishments of his harder line group and \"likely destroy the mobile food industry in California\", the Sacramento Bee <a href=\"http://www.sacbee.com/2012/08/12/4717597/food-truck-conflictspreads.html#storylink=cpy\">reported on Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Jarosz and other truck owners who favour compromise called the letter \"threatening\", \"bullying\" and \"scare tactics\" and said they would continue cooperating with Sacramento officials and explore possible state legislation. \"It could erase what we've accomplished in the past two months,\" he told the paper. \"It's important in the next six months that food trucks take care of each other and show respect for each other and the regulations.\"</p> <p>However some truck owners such as Davin Vculek, owner of Krushburger, defended Geller as a champion.</p> <p>\"He's worked so hard to give rights to the food trucks, and now the industry is working against him. A lot of politicians and big government are tied in with restaurants.\"</p> <p>The dispute is the latest in a series of disagreements within a burgeoning industry which caught the Californian public's imagination and inspired imitators in Chicago, New York and elsewhere in the US.</p> <p>The phenomenon took off about a decade ago when innovators took the concept of \"loncheras\" \u2013 taco trucks which typically served pre-cooked meals to labourers \u2013 and put kitchens and gourmet fare on wheels.</p> <p>Fans hailed the trucks not only for the quality of the food but for creating a street culture which helped connect otherwise atomised communities. Last year, however, some leading food truck owners complained that hundreds of new competitors were saturating the market and ruining the concept with mediocre fare.</p> <p>\"What was once an exciting, underground food scene driven by a punk rock aesthetic and an exploratory mentality is swiftly becoming a mainstream, bottom-line-obsessed maze of infighting and politics,\" <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/06/food/la-fo-food-trucks-20110506\">the LA Times wrote at the time</a>.</p>",

  "<p>It is, in fairness, the Scottish play. But rarely has Macbeth been so inescapable north of Carlisle. There are, depending on how you count, at least 13&nbsp;versions at this year's Edinburgh festival.

This&nbsp;is 2008: Macbeth by <a href=\"http://www.trwarszawa.pl/en/about-tr\" title=\"\">the punky young Polish company TR Warszawa</a>. Just opened, it is the biggest, boldest Macbeth of them all: an adaptation that turns Shakespeare's play into a jarring response to sectarian violence and war in the Middle East, performed in Polish with surtitles. <a href=\"http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/theater/reviews/23macb.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">The New York Times called it \"brash, aggressively violent and very free\".</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.trwarszawa.pl/en/people\" title=\"\">Director Grzegorz Jarzyna</a>, 44, prefers the word \"cinematic\". Guiding me around the outskirts of his vast stage, its steel columns studded with lights and men in climbing gear rigging up speakers, he says: \"For me, the play is like a movie. It's very fast, the scenes are very brief. Macbeth doesn't have time to make proper decisions \u2013 he just has to act.\" This is&nbsp;Shakespeare's play reimagined as full-scale war, complete with soldiers shimmying down ropes to the roar of helicopter blades, like special forces on&nbsp;the trail of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/osamabinladen\" title=\"\">Osama bin&nbsp;Laden</a>.</p> <p>But if Jarzyna's Macbeth is an action hero, he's more violent video game figure than noble Hollywood warrior: already dangerously desensitised by battle. The play opens on the upper level of the two-storey set, with soldiers clustered around video screens watching military commander Macbeth and his troops storm what looks alarmingly like a mosque; they then butcher its inhabitants, a grisly taste of things to come. Jarzyna points cheerily to where these horrors are to ensue, proud of the newly installed hose that will clean away the gore afterwards.</p> <p>It's easy to see how the production might be difficult to stomach, but TR Warszawa's first brush with controversy came from an unexpected source: they displeased the Polish munitions manufacturer who, in 2005, lent them an old factory to stage their Macbeth, no other venue in Warsaw being big enough. \"They weren't very happy when they read in the newspapers what we were doing,\" says Jarzyna. \"They didn't realise we made so many references to Iraq.\" The company decamped soon afterwards. <a href=\"http://www.trwarszawa.pl/en/all-our-tomorrows-tr-warszawa-brings-macbeth-to-dumbo\" title=\"\">Apart from that brief visit to New York in 2008 later that year</a>, this is the first staging since.</p> <p>Given that the show has had various incarnations in various places (the 2008 in its title dates from the New York trip), you might wonder whether the contemporary Middle East setting carries the same force. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\" title=\"\">Iraq, though still fissured by sectarian violence, is&nbsp;less volatile than four years ago</a>; US&nbsp;troops, clearly referenced in this&nbsp;production, withdrew last December;&nbsp;and there's much more to&nbsp;Shakespeare's play than war. Jarzyna&nbsp;nods. \"The reason we initially&nbsp;did this was the war in Iraq. But I remember something <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">Putin</a> said after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/chechnya\" title=\"\">Chechnya</a>, where the Russians killed thousands of people: 'We have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things still to do.' It's the same&nbsp;mechanism, the same power.\" Putin is quite a Macbeth-like figure, I say. Jarzyna laughs mirthlessly. \"Macbeth is a beast, but a reflective one.

  "<p>A women-only industrial city dedicated to female workers is to be constructed in Saudi Arabia to provide a working environment that is in line with the kingdom's strict customs.</p> <p>The city, to be built in the Eastern Province city of Hofuf, is set to be the first of several planned for the Gulf kingdom. The aim is to allow more women to work and achieve greater financial independence, but to maintain the gender segregation, according to reports.</p> <p>Proposals have also been submitted for four similar industrial cities exclusively for women entrepreneurs, employers and employees in Riyadh.</p> <p>Segregation of the sexes is applied in Saudi Arabia, where Wahabi sharia law and tribal customs combine to create an ultra-conservative society that still does not allow women to drive. Saudi women are said to make up about 15% of the workforce, with most in female-only work places. Although the number of mixed gender workplaces has increased these are still few.</p> <p>The proposals follow government instructions to create more job openings for women to enable them to have a more important role in the country's development.</p> <p>The Saudi Industrial Property Authority (Modon), which is developing the women-only industrial city at Hofuf, said it hoped the city would open next year. Prince Mansour bin Miteb bin Abdulaziz, minister of municipal and rural affairs, had approved the plan, a spokesperson said.</p> <p>\"I'm sure that women can demonstrate their efficiency in many aspects and clarify the industries that best suit their interests, nature and ability,\" said Modon's deputy director general, Saleh al-Rasheed.</p> <p>The Hofuf development is expected to create about 5,000 jobs in textiles, pharmaceuticals and food-processing industries, with women-run firms and production lines. Modon said the Hofuf industrial site was a suitable location given its \"proximity to residential neighbourhoods to facilitate the movement of women to and from the workplace\".</p> <p>In a statement it added that the site was equipped \"for women workers in environment and working conditions consistent with the privacy of women according to Islamic guidelines and regulations\".</p> <p>The project has been proposed by a group of Saudi businesswomen, said Al Eqtisadiah, the business daily, quoting the business woman Hussa al-Aun. She told the paper: \"The new industrial city should have a specialised training centre to help women develop their talents and train them to work at factories. This is essential to cut unemployment among our female graduates.\"</p> <p>The oil rich kingdom has one of the world's largest disparities between male and female employment, with a gap of 23%, according to a recent Gallup poll, arabianbusiness.com reported.</p> <p>An increasing number of firms were insisting that women had to be unmarried to qualify for employment; this violated the kingdom's workforce regulations, reports said. \"Some private companies are stipulating conditions such as a woman shall be recruited only if she is single or not pregnant if married,\" Hatab al-Anazi, a ministry spokesman, is reported to have told the paper Arab News. \"[That] is against the regulations approved by the ministry.\"</p> <p>Saudi Arabia attracts constant criticism from human rights groups for its systemic discrimination against women.</p> <p>Last September King Abdullah, who has taken some tentative steps towards loosening strict gender segregation, announced that women would be able to vote in the 2015 local elections and for the consultative assembly.</p> <p>In January the government enforced a law allowing Saudi women to be employed in lingerie and cosmetic shops, following a campaign by the women's rights activist Reem Asaad. Previously women had to purchase underwear from male shop assistants. The plan is that by the end of this year women will replace men in stores selling abayas, the traditional black cloak worn by women.</p> <p>Last month a poll of working women in Saudi Arabia by YouGov and Bayt.com found 65% wanted to achieve greater financial independence through their careers. Those under 25 also wanted to make use of their educational qualifications.</p>",
  "<p>It began with fears that venues were sinking into the mud following weeks of rain, serious concerns over whether there would be enough security guards to keep the public safe and the biggest call on the army outside wartime.</p> <p>The reaction to the Olympic torch as it toured the nation had raised the hopes of organisers, but the last-ditch security crisis dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the \u00a39.3bn cost to the public purse grew louder.</p> <p>Just over a fortnight later, London's Games ended bathed in sunshine as the country giddily rose to acclaim a host of new sporting heroes amid hopes that it would lead to a new sense of ourselves and \u2014 in the words of a Locog slogan that once seemed cloying but now feels appropriate \u2014 \"inspire a generation\".</p> <p>Even the hamfisted marketing slogans of Team GB \u2014 \"One Team, 60m Strong\" \u2014 seemed to take on a new hue once bathed in the golden light of the achievements of Mo Farah, Chris Hoy, Ben Ainslie, Jessica Ennis, Kath Grainger, Victoria Pendleton and the rest.</p> <p>The London 2012 organising committee chairman, Lord Coe, said he was humbled but not surprised by the reaction of the British public and the mood catalysed by the athletes and the 70,000 volunteers that became his most potent cheerleaders.</p> <p>\"I don't think any city that stages the Games is ever the same afterwards. No country is ever the same,\" said Coe. \"It has been important to showcase all that we hold dear in this country, in the way that all Games do.\"It was a job that began with Danny Boyle's opening ceremony, which packed the history and hopes of the British nation into three hours that received rave reviews at home and abroad, and proclaimed: \"This is for everyone!\" As it turned out, it was.</p> <p>As the focus moves on to whether London's Olympics can provide the sporting, economic, social and regeneration legacy it promised, the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, said it was also important to remember the \"intangible\" effect of the Games on the people. He summed up the shift in the national mood by saying that the Games had achieved the impossible by inspiring Londoners to talk to one another on the tube network.</p> <p><strong>Atmosphere</strong></p> <p>It became so well worn that by the end of the Games it had almost become a cliche, but every athlete from at home and abroad who competed was quick to pay tribute to the atmosphere within the venues.</p> <p>Some purists felt organisers overdid the loud music and flash presentation, but many more felt it immersed the crowds effectively in sports that might be new to them.</p> <p>From the hush of the archery at Lord's to the jollity of the beach volleyball and the tumult of the boxing arena at ExCeL, excited, knowledgeable crowds packed out every venue. For the big moments in the stadium, at the velodrome or on the rowing lake, the atmosphere rivalled any sporting event ever held on the planet.</p> <p>On the park, a Truman Show style mood of collective goodwill held for the entire period. Beyond the venues, for 17 days London felt a more pleasant place to be.</p> <p>Part of that may have been down to the fact organisers had successfully terrified Londoners to the point where they stayed off public transport but it was also because there was a collective sense of goodwill in the air. Buoyed by inspirational athletes from every part of the country, it spread far beyond the capital.</p> <p>Although organisers denied it, if there was one minor gripe it was that the live sites with big screens were not as busy as they might have been. But that's largely because everyone was at home watching the Olympics on television \u2014 the BBC posted huge audience figures and enjoyed its own boost to its reputation.</p> <p><strong>Volunteers</strong></p> <p>Determined to pluck the best from previous Games, Lord Coe had always waxed lyrical about the effect the volunteers at the 2000 Games in Sydney had on the national mood and was determined they could do a similar job here. The London organising committee's human resources director, the redoubtable Jean Tomlin, is one of many unsung heroes of these Games. She devised the scheme that enlisted 70,000 volunteers from 250,000 original applications.</p> <p>But the enthusiasm, wit, knowledge and good humour they brought to long days performing often menial tasks in their garish purple uniforms was all their own. Often lodging with relatives or paying for their own accommodation, their firm belief that they were part of something bigger transmitted itself to visitors from home and abroad and to the rest of the city. Coe said they represented \"the best of British\" \u2014 the challenge will be how to harness their enthusiasm and raise the profile of the armies of volunteers who already do similar work week in, week out across the country.</p> <p><strong>Organisation </strong></p> <p>Brazil's sports minister said that one of the lessons that they would take from London's organisers was the value of pre-planning. Bequeathed a clutch of glittering venues finished ahead of time and under budget by the Olympic Delivery Authority, Locog nevertheless had to undertake the challenge of delivering 26 simultaneous world championship in one of the busiest and most congested cities in the world. By any measure, they delivered.</p> <p>Paul Deighton, the Locog chief executive, will have to answer for his part in the eve-of-Games security shambles but he deserves praise for microscopic attention to detail in planning and obsessive focus on delivery. That mattered most of all in the crucial few weeks before the Games when huge temporary arenas had to be built in cramped and congested areas of the city.</p> <p>If there was one fly in the ointment it was a ticketing policy that sometimes appeared to be made up on the hoof. The original ballot was hugely oversubscribed, and probably the fairest way of distributing tickets, but there were issues with the Ticketmaster system all the way through to the last day of the Games.</p> <p>And lessons will have to be learned about the consequences of the unwieldy manner in which the IOC handles ticket sales, along with the overgenerous allocation of seats in accredited areas that led to the public anger over empty places, particularly in the opening days.</p> <p><strong>Sport </strong></p> <p>It's the sport, stupid, could have been the mantra of the organising committee. Deighton explained his job as removing anything that could get between the British public and the action, so convinced was he that once the world's best athletes were presented to a sports-mad nation success was virtually assured. As Rogge has said, success for the home nation is also a prerequisite for a Games to really take flight.</p> <p>For Team GB, it took until Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took gold in the women's coxless pairs on the fifth day of the Games to achieve liftoff. Bradley Wiggins followed soon after, and the British team were on their way to their best medal haul for more than a century on the back of unprecedented focus and investment in high-performance sport.</p> <p>The highlights flowed thick and fast. Old heroes were venerated anew -Sir Chris Hoy's sixth gold and Ben Ainslie's fourth in consecutive Games \u2014 and new ones were created in sports that normally barely feature on the media radar, from shooting to taekwondo and dressage to women's boxing. The success of female athletes was a familiar theme, with long overdue victory for Kath Grainger with Anna Watkins and Nicola Adams becoming the first women's boxing gold medallist ever deserving of particular mention.</p> <p>There was widespread appreciation for the dedication and humility that all of Britain's competitors brought to their task. Mo Farah's double victory, following a magical hour a week earlier that will remain one of the most venerated in British sporting history, set the seal on an extraordinary performance.</p> <p>But it wasn't just British athletes who stepped up to the plate. The Muhammad Ali of the track, Usain Bolt, confirmed his legendary status and the American swimmer Michael Phelps laid claim to the title of greatest ever Olympian. Other standouts included David Rudisha's 800m world record and the ongoing duel between the US and Jamaican sprint teams.</p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>Security at the Olympics has faded as an issue over the past fortnight, which will have delighted the police, MI5 and armed forces \u2014 and come as a huge relief to G4S. But the company's problems are far from over. The security firm generated all the wrong kind of headlines on the eve of the event, embarrassing ministers and forcing emergency statements in the House of Commons.</p> <p>The inquest at Westminster will begin next month, and MPs will be unforgiving.</p> <p>In all other respects, the security of the Games has been a success.</p> <p>Whitehall officials privately acknowledge that G4S's problems with recruitment and training were, in some ways, quite useful. They distracted attention from the potential terrorist threat, and gave the police and the armed forces a chance to restate their reputations as trusted public servants, a cut above the profit-motivated managers from the private sector.</p> <p>Fears about the over-militarisation of the games were also over-played. The sight of thousands of soldiers in khaki did not prove unsettling to the crowds at the Olympic venues. Quite the opposite.</p> <p>All the anecdotal evidence suggests their presence came as a welcome relief. And the troops seemed to enjoy the experience too, even though many had had to cancel holidays.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence likes nothing better than riding to the rescue at short-notice, while retaining a Uriah Heep-ish humbleness about doing so. In the shadows, MI5 has been paddling hard to stay ahead of potential problems, process intelligence and reassure agitated intelligence officials from other countries.</p> <p>A triumphant games for MI5 will be one in which it doesn't get written about at all. The service will not start to relax until after the Paralympics but so far, so good.</p> <p><strong>Economy</strong></p> <p>The prime minister and his government have tried to talk up the economic legacy of the Games. But the short-term impact of the Olympics on the economy can be summed up in three words: modest, temporary and localised. When combined with a bounceback in activity from the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee, the extra spending associated with the London Games will be enough to ensure that the UK will not suffer a fourth successive quarter of decline in the three months to September.</p> <p>But the boost, as the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, noted last week, is unlikely to be that big. Ticket sales and the sale of TV rights for the Olympics will be included in the third-quarter GDP figures, and should add 0.1 percentage points to growth.</p> <p>On top of that there will be the receipts from tourism and the additional spending from UK consumers. The early signs were not promising, with reports of empty hotels, deserted shops and tables to be had at London's poshest restaurants.</p> <p>As the Games have progressed, the picture has started to look brighter. John Lewis reported a 22% year on year increase in sales at their department stores, and detected a consumer feelgood factor across the country. Data for high street footfall showed a pick up in the number of shoppers and London hotel occupancy rates were up on a year ago.</p> <p>The John Lewis figures, however, display a marked north-south divide, with year on year sales up by a quarter in Poole and Croydon but by 5%</p> <p>in Glasgow and Newcastle. Ben May, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said he expected a 0.3% boost to real household spending from the Games in the third quarter (including ticket sales), but said this would be partly offset by lower spending later this year. \"Previous boosts to consumer confidence from one-off events have been fleeting,\" May said.</p> <p><strong>Transport</strong></p> <p>It's hard to credit already that Coe once thought transport \"the achilles heel\" of London's bid for the Games. Or that anyone would worry about jamming thousands of spectators into the creaking tube system, or have concerns over the capital's winding streets accommodating Zil lanes for Olympic VIPs.</p> <p>Not only did London ensure all athletes \u2013 and spectators \u2013 made it to the venues in time, even the predicted queues and crush failed to materialise. So successful was the \"big scare\", as some uncharitably dubbed Transport for London's information campaign, that those who did not either abandon or alter their commute reported the quietest journeys in memory.</p> <p>Yet while angry retailers spoke of ghost town London, TfL pointed to record overall numbers on the network, growing to a peak of 4.5m tube journeys on the Tuesday of the final week.</p> <p>The figures vindicate the strategy of Peter Hendy, the TfL commissioner responsible for most Olympic transport, who walked the line between bridling at suggestions that the capital would not cope and pushing the message that only the craziest commuter would plan to ride the Jubilee line as normal during the Games. Charts waved under the noses of employers since 2011 suggested gridlock at key stations if working patterns didn't change. Rush-hour commuters stayed away: as TfL puts it, they heeded the message and that kept London moving. Now Hendy hopes they will still listen for the Paralympics, after the holidays when underlying traffic will be higher.</p> <p>There was some good fortune. In the final days before the Games there were serious failures of key tube lines, and even the flagship Javelin service. But once the crowds arrived, only hiccups occurred.</p> <p>Luck, perhaps, but built like most Olympic success on long, extensive, thorough preparation. That included creating a new integrated control centre, getting staff and unions on side, extending capacity, issuing Travelcards to spectators to avoid ticket queues, drafting in volunteers and issuing constant information. Altogether, a transport system so easy the prime minister could use it.</p> <p><strong>Contributors Nick Hopkins, Gwyn Topham, Larry Elliott </strong></p>",

Fear of losing health coverage could turn out to be significant in swing states such as Florida, which has a large retired population.</p> <p>Romney ended speculation about his vice-presidential pick on Saturday morning when he announced at a rally in Norfolk, Virginia, that he had opted for Ryan over former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, Florida senator Marco Rubio and others on his short list.</p> <p>The Drudge Report had said at various times that former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and General David Petraeus had also been in the running.</p> <p>The choice of Ryan, 42, a congressman from Wisconsin for 14 years, marks a change in strategy by the Romney team.</p> <p>Until now, it has concentrated on presenting the November election as a vote on the incumbent, making Romney as small a target as possible by offering few policy details. Making Ryan his running mate changes that, providing a host of policy positions for the Democrats to attack.</p> <p>Murdoch, who tweeted last month after meeting Romney that he was unimpressed with the Republican candidate's campaign, expressed relief over the Ryan announcement. \"Thank God! Now we might have a real election on the great issues of the day. Paul Ryan almost perfect choice,\" Murdoch tweeted.</p> <p>Ryan's debt-reduction plan made him a hero of the Tea Party, whose emergence was inspired in part by the burgeoning federal debt.</p> <p>He is also a strong social conservative, having voted against legislation to end pay discrimination against woman and, according to the Democrats, opposed to abortion even in cases of rape or incest.</p> <p>The combination of fiscal and social conservatism has made him popular with a Republican base that remains sceptical about Romney's conservative credentials.</p> <p>Andrea Saul, a Republican spokeswoman, said the campaign had taken in $1.2m within hours of the announcement and a further $2.3m a day later.</p> <p>One of the Obama campaign's leading strategists, David Axelrod, described Ryan as a \"right-wing ideologue\" who is \"quite extreme\".</p> <p>Although Ryan was genial, his views were \"quite harsh\", Axelrod told CNN's State of the Union.</p> <p>\"It is a pick that is meant to thrill the most strident voices in the Republican Party, but it's one that should trouble everyone else,\" Axelrod said in another interview, on ABC. \"He's the guy who's the architect of a plan to end Medicare as we know it.\"</p> <p>Ed Gillespie, a Romney strategist and former chairman of the Republican national committee, acknowledged that Romney, as president, would have signed into law Ryan's budget plan but insisted it was not to kill off Medicare but \"to save it for future generations\".</p> <p>The Republican argument is that unless the spiralling cost of Medicare is dealt with, it will collapse.</p> <p>Gillespie said the choice of Ryan offered an opportunity for a national debate on big ideas rather than \"the little things\" the Obama campaign team has been pursuing.</p> <p>The Obama campaign has been calling for Romney to disclose his tax returns in line with previous presidential candidates and looking in detail at his record as chief executive at Bain Capital, the company in which he made his fortune.</p> <p>The timing of the Ryan announcement was odd, early on a Saturday morning rather than aimed at a prime-time television slot.</p> <p>The Romney campaign said it had been planned for Friday but the schedule had to be delayed because Ryan wanted to attend the Friday funeral of Sikhs killed in a mass shooting in his district in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2012.

We saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/31/boris-johnson-rupert-murdoch-olympics\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson entertaining Rupert Murdoch</a>, a sight to terrify any sensitive soul. We saw a smirking Tony Blair. But the most reticent visitor to the Olympics was the man who might be thought the begetter of the gold rush: Sir <a href=\"http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Major</a>.</p> <p>After the unknown soldier, they were burying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonar_Law\" title=\"\">\"the unknown prime minister\"</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith\" title=\"\">Herbert Asquith</a> quipped at the funeral of <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/andrew-bonar-law/\" title=\"\">Andrew Bonar Law</a>, and the tag sometimes seemed to apply to Major. His years at No 10 had the feeling of an awkward interruption between the tenures of Margaret Thatcher and Blair.</p> <p>A few months after Thatcher was deposed and replaced, I asked Enoch Powell what he thought of our new premier, and he replied in his eerie monotone: \"I simply find myself asking:&#xa0;does he really exist?\" Major was&#xa0;for years subjected to poisonous abuse in the rightwing press, his government plainly failed in some ways,&#xa0;and it all ended in an annihilating defeat at the 1997 election.</p> <p>And yet Major, though not a boastful man, had real achievements to take pride in, not the least of them the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/lottery\" title=\"\">national lottery</a>. Its proceeds have paid for any number of cultural projects, and transformed British sport. Money alone can't buy sporting victory, but it would have been quite impossible for Team GB to succeed as it has, on bikes, in boats, on horseback, or in track and field, without generous lottery seed money.</p> <p>These triumphs were far away when the Major government established the lottery, with 28p in the pound to go to good causes. At first Labour put up half-hearted opposition. \"Anti-gambling\" had once been almost as ardent a cause as temperance, but Labour were by now punch-drunk after losing four elections. And by the time <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/19/newsid_3702000/3702998.stm\" title=\"\">Noel Edmonds presented the first draw in November 1994</a>, and seven jackpot winners shared a modest prize of \u00a35.8m, the Labour leader was a man who taught his party to worship unbridled capitalism, the filthy rich or just plain money.</p> <p>And so New Labour wasn't in much of a position to criticise the lottery on the grounds that it exploited or corrupted. Indeed, the day would come when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4014673.stm\" title=\"\">Labour in office cheerfully agreed to the building of vast gambling emporiums</a>, which unquestionably do debase the poor, to a degree that has even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/05/labour-mistake-gambling-law-harman?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">led some former ministers to express remorse</a>. By the standards of mega-casinos, the lottery is a harmless flutter, much like the football pools, offering huge returns for small stakes (at preposterously long odds if one bothers to look).</p> <p>Most governments stagger from planned failure to unplanned success, and Major's was no exception. He pulled off a remarkable victory at the 1992 election, the only party leader before or since to gain more than 14m popular votes. Months later came the <em>d\u00e9gringolade</em>, when sterling was driven out of the European exchange rate mechanism. This destroyed the Tories' reputation for financial competence, led to their electoral rout at the next election \u2013 and was the salvation of the British economy, confirmed by Gordon Brown's one good deed: keeping out of the single currency. Even then, Major deserved more credit for holding his fratricidally fractious party together, before he left Downing Street with palpable relief the morning after the election and went to watch a cricket match at the Oval.</p> <p>Most prime ministerial memoirs are dire, from Harold Macmillan's leaden volumes to Thatcher's self-serving, largely ghost-written work. But Major's autobiography is a well-written, authentic, rather touching book. He followed it with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview10\" title=\"\">More Than a Game</a>, a surprisingly good history of cricket.</p> <p>No one is ever going to call Major a great man or a great premier. But apart form the fact that all sports fans should&#xa0;be grateful to him, he did his best in impossible circumstances, and behaved decently on the whole. His successors at Downing Street could have&#xa0;learned from that.</p>",
  "<p>A former Israeli soldier is to serve 45 days in prison on charges in connection with the deaths of a Palestinian mother and daughter who were shot while waving white flags during the three-week war in Gaza in 2008-09.</p> <p>The ex-soldier, who has not been named, agreed to a plea bargain under which he was convicted of shooting without permission, and the original manslaughter charge dropped. He was the only soldier to be indicted for manslaughter as a result of Operation Cast Lead, in which around 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed.</p> <p>According to reports and testimonies at the time, Majda Abu Hajaj, 35, and her mother, Rayah, 64, were among 30 people, including children, trying to leave a house where they had taken shelter. The group was fired on and the two women were killed.</p> <p>In a statement issued at the time of indictment two years ago, the Israeli military said the charge was based on evidence that the former soldier, a marksman, \"deliberately targeted an individual walking with a group of people waving a white flag without being ordered or authorised to do so\".</p> <p>According to the ex-soldier's lawyer, there was no conclusive proof to show his client had shot the women.</p> <p>Human rights groups, which say dozens of civilians were killed unlawfully during the conflict, have criticised the Israeli Defence Forces for conducting its own investigations into allegations of wrongdoing.</p> <p>The killing of the two women was recorded in the United Nations-commissioned Goldstone Report, published in September 2009, which accused Israel of war crimes during the conflict.</p>",
  "<p>A former recruiter for an extreme Islamist organisation has described how he has diverted his \"transferable skills\" of \"organising, propagandising and preaching\" to persuading the young people of Pakistan of the virtues of democracy and human rights.</p> <p>Essex-raised Maajid Nawaz claims he became drawn to extreme Islamism after an encounter with members of the far-right group Combat 18 and reports of the massacre of Muslims at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war. He went on to \"recruit army officers\" in Pakistan to the Hizb ut-Tahrir cause and organised branches of the organisation in Egypt and Denmark while he was a student at the University of London in the 1990s.</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international book festival</a> on Sunday, Nawaz told how, after the September 11 attacks, he was arrested by the Egyptian security services and imprisoned for four years.</p> <p>He had been spending a year in Egypt while a student at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London. While there, he became the head of the Alexandria chapter of Hizb ut-Tahrir.</p> <p>He was held in Mazrah Tora, among prisoners ranging from jihadists to homosexuals to the assassins of Sadat. It was here, in the cells now occupied by the former president, Hosni Mubarak, among others, that he received his \"real political education\" and \"came to re-evaluate everything I stood for\".</p> <p>Nawaz, who has written of his experiences in his memoir, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Radical-ebook/dp/B007NG95SC\" title=\"\">Radical</a>, told how in the 1990s the British government and security services were \"caught completely unawares\" by the radicalisation of large numbers of Muslim teenagers and young people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, \"the liberal left, because they did not want to be seen as racist and did not realise the difference between multiculturalism and totalitarianism parading as a religion, were ill-equipped to deal with it.\" He added: \"I disagree with most of what [the commentator and author] Melanie Phillips says, but she was right when she said that London became Londonistan,\" he said.</p> <p>After his release from prison, Nawaz co-founded an organisation in Pakistan called <a href=\"http://www.khudipakistan.com/\" title=\"\">Khudi</a>, which aims to recruit young people to democracy \u2013 \"a democrats' version of the Muslim Brotherhood\", he said. \"The neo-Conservatives got it wrong,\" he added. \"You can't impose democracy down the barrel of a gun. That's the supply-led approach. You need a demand-led, grassroots approach.\" He hopes to spread the organisation to other nations, including Somalia. \"Hopefully, if I don't get shot first, it will succeed.\"</p>",
  "<p>An initiative to flag potential terrorist threats at an Boston airport has led to to widespread racial profiling of passengers, it was reported Sunday.</p> <p>A report by the New York Times found that more than 30 federal officers involved in the \"behaviour detection\" programme at Logan International Airport said that the operation targets black and Hispanic people as well as those of a Middle Eastern appearance.</p> <p>The claims will come as an embarrassment to air security chiefs, who had been touting the initiative as a model for transport hubs across the US. It also comes at time when the Obama administration has attacked the use of racial profiling by law enforcement authorities in Arizona and elsewhere.</p> <p>The programme was brought in to allow officers to stop, search and question passengers deemed to be acting suspiciously.</p> <p>Under the initiative, specially trained \"assessors\" would monitor security lines at check-ins and pull aside those observed to be displaying tell-tale signs \u2013 such as avoiding eye contact, fidgeting or sweating.</p> <p>Passengers considered suspicious are then taken away for more intensive questioning.</p> <p>But the system has led to de facto racial profiling, it is claimed. Thirty-two officers have submitted written complaints to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) over the targeting of minorities by colleagues.</p> <p>Some of the stop and searches were the result of pressure from manager who hoped that it would lead to the discovery of drugs, outstanding arrest warrants and fraudulent immigration documents.</p> <p>As a result, assessors have been looking for people who fit certain profiles \u2013 such as Hispanics travelling to Miami, or black people wearing baseball caps backwards, it is claimed.</p> <p>\"They just pull aside anyone who they don't like the way they look \u2013 if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewellery, or if they are Hispanic,\" one white officer told the New York Times.</p> <p>In an anonymous complaint to the TSA obtained by the newspaper, an officer wrote: \"The behaviour detection program is no longer a behaviour-based program, but it is a racial profiling program.\"</p> <p>Passengers have also complained of the seemingly discriminatory practice.</p> <p>Kenneth Boatner, a black psychologist and educational consultant, was detained for nearly half an hour while attempting to travel to Atlanta on business last month. Agents examined belongings \u2013 including patients' clinical notes \u2013 after singling him out.</p> <p>In an interview with the New York Times, Boatner said he felt humiliated and that the officers never explained why he had been targeted.</p> <p>But he suspected it was because of his race and attire \u2013 he was wearing sweat pants, a white T-shirt and high-top sneakers at the time.</p> <p>\"I had never been subjected to anything like that,\" Boatner said.</p> <p>In a statement, the TSA said the programme at Logan \"in no way encourages or tolerates profiling\" and that passengers are not allowed to be pulled aside based on their nationality, race, ethnicity or religion.</p> <p>\"If any of these claims prove accurate, we will take immediate and decisive action to ensure there are consequences to such activity,\" the agency added.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <blockquote> <p>An Everton club statement confirmed: \"The midfielder is set to undergo a medical with the Premier League champions on Sunday.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>In the meantime, Manchester City have only gone and agreed an undisclosed fee with Everton <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/12/manchester-city-everton-jack-rodwell\">to sign midfielder Jack Rodwell</a>:</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Too soon? Probably but I'm sure most fans of Chelsea and Manchester City won't be thinking that way. City, of course, played in last year's Community Shield as the FA Cup holders, losing 3-2 to the neigbours. Their last victory in this match came at this ground in 1972 when Derby and Leeds turned down the FA's invitations to play and Francis Lee's penalty defeated Aston Villa 1-0. Chelsea's last win came in 2009, beating Manchester United on penalties.</p> <p>It has been a contrasting summer of recruitment for both clubs \u2013 Chelsea spending more than \u00a360m on Eden and Thorgan Hazard, Oscar and Marko Marin, City spending nowt till today, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/aug/10/roberto-mancini-manchester-city-trading\">much to the ire of Roberto Mancini</a>. He'll be pleased to hear that Everton have agreed to sell him <strong>Jack Rodwell</strong> for \u00a320m. Rodwell won't play, it's too soon, but neither will Joe Hart who has back knack nor David Silva and Mario Balotelli who only resumed training a fortnight back. </p> <p>Each side won 2-1 at home last season in this fixture, which tells us little. Brian Mullen is one absentee. \"At rhythmic gymnastics at Wembley Arena,\" he writes. \"Missing the match. Not happy.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Your starting XIs:<br>Chelsea:</strong> (4-2-3-1) Cech, Ivanovic, Luiz, Terry, Cole; Lampard, Mikel; Ramires, Mata, Hazard,; Torres. <br><strong>Man City</strong> (3-4-3) Pantilimon; Savic, Kompany, Zabaleta; Milner, De Jong, Y Tour\u00e9, Kolarov; Nasri, Ag\u00fcero, Tevez.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>City teams correction \u2013 now amended</strong><br>City start with Kolarov, not Clichy. Sorry, got blindsided by rogue official tweet. <br>Substitutes:<br><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Turnbull, Essien, Meireles, Sturridge, Cahill, Bertrand, Piazon.<br><strong>City:</strong> Holmen Johansen, Dzeko, Adam Johnson, Silva, Clichy, Toure, Razak. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Kevin Friend (Leicestershire)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Another debutant: </strong>ITV field new signing Lee Dixon, a canny bit of recruitment. Does this mean Robbie Savage will be elevated as the first choice punditry sub for Match of the Day when one of the Alans is off?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Give your head a shake:</strong> Me. Torres in both teams. The shame. I meant Tevez. This game shall be my penance.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Out come the teams:</strong> City in their new burgundy away kit. They've been introduced to David Bernstein, former City chairman, in his role at the FA. The anthem has been sung. Off we go to an ad break \u2026</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> City kick off and Luiz intercepts a mishit rolled pass from Nasri to move Chelsea forward, first up the left and then backwards and up the other flank. City win the ball back after a Chelsea free-kick just inside City's half.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Nasri skips his way through the inside-right channel, wriggling past Luiz until Cole steps in. Kolarov crosses and the ball comes out to the left where Luiz concedes the foul right at the corner of the box. Tevez curls in a shot at the left post that Cech parries to his right and Chelsea get hold of it at the second attempt.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Luiz cuts out what could have been a very dangerous dinked through ball up the middle from Yaya Tour\u00e9 and knocks the ball up to Torres. Zabaleta slides in to tackle him, pushing the ball wide to Lampard and Zabaleta has another bite, sliding in again and giving away the free kick.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> A strong challenge from De Jong stalls Chelsea's progress but they shuffle the ball out to Hazard who the referee thinks goes to ground too easily when he controls it and tries to cut infield before the tackle. Then Luiz evens up the foul count.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Corner to City, taken by Nasri, to the far post where Ivanovic back-heads it out for another. Kolarov takes this one, puts it on Savic's head who connects well but Luiz blocks and Chelsea clear their lines.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> City are looking slick and confident over the first 10 minutes in central midfield, Nasri buzzing about and Tevez dropping deep, too, taking advantage of Mikel's dithering. Tevez has just been robbed by Terry. Savic is booked for a heel-clipper from behind on Hazard on halfway.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> City fans are baiting John Terry while Mata lines up a free kick wide on the right and 35 yards from goal that goes nowhere. \"I assumed (as I'm sure others did) that your bungled team selection was a clever commentary on the effectiveness, or otherwise, of Torres,\" writes Matt Dony. \"Depending on his mood, he could pretty much be playing for either team!\" I'm not that clever, Matt, though he is looking pretty isolated so far.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Milner's doing OK wide on the right. They keep calling him a wing-back but I'm not sure that's accurate in a 3-4-3, 3-4-1-2. Where's Wilson?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Opening for City, strangled by Ag\u00fcero's hesitancy in slipping it through to Nasri as he cut into the box from the left, which allowed Cech to dive and smother the prodded shot.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Another City corner, viciously inswinging from Kolarov, hit so hard that it was almost a shot. Cech backpedals and swipes it away for another with his palm. \"If there are any empty seats can we blame the greater attraction of rhythmic gymnastics?\" asks Ian Copestake. There are a fair few, Ian. And we can.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> City, champions, and ready to be crowned corner kings have just had another, swung in by Milner on to Kompany's head who flicks it straight at Cech. Up the other end, Hazard essays a flashy backheel that doesn't come off and the City fans laugh uproariously. A propos of which, here's Colin Ward: \"I feel grubby inside for watching the Community Shield today when the weather's good and there's 'proper sport' (\u00a9 London 2012) on the other channel. I haven't seen that much of Eden Hazard before today, but is he just an ever-so-slightly better, younger - and Belgian - version of Joe Cole?\" Bloody hell, that was quick, Colin.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Important tackle from De Jong, not his first today, tees up Milner who hits an early diagonal cross towards the penalty spot where Ag\u00fcero has made a subtle run but glances it wide on the dive.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Chelsea create their best chance through Ramires, who does everything right down the right flank, except his centre, which is a fraction behind the run of Lampard. The midfielder manages to check and shoot bit if it had have been rolled into his path that probably would have been a goal, against the run of play.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Chelsea corner after a good pass on the run from Hazard switches play to Ivanovic on the right. His cross is strong and too deep but Milner is taking no chances and glances it behind. Chelsea take the corner short but City crowd them out on the flank.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Shot on the run from Hazard, cutting in from the left on to his right foot when Cole's clever overlapping run drew Milner and Savic to open the space. He belts it from 25 yards and it skims across the turf, bouncing three times into the hands of the City goalkeeper whose name I can't spell without checking.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Cut back from Nasri who is in a free role and making inroads between the centre-halfs and full-backs, to Tevez whose shot from 15 yards is blocked by Terry.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> \"Can we take it that there is still resistance from the football mbm-ers to the swanky new technologically advanced mbm format as used during the Olympics (and for a while now on other parts of the site)?\" asks Cian Mulligan. It won't be long, I'm told \u2026 but I don't know why we're starting the season in the old style. Chelsea fans sing: \"We are the champions, champions of Europe.\" Accurately but WACCOErs won't be chuffed.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Chelsea have been more prominent going forward this past five minutes, Hazard and Mata linking up well and looking for Ramires to burst into the box from the right. One overhit hooked pass over the top just eludes Mata before Pantilimon runs out to snaffle it.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Chelsea 1-0 Man City (Torres)</strong> Ramires cuts across the box from right to left then spins the ball back out to the right, three yards inside the box with the outside of his right foot. Mata either dummied it or minimally flicked it on and Torres finished beautifully with the outside of his left foot.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Red card!! Chelsea's Ivanovic is sent off</strong> A sliding tackle, and he clips Kolarov, knocking him off his feet. Reckiless or excessive force? Andy Townsend thinks neither. A minute earlier Savic looked to have brought down Torres and he was on a booking but the ref gave it the other way.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min: </strong> As we're in old school mbm mode <strong>you might have to hit f5 or refresh</strong> to get those last two descriptions. Milner takes the free kick from the left, 25 yards from goal, and tamely loops a shot into Cech's hands.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Lampard now gets his name into the book for a sliding foul on Milner when the ball had gone and Lampard lifted his foot. Townsend thinks the red card is \"a shame\" and that he won the ball. Not the point. I'll have to look at it again but on one look I thought it was justified. His left leg went studs first into Kolarov's shin.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half time: </strong> Back in a few minutes. Go watch <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/olympic-boxing-joshua-evans-livehttp://\">the boxing</a> with Smelling Salts Baz.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>The sending off verdict: </strong>Lee Dixon and Gareth Southgate both agree that Ivanovic deserved it. \"The referee's name is Friend,\" writes Rotimi Obisesan. \"But with the number of cards issued in first half already, is he really a friend?\" What's this, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiQzUEc_FmI\">Golden Girls</a>?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min: </strong><strong>Substitution for City at half-time</strong>. <strong>Clichy on for Savic</strong>. Zabaleta moves over to the right of the back three. Ramires, who is playing at right-back since Ivanovic's expulsion hooks a pass up and over Kolarov on the right but Clichy reads it and blocks the advance.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Torres goes storming through the middle, toes it beyond Clichy and beats the City defender to the ball on the run then skews his shot.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>48 min: </strong>Torres gets the better of De Jong who tries to grapple him off the ball from behind and then Kompany decides to stop his marauding run by stepping into him and gets booked for the naked bodycheck.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>50 min: </strong>Cole brings down Milner on the right of City's attack. Kolarov takes the free-kick, curling it beyond the back post. \"What exactly <em>would</em> Andy Townsend give a red for?\" asks Adrian Miller. \"Would Kolarov have to be out for six months first?\" I know \u2013 he's flaming ridiculous.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Chelsea 1-1 Man City (Yaya Tour\u00e9)</strong> Tour\u00e9 finds Milner with a fine pass out to the right touchline for the Yorkshireman to run on to. Milner's cut-back cross is intercepted by Terry on the slide and he deflects the ball to Tour\u00e9 who shifts it wide of Luiz on to his right foot and whips his shot from 20 yards past Cech. Excellent finish.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Nasri is all over the place, in a good way, popping up now on the left and chipping a cross into the centre for Milner to meet but Cech is wise to the run and marshals his defences to block.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Chelsea 1-2 Man City (Tevez)</strong> The ball is tapped to him on the left corner of the penalty area and he opens his body to move it across the 18-yard line, getting shooting space ahead of Luiz and he spanks it home from the middle of the goal. He lifts his shirt to show the legend Fuerte Apache, his home.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Refresh if the goal descriptions aren't showing. Cole fouls Tevez. \"No need for that,\" says Townsend, censoriously for him. City shovel it backwards , having taken a decisive grip on the game in the second half. \"Townsend or Beglin,\" asks Paul Ruffley. \"Neither adds anything to the commentary, but I enjoy Townsend more because I quite like shouting at the telly.\" Ha.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Chelsea 1-3 Man City (Nasri)</strong> That's City's third in 14 minutes. Without a proper right-back, Kolarov makes hay down the left, crosses it in to Nasri who steers it in past Cech.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Ashley Cole is told by Kevin Friend to calm down after another lunge should have brought him his second yellow card. Nasri tries to score the goal of the season with a left-foot volley from a bobble off the chest of Ramires from a corner and slices it wildly.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Poznan alert. City fans bounce after singing \"we score when we like\". Chelsea look tired, Cole especially, passing straight to De Jong to set up Tour\u00e9 almost to free Milner or Ag\u00fcero for a run on goal.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> <strong>Chelsea substitution</strong>. Hazard off, Bertrand on.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Very interesting this City formation at the back. At times Kompany is in the middle of the pitch with Zabaleta and Clichy pushed up high on the touchlines in a V shape. That allows De Jong and Tour\u00e9 to slot in alongside him when Chelsea break, rather than Kolarov and Milner, as Clive Tyldesley maintains, as orthodox wing-backs. Well, that's my take any way.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Chelsea substitution. Mata off, Strurridge, the former City man on, greeted by predictable \"one greedy ba$tard\" choruses.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> City substitution. David Silva for Samir Nasri.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Lampard, who has already been booked, gets a life when he should have had a second for thrashing Milner's shins with his right studs when the ball had gone.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>GOAL!! Chelsea 2-3 Man City (Bertrand)</strong> An assist from Pantilimon. Sturridge hits a powerful shot from the edge of the area, from the left across goal. The keeper dived to smother and the ball squirmed out of his grasp to the right where Bertrand leapt in to knock it into the net. The keeper and Bertrand are booked for a wrestle for the ball after the goal.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Chelsea corner after a good cross from Cole, the space made for him by a decent overlapping run from Bertrand. The corner breaks down when Bertrand slips in the box when Sturridge cuts it back to him with his back to goal.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> \"Lampard gets a life?\" asks Philip Podolsky. \"As a Daily Mail reader I thought he already had one.\" B'dum tish. Sir Geoff Hurst names Yaya Tour\u00e9 as the man of the match. Chelsea keep fighting and Sturridge looks lively and, on this evidence, less selfish than last season.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Barry Praag lights the fuse \u2026 and seeing I'm out of here in five minutes, here goes: \"Just think what we would have done to them if we had Ivan on the pitch. Lucky, lucky, lucky, City.\" But \u2026 but \u2026 but \u2026 but \u2026 but. He deserved to get sent off. It was entirely his fault.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Now City defend with wing-backs, a line of five as the clock ticks down. Sturridge crosses from the right to the far post and erans a corner. Up comes Cech. Pantilimon catches it and launches it \u2013 Ramires blocks Silva to kill the attack with Cech out of goal. He's been booked too \u2013 that's four Chelsea could have had sent off if friendly Kev had been consistent and Savic for City in the first-half.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Full time:</strong> City have won the Community Shield. They played very well in the second half against 10-man Chelsea to score three goals, Nasri took up some great positions and Tevez and Ag\u00fcero linked well but Chelsea also showed signs that they have added more guile in Hazard to their fortitude and Sturridge looks to have kicked on. It was an enjoyable match despite the inconsistent refereeing.</p>",
  "<p>Two Afghan policemen have shot dead a senior commander and eight other officers, the latest in a string of attacks by rogue security forces that are poisoning efforts to build up the police and army as foreign troops head home.</p> <p>The attack in south-western Nimruz province near the Iranian border on Saturday was the fifth in less than a week to involve men in uniform turning on their comrades or foreign trainers.</p> <p>The attackers were local men who had only signed up for the police three months ago, said Shakila Hakimi, head of the Nimruz provincial council. In an added twist, the pair targeted the man who had vouched for their trustworthiness, the provincial head of criminal investigations, Abdul Hadi Azizi, said.</p> <p>Mohammad Eesa was based in the provincial capital, but was making a brief visit to the troubled Delaram district to discuss the security situation, he said. \"These two man came yesterday because they knew Eesa and through him had been introduced to the district police chief and got their weapons and uniform,\" Azizi said by phone, after visiting the site of the shooting.</p> <p>The men opened fire in the yard of the district police chief's office, killing Eesa and eight others, and wounding another man before they were themselves shot, he added. \"This was a very sophisticated effort by the insurgents,\" Azizi said. \"Eesa was a good guy, very honest. He was cheated by these two guys as he didn't know they had a connection with the Taliban.\"</p> <p>The insurgent group claimed credit for the attack, which came just a day after policemen shot dead six US soldiers in neighbouring Helmand province.</p> <p>It was the bloodiest single day for foreign troops in the province since six British soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in early March, and a grim reminder of the growing threat foreign forces face not just from the Taliban but also from their supposed allies.</p> <p>Three US Marine Corps special operations troops were shot dead early on Friday in Sangin district, a northern corner of the province that has seen heavy fighting. The killers were an Afghan police commander and some of his men, who had invited the US officers to join them for a meal and to discuss security.</p> <p>In the evening, an Afghan policeman shot dead a further three US soldiers as they exercised on a joint base about 40 miles south-west of the provincial capital.</p> <p>On Tuesday, two Afghan soldiers killed a US soldier and injured two others in eastern Paktia province, and on Thursday two other Afghan soldiers opened fire on a group outside another base in the east, although the only person killed was one of the gunmen.</p> <p>So far this year 37 foreign soldiers and military contractors have been killed in 27 such attacks, far more than in 2011. They have become such a commonplace threat that foreign units working with Afghan forces are often watched by armed \"guardian angels\" from their own ranks.</p> <p>In a sign of growing concern, President Hamid Karzai issued a rare condemnation of the deaths of foreign soldiers, and ordered an investigation into shootings in Helmand and Paktia. \"The enemy \u2026 does not want to see Afghanistan have a strong security force, targets military trainers,\" Karzai said in a statement that described the gunmen as \"terrorists in Afghan security uniform\".</p> <p>Nato commanders argue that the attackers account for a tiny portion of security forces, now more than 300,000 strong, and say many are driven by personal grudges rather than loyalty to the Taliban or other insurgent groups.</p> <p>But the shootings are disproportionately damaging to morale, and in some ways the attacks on Afghans from within their own forces are more worrying than the attacks on foreign forces.</p> <p>The Nato trainers will eventually head home, leaving the Afghan police and army to fight a hardened insurgency, a challenge that will be made much tougher by mistrust in their own ranks.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1 Laura Trott</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The 20-year-old-cyclist from Cheshunt in Hertfordshire took gold in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/07/laura-trott-olympic-omnium\" title=\"\">women's omnium</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/04/jo-rowsell-laura-trott-dani-king\" title=\"\">women's team pursuit</a> to make herself out as an heir to Victoria Pendleton and Sir Chris Hoy. Trott, who has overcome asthma and other health problems to pursue her sporting career, said she was still struggling to come to terms with her double victory. \"It still feels totally surreal for me, I still can't believe this is happening, I'm just a 10-year-old kid,\" she said.</p> <h2><strong>2 Missy Franklin</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>As the Michael Phelps era draws to a close, so the Franklin one begins. The 17-year-old from Pasadena, California, took four golds at her first Games to mark herself out as one of the truly great young Olympians. \"I honestly couldn't think of a better way to end it; that was so perfect in every way,\" Franklin said after taking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/missy-franklin-olympic-gold-swim\" title=\"\">her fourth gold</a> in the women's 4x100m medley relay. \"I've learned so much from this experience and I can't wait to take that home with&#xa0;me.\"</p> <h2><strong>3 Lawrence Okoye</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The 20-year-old Briton may have finished last in the discus final, but then he only took up the discipline two years ago \u2013 and for a thrower of his age, his talent is prodigious. Okoye deferred a place to study law at Oxford and gave up&#xa0;his rugby union career at London Irish to dedicate himself to preparing for the London Games. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/britain-lawrence-okoye-olympic-discus-final\" title=\"\">65.28m he threw in qualifying</a> ranked him fourth&#xa0;going into the final, but he could not get within four metres of that in the&#xa0;final.</p> <h2><strong>4 Katarina Johnson-Thompson</strong></h2> <p>The 19-year-old heptathlete from Liverpool was overshadowed by more famous members of the team, but finished 15th in a personal best of 6,267 in her first senior competition. Parallels have been drawn with Jessica Ennis and her prospects for Rio look very good. It is a comparison she is keen to live up to. \"[Watching] Jess coming through the line and seeing her so emotional and the crowd giving her a standing ovation; that's something I want in the future,\" she said.</p> <h2><strong>5 Ye Shiwen</strong></h2> <p>Despite the controversy that greeted her stunning, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/02/olympics-2012-ye-shiwen-400-medley-statistics-data\" title=\"\">record-breaking win</a> in the 400m individual medley, the 16\u2011year-old Chinese swimmer has been one of the great performers of the Games, shrugging off the criticism and winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/ye-shiwen-200m-medley-gold\" title=\"\">another gold</a> in the women's 200m medley. She also took to her Sina Weibo microblog to take a sarcastic dig at those who had questioned her achievements. \"A really big thanks to everyone for their support! Including the doubts from the Western media!\" she wrote.</p> <h2><strong>6 Ruta Meilutyte</strong></h2> <p>The 15-year-old Lithuanian, who attends the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/31/plymouth-college-ruta-meilutyte-olympics\" title=\"\">same school</a> as the British diver Tom Daley, saw off a vastly more experienced field to win the women's 100m breaststroke title. Meilutyte, who bagged her home country its very first Olympic swimming medal, showed a mix of skill and hunger far beyond her tender years. \"I can't believe it; it's too much for me,\" she said of her win. \"It was hard and difficult. At the moment I can't speak too much but it means a lot to me and I am so proud.\"</p> <h2><strong>7 Katie Ledecky</strong></h2> <p>Like her fellow teenage prodigy Ye Shiwen, Ledecky also had to cope with accusations of doping after her astonishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/03/katie-ledecky-rebecca-adlington-bronze-olympic\" title=\"\">win in the 800m freestyle</a> final. The 15-year-old from near Washington DC powered past Rebecca Adlington to finish in 8min 14.63sec \u2013 the second fastest time in history behind only Adlington's world record from Beijing. \"She is unbelievable,\" Adlington said after the race. \"She has such a good career in front of her.\"</p> <h2><strong>8 Gabby Douglas</strong></h2> <p>The 4ft 11in, 16-year-old Douglas \u2013 aka the Flying Squirrel \u2013 made history by becoming the first African-American to win an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/02/gabrielle-douglas-london-2012-gymnastics-gold\" title=\"\">all-around gymnastic gold</a>. She also helped the USA to gold in the women's team event. \"I've always wanted to inspire people,\" she said later. \"And the thing about the Olympics, this quote 'inspire a generation' \u2013 so, you know, I can check that off my bucket&#xa0;list.\"</p> <h2><strong>9 Robeisy Ram\u00edrez Carrazana</strong></h2> <p>The teenage Cuban flyweight fought his way to gold against Mongolia's Tugstsogt Nyambayar with a mixture of charm and skill. The 18-year-old southpaw, who brought relief to Cuba when he delivered their first Olympic boxing title since Athens eight years ago, laughed off the pressure of carrying a nation's hopes. \"We know the Olympics are the biggest show on earth when it comes to sporting events,\" he said. \"But when you're in the ring everything is the same, you could be anywhere.\"</p> <h2><strong>10 Nicola Adams</strong></h2> <p>The 29-year-old former EastEnders extra made history by becoming the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/09/nicola-adams-olympic-gold\" title=\"\">first female Olympic boxing champion</a>, beating China's Cancan Ren \u2013 and then declaring her intention to celebrate by going for a Nando's. She is already looking to Rio. \"I'll be only 33 then and the women's game will be even bigger, with talk of there being six weight divisions rather than the three we had at London 2012,\" she said. \"And Nicola Adams, double Olympic champion, has a nice ring to it.\"</p>",

  "<p>Like lots of people, I never thought I'd be a teacher when I was at school. To be honest, I only did my training because my husband was on a four-year course and I was on a three-year course at Cardiff University, so I wanted to do something for one year. I thought doing a teaching qualification would be interesting and might be quite useful.</p> <p>My first teaching practice, as part of the course, was in a primary school for three weeks. Although it was fun, the kids were running wild. I didn't feel I could control them and I thought: \"this is hopeless - I just can't do this\".</p> <p>But when I went into a secondary classroom, to teach my own subject, it was a completely different experience. Passing on a love of literature was wonderful, and I realised that I could never be bored teaching with so much variety in the job. Teaching itself is never boring - the kids are so entertaining, they always surprise you.</p> <p>I'm convinced that nothing else I might have done would have given me so much pleasure and satisfaction, or fitted in so well with family life.</p> <p>When I retire, in just a few years time, I can look back on a career which made a positive difference to the lives of thousands of children. Few other career choices can be so rewarding; so if you have a love of your subject, and want the opportunity to pass that on, then teaching can be a great career.</p> <p>It was completely different then, of course. I trained 30 years ago and in the first 20 years of my career I was observed just once \u2013 and that includes my probation year. In those days the classroom was your kingdom. There really was very little direction and no such thing as a formulaic approach. You were left to your own devices to sink or swim.</p> <p>Now, there's so much more direction from outside and there's good and bad in that. It's created more standardisation; certainly teachers who aren't putting effort in will be forced out.</p> <p>Anyone going into teaching now will be used to teaching to formal work schemes and observation. I think it has raised standards in the profession but, personally, I feel the loss in the classroom. I've got the confidence of 30 years experience. I've seen new approaches come and go; sometimes even identical 'new ideas' come and go more than once.</p> <p>For me, it's the passion for your subject and interest in the success of your students that matters more than how all the acronyms add up. This is what will make you a good teacher. There's still room for individuals but you have to have the confidence and passion for your subject to make it work.</p> <p>The major challenge in teaching is time; there's not enough of it. It's hard if you're working full time to cope with the marking and feel like you have enough time to do your job properly. I've worked part time ever since I had children. I officially work three days a week, but on my two days off I always work. It probably all adds up to what counts as a full-week's work in most other jobs but the pay isn't bad, so you can work part time and then the job really does fit in with family life. There are shortcuts to save time and if I had to work full time I'd have to use them. But working part time gives me the luxury to be a fussy marker. It can take two hours to mark a 3,000 word A-level essay, so if you have 16 pupils that's 32 hours of marking in one week for just one class. One of the benefits of being a part-time teacher is that I do have time to mark properly. Sometimes my feedback is almost as long as their essay but I really want the kids to do well.</p> <p>One of the best things about teaching is you get to raise children's aspirations and make a difference in their lives. You get visits and emails from your old students to prove it. It's great to make the difference and, as they say, it does make it all worthwhile.</p> <p>The core of teaching is the subject and the pupils. We have a lot of NQTs and PGCE students coming to our school and sometimes I must admit to being disappointed when students don't know their subjects that well. I had an NQT who was teaching Animal Farm who asked me \"What's Marxism?\" She'd got a first in her degree, so it just goes to show that government initiatives to try and attract those with firsts aren't necessarily going work.</p> <p>After teaching for 20 years in one school, I've got a reputation. I think I'm known for having high expectations and high standards and pushing my students. Of course some like being pushed and some don't, so there are always challenges.</p> <p>But generally - when I'm teaching poetry, for example - I'll get kids moaning in the beginning but, a high percentage of the time, when we've finished they'll have found some stuff they like and connect to. That is just as rewarding for me as great A-level results. I can't bear to think that any child will go through their lives not knowing how great literature can affect them, that they can see the world through someone's eyes. They might be living in Chelmsford but they can learn what it's like being an immigrant moving to London through reading a book. Reading for pleasure is such a wonderful thing.</p> <p>Lots of people drop out of teaching after a couple of years, it is an exhausting job. So my advice to those just starting out is:</p> <p>\u2022 Don't lose your sense of proportion over things that happen in the classroom or in an observation that doesn't go well. As long as in the bigger picture of things you are connecting with kids and the subject, don't get disheartened. Even after 30 years of teaching everyone has appalling days when you think: \"Can I really do this?\" You've got to keep positive, it's only a problem if you get more bad days than good days.</p> <p>\u2022 Make sure teaching doesn't overwhelm you. You have to develop strategies especially if you are teaching a subject which requires a lot of marking. So plan things well. Get your pupils to do peer marking, which really can work. If you know you just can't handle any more marking in a particular week, get pupils to write a speech and then perform it in the next class. You've got to think ahead about times of maximum workload and plan accordingly - ask your more experienced colleagues for advice.</p> <p>\u2022 You've got to keep your sense of humour; it's a great way of defusing a situation. I know I became a better teacher when I became a parent. I realised that kids can be so obnoxious sometimes, even your own kids. They don't mean it, they're just being kids. It doesn't mean they hate you or hate your lessons. When you're a new teacher coming into teaching, especially if you are young, you think of the students as almost your adversaries, you've got to defeat them. But you've got to be careful what you say. You can't belittle them too much or you can really harm them.</p> <p>\u2022 Love your subject. If you are going to succeed in secondary school teaching you must love your subject, the kids really know if you do or don't.</p> <p>\u2022 You have to know your students are individuals, they learn in different ways, you have to be sensitive to that.</p> <p>\u2022 You can't just teach to a formula. I do worry about the divergence between lip service to what the government say it's supposed to be like and what it's really like. I do hate the hypocrisy of that, and the gulf seems to widen more and more. It feels like what matters most is what's tested. The trouble is, nothing that is really worthwhile can be tested. So the love of learning, connection with literature, having empathy \u2013 these are the things that really make a difference to someone's life but of course they can't be tested. Young teachers have to be careful not to get lost in formulas and initiatives. A more experienced teacher will have confidence to respond to kids and to talk about an issue that's raised in class that's not on the plan. The children will learn so much from that but there's no box to tick.</p> <p>Julia Frascona teaches English at <a href=\"http://www.boswells.essex.sch.uk/\">The Boswell's School</a> in Chelmsford where she is also joint head of the library.</p> <p>Interview by Emily Drabble.

  "<p>An Afghan police officer has killed at least 10 of his fellow officers, a day after six US service members were shot dead by their Afghan partners.</p> <p>Shakila Hakimi, a member of the Nimroz provincial council, said the policeman who opened fire on his colleagues at a checkpoint in Dilaram district on Saturday was believed to have had ties to militants. He was killed in an ensuing gun battle, she said in a telephone call from the provincial capital of Zaranj, along Afghanistan's western border with Iran.</p> <p>\"The checkpoint is in a remote area of a remote district,\" Hakimi said. \"The telecommunications are poor and we are not able to get more details.\"</p> <p>Hakimi said the provincial governor has sent a team to the scene to get more details about what happened.</p> <p>On Friday six US soldiers were shot dead by Afghans, including police, in southern Helmand province \u2013 a grim reminder of the growing threat foreign forces face not just from the Taliban but also from their supposed allies. It was the bloodiest single day for foreign troops in the province since six British soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in early March.</p> <p>Three US Marine Corps special operations troops were shot dead in the early hours of Friday morning in Sangin district, a northern corner of the province that has seen heavy fighting. The killers were an Afghan police commander and some of his men, who had invited the US officers to join them for a meal and to discuss security, Afghan officials said.</p> <p>Then in the evening an Afghan man shot dead three other foreign soldiers who worked on a joint base with him, the Nato-led coalition said. It does not reveal nationalities of soldiers killed during operations but Afghan officials said the men were from the US.</p> <p>\"The attack happened in police headquarters of Garmser,\" said Daoud Ahmadi, spokesman for the provincial governor, referring to a district about 40 miles (60km) south-west of the provincial capital. One other foreign soldier was also injured, he added.</p> <p>The Taliban has claimed reponsibility for the attack. \"Last night after prayer time around 9pm they were just coming out of the mosque and a policeman opened fire on the Americans outside the district police headquarters,\" said Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadi.</p> <p>The shooter was arrested, Nato said, but added that he was not wearing a uniform at the time of the attack, leaving open the possibility he was a civilian employee on the base. But Farid Farhang, spokesman for the provincial police chief, said the man was from a much-criticised auxiliary police unit usually trained by special forces. \"All I know is that he was from the Afghan local police,\" Farhang said, adding that an investigation was under way. The attacks were the third and fourth times in less than a week that Afghans have turned on their mentors or colleagues.</p> <p>On Tuesday two Afghan soldiers killed a US soldier and injured two others in eastern Paktia province, and on Thursday two other Afghan soldiers opened fire on a group outside another base in the east, although the only person killed was one of the shooters.</p> <p>So far this year 37 soldiers and military contractors have been killed in 27 such attacks, far outpacing the toll in 2011. They have become such a commonplace threat that some foreign units are watched by armed \"guardian angels\" from their own ranks.</p> <p>In a sign of growing concerns about the frequent shootings, President Hamid Karzai issued a rare condemnation of the deaths of foreign soldiers and ordered an investigation into shootings in Helmand and Paktia. \"The enemy who does not want to see Afghanistan have a strong security force targets military trainers.\" Karzai said in a statement that also described the shooters as \"terrorists in Afghan security uniform\".</p> <p>Nato commanders argue that the attackers account for only the tiniest portion of security forces, now numbering more than 300,000, and say many are driven by personal grudges rather than loyalty to the Taliban or other insurgent groups. But the shootings are disproportionately damaging to morale on the critical mission to train the Afghan police and army as foreign forces head home.</p> <p>Two British soldiers were killed within the space of 48 hours in Helmand last week. Their deaths bring to 424 the number of UK soldiers killed in Afghanistan since 2001.</p>"
