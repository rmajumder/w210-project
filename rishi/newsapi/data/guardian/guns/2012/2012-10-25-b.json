  "<p>In both states on the island of Ireland the authorities have built a wall of denial around the abortion question. In the republic, abortion is banned in all circumstances, while Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply. Those in power adopt the cynical approach of the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Haughey\" title=\"\">Charles Haughey</a> and offer only an Irish solution to an Irish problem: in both states they simply export their abortions to Britain.</p> <p>A week ago, a crack appeared in the wall when the sexual health charity Marie Stopes International opened a clinic in Belfast offering limited non-surgical abortion services of up to nine weeks to women from Cork in the south to Derry in the north. <a href=\"http://www.mariestopes.org/media/marie-stopes-northern-ireland-opens-belfast\" title=\"\">Marie Stopes Northern Ireland's</a> new centre provoked fury and ire among the anti-abortion lobby, although tellingly the <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1019/1224325456715.html\" title=\"\">hundreds of protesters</a> they brought out on the streets of central Belfast were far fewer than the thousands they had predicted. The protesters were cheered, though, by the news that <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/astonishment-as-legal-chief-wades-into-abortion-row-16226730.html\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland's attorney general, John Larkin,</a> had intervened in the abortion debate by offering his advice to the Northern Ireland assembly's justice committee, inviting them to investigate the legal position of the new clinic. And not just his advice. Although he cannot use the law to force the clinic to close, the attorney general's letter to the committee made clear that he was willing to act as counsel and cross-examiner on behalf of any investigation they undertook.</p> <p>Mr Larkin has form on the abortion issue. In 2008, on a local radio show, he compared the termination of a pregnancy where a child would be born extremely disabled as \"putting a bullet in the back of the head of the child two days after it's born\". At the time the highly able QC was not the attorney general and was undoubtedly entitled to his personal views. However, Mr Larkin is now the chief law officer for everyone in the province, including the substantial part of the population who are pro-choice on abortion.</p> <p>Mr Larkin has a taste for making proactive use of his office. Earlier this year he tried to prosecute the former NI secretary Peter Hain for criticising a judge. He also intervened in a European human rights case to argue against <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/government-distances-itself-from-attorney-general-john-larkin-over-austrian-lesbian-case-16229060.html\" title=\"\">adoption by gay couples</a>. Given that the main parties in the cross-community coalition running Northern Ireland are all hostile to legal abortion, any move against the Marie Stopes clinic by the devolved government is clearly likely to be hostile. But the attorney general is a public servant of all the people, including women facing crisis pregnancies or who are victims of rape. Mr Larkin should stop stirring the Marie Stopes pot and stop <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20054111\" title=\"\">controversialising his office</a> in this way. If he intervenes again on the matter his position as chief legal adviser in Northern Ireland is surely untenable.</p>",

It doesn't matter as the Tigers couldn't do anything against the Giants' Madison Bumgarner or their bullpen.

That will be Saturday night at Comerica Park in Detroit, 8:00pm EST. The planned matchup pits the Giants' best pitcher Ryan Vogelsong against the Tigers' number three starter Anibal Sanchez. Enjoy a day off of baseball and then we'll have coverage here at the Guardian starting 7:30pm EST.

Scutaro then bunts the second pitch foul. 0-2. Maybe the strategy was to confuse Marco here? What an odd move there. Pagan is making like he's about to run, but Smyly's not really focusing, he throws ball one to a taking Scuatro.</p> <p>The next pitch? Scutaro hits a long ball that hooks just about eight feet foul. Still 1-2. Now Smyly throws to first, but Pagan gets back safely.

He hit three home runs in three at-bats, the first two against Justin Verlander (the de facto greatest pitcher in the known universe) before ending his night with a mere single in his last at bat of the evening. At that point his team had a comfortable lead over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series, a game that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-1-live\"> the San Francisco Giants would end up winning 8-3 </a>after Jhonny Peralta hit a last gasp home run in the ninth inning.</p> <p>Maybe the most surprising story is that Barry Zito managed to out-pitch Justin Verlander in the first game of the World Series. Maybe this <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8526051/barry-zito-nlcs-game-5-masterpiece-sends-series-back-san-francisco\">#RallyZito thing</a> does have some unexplainable spell-like qualities, or maybe Barry Zito is slipping something into the drinks of his opponents like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFV1SVTYeuE\">Ryan O'Reilly in \"Oz\"</a>. In any case, tonight's pitching matchup seems a lot more even than yesterday's suspected mismatch that went the other way.

Yes I'm well aware how dirty that sounds, but let's at least attempt to be adults here.</p> <p>You know when they say \"it's an all-new ballgame\"? Well, tonight it's an all-new ballgame, quite literally. There are seven games, and nobody is expecting a sweep in any direction. All of those runs that the Giants scored last game? Well they don't carry over into tonight's matchup. A win tonight by the Tigers would effectively take away the Giants' not insignificant home court advantage (this crowd is loud). Even if the Giants do win tonight, all they will have done is what they're supposed to have done.</p> <p>(In other words, for those of us who predicted the Tigers to win in six? Well, it's still possible. Which reminds me, there's still time to read both my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/24/world-series-tigers-giants-everything-you-need-to-know\">utterly ridiculous World Series preview</a> and David Lengel's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/23/world-series-tigers-giants-preview\">rather more useful and coherent one</a>. They will both be outdated, perhaps laughably so, in about a week. So don't hesitate. It's that or listen to the FOX pregame chatter, your choice.)</p> <p>Can the Detroit Tigers come back from an unexpectedly rough Game 1?

  "<p>The British government opposed the establishment of the Nuremberg war crimes tribunals at the end of the second world war because it wanted selected Nazi leaders to be summarily executed and others to be imprisoned without trial, according to a contemporary account that is declassified on Friday.</p> <p>Winston Churchill made the proposal at the \"Big Three\" conference at Yalta in February 1945, according to the account, but was overruled by Franklin D Roosevelt, who believed the US public would demand proper trials, and Joseph Stalin, who argued that public trials possessed excellent propaganda value.</p> <p>The British eventually agreed to the war crimes trials despite the misgivings of some senior government officials who believed the decision to prosecute the surviving Nazi leadership for waging a war of aggression would set a dangerous precedent. They also feared the prosecutions would be on a par with the high-profile show trials in Stalin's Russia.</p> <p>The insight into British thinking at the time that allied leaders were attempting to reach agreement over the political shape of postwar Germany is in a diary that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Liddell\" title=\"\">Guy Liddell</a>, head of counter-espionage at MI5, kept during the 1940s and 50s. Codenamed Wallflowers and supposedly kept in a safe in the office of successive MI5 director-generals, the wartime volumes of the diary have been declassified, and redacted copies of the postwar volumes are <a href=\"http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/\" title=\"\">available</a> at the National Archive.</p> <p>Liddell supported a plan drawn up by the director of public prosecutions, Sir Theobald Mathew, for selected Nazis to be \"bumped off\" rather than put on trial, after a commission of inquiry had \"come to the conclusion\" this was the preferred option.</p> <p>On 21 June 1945, Liddell dictated a diary entry to his secretary about a visit to his office by a British War Crimes Executive official, and representatives of MI6 and the Special Operations Executive, looking for evidence to support a war crimes prosecution.</p> <p>\"Personally I think the whole procedure is quite dreadful. The DPP had recommended that a fact-finding committee should come to the conclusion that certain people should be bumped off and that others should receive varying terms of imprisonment, that this should be put to the House of Commons and that the authority should be given to any military body finding these individuals in their area to arrest them and inflict whatever punishment had been decided on. This was a much clearer proposition and would not bring the law into disrepute.</p> <p>\"Winston had put this forward at Yalta but Roosevelt felt that the Americans would want a trial. Joe supported Roosevelt on the perfectly frank grounds that Russians liked public trials for propaganda purposes. It seems to me that we are just being dragged down to the level of the travesties of justice that have been taking place in the USSR for the past 20 yrs.\"</p> <p>In July 1946, Liddell flew to Nuremberg with the deputy head of MI5, Oswald Harker, to watch the prosecution of 21 senior Nazis, including Hermann G\u00f6ring (\"considerably reduced in size\") and Albert Speer (\"probably one of the ablest in the dock\").</p> <p>There, he felt his fear that the tribunals would be little better than show trials had been confirmed. \"One cannot escape the feeling that most of the things the 21 are accused of having done over a period of 14 years, the Russians have done over a period of 28 years. This adds considerably to the somewhat phoney atmosphere of the whole proceedings and leads me to the point which in a way worries me most, namely, that the court is one of the victors who have framed their own charter, their own procedure and their own rules of evidence in order to deal with the vanquished.\"</p> <p>While the Nuremberg tribunals are now widely seen as a defining moment in international justice, providing the basis upon which war criminals could be brought to trial, Liddell thought it unwise to prosecute the Nazis for having waged a war of aggression. \"One cannot help feeling ... a dangerous precedent is being created,\" he said.</p> <h2>The defendants</h2> <p>The Nuremberg tribunal opened in 1945. Two years earlier, the USSR, Britain, and the US had issued their Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe, which stated that when the Nazis were defeated, the allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth \u2026 in order that justice may be done\".</p> <p>Twenty-four defendants were charged under four counts: crime against peace, planning and waging wars of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. They did not include Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and Joseph Goebbels, head of propaganda, who had all killed themselves. Martin Bormann, the Nazi party secretary, was tried in absentia \u2013 his remains were found many years later in Berlin.</p> <p>Robert Ley, head of the \"Strength through Joy\" movement, hanged himself before the trial started. Hermann G\u00f6ring, Hitler's successor, killed himself with a phial of cyanide the night before he was to be executed.</p> <p>Rudolf Hess, Hitler's former deputy, who flew to Britain in 1941 with what he called a peace plan, was given a life sentence. He killed himself in Spandau prison, Berlin, in 1987.</p> <p>Albert Speer, Hitler's architect who was responsible for the mass exploitation of forced foreign labour, was jailed for 20 years. The man who supplied the slave labour, Fritz Sauckel, was sentenced to death, as were 12 others.</p> <p>The Nuremberg tribunal gave its name to the \"I was only obeying orders\" defence. It also led to a series of international conventions on the laws of war, genocide, and human rights, and the setting up of the permanent international criminal court in The Hague. <strong>Richard Norton-Taylor</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 26 October. The original version said the wartime volumes were declassified in 2005. They were in fact declassified this week. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The 19th-century blood feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys \u2013 two families living either side of a river that marked the border between West Virginia and Kentucky \u2013 was famous enough for the term \"Hatfields and McCoys\" to become American shorthand for any type of intractable dispute. The horrors of the original conflict were largely buried under jokey references. In the 1970s actual members of the Hatfield and McCoy families appeared on the game show Family Feud. The McCoys won that one.</p> <p>Now comes a three-part miniseries, <a href=\"http://www.channel5.com/shows/hatfields-mccoys/clips/watch-the-series-trailer?collection=kevin-costner\" title=\"Hatfields  McCoys\"><strong>Hatfields &amp; McCoys</strong></a> (Channel 5), which aims to to put the blood back in the feud. It's a Kevin Costner project, in that he produced, directed and starred in, and wrote some of the music.</p> <p>My initial fear \u2013 that I wouldn't be able to tell the Hatfields from the McCoys \u2013 was realised almost immediately. Nearly all the male actors are hidden behind bushy beards, which makes them easy to confuse, especially in medium shot or wider. Even Costner is hard to pick out in a crowd at first. They probably had a knack for distinguishing one beardie from another in those days. It is a skill we should re-acquire, for we live in such times again. This show provides plenty of practice.</p> <p>The civil war is coming to an end. Anderson \"Anse\" Hatfield (Costner), head of one clan, is a brave but deserting confederate soldier; his former comrade Randall McCoy (Bill Paxton), leader of the opposing camp, is embittered by long incarceration in a PoW camp. Meanwhile another McCoy (I&#xa0;forget which) has been serving with the union army; he makes the mistake of accusing Uncle Vance Hatfield (Tom Berenger) of having unnatural relations with his dog. I'm not saying it's inaccurate, just rash. I don't know if Uncle Vance has sex with his dog. \"My uncle tends to go his own way,\" says Anse, which isn't much of a denial.</p> <p>Vance, who is clearly capable of most bad things, kills the one who's name I'm now glad I didn't bother to latch onto. There's a side dispute about timber rights, and later Floyd Hatfield is accused of stealing a McCoy pig. \"I guess you Hatfields are all the same,\" says Randall. A jury trial follows \u2013 with six jury members per family and a Hatfield judge. The resulting bad blood leads to the killing of big-mouth drunk Bill Staton (neither Hatfield nor McCoy, but played with shortlived gusto by Michael Greco, aka Beppe off EastEnders). There is also \u2013 inevitably, you might think \u2013 a pair of star-crossed lovers from either side of the divide.</p> <p>Amazingly, this all appears to be historically accurate, Romeo and Juliet subplot included. In real life there was a 13-year gap between the first shooting and the stolen pig - a passage of time reflected here as children grow into adults. Only Uncle Vance's dog looks unaltered by the years. Of course it could be a different, similar dog. Vance may be attracted to a particular type.</p> <p>Hatfields &amp; McCoys is like a hillbilly version of Dallas. Everyone's a bit of a scumbag, so it's hard to care what happens to them, which is just as well, because folks die regularly, without much preamble, in fairly gory ways. They all speak in roundabout, cod-mountain man English, and the whole thing is steeped in the kind of American backwoods atmosphere you only get by filming in Romania. I'll take it over Dallas every time.</p> <p>American high school student Lori Brownell fainted on the baseball diamond. Afterwards she was afflicted with Tourette's-like tics. Doctors could find no neurological cause. Before long a half-dozen girls, all from the same high school, began to experience similar symptoms. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-town-that-caught-tourettes/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1\" title=\"The Town That Caught Tourettes\"><strong>The Town That Caught Tourette's</strong></a> (Channel 4) investigated this bizarre outbreak, and the search for a cause. Mobile phones, poison, drugs toxic waste, jet trails and demons were all blamed. The number of cases increased to 10.</p> <p>The girls were diagnosed as having \"stress-induced conversion disorder\". Not all the parents liked the idea that these very real symptoms had a psychological basis, or the implication that their daughters suffered from high stress. \"There is something going on inside her veins,\" said one. Environmental campaigner Erin Brokovich weighed in, citing a chemical spill near the school. Finally, another doctor diagnosed a rare infection, administered antibiotics and, lo and behold, the girls got better. But the girls who underwent counselling also got better.</p> <p>In spite of its sensational title, this was a thoughtful investigation, which explored a genuine mystery from every angle, and didn't settle on a single answer. As one sufferer put it, \"the psyche is a big place\".</p>",
  "<p>Paul di Resta had to fend off questions about the survival of his Force India employers before the Indian Grand Prix after the team principal, Vijay Mallya, lost his billionaire status.</p> <p>Mallya's Kingfisher Airlines business is reportedly \u00a31.5bn in debt and has had its licence suspended.

For whatever reasons it's not happened. But this team is still growing and hopefully we will be successful. I am definitely ready [for a move to a big team]. I feel the consistency is there. But I've still got time. I'm 26.\"</p> <p>Force India's deputy team principal, Bob Fernley, did his best to separate the speculation about the team from problems faced by Mallya. \"You have to have huge sympathy for the employees of Kingfisher Airlines \u2013 huge sympathy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But it's a public company. Vijay is one of the shareholders. Obviously he's the face of Kingfisher and the chairman, so it stops with him. But in terms of where they've got to go it's a shareholder process.

We've had doom and gloom for five years but we're still here and we're still competing and each year we improve.</p> <p>\"It's business as usual.

  "<p>Sister (originally entitled L'Enfant D'En Haut, or The Child From Above) is the new film from Ursula Meier, who made <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125328/home\" title=\"\">Home</a> (2008), starring Isabelle Huppert as a woman who finds herself living next door to a new motorway. Sister is perhaps a more conventional sentimental-realist picture about poverty. Kacey Mottet Klein plays Simon, a kid who lives near a Swiss ski resort; every&#xa0;day, he sneaks up on to the slopes and steals ski equipment from the tourists who live up in this high, rarefied atmosphere of wealth. Then he&#xa0;sells it to buy food for himself and the jobless Louise (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who&#xa0;tells various boyfriends that this kid brother of hers is only staying temporarily. Simon and Louise are bound together by ties of shame, guilt and fear, and Simon's thieving is a pathetic attempt to buy love; he is a breadwinner of sorts but his stealing is also a kind of compulsion that he cannot understand, still less control. It&#xa0;is an interesting and well-made movie, though with an uncertain ending. The appearance of Martin Compston, playing the young Scottish hotel chef who takes an interest in Simon's little scams, is perhaps a sign that Meier has been influenced by the humanist cinema of Ken Loach.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>From the days of Bob Paisley to the era of Rafael Benitez, success in the Uefa Cup - let's not quibble about minor branding issues - has served as a harbinger of things to come for Liverpool Football Club.</strong> Paisley's side won the trophy in 1976, then went on to dominate Europe for the best part of a decade. Benitez landed the thing with Valencia in 2004, then went to Anfield where his team regularly made their presence felt at the business end of the Champions League.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>His young side being very much a work in progress, and inconsistent as hell to boot, Brendan Rodgers is unlikely to join the roll call of Uefa Cup winning bosses quite yet.</strong> Which is not to say he'll not be going for glory this season. Widely expected to name a team of 12-year-olds tonight, with the Merseyside derby looming at the weekend and qualification from Group A a big ask for his thin squad, he's only gone and done this: Jones, Wisdom, Johnson, Agger, Skrtel, Gerrard, Sahin, Shelvey, Assaidi, Downing, Suarez. Amsterdam or bust, then. Amsterdam or bust.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>But even if Liverpool aren't quite there yet, this game might still offer some major pointers for the future of European football.</strong> Anzhi Makhachkala were purchased by $6.5bn oligarch Suleiman Kerimov in January 2011, and they're quickly making their mark. With Guus Hiddink at the helm, and having signed former Chelsea star Yuri Zhirkov, Christopher Samba from Blackburn Rovers, Lassana Diarra from Real Madrid and Samuel Eto'o from Internazionale, they're already clear at the top of this year's nascent Russian league, and would rather like to become only the third Russian winners of this trophy, CSKA Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg having already done the business in 2005 and 2008. Their ambition, set against Liverpool's quiet rebirth, should make for a fascinating spectacle this evening. It is on!</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Kick off:</strong> 8.05pm.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>That unexpectedly strong Liverpool side again, because let's face it, I've buried it in all that waffle:</strong> Jones, Wisdom, Skrtel, Agger, Johnson, Gerrard, Sahin, Shelvey, Downing, Suarez, Assaidi.<br>Subs: Gulacsi, Henderson, Carragher, Allen, Suso, Sterling, Yesil.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Anzhi Makhachkala, who are giving me a Lady Marmalade earworm:</strong> Vladimir Gabulov, Agalarov, Samba, Joao Carlos, Zhirkov, Shatov, Georgi Gabulov, Boussoufa, Carcela-Gonzalez, Eto'o, Smolov.<br>Subs: Pomazan, Gadzhibekov, Lakhiyalov, Tagirbekov, Logashov, Mukhammad, Traore.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Bas Nijhuis (Holland)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>History will teach us \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e.</strong> \u041d\u0435\u0442! \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e! And this is because Liverpool have never played Anzhi before. And Anzhi have never played an English team before. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b. The last time Liverpool faced Russian opposition, they beat CSKA Moscow 3-1 to make off with the 2005 Uefa Super Cup. Previous to that, they've hosted Russian sides three times, spanking Spartak Moscow 5-0 in the Champions League in 2002, drawing 0-0 with Alania Vladikavkaz in the 1995 Uefa Cup to seal a 2-1 aggregate win, and being skelped 2-0 by the aforementioned Muscovites in the 1992 Cup Winners Cup, that defeat coming off the back of a 4-2 humiliation at Spartak's place. Oh Graeme! How could you!</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Recent form's probably a better guide, isn't it?</strong> \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430. Anzhi are on a four-game winning run; they've only lost once this season domestically, and are unbeaten on their continental manoeuvres. Liverpool meanwhile have are on a winning run of their own, one in a row, having edged past Reading at the weekend. Still, early days for Brendan, and all. Early days.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Rodgers, Rodgers and Hammerstein:</strong> After a blast of <em>that</em> showtune, the players and managers take to the pitch. Liverpool in their famous red, Anzhi in neon yellow. Gerry Marsden's in the crowd, by the way, pop kids. Can Liverpool do it for the man who's serenaded them onto the field of play for the last 50 years?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> A fair old atmosphere as Liverpool set the ball rolling. It's not quite St Etienne '77 or Chelsea '05, but it's a European night at Anfield, so. Anzhi will be kicking towards the Kop in this half, which means Liverpool will be doing it in the second period, just as they like it. Suarez attempts to diddle into the area down the inside left, but gets nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> It's been all Liverpool so far, in terms of possession at least. They've done nothing with it as of yet, but they'll be pleased enough with the opening 120 seconds. \"Well, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/04/liverpool-udinese-live-mbm\">after my expert jinxing of Sebastian Coates in the last home Europa tie</a> I'll be keeping my optimism firmly under lock and key this time around,\" promises Phil Sawyer. \"To be honest, it doesn't need much damping down. The last time I felt less optimistic about getting a result was when [fellow regular MBM crackpot] Mac Millings set me up with a blind date. I expect lots of dinky passing it around before the new Russian All-Stars exploit our shaky defence to grab a 2-1 victory. And Suarez to pick up an injury. And then we'll lose the derby at the weekend. And then my toffee-nosed mum will be on the phone Sunday night, gloating to the heavens. To be honest, she might be on the phone at 10pm tonight gloating to the heavens. She's never really forgiven me for supporting the Reds.\" And there you have it, a nervous breakdown in 136 words. Is Millings reading this, I wonder? If you are, do you fancy popping round to check on him? Confiscate all sharp objects, shoelaces, gin, etc. And perhaps fiddle around with his browser settings to block this website.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> \"Is it true that Downing is at or near the top of the Europa League assists list so far in this campaign?\" asks Peter Oh, and let's hope he expects me to ignore rather than answer that question. \"I can't decide if that says more about Stewart's improving form, or the abject lack of quality in EL opposition. In any case, wasn't he demoted to left back, fourth choice goalkeeper, or water carrier? He's in the starting XI and it has four recognized defenders already, so he must be out of the doghouse and back on frenetic, aimless winger duty?\" I can indeed report that he's patrolling the right wing at the moment, and he has in fact managed a pass. But it was Wisdom who had to take the initiative and attempt to fire a cross into the area. Still, plenty of time for him to get his act together and utilise some of that talent. He's only 27.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> My mistake, he's 28.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> A decent run by the ever-lively Suarez down the right. He twists and turns Samba as he reaches the area, but attempts one dropped shoulder too many - a third, naturally - and the ball's bundled away.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Assaidi wins a corner down the left, off Samba as the big man comes across to cover. Assaidi takes it himself, hits it too long, then Gerrard fires the ball out of play on the right.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Skrtel has just booted Smolov up the arse. It's a proper comic-book punt, a clumsy load of nonsense. The Anzhi man's down injured, and no wonder, he's just had a load of studs pressed into his left buttock. He gets up, and he's got a face on, as the ref's done nothing. Expect more developments.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Plenty of space for Suarez down the left, but he overcooks the cross. No matter, the box was hardly loaded with red shirts anyway. The camera pans to the crowd, where $6.5bn oligarch Suleiman Kerimov is watching his team. He's dressed in a trucker's cap and checked shirt. He's dressed like the lead singer in Lambchop, or perhaps someone signed to Sub Pop in 1989. $6.5bn!</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Suarez is looking lively, almost as though he's been told to go hell for leather for 45-60 minutes before being wrapped in cotton wool for the Everton game on Sunday. He dances along the edge of the Anzhi area, and upon reaching the left-hand edge of the D, hits a weak shot straight at Vladimir Gabulov, who gobbles up the ball.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Eto'o shows for the first time. He offers it to Agger down the inside right, lets the defender slide in to commit himself, then nudges it right to Smolov. Eto'o continues his run into the box, but the return pass is overcooked and useless. Eto'o looks extremely displeased with this turn of events, and looks at his team-mate like <em>that</em>.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Liverpool aren't quite clicking yet, but both Suarez and Assaidi are jigging around at high pace down either flank. A sense one of them might showcase a routine <em>just so</em>, and create themselves a chance. But nothing more than a sense as of yet.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Well, here's Assaidi dancing clear down the left, reaching the byline and pulling one back for Johnson, whose attempt is blasted straight at the keeper. Liverpool are slowly turning up some heat. \"If ever there was a Lambchop song that typified Liverpool last season, it's Life's Little Tragedy,\" croons Graeme Neill, quietly, with jazzy guitar flitting in and out, unobtrusively. \"Slightly more optimistic about this season, thanks to the excitability of Virility's Raheem Sterling and the rampaging yellow card machine that is Jonjo Shelvey.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Samba is booked for coming straight through the back of Suarez. The Anfield faithful cheer in the ironic fashion. Gerrard takes the free kick, 35 yards out, and blasts it witlessly at the wall. The Anfield faithful moan, but this noise is telling it straight, no need for analysis of subtext.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> This should have been the opening goal. A long ball down the inside right is misjudged awfully by Joao Carlos. Suarez tears clear, and is within his right to shoot once he reaches the area, but instead unselfishly slides a pass inside for Shelvey, who leans back and blooters an awful effort miles over the bar. Shelvey's the joint leading scorer in this competition - or at least he was before the start of play today - and therefore the crowd were expecting better.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Smolov and Skrtel come together in the Liverpool area down the left, the former running and then falling over the latter, who is sliding across the turf. Smolov was never really in control of the ball, but then neither was Skrtel of himself. The referee doesn't care, and neither do Anzhi really, though they make half-arsed claims for a penalty. \"I'm now an MBM crackpot?\" cries Phil Sawyer (2min). \"Does one have to obtain a certain number of MBM mentions to attain this status or is it down to the tenure of the comments? If the former, how many more is it to the next level? And what is the next level? MBM loser? MBM basket case? MBM exile?\" The next level of social ineptitude? MBM writer, probably.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Johnson riffs down the left, and is stopped in the area by a little tug from Agalarov. Johnson elects the non-cynical approach, staying up and pulling the ball back for the impressive Assaidi, who nudges the ball forwards then pelts a low shot towards the bottom left. It's not hit with much venom, although keeper Gabulov makes a meal of dealing with it.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> The impressive Assaidi. That's what I just said. So here he is, overhitting a hilariously inept free kick straight down the keeper's throat from the right touchline, with the box loaded with team-mates. Thank you, my Guardian Sport!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Agalarov makes a dangerous run into space down the right. Boussoufa hits the worst pass in the history of All Football, about 20 yards behind his overlapping team-mate and out of play. Liverpool off the hook. That passage of play came after an Anzhi free kick deep in Liverpool territory down the right, which was so bad it defies description. So I'll not try.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Chasing after a clever Suarez pass, Johnson finds himself in space down the inside-left channel, closing in on goal. He makes it to the six-yard box, then takes a fresh-air swipe with his right peg. Oh dear. He claims a penalty, with Agalarov behind him, but it's out of embarrassment more than anything else.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Corner to Liverpool down the right. Gerrard takes. Sahin, on the penalty spot, gets his eyebrows to the ball, but can't keep it down and on target. \"I guess Stewart Downing will be dressing up as a footballer for Halloween,\" writes Ciaran McGowan. Does he not scare you enough already? \"Surely it is time he came out and confessed that it was an April Fool Joke that got out of hand and that he is really a librarian by trade.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Anzhi have been very quiet. Eto'o feeds Carcela-Gonzalez down the right, but the Moroccan falls onto his face. \"Samuel Eto'o is not getting much service but he's acting like it should be delivered on silver platter,\" opines Gene Salorio. \"Highest paid player in the world looks like he's somewhere in Europe on an austerity budget because he's being very economical with his efforts.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Agger has had enough of this nonsense, and decides to go on the rampage down the inside-left channel. He hits a shot of extreme violence towards the top-left corner. The ball rises too quickly, but that wasn't a bad effort at all, and had Gabulov scrambling across with furrowed brow.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Agalarov is booked for tugging Assaidi's arm in a very cynical fashion as the winger looks to slalom down the left. He looks decent enough, does Assaidi, direct, purposeful and skilful, the Bizarro Downing. \"Great effort by Agger,\" writes Matt Dony. \"Shame the camera missed him giving Roberto Carlos on the Anzhi bench a quick wink just before he hit it.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Anzhi put a lovely smooth passing move together down the left, Shatov spreading it wide, Zhirkov the pivot, then Smolov cutting in to fire a fizzer across Jones and out of play on the right.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Anzhi Makhachkala.</strong> And that's that for the half. Hmm. Not a whole lot to say about that, really. And there's no point me droning on.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>HALF-TIME ENTERTAINMENT:</strong> Liverpool haven't served up much of it so far, so here's some alternative scouse-based amusements to while away the time.</p> <!-- Block 37 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AarhZScyuz0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AarhZScyuz0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> Run it up your mast nine times, it'll get you through this second half.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Here comes entertainment!</strong> The second half's starting, and Raheem Sterling has come on for Glen Johnson. That means the woeful Stewart Downing has been pushed back to left-back - and while we're hearing Johnson has a minor knock, there's also a suggestion Downing's just had the gauntlet thrown down at his feet by Brendan Rodgers. Has he entered the last-chance saloon?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> A quick bellow from the crowd as Anzhi get the second half underway, and then we quickly fall into relative silence. An appropriate time for this email, then, and Ciaran McGowan's comment on 36 mins has reminded one of our readers of their favourite librarian joke. \"It doesn't really work on the page, but here goes. Man walks into a library, goes up to the counter and says 'Can I have a pint of lager and a packet of crisps please?' Librarian replies, 'I'm sorry but this is a library.' Man says again (this time in a whisper) 'Can I have a pint of lager and a packet of crisps please?'\" Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Simon McMahon. He's here all week, try the lamb and vegetable stew.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> This came from nothing. Eto'o fannies around in the middle of his own half as he receives a pass. Skrtel comes bombing in, races off with the ball, and blasts a shot at goal. A really decent effort, but the keeper's behind it. \"Stewart Downing is surely nothing as exciting as a librarian,\" insists J Willoug. \"A chartered accountant, perhaps? Or a real estate salesman? Apologies to those chartered accountants and real estate salespersons out there who enjoy their jobs - I know a librarian who enjoys her job, but none from your professions.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> How about this for an aerial match-up: Sterling v Samba? Sure enough, having introduced the concept, it's the tiny Sterling who wins it, flicking the ball on for Shelvey down the inside left. Shelvey reaches the area and lifts the ball into the centre for Gerrard, who running into the box at pace guides his header well wide left of goal. If that had been on target, the keeper, rooted, wasn't getting there.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>53 min: YOU KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN... Liverpool 1-0 Anzhi Makhachkala.</strong> Stewart Downing has just scored a <em>magnificent</em> goal. He cuts inside from the left, looks lost for a couple of seconds, then decides TO HELL WITH IT, and hammers a gorgeous screamer into the top right corner. He races off with a huge smile of relief, more than anything, playing across his face. On the touchline, Brendan Rodgers points at him, smiling broadly too. If he has had a kick up the shorts, it's really worked. And look what happens, Stewart, when you <em>take a chance</em>.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Suarez welts a vicious drive towards the top left corner from 30 yards. Half the ground think it's gone in, and scream accordingly, but it's just wide left. Liverpool have woken up alright, and credit where it's due, it's all down to Downing. \"Stewart Downing scored?\" asks Hubert O'Hearn. \"That explains it. My dog has started woofing in perfect iambic pentameter.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Assaidi scampers down the left and slides the ball inside to Suarez. The pass doesn't come off, but the ball falls to Shelvey, who bumbles through a challenge down the inside left and attempts a shot from a tight angle. It's deflected and blocked, and easily picked off by keeper Gabulov. \"Can a chartered accountant do THAT?\" asks Matt Dony, not unreasonably. \"Always liked the boy.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Liverpool look a totally different team in this second half. A hearty chant of \"There's only one Brendan Rodgers\" from the Kop. They're still furiously scribbling down a Downing chant on the back of an envelope, presumably.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Logashov replaces Agalarov.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Suarez slides Shelvey clear down the middle. A heavy touch allows Shatov to cut across the midfielder as he shapes to shoot from the edge of the area, whip the ball from his toe, and hack clear for a corner. The set piece is a waste of time and energy.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Smolov is replaced by the 6ft 8in figure of Lacina Traore. Beating Samba in the air's all good and well, but let's see Sterling go up against <em>him</em>.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> A slight lull in proceedings at the moment, allowing the stadium to stand in memory of the 96 who died at Hillsborough.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> \"To be fair,\" begins Jon Rushton, \"there's still plenty of time for Liverpool to create four or five more gilt edged chances, and then concede in the 90th minute. Downing own goal?\" Almost perfect timing there, Jon, as Downing, near his own corner flag, plays a pointless square pass through the Liverpool area. That's beyond foolish. Luckily he's still in credit tonight, as Liverpool swarm around Eto'o, who's picked up the loose ball. And though the striker gets a shot away on the turn, looking for the top right corner from the penalty spot, Jones is able to claim without fuss. Downing has the good grace to look sheepish.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Anzhi are beginning to make Liverpool anxious. A long ball down the inside right channel. Traore, on the edge of the area, is <em>this</em> close to taking the ball down and shooting from the edge of the box, but can't control. There is an obvious joke to be made here about erstwhile Liverpool left back Djimi, but let's show a little respect to a guy who, in fairness, has cleared a ball off a line in a European Cup final.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Assaidi is sent scampering towards the area down the left, released by a lovely diagonal spray from Gerrard. He enters the area and is nudged to his knees from behind by Logashov, but there's no penalty. You'll have seen them given. Suarez, the heat descending, is booked for attempting to engage the referee in a Hegelian dialectic.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Zhirkov aims for the bottom-left corner from the edge of the area. His shot is deflected off Wisdom, and parried round the post by Jones. Before the corner, Lahiyalov replaces Boussoufa. Then Shatov takes the corner, and it's plucked from the air by Jones, who has looked as solid as Pepe Reina, which admittedly isn't saying much these days.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Allen replaces Shelvey.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Anyone remember Gary Crosby and Andy Dibble? From a Liverpool corner, Agger heads towards the top left. Gabulov claims. The players stream upfield. Gabulov balances the ball on the platform of his right hand. Agger comes up from behind, heads it off the keeper's palm, and hoicks the ball into the empty net. The goal, miserably, is disallowed and Agger is booked.</p> <!-- Block 56 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gEFj3AV0hCw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gEFj3AV0hCw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>Football is supposed to be fun, remember.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> A couple of close shaves for Liverpool, who may yet regret not getting a second goal. First Carcela-Gonzalez cuts inside from the right and sends a low, dangerous fizzer goalwards. Jones and Skrtel combine to clear. Then Traore nips in at the left-hand post, poking just wide. Anfield is tense. But with Young Boys winning 3-1 in the other game, as things stand, Liverpool will be leading the group tonight.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Assaidi romps down the left, checks, and rolls the ball inside to Gerrard, who lumps over from 25 yards. \"I'm a (qualified) librarian and I enjoy it a lot more than I've enjoyed being a Liverpool supporter in recent times,\" notes Ned Potter.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Downing has certainly been trying his hardest to undo all his good work. Twice in the last couple of minutes, he's played needlessly jazzy passes near his corner flag, inviting pressure on his defence. This time, something nearly comes of it, Carcela-Gonzalez looking for the bottom-right corner from the edge of the box, Jones behind it all the way.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> This is better from Downing. Carcela-Gonzalez, who is ending this game strongly, gets the makeshift fullback one on one, racing towards the area down the right. Downing clatters him to the ground like Mark Dennis, then wanders off with the ball, wearing a look of beatific innocence. The referee waves play on. Stewart Downing: hard man.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> This is the first of three added minutes, and there's nearly been a goal at each end. First Sterling goes on a freestyle run through the Anzhi area from right to left - imagine the shape of a treble clef. He eventually falls to earth with a big bass thud. No penalty. Anzhi fly upfield, Carcela-Gonzalez wheeching a low shot across the face of goal and inches wide of the left-hand post.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> A lot of misplaced Liverpool passes, but Anzhi aren't taking advantage.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Stewart Downing 1-0 Anzhi Makhachkala.</strong> A free kick for Anzhi down the right. They load the box - then fail to hoof the ball into it. Dear me. And that's it! Liverpool win a tight match, deservedly so mind you, and top their group. Downing is ushered towards the Kop by his manager, where he's greeted by a warm round of applause. There's nice! Remember how it feels, Stew. Remember how it feels when you roll the dice.</p>",
  "<p>If there's one method of communication that the CEOs of American companies have mastered, it's how to send an opinion upon deaf ears, at the time least likely to make a difference. The credibility of corporate leaders is not exactly at an all-time high (just ask Jack Welch).</p> <p>Yet, trying to reverse this curse, 80 of America's most powerful, prestigious corporate chieftains signed their names to a petition on Thursday \u2013 a letter really \u2013 that encourages a perfectly rational response to the coming tax crisis that faces America. </p> <p>That coming crisis is called the \"fiscal cliff\". It will take place in two months. A lot of the talk about it is highly intellectual and mostly impenetrable, but it really will affect the average American taxpayer. </p> <p>Here's what will happen: a number of tax breaks will lapse, and regular people will feel the pinch when tax season comes next year. For instance, the mortgage interest-rate deduction will be over, which will make it more expensive to own a home \u2013 really unfortunate timing, as unemployment remains high, home budgets are under pressure, and housing seems to be on track for a recovery. </p> <p>Then there's the payroll tax cut. If that goes away, payroll taxes will go up, and nearly $125bn in household income in the US will disappear, according to JP Morgan. There are other potential tax breaks that will disappear from lower-income households, like the earned-income tax credit, which allows people with modest incomes to get tax breaks if they have children. </p> <p>Overall, Americans will pay more in taxes than they have in 12 years, and legislators would also be taking away the real power of the tax system: the government's moral incentives to having children, home-ownership, and hiring. </p> <p>So it's clear that most American households will suffer in some respect if Congress fails to stop us from going over this fiscal cliff. American businesses are already suffering, or at least believe they are. The New York Times said its revenues fell largely because advertisers were holding back on budgets for fear that the fiscal cliff would destabilize the economy. We don't even need the fiscal cliff to occur to hurt us \u2013 the fear of the fiscal cliff is enough. </p> <p>But the thoughts of 80 CEOs are not going to assuage those fears, or convince Congress or the candidates that they need to act urgently.</p> <p>That's too bad. The CEOs point out, simply and with no partisan tint, that the tax math we've been hearing on the political stump doesn't exactly make sense in the real world. </p> <p>It's not exactly a shocking suggestion that campaign promises aren't always rooted in reality. But even sensible messages get drowned in the noise of \"October surprises\" and other sensationalist election nonsense. </p> <p>For one thing, the timing of the letter is all wrong. The CEOs would clearly like to influence what happens immediately post-election, when a lame-duck Congress is supposed to use their last few breaths to pass legislation to keep the country from careening off the fiscal cliff. But both President Obama and Governor Romney are cramming for election day. It's probably a good day for each of them now if they can keep their shoelaces tied and read a few policy briefings on Benghazi while hitting five states in 24 hours for campaigning. </p> <p>Paying attention to to-do lists \u2013 even from donation-rich corporate America \u2013 is not likely to hit high on the agenda. </p> <p>\"It's very weird timing,\" says Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. \"I wasn't quite sure why they put it out now. I can't picture Mitt Romney saying, 'I've been completely wrong about taxes, and we're now going to use tax increases to reduce the deficit!' I don't think that's the outcome.\"</p> <p>Another reason this letter won't change much is that it needs greater numbers for support. </p> <p>\"There are only 80 CEOs who signed it, and there are lot of CEOs missing from that list,\" points out Gleckman. \"There's a long way to go before the public and the business community are convinced.\"</p> <p>Gleckman says what voters and other business leaders need to be convinced of is the same thing that Congress needs to be convinced of: that avoiding the fiscal cliff will involve both raising taxes and cutting government programs. No shortcuts. No fairy tales. </p> <p>Yet another reason this letter is likely to have little impact is that the subject matter is not exactly the kind of thing you can rally voters around. </p> <p>There are few Americans who understand the fiscal cliff and its implications; making sense of tax policy is like falling down the rabbit hole. Even most CEOs don't care, says Gleckman. \"I don't think voters feel despair. I think they've long since tuned these people out. I've even heard this from CEOs: 'Just tell me when this is over. When these guys actually have a plan, call me. I don't want to hear about this anymore.'\" </p> <p>Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, says the fiscal cliff may be an impending financial crisis, but for now it's a political one. \"It's a game of fiscal chicken, where both parties have their interests about how to support economic growth and control long-term budget deficits, and both have incentives to delay any long-term resolution. There's no incentive for anyone in Congress to act right now. it would be like shooting yourself in foot.\"</p> <p>Congress may not even feel that urgency after the election. The election could change the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats. New legislators will be uncomfortable delving into complicated issues; the old ones may not have a good grip on party loyalties. </p> <p>And that's even if Congress has a plan. It's more likely that, under the pressure of saving the country, they will not have a coherent vision of what to do about some very loaded issues. Many major investors and bankers expect Congress to do what it did before: delay the decision for another few months, or even a year. Then, come tax season in 2014, the average American household may see its taxes rise by $3,500, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center. </p> <p>LeBas says Congress has to act. \"Economically speaking, the worst possible outcome is another kick the can down the road.\" Unfortunately, that's what many are expecting to happen. </p> <p>There was story in The Onion this week that seemed oddly prescient: \"After Four Debates,\" the headline declared, \"Entire Nation is Undecided.\" One could say the same of Congress \u2013 and average American households will pay the price. Corporate leaders, even in the most sensible of their talk, will have little influence.</p>",
  "<p>If Claude Chabrol had made a film that looked like a Russian parable of human vanity, it might look like this gripping and disturbing film from Andrey Zvyagintsev. (I found myself thinking of both Merci Pour Le Chocolat and old Count Bezukhov's will in War And Peace.) Elena is only the third feature-length film from this 48-year-old director, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96813/return\" title=\"\">The Return</a> (2003) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/121143/banishment\" title=\"\">The Banishment</a> (2007); it is in many ways his most intimate, and the film with the most contemporary and realist character. </p> <p>Nadezhda Markina plays Elena, a middle-aged former nurse from a poor background who appears to have struck it very lucky. A&#xa0;wealthy patient, Vladimir (Andrey Smirnov) married her and now she lives with him in his luxury apartment with nothing to do but tend conscientiously to her husband. He is ageing, but their love life is still vigorous, and he bullishly insists on attending the local private gym. The problem with this happy and workable arrangement is that each spouse detests the other's grownup child from a previous marriage. Vladimir's daughter Katya (Elena Lyadova) is a spoilt party animal who sneers at her indulgent dad; Elena's son Sergei (Alexei Rozin) is a feckless waster who keeps producing kids and thinks of his mum's marriage as his meal ticket. Vladimir has not yet written his will, and a crisis ensues. </p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398395862\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/26/121026TGFSelena-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/26/121026TGFSelena_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121026TGFSelena/121026TGFSelena.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/26/121026TGFSelena_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>The subtlety and stealth of this movie is a marvel, and so is the complex and enigmatic performance of Markina. Zvyagintsev has a brilliant slow zoom on to an old photo of Elena, apparently taken around the time of her marriage 10 years before \u2013 and presumably taken by the doting Vladimir. It inspires the question: who is Elena? What does&#xa0;she want? Who does she love? It is&#xa0;superbly shot and directed; it does not offer a thriller-type ending \u2013 the narrative is resolved in a disquieting minor key. A&#xa0;deeply satisfying film.</p>",
  "<p>Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. </p> <h2>Keith Hackett's verdict </h2> <p><strong>1)</strong> You rightly played advantage, and the striker failed to take it. If he had not then gone on to commit an offence you would have taken play back to the original foul and awarded a direct free-kick \u2013 but the striker's action negates that. You need to show two yellow cards: the keeper for his foul (unsporting behaviour) and the striker for deliberate hand-ball. Restart with a direct free-kick to the defence. <em>Thanks to Kannan Murali</em>. <br><strong>2)</strong> The Law states that shinguards must be worn, but there is no written regulation on the design. It is simply down to you to decide if the shinguards provide an adequate degree of protection. I would allow the player to play with this minimum form of protection provided it does not create a danger to him or his opponents. <em>Thanks to Roger Bulland</em>. <br><strong>3)</strong> It's a clever trick, but not a legal one. Stop play, show the keeper a yellow card for unsporting behaviour and restart with an indirect free-kick to the attacking side on the goal area line, parallel to the goalline, nearest to where the ball was when play stopped. <em>Trevor Short wins the shirt</em>.</p> <h2>Competition: win an official club shirt of your choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398457453\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2010/8/25/1282726013467/Kitbag-New-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kitbag New\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View the Kitbag range</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a chance to win a club shirt of your choice from the range at <a href=\"http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=18796&amp;a=1446133&amp;g=512634\">Kitbag.com</a> send us your questions for You are the Ref to <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Kevin Pietersen is free to join the England squad for their training camp in Dubai after his Delhi Daredevils side were beaten in the Champions League Twenty20 semi-finals on Thursday night.</p> <p>It was the perfect outcome for England as Pietersen showed welcome hints of a return to form by hitting 50 from 44 balls, his top score of the tournament, but his team were beaten by the Highveld Lions.</p> <p>It means that his reintegration into the England set-up can continue in Dubai over the weekend before the squad head for Mumbai and the first of their three warm-up games before the first Test, a three-day match against India A which starts on Tuesday.</p> <p>Pietersen and the rest of the England batsmen seem likely to spend most of their time in Dubai facing spin to prepare them for the tests that await.

The BBC is being asked for a comparatively modest $80,000 for the facilities required for live ball-by-ball radio coverage for Test Match Special \u2013 a fee, like Sky's, which had not been mentioned when its own deal to cover the series was concluded six weeks ago. But it is also refusing to pay.

None of [the opponents] \u2013 not the critics, not scientists, not politicians \u2013 have come up with a single workable alternative to the cull which would give us the positive impact we need right now.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\" title=\"\">debate had been granted after more than 150,000 people signed</a> an official government e-petition \u2013 an innovation that had been launched by Heath.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, was present for 20 minutes of the five-hour debate. Several Labour MPs reported that he said \"I can't stand any more of this\" as he walked out of the discussion.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2012/10/25/owen-paterson-accused-of-badger-debate-snub/\" title=\"\">Paterson said later</a>: \"I didn't storm in or out anywhere. As I left I might have joked about the ill-informed comments of the other side.\"</p> <p>During the debate, Sir Jim Paice, who lost the farming minister's post in September's reshuffle, said that he and other ministers were under \"special security measures due to threats from animal-rights extremists\".</p> <p>He also commented on the shooting of free-running badgers. The killing method marked a key difference between the government's proposals and the evidence arising from a landmark \u00a350m, 10-year culling trial, in which 11,000 badgers were captured in cages then shot with pistols.</p> <p>Paice said: \"Nobody knows if controlled shooting will cull 70% of badgers [the minimum required] or be humane. There is no science, I readily admit that, because it has never been done.\"</p> <p>He said that the now-postponed pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire had to go ahead to \"test free shooting\".</p> <p>But other MPs quoted eminent scientists who argue that killing badgers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">killing could well increase TB infections in cattle</a> as infected animals flee the killing zone.</p> <p>The lost vote means a problem for ministers if they decide to push on with the cull, as they risk being accused of ignoring the will of parliament.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, said \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoners-vote-david-cameron\" title=\"\">parliament is sovereign</a>\" in the matter of whether the European court of human rights could force the UK to give prisoners the vote. Ministers would need to argue that parliament was not sovereign in the case of the badger cull, or possibly call another vote and whip MPs hard to ensure a victory.</p> <p>Before the vote, Heath was asked by Tory MP Mark Pritchard: \"Will ministers accept the will of this house?\" Heath said they would \"listen\" to the views of the house.</p> <p>Opponents of the cull welcomed the government defeat. Mark Jones at Humane Society International said: \"The government has refused to listen to the majority of scientists, disease experts and the British people opposed to the cull. Surely now it must listen to the will of the parliament and abandon its policy for good \u2026 and stop wasting time and money on a politically motivated badger hunt.\"</p> <p>Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: \"We stand ready to play a full part in working with farmers, land owners, the government and conservationists to move forward rapidly and constructively to tackle this dire disease in cattle and wildlife [using vaccination].\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012. The original said Gavin Grant was chief executive of the RSPB, rather than the RSPCA. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, toured broadcast studios this afternoon in an effort to demonstrate that the BBC is in control of the Savile crisis after cross-party criticism of the performance of the broadcaster's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/jimmy-savile-bbc-director-general-faces-mps-live\" title=\"\">director general in front of MPs on Tuesday morning</a>.</p> <p>But if anything the peer only seemed to heighten the tension surrounding the corporation, telling ITV News that he would be \"not surprised\" if there were resignations at the BBC - and telling Sky News that George Entwistle, the director general, and others involved \"have legitimate questions to answer\".</p> <p>Deploying colorful language guaranteed to get him a visible airing in the next day's newspapers, Patten told the BBC's World At One that Entwistle, who started in his job in mid September, has been deluged with a \"tsunami of filth\" which had done \"terrible damage\" to the standing of the broadcaster.</p> <p>His surprisingly frank admissions come as Patten is coming under pressure to get a grip on the scandal, now running well into its fourth week, and as the BBC finds itself light on political allies. Criticisms made by Maria Miller on Tuesday and again on Wednesday that the BBC was not in control, are privately echoed by her Labour opposite number Harriet Harman.</p> <p>Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of the culture media and sport select committee, said that Entwistle \"had not demonstrated so far\" that \"he can take a grip\", amid signs that politicians are queuing up to take aim at the broadcaster - although there was some qualified support from Labour leader Ed Miliband who when asked on a visit to Preston yesterday said that he did not think that Entwistle should quit over the crisis.</p> <p>There are few senior executives at the BBC able to defend the corporation, partly because so many are under fire for their role in the handling of an aborted Newsnight investigation into Savile, and partly because Entwistle's ascent has left the broadcaster with more key roles to fill.</p> <p>Meanwhile, former senior staff believe that the BBC's new leadership is struggling. One, who asked not to be named, contrasted the situation with the Russell Brand - Jonathan Ross prank calls affair in 2008 - where within a week of public outrage beginning Russell Brand and the controller of Radio 2 Lesley Douglas had both quit. Ross, meanwhile, was forced to serve a period of suspension.</p> <p>Even Patten himself conceded he was overwhelmed. He said that the situation was nothing like any of those he had experienced before in his long political career, which has encompassed being Conservative party chairman, a cabinet minister and the last British governor of Hong Kong, overseeing its handover to China. \"I don't think I've ever before been in one that felt like being washed over by a political reputational tsunami,\" he told ITV.</p> <p>Asked specifically if Entwistle would have to resign by ITV News he said: \"Steady on. It's difficult enough answering real time questions on this \u2013 I'm extremely reluctant to argue too many 'what if' questions but what is undoubtedly the case is the Trust appointed the present DG, he seemed to us to be the best candidate for the job. His appointment was widely praised, not only within BBC.\"</p> <p>But for all the doubts about Entwistle, and for all the public anger that Savile was allowed to get away with his sexual abuse for so long, the BBC has not yet seen the kind of political pressure seen at the time of Ross-Brand, where the looming general election and the political muscle of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation created an environment in which lapses in taste were linked to failures in the entire model of BBC governance, its Trust regulator, and the former chairman Sir Michael Lyons.</p> <p>Lyons, who was a Labour councillor before he became a local government executive, who chose not to stand for a second term, was disliked acutely by the Conservatives, and in particular former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt. But Patten was this government's appointment, giving him some personal insulation, while the BBC is at a relatively secure point in its own administrative cycle because the next royal charter is not due for renewal until 2016 and the next licence fee settlement is not due until a year after.</p>",
  "<p>British reluctance to be a conduit for a US military buildup in the Gulf seems to have taken Washington by surprise but it demonstrates the lessons of Iraq are deeply etched in Whitehall. This time the UK is making clear it will not write blank cheques and will take its own decisions on what is legal and what is not.</p> <p>The argument does not reflect a difference of opinion over the utility of going to war as a means of stopping Iran's nuclear programme. US military commanders, like their British counterparts, believe that any such venture is likely to backfire in current circumstances, persuading the Iranian leadership that it has no choice but to make nuclear weapons as fast as possible.</p> <p>Circumstances will change, however. A <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/10/23/whether-its-romney-or-obama-u-s-will-consider-direct-talks-with-iran/\" title=\"\">new diplomatic push</a> is planned for after the US elections, offering sanctions relief in return for limits on Iranian uranium enrichment. But if that initiative fails, tensions will rise, and rash moves with unintended consequences will become more of a risk. The military calculus facing the next US president will present itself in ever more shades of grey, as will the legalities.</p> <p>The most immediate unknown is what Israel will do if diplomacy fails. US commanders insist publicly and privately they are in the dark about Binyamin Netanyahu's thinking on a military strike aimed at setting back Iran's progress. The betting in the Pentagon this week is 60-40 against an Israeli attack, but the odds change every day.</p> <p>If Israel strikes and Iran responds with an attack against the US or its Gulf allies, then Washington would undoubtedly retaliate. If the Iranian response is tightly focused on Israel, and roughly proportionate, the American reaction is harder to predict. It depend to some extent on who will be in the Oval Office at the time. And again, the legalities of any action would depend on the details.</p> <p>The Iranians will be making their own calculations, but it is a safe bet the country's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, will not jeopardise the regime's survival. An all-out US assault would do just that, and awareness of that risk underlies everything Tehran does, but as the stakes rise the law of unintended consequences begins to take over.</p> <p>As the sanctions screw tightens on Iran, the regimes or elements within it could miscalculate. Iran is finding it harder and harder to sell its oil and, by some estimates, will run out of storage space for it in January, potentially forcing it to turn off the pumps and thereby degrade its own infrastructure.</p> <p>US military officials speculate that if Tehran, or more specifically the Revolutionary Guards, decide to strike back against a sanctions regime Iran sees as an act of war, they would do so in ways they hope would be unattributable, by secretly mining the shipping lanes or triggering a vast oil spill in the Strait of Hormuz. That would make the Strait impassable to shipping and threaten desalination plants which are essential to life in the Arab Gulf states.</p> <p>Or the Iranian navy could start boarding and inspecting shipping. Each move would invite a counter-move from the US Fifth Fleet, which has been preparing for each contingency, conducting its <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304388004577531331722511516.html\" title=\"\">biggest ever minesweeping exercise</a> in the Gulf last month and beefing up its capacity to handle oil slicks.</p> <p>American and Iranian warships already operate in close proximity in the Gulf, and although the two countries have no diplomatic relations, naval etiquette requires their sailors to talk to each other from bridge to bridge every day. Such polite encounters could easily turn sour and run out of control if tempers heat up.</p> <p>Alternatively, the leadership in Tehran could gamble by raising the level to which it enriches uranium in the hope of forcing western concessions at the negotiating table. Iranian parliamentary officials have suggested the current top level of 20% could be raised to 60%, close to weapons grade. That could cross not just Israeli red lines, but American red lines too.</p> <p>Barack Obama has said he would act to stop Iran building a nuclear weapon, while Mitt Romney said he would prevent Iran's \"nuclear-weapon capability\", leaving his definition vague.</p> <p>As the scenarios proliferate, so do the ramifications in international law, focusing on what constitutes legitimate self-defence. Little wonder the British government is keen to retain its own counsel.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan has complained to the UN security council that Israeli planes bombed a munitions plant in Khartoum, an attack that has been widely interpreted as a warning to Iran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Israeli military commentators said that the Yarmouk facility in the Sudanese capital was owned by Iran and had been used to supply weapons to Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip. The \"impressive\" reach of the secret operation was said to have demonstrated an ability to hit Iran's nuclear facilities \u2014 a similar distance from Israel.</p> <p>As reverberations continued from Tuesday's 1,000-mile attack, Israel would neither confirm nor deny it was involved. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, said : \"There is nothing I can say about this subject.\" But one of his most senior officials praised the country's air force and called Sudan a \"terrorist state\".</p> <p>Sudan's UN ambassador, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, called on the security council to condemn the raid as \"a blatant violation of the concept of peace and security\". Iran also denounced Israel, as did Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement with close links to Tehran.</p> <p>Sudan's culture and information minister, Ahmed Bilal Osman, had said earlier that four radar-evading aircraft carried out an attack around midnight on Tuesday. \"We think Israel did the bombing,\" he said. \"We reserve the right to react at a place and time we choose.\"</p> <p>Sudan's state news agency said the planes used \"hi-tech jamming devices\" in the attack and a Sudanese reporter told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that there was a telecommunications blackout for about an hour before the explosions.</p> <p>\"There are two arms factories in this area of the strike: one is the Yarmouk factory, the other is the Sudan Technical Centre,\" a UN source told the Guardian. \"We don't know for certain if they are making weapons or manufacturing ammunition. At the very minimum they are repackaging munitions produced elsewhere. Yarmouk is sponsored by Iran. The Sudan Technical Centre is definitely handling Chinese weapons.\"</p> <p>Israel has long accused Khartoum of serving as a base for Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip. \"Sudan is a dangerous terrorist state,\" Amos Gilad, an influential former general and senior defence ministry official, told Israel's Army Radio.</p> <p>There was a strong sense that Israel was also sending a blunt message to Iran. Ron Ben-Yishai, a veteran military commentator, wrote in daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth: \"There is no doubt that the explosion in Khartoum will be food for thought not only for the authorities in Sudan but also in Gaza \u2013 and especially in Tehran.\"</p> <p>Ephraim Inbar, a strategic expert, said: \"It is very plausible that Israel was behind the strike. We have operated in that region in response to a variety of intelligence reports in the past. We definitely have the capability [to launch such a strike]. It seems an easy operation, involving four jets. For us it would be a piece of cake.\"</p> <p>The UN source said: \"We know for sure that weapons are flowing from and through Sudan into the Egyptian Sinai, possibly to Gaza. The Egyptians have told us that the arms flowing into Sinai from Sudan are a big security problem. Northern Sinai is full of weapons.</p> <p>\"We have seen in the last few days intense clashes along this northern border, between Israel and Egypt, with armed, radicalised Bedouin groups with a vision of political Islam. There seem to be clear links between this and the strike in Khartoum. In the same days we've seen a dramatic increase in rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. The convergence of these elements points to Israel as the perpetrator.\"</p> <p>In past there have been allegations that Sudan stored chemical weapons for Iraq at the Yarmouk facility. Government officials denied the charge. The attack destroyed part of the compound infrastructure, killed two people and injured another.</p> <p>In April last year, Sudan said it had irrefutable evidence that Israeli attack helicopters had carried out a missile and machine-gun strike on a car south of Port Sudan. That attack mirrored a similar strike by foreign aircraft on a truck convoy reportedly laden with weapons in eastern Sudan in January 2009. That too is widely believed to have been carried out Israel.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>Confucious says a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single<br>step. Andre Villas-Boas says I want to win the Europa League. Football<br>fans say you might start by actually winning a match in<br>the tournament. So far Spurs have taken only small steps on the road<br>to the manager's desired destination, drawing their opening matches<br>against Lazio and Panaathinaikos. Tonight's tussle could bring their first<br>victory. Maribor, who are nine points clear at the top of the<br>Slovenian league, are talking up their chances of toppling Tottenham,<br>pointing out that they have won three of their four home European<br>matches this season by at least three goals (and glossing over the<br>fact that the other brought a 1-0 defeat by Dinamo Zagreb). They've<br>also been highlighting how intimidating the atmosphere will be in<br>their stadium. But it can't be that daunting because Birmingham City<br>won there last season. What's more, while Spurs are without new dad<br>Gareth Bale, Maribor also have significant absentees, with Nejc<br>Potokar and Rajko Rep injured and Jovan Vidovi\u010d suspended. Still,<br>Spurs lapsed into complacency to only draw against Panathinaikos in their last match despite being obviously more skilled and a repeat of such slackness could be costly - but at least topical, what with this being a week in which the decadence of English clubs has been badly exposed by European rivals.</p> <p>The teams are in ... and Michael Dawson is out, owing to a severe migraine. Let's not have any jokes about the stress of being linked with a January transfer to leaky Southampton. </p> <p><strong>Maribor:</strong> Handanovic, Milec, Rajcevic, Arghus, Mejac, Mertelj, Cvijanovic, Mezga, Tavares, Ibraimi, Beric. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Pridigar, Filipovic, Komazec, Ploj, Viler, Dodlek, Lesjak.</p> <p><strong>Tottenham:</strong> Lloris, Walker, Caulker, Vertonghen, Naughton, Sandro, Huddlestone, Lennon, Sigurdsson, Townsend, Defoe. <strong>Subs:</strong> Cudicini, Dempsey, Gallas, Falque, Livermore, Smith, Parrett.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Sergei Karasev (Russia)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Maribor get the game going amid a rocking atmosphere in the small but impressive Ljudski stadium.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Some pointers to help you picture proceedings: Vertonghen is in his preferred position of centreback; Townsend is on the left-hand side of midfield; and Sigurdsson might have scored just now as he collected a sloppy attempted clearance by Milec but slashed an equally sloppy shot wide from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> The locals are amusing themselves with some slow handclapping, and it appears to inspire their heroes on the pitch as Cvijanovic canters through midfield and then slips a nice ball through for Beric, who shoots into the net ... before realising the flag was already up for offside.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> It's been quite a stodgy start by Spurs, who are allowing Maribor plenty of possession at the moment...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Lloris hurtles off his line to collect an attempted through-ball to Beric, who was being watched by Caulker so probably wouldn't have got to it even if the keeper had not intervened. But Spurs could do with showing a bit more assertiveness going forward. They've yet to piece anything of note together.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> The camera focuses on Defoe, just to remind us that he is on the pitch. The striker has been as bereft of service as bolshy hotel guests. Spurs haven't got going at all.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Huddlestone sweeps a trademark expansive pass out to the right wing, where Townsend collects it. Faced with two defenders he turns back and rolls it to Naughton, who sends a hopefull cross towards the back post. It floats over Defoe and the defenders and out for a goal kick. Uninspired Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Townsend embarks on an almost Bale-esque run down the left .but then delivers a Walcott-esque cross.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> An errant pass by Sigurdsson cedes possession to Cvijanovic. The Icelander attempts to redeem himself by winning the ball back but instead commits a foul.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Huddlestone hoiks a long freekick from wide on the left towards the back stick. Vetonghen rises to try to meet it and so does the keeper; but both miss it and it bounces harmlessly wide. This game is starting to take on a certain lullaby quality.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> After a long period of Maribor possession, Walker wins the ball back and then nips it in-field to Sandro, who fires a nice low long ball forward to Defoe, who turns nicely before the defence recovers. Still, Spurs retain possession and reinforcements soon arrive, including Walker, who's feeling lucky and thus has a bash from 25 yards. Not only is he unlucky but so is the photographer sitting 15 yards to the left of the goal, who almost cops the ball plum in the face.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Spurs are starting to take the initiative and are moving the ball about with greater speed and purpose. Walker is a growing influence down the right and Lennon is getting more involved too. And when they did eventually lose possession just now, Defoe showed fine strength and timing to regain it and feed Lennon, whose dinked cross was headed behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Huddlestone clips another freekick into the danger zone. I say danger zone, but Sigurdsson's subsequent header was anything but threatening. Handy save for Handovic.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Spurs seem to have taken full control now. Maribor are reduced to scurrying around after them: so far they're doing it sufficiently well to prevent the visitors from creating truly clear chances but a Spurs breakthrough is starting to look inevitable. And on that note, Sandro strides forwards and let fly from the 20 yards .... and the ball whizzes narrowly wide.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>34 min: </strong> Huddlestone dinks a nice ball into the box, where Sandro, becoming increasingly adventurous, nods it down for Defoe, who booms over the bar from 14 yards. \"As a Spurs fan I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do here,\" blubs John. \"Last season I was so happy when Chelsea progressed in the CL purely because I hoped that it would affect their already dodgy league form and allow Spurs into the top four - yeah, that both did and didn't work out so well. I'm not that keen on this competition, but the manager seems to want to<br>win it. So a quick exit will probably help league form, but then staying in for a<br>bit would raise confidence and the clubs profile and help with player<br>recruitment... Having said that, 'Arry's policy of playing the reserve team at least meant that the players were excited to be out there and fully committed.\" I'm not sure a quick exit would really help league form. AVB says that he has fielded strong sides in this tournament not only because he wants to win it but also because he feels the players needs as much time as possible playing together with his new methods.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Mejac relieves the pressure on his side ... and almost lands a splendid sucker punch, charging down the left before cutting in-field and lashing a wicked shot inches wide from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> A flowing Spurs counter-attack comes to an end due to a oafish touch by Sigurdsson, who's having something of a shocker so far.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Maribor 1-0 Spurs (Beric 41')</strong> Totally against the run of play but what a fine goal! Aided, it must be said, by Spurs' slackness. First Townsend lost the ball inside his own half and then Mejac set about enacting the very definition of a mazey dribble, one that takes him all the way into the Spurs six-yard box. Lloris rushes out to curtail his spree and the full-back flips it inside, where Beric arrives to knock it into the net from close range!</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> No penalty! Lennon goes down under a challenge by a defender I can't identify and the ref reckons waves play on. No Spurs players appealed but it looks a foul to me (though I haven't seen a replay).</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Their manager may want to win this tournament but for a significant portion of this half Spurs have played like a side with Redknapp-levels of enthusiasm for the Europa League. They did improve as the half progressed - in fact, they took full control for a 15-minute spell ... immediately prior to Beric's goal. So there is hope for AVB that his team will overturn this deficit. If they don't, their chances of progressing in the tournament will be severely compromised.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Spurs kick-off successfully. Well, that's something.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Spurs have also made a change, with Townsend taken off and replaced by Falqu\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Walkers tries to get up a gallop down the right but is sabotaged blatantly by Mezga, who deservedly gets booked. Doubltess Huddlestone will launch another long freekick into the box. Yes, he does. Caulker wins it but Maribor clear his nod-down before Defoe can connect.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Mesga shows his good side, turndling down the left and flicking a decent pass into Tavares, who hits it on the run ... but straight at Lloris.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Huddlestone's passing is starting to get annoying. His constant lofts into the box look elegant but are seldom finding a team-mate and even hint at laziness. A bit more imagination is required.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Tottenham have most of the ball but the hosts are full of vim and vigour when they counter; and Ibrami came close to notching a second goal just now, banging just over from the edge of the area.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Falque skitters down the left and then ignores Defoe to try to pick out Sandro at the back post. his cross is deflected behind for a corner, which Maribor repel easily. Elsewhere in this group, Lazio are leading 1-0 against Panathinaikos.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Maribor 1-1 Spurs (Sigurdsson 58')</strong> Luck at last for Sigurdsson! Sandro made a terrific break into the box before his cross ran to the far side of the box, where Falque tapped it inside to Defoe. The striker's rocket shot from eight yards seemed certain to blaze into the net but bounced out off an unaware but well-positioned defender. Happily for the visitors it fell into the path of Siguardsson, who bundled it over the line from close range.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Spurs find themselves short at the back and Naughton, faced with two attackers, can do nothing about it. Fortunately for them, Cvijanovic blasts into the sidenetting from 16 yards.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Much innocuous passing by Spurs ends when an extravagant flick by Falque goes to an opponent. Extravagant and rubbish, then.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Metelj tests Lloris with a shot from distance. But it's the football equivalent of a spelling test featuring words such as cat, pig and plod. A+ for the unchallenged keeper.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> A Sigurdsson shot from the edge of the area deflects up into the air. Falque takes it down (or rather, waits for it to come down, since he has not jetpack) and then lays it back to Defoe, whose shot gets another deflection, this time into the keeper's arms.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Oh la la! A jinking run by the Naughton - down the left and into the box - ends when a defender stretches out his leg and Naughton goes down. And Naughton gets booked for diving! Good! It's true that there was contact but what this ref has understood, and what many people don't, is that CONTACT DOES NOT NECESSARILY EQUATE TO A FOUL. Naughton could easily have stayed on his feet, he was not impeded in any meaningful way.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Spurs substitution:</strong> Sigurdsson, who has failed to sparkle despite his goal, is replaced by Dempsey.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> (Should have been a) GOAL! Rajcevic broke free beautifully in midfield and then supplied Mejac, who sent a fine low cross towards the penalty spot. Beric fails to apply a proper connection, scuffing it badly wide to let Tottenham off.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Dempsey has a ging from 25 yards. It bobbles towards the keeper, who isn't in the mood to dispense any Rob Green-style favours to the American.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Maribor are defending well, and Spurs are not showing enough imagination to overcome them.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Walker balloons a shot into the stands from 30 yards. That's an instance when hitting someone in the face has the reverse effect of shutting them up: because the delighted Slovenian fans chanted louder after Walker's wayward effort.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Spurs change: Sandro off, Livermore on.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Spurs have most of the ball but Maribor remain dangerous when they break: only a solid intervention by Vertonghen stopped them from creating another chance just now.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> After a slow but progressive build-up by Spurs, Vertonghen enters the fray ... and almost settles the match.

  "<p>Britain has rebuffed US pleas to use military bases in the UK to support the build-up of forces in the Gulf, citing secret legal advice which states that any pre-emptive strike on Iran could be in breach of international law.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that US diplomats have also lobbied for the use of British bases in Cyprus, and for permission to fly from US bases on Ascension Island in the Atlantic and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, both of which are British territories.</p> <p>The US approaches are part of contingency planning over the nuclear standoff with Tehran, but British ministers have so far reacted coolly. They have pointed US officials to legal advice drafted by the attorney general's office which has been circulated to Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>This makes clear that Iran, which has consistently denied it has plans to develop a nuclear weapon, does not currently represent \"a clear and present threat\". Providing assistance to forces that could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be a clear breach of international law, it states.</p> <p>\"The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,\" said a senior Whitehall source. \"It is explicit. The government has been using this to push back against the Americans.\"</p> <p>Sources said the US had yet to make a formal request to the British government, and that they did not believe an acceleration towards conflict was imminent or more likely. The discussions so far had been to scope out the British position, they said.</p> <p>\"But I think the US has been surprised that ministers have been reluctant to provide assurances about this kind of upfront assistance,\" said one source. \"They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well. That has come as a bit of a surprise.\"</p> <p>The situation reflects the lack of appetite within Whitehall for the UK to be drawn into any conflict, though the Royal Navy has a large presence in the Gulf in case the ongoing diplomatic efforts fail.</p> <p>The navy has up to 10 ships in the region, including a nuclear-powered submarine. Its counter-mine vessels are on permanent rotation to help ensure that the strategically important shipping lanes through the Strait of Hormuz remain open.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that a British military delegation with a strong navy contingent flew to US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, earlier this summer to run through a range of contingency plans with US planners.</p> <p>The UK, however, has assumed that it would only become involved once a conflict had already begun, and has been reluctant to commit overt support to Washington in the buildup to any military action.</p> <p>\"It is quite likely that if the Israelis decided to attack Iran, or the Americans felt they had to do it for the Israelis or in support of them, the UK would not be told beforehand,\" said the source. \"In some respects, the UK government would prefer it that way.\"</p> <p>British and US diplomats insisted that the two countries regarded a diplomatic solution as the priority. But this depends on the White House being able to restrain Israel, which is nervous that Iran's underground uranium enrichment plant will soon make its nuclear programme immune to any outside attempts to stop it.</p> <p>Israel has a less developed strike capability and its window for action against Iran will close much more quickly than that of the US, explained another official. \"The key to holding back Israel is Israeli confidence that the US will deal with Iran when the moment is right.\"</p> <p>With diplomatic efforts stalled by the US presidential election campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/diplomatic-defusing-iranian-nuclear-crisis\" title=\"\">a new push to resolve the crisis</a> will begin in late November or December.</p> <p>Six global powers will spearhead a drive which is likely to involve an offer to lift some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy in return for Tehran limiting its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p> <p>The countries involved are the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. Iran will be represented by its chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"As we continue to make clear, the government does not believe military action against Iran is the right course of action at this time, although no option is off the table. We believe that the twin-track approach of pressure through sanctions, which are having an impact, and engagement with Iran is the best way to resolve the nuclear issue. We are not going to speculate about scenarios in which military action would be legal. That would depend on the circumstances at the time.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office said it would not disclose whether the attorney general's advice has been sought on any specific issue.</p> <p>A US state department official said: \"The US and the UK co-ordinate on all kinds of subjects all the time, on a huge range of issues. We never speak on the record about these types of conversations.\"</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned at the UN general assembly last month that Iran's nuclear programme would reach Israel's \"red line\" by \"next spring, at most by next summer\", implying that Israel might then take military action in an attempt to destroy nuclear sites and set back the programme.</p> <p>That red line, which Netanyahu illustrated at the UN with a marker pen on a picture of a bomb, is defined by Iranian progress in making uranium enriched to 20%, which would be much easier than uranium enriched to 5% to turn into weapons-grade material, should Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, take the strategic decision to abandon Iran's observance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and try to make a weapon. Tehran insists it has no such intention.</p> <p>In August, the most senior US military officer, General Martin Dempsey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/israeli-attack-iran-not-stop-nuclear\" title=\"\">distanced himself from any Israeli plan to bomb Iran</a>. He said such an attack would \"clearly delay but probably not destroy Iran's nuclear programme\".</p> <p>He added: \"I don't want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the evening of 5 April 2009, Luigi Guigno of L'Aquila in Italy was phoned by a sister terrified by tremors under their village. He told her not to worry. Government experts in \"the forecasting and prevention of major risks\" had just been on the news declaring there to be \"no danger\" of an earthquake. They need not go out into the street. A few hours later an earthquake struck and Luigi, his pregnant wife, their son and 300 others were crushed to death.</p> <p>This week a local judge jailed six of the scientists, not for failing to predict the quake but for giving what he regarded as reckless reassurances. He fined them \u00a36m and disbarred them from public office. World <a href=\"http://science.time.com/2012/10/24/scientific-illiteracy-why-the-italian-earthquake-verdict-is-even-worse-than-it-seems/\" title=\"\">scientists condemned the verdict</a> as inquisitorial and medieval. Britain's <a href=\"http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/view/may_r.htm\" title=\"\">Lord May</a> said it ignored the basic nature of scientific inquiry. Luigi's relatives disagreed. A local official said simply: \"Some scientists didn't do their job.\"</p> <p>When a forester fails to predict that a tree might fall and it kills someone, he is arrested. The same goes for a train mechanic who fails to repair a carriage, a cook who poisons a customer and a builder whose house collapses. They didn't mean to kill, but they failed to forecast what might ensue from their defective expertise.</p> <p>Why does the same not apply to the professional scientists, experts and pundits on whose predictive genius so much of our life depends? The answer is that they claim protection, either through (usually weak) self-regulation or by pleading Lord May's fifth amendment, that the nature of scientific inquiry exonerates them of harmless mistakes.</p> <p>This week agriculture ministers were left floundering by conflicting scientific guidance on bovine TB and badgers. Transport ministers were humiliated by statisticians failing to predict revenue on the west coast railway. The Totnes MP, Sarah Wollaston, called attention to the hysterical 2009 swine flu \"forecast\", which panicked Whitehall into blowing \u00a3500m on dubious Tamiflu, whose test results it refused to disclose.</p> <p>Yesterday we were told that the nation was recovering from a second \"dip\" in a recession, which its forecasters had failed to predict. This is despite government economists being served by ever more powerful computers and mathematical models. No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been called to account for this failure.</p> <p>Science has rarely enjoyed greater status. Schools are in thrall to it. Broadcasters grovel at its feet, with hours of programmes devoted to children gazing adoringly at scientific researchers, depicted as funny, garrulous, lovable role models. Science has taken the place of religion in a cocoon of uncritical certainty. Those who claim the title \"scientist\", be it natural or social, expect to combine the immunity of diplomats and the infallibility of popes. Science is merging into scientology.</p> <p>Of course, Lord May is right, that academic inquiry must proceed uninhibited by risk from error. That is what universities are for, and why they should stay independent of the state. But the Italian geologists were not doing research: they were paid to apply their expertise to keep the public safe. They were not researching, but advising. They failed catastrophically.</p> <p>The truth is that there is one law for the officer class and another for the poor bloody infantry. When experts trained to detect seismic phenomena fail, their fraternity does not criticise or review their work, but treats them as innocent and relieves them of blame. If an ordinary worker miscalculates the risk, if trains crash, trees fall, rivers are polluted or foodstuffs rot, he goes to jail. The difference is not in class of error but in class of person.</p> <p>Since the dawn of time, people have craved prediction against uncertainty. They have paid soothsayers, witchdoctors, stargazers and palmists. They ask journalists at parties: \"Who is going to win the American election?\" and seem cheated if the reply is \"I just don't know.\"</p> <p>Some people are paid to forecast. Their job is to make assertions about the future, assessing likelihood over a spectrum of certainty. When a scientist says this or that \"will happen\", we expect it to have greater credence than if he had merely gazed into the entrails of a sacred goose.</p> <p>The worst offenders are meteorologists. A Devon entrepreneur, <a href=\"http://www.thisisdevon.co.uk/Tourism-boss-vows-sue-Met-Office-needlessly/story-17024944-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Rick Turner</a>, declared last month that he would sue the Met Office for inaccurate and \"persistently pessimistic\" forecasts, which had cost his region millions of pounds in lost revenue. I hope he wins. The gloomy Met Office, seemingly in the pay of the outbound tourism trade, is reckless with other's people's livelihoods. The weather on the Welsh coast this summer was not ideal, but it bore not the slightest resemblance to the daily \"forecast\" of it on the radio. The sun shone for far more hours than it rained, yet the forecast kept people away in droves. And there was never any hint of correction or apology.</p> <p>Prediction matters to people. If the variables are too great, science should shut up, rather than peddle spurious expertise. But you can wave a banknote in a pundit's face and he will predict anything you like. Of course, it is outrageous to jail scientists for honest errors, but it is not outrageous to hold them to some account. When did Lord May's Royal Society last inquire into a scientific scandal? Journalists, like bankers, are getting hell these days for their mistakes. Why let seismologists off the hook?</p>",
  "<p>The owners of Penguin and Random House are in talks about merging their publishing arms to create the world's biggest books publisher.</p> <p>Pearson, which owns Penguin and the Financial Times, confirmed on Thursday that it has entered into merger discussions with Bertelsmann, the privately owned German company that owns Random House.</p> <p>A merger would bring together two of the world's \"big six\" publishers to create a new powerhouse that would publish 25% of all books sold in the UK. The combined company's authors would include TV chef Jamie Oliver, Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James and diver Tom Daley.</p> <p>A Pearson spokesman confirmed the merger talks were active, but said the companies \"have not reached agreement, and there is no certainty that the discussions will lead to a transaction\".</p> <p>Bertelsmann, which is Europe's biggest media group and owns broadcaster RTL and X Factor producer FremantleMedia, declined to comment.</p> <p>Analysts have long predicted a further round of consolidation in the book trade, which is dominated by HarperCollins, Random House, Hachette, Simon &amp; Schuster, Macmillan and Penguin. The industry has changed rapidly in recent years following the introduction of ebook readers and mass-market selling via supermarkets.</p> <p>The merger discussions come just weeks after Pearson chief executive Dame Marjorie Scardino announced her intention to stand down as after 15 years at the helm. Her exit sparked speculation that the FT could be sold \u2013 she had vowed that would only happen \"over my dead body\".</p> <p>Analysts believe Pearson's new chief executive, John Fallon, who lacks a publishing background, could be willing to sell both the FT and Penguin, as neither division fits into Pearson's strategic vision of concentrating on becoming a dominant force in the education sector.</p> <p>Lorna Tilbian, head media analyst at Numis, said it was \"no surprise\" the big publishers were exploring the possibility of merging. \"Consolidation is the order of the day, and technology and tablet computers have given it extra momentum. They [publishers] have got to gang together to have enough clout to take on the technology giants that have transformed the industry,\" she said. \"I can see a world where Apple, Amazon and Google become the 21st century equivalent of Time Warner, News Corp and Walt Disney, but they won't [just] be running the technology and content, but also distribution.\"</p> <p>Tilbian said a merger would probably reduce the likelihood of an FT sell-off because a merger in which Bertelsmann takes a majority stake would provide Pearson with cash to invest in its core education business.</p> <p>Speculation about the merger was first reported by German publication <a href=\"http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/0,2828,862777,00.html\" title=\"\">Manager Magazin</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AJqiheKM\" title=\"\">FT</a> (paywall). Manager Magazin said the publishers had already begun talks with US and EU competition authorities. It said Bertelsmann would end up with the majority of the combined company, with Pearson taking a less-than-50% stake. A source at Random House told the magazine that negotiations were \"promising\".</p> <p>The joining together of Penguin, which has annual sales of almost \u00a31bn, and Random House, with \u00a31.4bn, is likely to lead to a regulatory investigation, but Tilbian pointed out that regulators allowed the music industry to be consolidated down to just three big players.</p> <p>Phil Jones, editor of trade magazine the Bookseller, said: \"The merger of Penguin and Random House would create a powerhouse of a consumer publisher across books, ebooks and apps. In the UK, the combined market share takes them beyond 25%, meaning any deal would likely face some kind of scrutiny from competition authorities. Even if they had to sell bits of the businesses to make it happen, it would still create by far the largest such group in the English-speaking world.</p> <p>\"But the deal makes sense: Amazon's market share of physical and ebooks in the UK is fast approaching 40%, with competition now only really provided by equally huge tech giants such as Apple and Google. Publishers simply need greater muscle if they're going to have a presence on these new platforms and a say in how these markets develop.</p> <p>\"Agents and authors will be concerned as it takes out two competitors for their content, but what they can do together means that it is now almost certainly worth whatever negatives arise out of the consolidation of these two well managed businesses. Though these kind of mergers have been predicted recently, we actually haven't seen a deal of this size in publishing for six years, but this, I think, provides the first hint of what the future shape of publishing will look like.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two Serbian players involved in a melee at the end of an Under-21 European Championship qualifier with England that also sparked a racism row have been banned from international football for a year.</p> <p>The Serbian Football Association suspended Nikola Ninkovic and Ognjen Mudrinski from all national teams and banned coaches Srdjan Maksimovic and Andreja Milutinovic from working at any level for two years. It said all four had \"violated the ethics and fair play code\".</p> <p>The brawl in Krusevac followed a last-minute winner for England and Danny Rose being sent off when he kicked the ball away in frustration after being subjected to racist abuse from the stands throughout the game.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath, the Serbian FA went on the attack. It claimed there had been no racist chanting, despite a series of incidents being logged by the FA that reached a crescendo at the end of the match, and accused Rose of acting in an \"inappropriate\" and \"vulgar\" manner. Uefa charged both countries over the behaviour of their players and Serbia over racist chanting from the stands.</p> <p>The scenes provoked a furious response, with many calling on Serbia to be banned altogether from international football and others suggesting Uefa's response would be a litmus test for its desire to take racism seriously. The FA suggested it could boycott matches in Serbia in protest and the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, wrote to the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to underline the seriousness of the allegations.</p> <p>Tomislav Karadzic, the president of the Serbian FA, last week issued a qualified apology for his players' involvement in the post-match brawl but maintained there had been no racist chanting. \"The Serbian people have never been, nor will be, racist,\" he said. \"The crowd's reaction to the defeat should not be confused with one of the greatest evils of the modern era.\"</p> <p>After the sanctions were handed down the former Serbia international Savo Milosevic, who is now his country's director of national teams, condemned the behaviour of the players and officials involved.</p> <p>\"First of all, I do not dare to comment on the sentence. Regardless of that, I would suggest that in the future this or similar behaviour will not be tolerated,\" he said. \"As such it is not and will never be acceptable to all those in the Serbian FA.\"</p> <p>Uefa's control and disciplinary panel will meet on 22 November to decide on sanctions against both sides. After the match, the FA general secretary, Alex Horne, said it would be forced to \"question the viability\" of sending teams to Serbia in future.</p>",
  "<p><strong>In your new film, Sister, you're known as \"the English Lady\". How English do you feel?</strong></p> <p>I feel very English until I'm in America, and then I feel very American. I was always teased at primary school \u2013 I was \"the yank\", even though I had British accent. I would have thought I would feel more like an imposter now, but I don't. I have been in the UK for the past 10 years, but Britain has been such a through-line throughout my life because my parents still had a flat in Haringey, north London, and we used to come back in the summer. During hiatuses from the X-Files I would come back and rent a flat in London.</p> <p><strong>The film is a very literal representation of the split between rich and poor. Is that growing divide something you spend much time thinking about?</strong></p> <p>I do think about it a lot. I'm involved in a couple of charities to do with kids who have come from the street, or the disenfranchised, but also I've always had a weighty guilt that has followed me in my success. It probably came in with the first paycheck I got, which was more than anything my parents had ever seen. I have a feeling that I need to keep moving all the time to justify how lucky I am. I'm constantly asking myself, whether or not I follow through with it, \"Do I need this?\" Just in terms of the clutter in one's life. I have a tendency to clutter without thinking about the consequences to other people, where things have come from, where and how things are made.

What was that like?</strong></p> <p>I'm still not sure I really know. We were shooting in Vancouver, so there was a certain amount of protection and separation \u2013 we weren't in Los Angeles and leaving our houses every day with paparazzi following us. There were times when paparazzi would come up, if David was dating Winona Ryder, that kind of stuff. It was almost too much to take in that I think I split myself \u2013 \"that\" is somebody else, and I'm just going to work and raising a child and trying to do these hours without collapsing. It felt very separate from what the rest of the world thinks.</p> <p><strong>From what I've read, you consider yourself to be a feminist. How do you square that with your decisions to pose for men's magazines in your underwear? Do you regret that now?</strong></p> <p>I think I had quite a low level of respect for myself and I think it was quite easy for me to not necessarily use my sexuality, but not honour it. I might have been speaking quite strongly about feminism, but somehow I could also say [at a shoot]: \"Oh, you've run out of clothes? I don't mind doing the next bit on the bed.\" Somehow, I did make them unrelated in my mind. I think it's only in the past 10 or 15 years that I've started to look at the discrepancy there, and what it represents for women.</p> <p><strong>Do you think there are better roles for women on TV than in film?</strong></p> <p>It seems like that. It's like the world of television allows for professional women and working mothers and complicated female characters.

  "<p>About a third of universities in the elite Russell Group have suffered a drop in their undergraduate intake this year, after government changes to the way institutions recruit students.</p> <p>Vice-chancellors at the universities concerned fear they may have to cut spending on widening access to poorer students.</p> <p>Wendy Piatt, the director-general of the Russell Group, which represents 24 of the UK's most sought-after universities, told a BBC Radio 4 documentary that about a third of the group's English institutions had lost out.</p> <p>She said: \"Having far fewer students than planned does create a real financial hit. It's hard to give a very accurate number, but across the Russell Group it may amount to something like \u00a380m. It's a significant amount of money.\"</p> <p>Universities can now recruit an unlimited number of the highest performing students, those who achieve A-level grades of AAB or above, under coalition changes intended to give more students their first choice.</p> <p>However, all English universities are capped on the number of students they can recruit at lower grades.</p> <p>After A-level results were published this summer, there was fierce competition for a small pool of high-performing students in clearing. Some leading universities have been left with spare capacity after failing to attract enough of these students.</p> <p>At Southampton University, the UK undergraduate intake is down by more than 600 on 2011, a decline the vice-chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/06/university-southampton-fall-undergraduate-intake\" title=\"\">has described as a \"wake-up call\"</a>.</p> <p>In an interview for the documentary, the business secretary, Vince Cable, who is responsible for universities, said that overall the policy has worked.</p> <p>\"It's experimental,\" he said. \"Essentially what we're trying to do is to free up an almost Soviet style system of numbers control. We're monitoring this fairly closely but the underlying reasoning behind it is to give a bit more freedom to the university sector and to students \u2026 because at the moment it's very, very tightly controlled and very inefficient in a rather Stalinist way.\"</p> <p>Next year the government will take deregulation of student numbers further. Universities will be allowed to recruit as many students as they like from the wider pool of school-leavers with A-level grades of ABB or equivalent.</p> <p>Many vice-chancellors welcome the prospect of greater freedom, but warn of the consequences of an unexpected dip in income after this year's changes. Piatt said: \"There'll be lots of efforts to make sure the students don't notice that, but it will have an effect.</p> <p>\"We are battling already with increased costs in trying to get the very best teachers for those students and we are competing with universities across the world for the very best academics and trying to invest in programmes to reach out to the poorer students. We would hope that the money for those activities and for bursaries to help students wouldn't be affected but there are going to be some tough choices that vice-chancellors are going to have to make.\"</p> <p>Separately, a study of the government's student loans policy has said ministers' assessment of the net cost of loans depends on \"highly uncertain and unrealistic assumptions\".</p> <p>The study by the <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Policy Institute</a> in Oxford says the effect of student loans on inflation could lead to a rise in the cost of benefits such as pensions. The rate of inflation is used to calculate pensions and other state benefits.</p> <p>The thinktank's director, Bahram Bekhradnia, said: \"We think that the government has badly underestimated what loans will cost them because they have made unrealistic, and in some cases, wrong assumptions.</p> <p>\"One of these is that they have assumed average fees of \u00a37,500. We know that average fees are over \u00a38,200. They haven't changed their assumption.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the government has also supposed the salary increases achieved by graduates will be spread out evenly, Bekhradnia said.</p> <p>In reality, the report argues, the highest earning graduates have had substantial salary increases over the past 30 years, with modest increases at most for those earning less.</p> <p>This could have an impact on the loan repayments the government receives.</p> <p><em>Universities Challenged is on BBC Radio 4 at 11am on Friday.</em></p>",

Harry knows my aunt Barbara.</p> <p><strong>It's quite an odd thing to be in a tussle between politicians.</strong></p> <p>But you know, I keep saying it, I feel like a broken record but we're neutral. We've never really embraced one side or the other, or used our success to really preach like that.</p> <p><strong>How many times have interviewers asked whether you're human or dancer?</strong></p> <p>Probably about 50. I give different answers. But I don't know that I've ever said dancer. I'm not a great dancer.</p> <p><strong>Mormons are not supposed to drink alcohol. So have you never been drunk?</strong></p> <p>I have been drunk. I haven't drank in five or six years. And I will probably never be drunk again.</p> <p><strong>You live in Vegas. It seems quite brash: all sex and gambling. A bit like Blackpool.</strong></p> <p>I've been to Blackpool. It's not like Blackpool.</p> <p><strong>You were a Vegas hotel bellman. What does that job involve?</strong></p> <p>Say you want to kill a couple of hours before your plane and you want to go and gamble or get a hooker, you leave your bags with me. You'd come back when you're finished and you would give me your tag and I would give you your bag. And you would tip me.</p> <p><strong>For Brits visiting America, the tipping thing can be very troubling. Like, when should you give them a dollar and when shouldn't you?</strong></p> <p>Don't ever give anyone a dollar.</p> <p><strong>Too low?</strong></p> <p>Yeah. Maybe if it was like 1965.</p> <p><strong>You recently had a debate on Swedish TV with prominent atheist Richard Dawkins <a href=\"#4\">(4</a><a name=\"4back\">)</a></strong>.</p> <p>Yeah, let me say this. I gave some decent answers that were edited out. So, the world is against the Christian man.</p> <p><strong>Did you know Dawkins was going on?</strong></p> <p>I found out the day before and I know who he is, and I knew about The God Delusion and all of those things. For him he sees the beauty in science proving something and finding out origins of things. And that's enough for him. Nothing that science will ever find will disprove that God had a hand in it, for me. So it's a useless debate. And nothing that has been found has changed the gospel that I believe in.</p> <p><strong>Did you speak to him on the phone afterwards, as was mooted?</strong></p> <p>No, I would like to. I have issues with him. He generalises things about my church and kind of drags it through the dirt a lot.</p> <p><strong>Are you working on this year's Killers Christmas single yet?</strong></p> <p>Well, let me just go back to it. It's just there's so much to be said by his behaviour and the way that he is in interviews, for the most part. I've seen other interviews with him.</p> <p><strong>Words like \"conman\" and \"fake\" did seem designed to provoke a reaction.</strong></p> <p>Yeah, and this is information that he's getting off the internet! [Laughs] He's this smart guy and getting his information from the wrong places. That was really what frustrated me.</p> <p><strong>Why would you want to speak to him again?</strong></p> <p>I'd like him to just stop dragging [my church] through the mud.</p> <p><strong>Which is unlikely to happen.</strong></p> <p>Oh it's fine. He's an unhappy old lemon tree. I'm a peach.</p> <h2><strong>Foot notes</strong></h2> <p><a name=\"1\">(1)</a><br><a href=\"#1back\">Back to article</a> <br>He can: Joshua, Luke, Brook, Seth, Rachel, Emily, Britney, Jake, Chase, Brianna, Cassidy, Taylor, Hayden, Caitlin, Alexis, Austin, Kyla and Ethan. <br><a name=\"2\">(2)</a><br><a href=\"#2back\">Back to article</a> <br>The other Brandon Flowers has played in the NFL since 2008. <br><a name=\"3\">(3)</a><br><a href=\"#3back\">Back to article</a> <br>They declined. <br><a name=\"4\">(4)</a><br><a href=\"#4back\">Back to article</a> <br>You can <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjwsG36XTZ8\" title=\"\">watch it on YouTube</a>.

  "<p>Alex Salmond has launched a damage limitation exercise to contain the political crisis over allegations that he lied about an independent Scotland's automatic entry into the EU.</p> <p>As opposition parties accused him of laying down a smokescreen, the first minister appointed a former Whitehall mandarin to conduct an independent inquiry into whether he had misled Holyrood about whether he had formal legal advice about Scotland's EU membership and so breached the ministerial code.</p> <p>His deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, had earlier appeared to offer a muted apology for the controversy which erupted on Tuesday after she revealed that her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland\" title=\"\">government had never asked Scotland's law officers for formal advice</a> on whether - as Salmond has repeatedly claimed - an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU without adopting the euro.</p> <p>Hours before Salmond faced a tempestuous first minister's questions at Holyrood, Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland: \"Given the fact that previously the impression had been created that we had legal advice, that we were not prepared to reveal because somehow it didn't suit our purposes, I think was an unfortunate one.\"</p> <p>Salmond's difficulties escalated further when it emerged that Spain's foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Margallo had abandoned his government's apparent neutrality on Scottish independence by stating that an independent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/24/scotland-eu-membership-spain\" title=\"\">Scotland would need to \"join the queue\"</a> to seek EU membership and gain the unanimous approval of all 27 member states.</p> <p>The controversy, potentially the worst crisis Salmond has faced as first minister, arose after it emerged he had stated in a BBC1 interview with Andrew Neil earlier this year that Scotland's law officers had given him legal advice on EU membership. Salmond said: \"We have, yes, in terms of the debate.\"</p> <p>At Holyrood, Salmond faced a barrage of allegations from opposition leaders. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, compared him with Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses, and the former US presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.</p> <p>Johann Lamont, the Scottish Labour leader, said Salmond had failed to ask his law officers basic questions about Scotland's future in EU in over five years in charge. \"The reality is that the first minister will say anything to get through the moment, and then asks us to take his assertions on trust. Doesn't he realise after this week, nobody trusts him,\" she said.</p> <p>At Westminster, Salmond was ridiculed by the leader of the Commons, Andrew Lansley, and the Labour MP for Glasgow South, Tom Harris.</p> <p>Harris asked whether the UK government would start a thorough search for Salmond's missing legal advice: \"We have searched everywhere for it, under the sofa, the first minister may have left it on a bus, his dog may have eaten it. We just don't know.\" Lansley replied: \"In this context, I suspect you would be better to instigate a search for the credibility of the first minister of Scotland.\"</p> <p>Salmond attempted to deflect their allegations by referring himself under the ministerial code. He said Sir David Bell, a former permanent secretary at the Department of Education and Skills and an assessor to the Leveson inquiry on press ethics, would investigate whether he had misled Holyrood and so broken the code.</p> <p>Salmond insisted he was being misunderstood. He said: \"Every major document which is published by the government is underpinned by law officers' advice. When we ask for specific advice, the law officers will give their opinion. It is absolutely clear what's being talked about is in terms of both the debate and the [Scottish government's policy] documents.\"</p> <p>His advisers, however, struggled to contain the controversy, refusing to confirm whether it was the Scottish government's in-house lawyers or the law officers themselves - the lord advocate and solicitor general - who had independently vetted the government's policy statements on independence and the EU.</p> <p>They were unable to confirm whether the Bell inquiry would consider Salmond's statements in the Andrew Neil interview, and also insisted Sturgeon had not been accepting responsibility for the confusion in her BBC interview earlier. They said she was merely referring to a misunderstanding by opposition politicians.</p> <p>Catherine Stihler, the Labour MEP whose freedom of information request on Salmond's EU legal advice helped to spark the controversy, said: \"This is a smokescreen by Alex Salmond. My question wasn't just about the ministerial code, it was about his abuse of power.</p> <p>\"I wanted to know why he went to court at the taxpayers' expense rather than answer simple questions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Vodafone's UK chief executive has launched a robust defence of the company's controversial record on tax, saying the mobile provider is one of the country's biggest contributors to the exchequer.</p> <p>Speaking from Vodafone's network control centre in Newbury, where the firm is preparing for the launch of a 4G mobile internet service next year, Guy Laurence called for an end to network \"bashing\" by British regulators.</p> <p>\"Can you name any other industry that has contributed as much to the HMRC as mobile phone companies pay when they pay for spectrum?\" he asked.</p> <p>Vodafone, whose corporation tax bill in the UK was zero last year, has been targeted by campaigners over its contribution to the exchequer. But the company stresses that it has handed over \u00a36bn in spectrum payments to the Treasury since the 3G auction in 2000.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, told the Labour party conference the estimated \u00a34bn raised from next January's airwaves auction could be used to pay for new homes.</p> <p>\"Is there another industry that is going to contribute as much to the Treasury as the mobile networks will in the 4G auction?\" asked Laurence. \"Ed Balls says the money we spend could pay for 100,000 homes. Who else could finance that?\"</p> <p>As Laurence became animated over questions on tax and the many legal threats that preceded a recent agreement to go ahead with the 4G sale, the army of identically dressed engineers sitting at computer terminals around him, Vodafone's self styled \"men in black\", remained calm and quiet.</p> <p>Their job is to manage the flow of traffic across the network, planning for national events such as the Olympics and traffic spikes generated by demonstrations, road accidents and floods. Vodafone's technological nerve centre is designed to be self-contained. With its own kitchens and power supply, in the event of an emergency the building can be shut off from the rest of the campus. The work done here is arguably the most critical of any UK network.</p> <p>Vodafone connects the mobile phones used by 80% of ambulance trusts, 75% of fire brigades and police forces, four in 10 UK businesses, government departments and, rumour has it, the prime minister himself.</p> <p>Which is why Laurence is content to take his time over launching Vodafone's 4G service. \"We believe 4G done well is better than 4G done quickly,\" he said in a thinly veiled reference to EE, the first 4G network, which goes live next week. The first out of the gates when its service goes live next Tuesday in 10 UK cities, EE is promising speeds five times faster than 3G.</p> <p>The company was able to launch early because it owns the most spectrum. The other UK networks must wait until after the auction to acquire the airspace they need to compete, meaning they face a six-month delay.</p> <p>According to a timetable set out by the regulator, Ofcom, the earliest auctioned spectrum can be released is April or May, because it is currently being used to broadcast digital TV channels. Laurence says he expects Vodafone's 4G to go live in \"late spring or early summer\".</p> <p>This gives time to integrate the firm's new purchase, business telecoms firm Cabe &amp; Wireless Worldwide. Thanks to CWW, Vodafone now owns the UK's largest fibre-optic network, which amounts to more than 12,500 miles of wiring.</p> <p>A third of Vodafone's base stations pass within 100m of CWW fibre, and work has now begun to plug them in. The better Vodafone's wiring, the more internet traffic it can carry.</p> <p>\"I can control the quality of service,\" Laurence said. \"We own our own network, we have other customers on it, but we have the Olympic lane and our 4G customers all go down that Olympic lane.\"</p> <p>He said that Vodafone's signal would give better indoor coverage than EE's, because the British group owns more low frequency spectrum. As anyone who has tried to sleep through a neighbour's party knows, base frequencies travel through walls much better than higher frequency sounds.</p> <p>\"We believe that the indoor connection is critical to 4G because two-thirds of activity in mobile is indoors,\" Laurence said. \"Not all 4Gs are equal.\"</p>",

  "<p>Two of Britain's biggest power providers have shelved plans worth almost \u00a32.5bn to construct five new \"green\" power stations, blaming lack of government support.</p> <p>Renewable energy campaigners said the decision was bad news for jobs, for supply firms and for energy security in the UK, and urged ministers to end an \"institutional bias\" against new biomass plants.</p> <p>The Drax group was intending to spend \u00a32bn on three self-standing biomass plants in North Yorkshire and Humberside. Centrica, meanwhile, intended to introduce one in Cumbria and another in Lincolnshire at a cost believed to be worth more than \u00a3400m.</p> <p>But instead of building new wood-burning stations Drax is proceeding with a smaller \u00a3700m project that will convert half of its existing 4,000 megawatts (MW) coal-fired plant at Selby, North Yorkshire, to biomass. .</p> <p>The move follows a consultation document from the Department of Energy and Climate Change which not only proposes lowering the subsidy levels, from 2013, but also proposes a total cap on new-build UK biomass of 500MW.</p> <p>At one stage Britain was looking at the possibility of 5,000MW of new plant. But the government decided that it was more cost-effective to concentrate scarce public cash resources on converting carbon-heavy coal plants to wood burning.</p> <p>A DECC spokesman commented: \"We are determined to strike the right balance between encouraging investment in renewable electricity and ensuring value for money for consumers. That is why our proposed approach to support for new dedicated biomass plant recognises its relatively high cost of carbon saving compared to &#xa0;technologies like conversion and wind power.\"</p> <p>Drax said last spring that it would not proceed with a new biomass plant at Selby but has now shelved the wider scheme.</p> <p>\"It makes much more sense for us [to convert],\" said the finance director, Tony Quinlan, who added that the company was \"absolutely convinced\" it could burn wood in a genuinely sustainable way.</p> <p>Drax said on Thursday it had successfully raised \u00a3190m (of new funds) via a share placing as part of measures aimed at funding the switch of three of its six units from coal to wood power.</p> <p>The first phase of conversion will be ready to open in April 2013, with all three on stream by 2017 when a decision will be taken about whether to move to 100% wood burning.</p> <p>Drax will also be building plants on the US Gulf coast that will be able to process agricultural and forestry wood into pellets for shipping and eventual burning. The pellets will be kept on site at Selby in four enormous white PVC domes, the first of which has already been constructed.</p> <p>Drax, whose Selby plant is the largest coal-fired power station in western Europe, is changing to biomass because of legislation from the Europe commission bringing increasingly tough environmental regulations to polluting plants. The current Drax plant produces about 22m tonnes of carbon emissions annually, so the \u00a3700m investment will reduce this by half \u2013 the equivalent of taking 3m cars off the road \u2013 and create or save 4,000 jobs.</p> <p>Centrica said that the government's \"preference\" for switching coal plants to biomass rather than for new-build biomass meant it was not viable for the company to proceed with its proposed 80MW biomass power station on its Roosecote site in Cumbria, nor with a 137MW biomass power station adjacent to the company's gas-fired plant at Brigg.</p> <p>Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association, said the UK could not afford to have large companies such as Centrica dropping out of the biomass power sector.</p> <p>She said: \"This is bad news for employment, the supply chain and energy security. With a capacity crunch looming in 2015 the government should be doing its utmost to encourage such shovel-ready projects. It must act swiftly to repair investor confidence in biomass, and renewables in general. Right now the government seems to have an institutional bias against new biomass power projects.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012. The original said Drax will be building plants on the US Gulf coast that will be able to process wood into pallets for shipping and eventual burning. This has been corrected to say process wood into pellets.</p>",
  "<p>Training to become a lawyer is a competitive and expensive business. Unfortunately, finding where help comes from can be a challenge and a bit time-consuming. Here's a guide to what's on offer at the different stages of your journey into the law that might help make it a bit less bumpy.</p> <h2>Bar Professional Training Course and Pupillage </h2> <p>If it's the bar you're aiming for, the year-long Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) will set you back between \u00a310,000 to \u00a316,000. After that, it's pupillage. Pupil barristers receive an annual minimum salary of \u00a312,000, although some chambers pay more than that, depending on the practice area. Details of pupillages and funding arrangements are provided in The Pupillage Handbook, which is available free from the Bar Council or <a href=\"http://www.pupillages.com\" title=\"\">online</a>. You should also find a copy in your law library or careers office.</p> <p>If you secure a pupillage before you start the BPTC, your chambers may allow you to \"draw-down\" some of your pupillage award as an advance during your BPTC year. While this might ease the financial pain during your BPTC, it will obviously mean that you will receive less money during your pupillage year, so it is really only an option for those with relatively well-paid pupillages.</p> <p>Most of the funding available to help would-be barristers comes from the four inns of court.</p> <p>Between them, Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, Inner and Middle Temple provide about \u00a34.5m of awards each year.</p> <p>All of the inns award their scholarships and grants on merit, with financial need taken into account by some. Candidates may apply for a scholarship to one inn only and must be a member, so it is really important when you're picking which inn to join to have a look at the scholarships on offer and criteria used to award them.</p> <p>Further information on the scholarships and grants available are all available on the respective inns's websites. There are two key deadline dates; the first for those applying for GDL awards is in May and the second, for the major BPTC scholarships is 2 November, so if the latter is what you're going for, don't hang about.</p> <h2>Here's a brief overview of what's on offer: </h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.graysinn.info/\" title=\"\">Gray's Inn</a> offers around \u00a3850,000 worth of prizes and scholarships, \"irrespective of background\". Most awards are for the BPTC year, but they also cover the GDL and pupillage years.</p> <p>Gray's Inn also offers the Hebe Plunkett Award to assist students with disabilities, especially those with impaired eyesight.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk\" title=\"\">Lincoln's Inn</a> seems to be the most generous inn, offering \u00a31,578,000 of scholarships and awards for the next academic year. They include up to 32 scholarships of up to \u00a37,000 for the GDL and up to 70 scholarships of between \u00a36-18,000 for the BPTC year. Scholarships for the BPTC year can include accommodation awards in self-contained flats in the Inns.</p> <p>It has slightly more bizarre awards, such as the \u00a315,000 Tancred Studentships for the BPTC year, awarded to two male communicant members of the Church of England.</p> <p>Smaller awards are available to cover admission, call fee and dining charges, as well as funds to cover work placements in the European court of justice, the international criminal court and the European court of human rights.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.innertemple.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Inner Temple</a> will fund \u00a31,428,000 next year, including around 100 for the BPTC year, including one Peter Taylor Scholarship of \u00a320,000; one Stephen Chapman Scholarship of \u00a318,000 and five Princess Royal Scholarships of \u00a317,500 each.</p> <p>There is no minimum academic entry level restriction and the inn will interview all eligible candidates.</p> <p>Up to \u00a310,000 is available annually to help students or pupils who are affected by serious disability, who demonstrate financial need and who can show they have a reasonable prospect of being called to the bar. Grants are awarded at the discretion of the scholarships committee.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.middletemple.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Middle Temple</a> will offer around \u00a31m of funding next year, as well as hardship fund for those who experience serious and unexpected financial problems. The Inn commits to interview all applicants with a place on the BPTC for the BPTC awards.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thekalishertrust.org\" title=\"\">The Kalisher Awards </a></p> <p>Criminal barristers may be able to benefit from the scholarships offered each year by the Kalisher Scholarship Trust.</p> <p>Set up in 1996 in memory of Michael Kalisher QC, they cover the entire cost of the BPTC, but are awarded retrospectively at the end of the students' BPTC year. The awards are rotated around the participating BPTC providers, with the prizes going to students from the nominated provider each year.</p> <p>The trust provides funding for one place and the participating law school matches that funding by providing another place. Next year, the participating provider is the College of Law in Birmingham, but the trust hopes it will also be able to award a place at another law school too, with an additional place provided by that provider, making a total of four scholarships available.</p> <p>The trust also runs an essay competition in the summer (June/July) for pupils at criminal chambers, with a first prize worth \u00a35,000 and a second prize of \u00a32,000.</p> <h2>Bank loans <br></h2> <p>Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/23/training-to-be-a-solicitor-studying-law\" title=\"\">trainee solicitors</a>, those studying for the bar can, if all other avenues have proven fruitless, apply for a bank loan. The Bar Council and the inns of court set up the bar loans scheme in 2008 with HSBC to provide loans on preferential terms to those undertaking the BPTC.</p> <h2>Overseas students </h2> <p>Overseas students can get information about scholarships from the British Council and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p> <p>So, don't be put off. To inspire and encourage you, here's the difference that taking the time to find and apply for awards made to two students. If they can do it, so can you: Laura Morgans, currently on the BPTC at the College of Law in Birmingham, received a full scholarship from the college, after her electronic presentation on diversity at the bar impressed the former Bar Council chair Tim Dutton QC, who judged the submissions.</p> <p>She says: \"It's made a huge difference. Without it, I'd have nearly \u00a350,000 of debt by the time I finish.\"</p> <p>Laura worked full time for two years \u2013 at a national charity for the first year and in the NHS for the second \u2013 in order to save up the money to support herself through her legal studies. \"You have to do 48 hours a week of studying and it would be difficult to have to do a job as well,\" she says.</p> <p>As well as helping her financially, Laura says the award has improved her chances of pupillage. \"A lot of pupillage applications ask what scholarships you have \u2013 I can now tick that box.\"</p> <p>Getting the scholarship, says Laura, has also improved her confidence and self-belief. \"I felt very encouraged that someone in the profession like Tim Dutton, who judged it, thinks I have potential,\" she adds.</p> <p>Eloise Le Santo was a Inner Temple BPTC scholarship winner and is now a pupil at Matrix Chambers. She says she had always been interested in the bar, but for a long time a career as a barrister did not seem realistic. She left school before doing A-levels and had her first son relatively young. After getting married Eloise had another child and concentrated on being a mother. Her interest in the law remained and she nurtured that by working as an administrator at a magistrates' court and enrolling on a part time legal executive course at college.</p> <p>After her marriage broke down, and with a one-year old son, Eloise enrolled at the University of Lincoln.</p> <p>\"Some of my family thought I was crazy as they could not understand why I would want to get myself into so much debt and study full time with two small children. It turned out to be the best decision I have ever made,\" she says although the financial cost was daunting.</p> <p>\"Without the scholarship I would have found raising the funds for the BPTC very difficult, if not impossible,\" she says. Eloise still needed to take out a bank loan to cover her living costs, but she says that having the scholarship helped convince the bank to approve her loan.</p> <p>She adds: \"It undoubtedly strengthened my applications for jobs and pupillage as it showed that the Inn felt I had a reasonable chance of becoming a barrister. The fact that they were willing to take a gamble on me encouraged others to do the same.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when the pubs on Holloway Road would hum with pride at Arsenal's self-sustaining model and the impressive trick they pulled in moving to a state-of-the-art stadium while continuing to compete on the pitch. Not for them the arriviste tendencies of Chelsea or Manchester City; they would succeed \"the Arsenal way\".</p> <p>But that consensus has been shattered in recent years, with the takeover by the largely invisible US sports mogul, Stan Kroenke \u2013 who paid hundreds of millions of pounds to enrich Arsenal's \"custodian\" owners and take control in 2011 \u2013 and an ongoing trophy drought leading to a splintering of fan opinion.</p> <p>All sorts of old certainties are being challenged, on and off the pitch. Despite the plaudits for the new assistant coach, Steve Bould, earlier this season, Wednesday night's Champions League defeat marked the longest run without a clean sheet since 2004-05 at a club once famed for its defensive solidity.</p> <p>And the self-sustaining ethos that looked like a model of how to run a football club has given way to suspicions over what ticket income is being used for, questions over why money in the bank is lying unspent and concern over the long-term intentions of the US owner.</p> <p>Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal's well-remunerated and highly regarded chief executive, has always talked a good game and continued to do so at Thursday's fractious annual meeting.</p> <p>He has argued persuasively that renewal or replacement in 2014 of deals signed with Nike and Emirates to underwrite the move to the Emirates Stadium will turbocharge commercial revenues in the same way that matchday takings were boosted by the new ground.</p> <p>That major revenue boost, runs the theory, will dovetail with the introduction of Uefa and Premier League regulations that will force clubs to live within their means, to leave Arsenal in a pre-eminent position. That is why the club has not only been a vocal supporter of Uefa's Financial Fair Play plan, which came into force last season, but also of discussions at Premier League level to introduce cost controls.</p> <p>Revenues should top \u00a3300m by 2014-15, thanks to the Premier League's new \u00a33bn TV deal and the renegotiation of those commercial contracts, putting Arsenal among the top five earners in the world behind Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. Gazidis has also long preached that doing things \"the Arsenal way\" will help the club's commercial prospects, burnishing the brand as it seeks to compete globally.</p> <p>Arsenal's ability to compete has been squeezed in the short term by the move and the arrival of free spending benefactors at Stamford Bridge and the Etihad Stadium. The football side of the business runs at a loss, before player trading is taken into account. Arguably, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has helped paper over the cracks by maintaining a remarkably consistent level of performance.</p> <p>The latest accounts, published earlier this month, show a pre-tax loss of \u00a331m on football operations because revenues have not kept pace with wage inflation. The gap has been plugged by player sales and continued upside from the property deal that helped fund the stadium move. As the last of the property receipts roll in, the intention is that the hole will be more than filled by the new commercial deals.</p> <p>The promise of jam tomorrow is no longer enough for Arsenal fans paying the highest ticket prices in the country and stung by the loss of a string of marquee names. Yet even before the promised land of FFP is reached, the Arsenal Supporters' Trust estimates the club has around \u00a370m sitting in the bank that has not been spent.</p> <p>They fear Kroenke has broken his contract with Arsenal fans. His invisibility has extended to a failure to meet them as promised in his offer document and concerns about the future of the Fanshare scheme once held up as a model for fan engagement.</p> <p>Moreover, they fear that as long as the upward curve of income continues, Kroenke will measure success in financial terms, content to sit back and allow his asset to appreciate in value.</p> <p>Worse, he could look to take money out in the form of dividends. \"It would be a bitter pill to swallow if we were told to buy into self-sufficiency only to wake up one day and find our money had been taken out of the club,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Alisher Usmanov, the 29% shareholder without a seat on the board, continues to lurk in the background, having made his position clear in a devastating critique that coincided with the sale of Robin van Persie to Manchester United in the summer.</p> <p>Whatever the future holds on the pitch, and much may depend on the effectiveness of FFP, the club has used up whatever goodwill it once had and must now show disgruntled fans that the Emirates still represents the promised land.</p>",
  "<p>The United Nations is to set up a dedicated investigations unit in Geneva early next year to examine the legality of drone attacks in cases where civilians are killed in so-called \"targeted\" counter-terrorism operations.</p> <p>The announcement was made by Ben Emmerson QC, a UN special rapporteur, in a speech to Harvard law school in which he condemned secret rendition and waterboarding as crimes under international law. His forthright comments, directed at both US presidential candidates, will be seen as an explicit challenge to the prevailing US ideology of the global war on terror.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, Emmerson, who monitors counter-terrorism for the UN, called for effective investigations into drone attacks. Some US drone strikes in Pakistan may amount to war crimes, Emmerson warned.</p> <p>In his Harvard speech, he said: \"If the relevant states are not willing to establish effective independent monitoring mechanisms \u2026 then it may in the last resort be necessary for the UN to act.</p> <p>\"Together with my colleague Christof Heyns, [the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings], I will be launching an investigation unit within the special procedures of the [UN] Human Rights Council to inquire into individual drone attacks.\"</p> <p>The investigation unit will also look at \"other forms of targeted killing conducted in counter-terrorism operations, in which it is alleged that civilian casualties have been inflicted\". Emmerson maintained that the US stance that it can conduct counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaida or other groups anywhere in the world because it is deemed to be an international conflict was indefensible.</p> <p>\"The global war paradigm has done immense damage to a previously shared international consensus on the legal framework underlying both international human rights law and international humanitarian law,\" he said. \"It has also given a spurious justification to a range of serious human rights and humanitarian law violations.</p> <p>\"The [global] war paradigm was always based on the flimsiest of reasoning, and was not supported even by close allies of the US. The first-term Obama administration initially retreated from this approach, but over the past 18 months it has begun to rear its head once again, in briefings by administration officials seeking to provide a legal justification for the drone programme of targeted killing in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia \u2026</p> <p>\"[It is] alleged that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners. Christof Heyns \u2026 has described such attacks, if they prove to have happened, as war crimes. I would endorse that view.\"</p> <p>Emmerson singled out both President Obama and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney for criticism. \"It is perhaps surprising that the position of the two candidates on this issue has not even featured during their presidential elections campaigns, and got no mention at all in Monday night's foreign policy debate.</p> <p>\"We now know that the two candidates are in agreement on the use of drones. But the issue of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques is an one which, according to the record, continues to divide them.</p> <p>\"I should make it absolutely clear that my mandate does not see to eye to eye with the Obama administration on a range of issues \u2013 not least the lack of transparency over the drone programme. But on this issue the president has been clear since he took office that water-boarding is torture that it is contrary to American values and that it would stop.</p> <p>\"... But Governor Romney has said that he does not believe that waterboarding is torture. He has said that he would allow enhanced interrogation techniques that go beyond those now permitted by the army field manual, and his security advisers have recommended that he rescind the existing restrictions.\"</p> <p>The Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, he pointed out, used the technique. \"Anyone who is in doubt about whether waterboarding is torture should visit Tuol Sleng, the infamous S-21 detention facility operated by the Khymer Rouge in Phnom Penh.</p> <p>\"Over a period of four years 14,000 people were systematically tortured and killed there. It is now a genocide museum. And right there, in the middle of the central torturing room, is the apparatus used by Pol Pot's security officials for waterboarding.\"</p>",
  "<p>All but unnoticed by the wider world, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held an unscheduled t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate last week with the US's most despised bogeyman, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.</p> <p>Given deep disagreements over Syria, and Iranian anger at Turkey's decision to allow the US to deploy missile defence systems on its soil, <a href=\"http://breakingnews.sy/en/article/9247.html\" title=\"\">the meeting at a regional economic summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, was something of a surprise</a>.</p> <p>Neither man gave much away after the encounter, but officials said ways of defusing the Syrian crisis were discussed. After a year or more of backing opposing sides, and with a military solution apparently beyond the reach of both Bashar al-Assad's regime and Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, Iran and Turkey have a shared interest in calming things down.</p> <p>The Syrian regime's reported agreement, strongly backed by Iran and Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20066613\" title=\"\">to begin a limited truce this weekend</a> may be one result of this new approach. It also reflects a changing Turkish stance that puts new emphasis on forging a regional solution to the Syrian impasse in the absence of effective US, UN or other international action.</p> <p>Turkey has been badly burned by the Syrian conflagration and feels let down by Washington and its European Nato allies, who have rebuffed its calls for border buffer areas, no-fly zones and armed humanitarian intervention. It has all but given up hope that either a re-elected Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will show a stronger lead.</p> <p>An estimated 150,000 Syrian refugees have flooded over Turkey's southern frontier. Trade with Syria, once worth an annual $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn), has dwindled to a trickle. Resulting economic hardship and political instability in Hatay and other Turkish border provinces, home to <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-291247-group-tries-to-recruit-hatay-alevis-into-assad-army.html\" title=\"\">large numbers of Arab Alevis who identify with Syria's ruling Alawite minority</a>, has rung alarm bells in Ankara.</p> <p>\"Turkish policy on Syria was thrown into total confusion by Assad's refusal to stand down last year,\" said Cengiz Aktar, a leading Turkish commentator. \"They were expecting him to go the way of Mubarak [in Egypt] and Gaddafi [in Libya], or better still Ben Ali [the Tunisian president who fled into exile]. But nothing of the kind happened \u2026 The US and Europe were not prepared to back any military operations and the Russians were doing their own thing \u2026 Turkey ran out of options.\"</p> <p>To make matters worse, Turkish officials are convinced the Syrian regime, retaliating for Turkish support for the FSA, is aiding and abetting Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) separatist fighters, whose terror attacks on targets in south-east Turkey are at a 10-year high.</p> <p>The PKK's Syrian offshoot, the Party of Unity and Democracy (PYD), which claims to represent Syria's Kurdish minority, has also profited from the chaos. Turkey worries the PYD may try to set up an autonomous region in northern Syria, akin to Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan regional government (KRG) in northern Iraq.</p> <p>\"Particularly alarming was the capture of several towns along the Turkish border by the PYD,\" said Gonul Tol, of the Centre for Turkish Studies at the Middle East Institute. \"Turkey watched nervously as Kurdish groups took control of the towns after the withdrawal of Assad forces and hoisted the Kurdish flag over Syrian government buildings, along with posters of the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan,\" <a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/29/syrias_kurdish_challenge_to_turkey\" title=\"\">Tol wrote</a>.</p> <p>Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/turkey-britain-us-intervene-syria\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview conducted last week</a>: \"When the regime has withdrawn from certain places in Syria, sometimes they are giving weapons or other means to let the PKK control those parts of Syria \u2026 The PKK is trying to use the chaotic situation in the region for their own activities.\"</p> <p>A recent spate of incidents along the 560-mile border has reinforced the impression the situation is spinning out of control. Turkish and Syrian military units exchanged fire repeatedly after a Syrian shell killed five Turkish civilians in a border town earlier this month.</p> <p>And a huge diplomatic row broke out last week after Turkish fighter jets forced down a Syrian passenger plane en route from Russia to Damascus. Turkey <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-fm-defends-ankaras-decision-to-ground-syrian-plane.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=33130&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">claimed the plane was carrying</a> military equipment, an allegation furiously denied in Moscow.</p> <p>Security issues aside, Syria has become a massive political headache. Erdogan and Davutoglu have been heavily criticised for first engaging with Assad last year, in the belief they could talk him round, and then going to the other extreme this year, noisily demanding his resignation when they lacked the means to enforce it.</p> <p>\"They were naive. They bet that Assad would fall. And they were wrong,\" said a former national newspaper editor. \"Erdogan is frustrated. He feels Assad sold him out. He takes everything personally.\"</p> <p>Capitalising on opinion polls that show a large majority of Turks fears a war with Syria and opposes any kind of intervention, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), rounded on Davutoglu, saying his famous policy of \"zero problems with neighbours\", adopted in 2002 as Ankara sought to re-establish itself as a regional superpower, was a flop.</p> <p>Kilicdaroglu said Turkey was isolated over Syria, with only Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the KRG in Iraq and Hamas on its side. Against it were ranged Russia, China, Iran, Brazil and India.</p> <p>\"How can we describe the policy that put Turkey into this situation?\" <a href=\"http://www.kurdpress.com/En/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=2695#Title=CHP%20leader%20criticized%20Turkey%20foreign%20policy,%20calls%20FM%20%18an%20idiot%19\" title=\"\">Kilicdaroglu asked</a>. \"Is this 'strategic depth' [a favourite Davutoglu concept] or strategic blindness? The process that resulted in Turkey becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world \u2026 You have to be a real idiot to do that.\"</p> <p>Clear signs are now emerging that the government is changing tack, and that by mending fences with neighbours such as Iran, Russia, and maybe even Nouri al-Maliki's Iraq, it hopes to forge a binding Syrian solution that is guaranteed by the regional powers and bridges what at present is a growing Sunni-Shia sectarian divide. Part of this new approach, outlined by Erdogan, is to establish a set of parallel talks mechanisms bringing together Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which want Assad to resign, and Russia and Iran, who have resisted forced regime change.</p> <p>Welcoming the move, the H\u00fcrriyet columnist Semih Idiz said Turkish policy on Syria had become a \"rudderless ship\" and a course correction was long overdue. \"This represents a significant shift in position by Ankara&#xa0;\u2026 It was no more than a few months ago that Ankara looked coolly on any discussion on Syria which involved Russia and Iran,\" <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-changes-tack-on-syria.aspx?pageID=449&amp;nID=32739&amp;NewsCatID=416\" title=\"\">Idiz said</a>.</p> <p>Intriguingly, this revamped region-based approach may include a rapprochement with Israel. Ties ruptured in 2010 amid a bitter row over the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza aid flotilla that was stormed by Israeli commandos. Alarmed at events across its disputed Golan Heights border, Israel has put out diplomatic feelers, suggesting that at this time of crisis, Tel Aviv and Ankara should set aside old differences and work together.</p> <p>Pinhas Avivi, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and former ambassador to Turkey, offered bilateral talks on Syria this week. Turkey's public response has been cool so far, but <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4295593,00.html\" title=\"\">political insiders say Ankara has a strong interest in making up</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said Turkey had always believed in a regional approach and was optimistic Russia, for example, with which he was maintaining regular high-level contacts, could be part of a solution.</p> <p>While flatly rejecting suggestions his Syria policy had failed, he was adamant Assad would have to step down if a lasting settlement were to be secured. He said: \"Every day I am asking myself, what more could be done to prevent this bloodshed. We have done everything&#xa0;\u2026 We have tried bilateral engagement with the regime to persuade them [to have] a transition process and help them go to a democratic system \u2026</p> <p>\"For several months we tried, even before the Arab spring \u2026 We went to Damascus last August [2011] \u2026 He [Assad] accepted our step-by-step plan but after two, three days he did not fulfil his promise&#xa0;\u2026 We realised he was cheating us and trying to misuse his relationship with us.</p> <p>\"Still we have regional engagement with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia&#xa0;\u2026 What else can we do? I think it would not be ethical at all to continue business as usual&#xa0;\u2026 Ethically and strategically our policy has been right. Ethically it is right because we are on the side of human rights, we are on the side of the rightful aspirations of Syrian people. Strategically it is right because we are on the right side of history.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, this regime cannot continue the way it is, and the new elected government of Syria will be the best friend of Turkey.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was a great day for equality. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/birmingham-equal-pay-victory-women-city\" title=\"\">The supreme court judgment</a> on Wednesday that equal pay claims can be heard in civil courts effectively means that they can be brought up to six years after leaving an employer rather than six months in an employment tribunal. Years of legal agonising over the technicalities of equal pay legislation are now over.</p> <p>Our clients had worked at Birmingham city council for years, and had service stretching back decades. Their colleagues had received compensation for their staggering pay disparity with male counterparts, but our clients were told that they were too late to claim.</p> <p>This judgment changed all that.</p> <p>Our clients' initial sense of frustration was palpable \u2013 they had been denied the chance to claim the bonuses that those in male-dominated jobs had received for years. Bonuses, which although superficially were meant to be linked to productivity, were in fact received regardless of the amount of work done, and in some cases regardless of whether the men were actually at work or not.</p> <p>I spoke to our first clients in 2008, and the claims were first brought in the high court in 2010. In all the years that the Equal Pay Act 1970 had been in force, no one had thought to bring the claims in the high court. Many lawyers I spoke to assumed that, although the legislation seemed to allow for such a claim on the face of it, the courts would never tolerate such a position.</p> <p>To borrow a dreadful term from management speak, we thought \"outside the box\" and it was this bold approach to litigation that made such a result possible.</p> <p>The supreme court decision has shown that such radical leaps can be made in incremental steps. The judgment built on the two previous success we had achieved against Birmingham city council in the high court and the court of appeal, both of which Birmingham had chosen to appeal. If it had taken a more pragmatic approach at the start of this claim, then the amount of compensation and legal costs that it is now likely to have to pay would be significantly smaller.</p> <p>Birmingham city council has already once tried to defend paying men bonuses that were denied to women, in the employment tribunal, and it was unsuccessful. It would surely be folly for it to try and repeat such an audacious argument in the courts.</p> <p>This has been a huge result for our clients, but I also know that it will be an important decision for many other underpaid women all over the country. For decades the gender pay gap has remained stubbornly persistent, and I hope that women now feel liberated to use the legislation to improve their pay and other conditions at work \u2013 regardless of their sector, industry or workplace.</p> <p>The Equal Pay Act has been in force for decades, but has struggled to have a lasting impact on women's pay. Perhaps now the act's true potential can be realised; it feels like parity in pay between the genders can be a matter of years away, rather than decades.</p>",
  "<p>'What's missing in the world,\" announces Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith and answer in human form to the question of what a child born of Mick Jagger and Carly Simon would look like, \"is that people don't get laid enough.\"</p> <p>He leans back in his chair, letting the force of this proclamation sink in, spreading his denim clad legs ever so slightly. Across the Los Angeles hotel room, his long-term bandmate and \"Toxic Twin\" (as the press dubbed them), Joe Perry, nods ever so slightly at his old friend's prescription for worldly ills. \"It's not just about coming and effing \u2013 it's about making love and unbridled passion. The world doesn't make love enough,\" Tyler continues. This proclamation occurs about five minutes after we meet.</p> <p>Such a conversation opener will not come as any surprise to even the most casual student of the Aerosmith oeuvre. \"Aerosmith was all about sex,\" Tyler writes in his memorably graphic and endearingly rambling 2011 autobiography, Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?, and few would argue. Certainly, through the 70s and 80s \u2013 before the band became purveyor of fist-pumping lovetorn ballads in the 90s \u2013 Aerosmith was at least as much associated with sex as it was with narcotic indulgence and inter-band bust-ups. So much so that one of the band's best known videos, Love in an Elevator, features Tyler who, despite being dressed like Charles II, only has to walk into a department store for ladies to offer him oral sex in a lift.</p> <p>\"That really happened!\" yelps Tyler, bouncing in his seat. \"Me and this girl, we were full on getting it on and, you know, it's a lifetime from the top to the bottom floor but suddenly the doors opened in the lobby and there were all these people \u2013 not children, but, you know, people. I was like, 'Holy shit!'\"</p> <p>Tyler has always been a man of prodigious appetite for drugs, alcohol or sex, and these days he's only allowed to indulge in one of those. In his autobiography he out-Naomi Wolfs Wolf with odes to the powers of a certain part of the female anatomy, decreeing it, in climactic conclusion, \"the holy grail\".</p> <p>\"I certainly do say that!\" he says stoutly, adding that the aforementioned body part is \"a creative force\". I cross my legs a little tighter, keeping my creativity all to myself.</p> <p>\"Tonnes\" of people, according to Tyler, come up to him on a daily basis to thank him for making music that helped them to get jiggy with it. And some of these people are more surprising than others.</p> <p>\"So I was sitting at a table a while back at the Kennedy Honours and was with, um, what's her name, the president's wife?\" asks Tyler.</p> <p>Michelle Obama.</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>Laura Bush?</p> <p>\"Keep going,\" he says, jerking his hand and scarves in a backwards direction above his bouffanted head.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton?</p> <p>\"Thank you! So I got up to go to the bathroom and I bumped into every actor, every joint chief of staff and Nancy Pelosi, and they said, 'You wrote the songs that I got laid to and made out to.' It was wild.\"</p> <p>Wait, I say, grappling with the image of the former speaker of the house getting her groove on to Mama Kin, Nancy Pelosi told you that?</p> <p>\"I don't want to say that on the record,\" he says with belated coyness. \"Is she still the speaker of the house?\"</p> <p>No.</p> <p>\"Oh, she's out? OK, go with it, yeah! I was like, what? But it was so sweet.\"</p> <p>Clinton, too, Tyler suspects of having some good Aerosmith anecdotes: \"You look at her and you think, dude, she's one of us!\"</p> <p>Tyler, 64, has been married and divorced twice: \"Why would a man and a woman who call themselves soulmates leave each other over something as frivolous as sex?\" he asks&#xa0;in his autobiography. This argument failed to work for him as at least one of his marriages ended in part due to his admission of infidelity. He has four children, including the actor Liv Tyler, and currently lives with a long-term girlfriend who sounds like quite a woman.</p> <p>The band's new and very fun, very Aerosmith album, Music from Another Dimension!, their first for eight years, includes one song that advocates the Viagra lifestyle of \"luv three times a day\". Another is titled Lover Alot. In fact, it's a rare song that doesn't have the word love in the title.</p> <p>\"I was reading the lyrics upstairs and I was thinking, there's a lot of love. And I got shameful for a minute and thought, We should be more socially relevant!\" Tyler says, evoking the striking image of Aerosmith affecting a late-career makeover in the mould of Bruce Springsteen.</p> <p>\"Bullshit,\" pipes up Perry from beneath his large black hat.</p> <p>\"But you know I'm not the smartest cookie in the barrel [sic],\" Tyler continues. \"I'm not socially relevant but I write about love and passion \u2013 and it's fun! It's what I think a rock'n'roll band should be.\"</p> <p>It's hard to imagine what Tyler would have done with his life if the music lark hadn't panned out. In person he is far less weird-looking than he appears on TV: the mouth, while certainly striking, seems less outsize when you see it as part of the whole feline package. But he is still a memorable chap with little of the 9-5 about him. His body these days is toned as opposed to rail thin and he winds it around in all sorts of improbable poses while making unfailingly entertaining conversation that occasionally tips over into Spinal Tap mode:</p> <p>\"I was talking to Mick Fleetwood the other day about hotels, you know? I like living in a hotel! I like the small room, the bathroom's right there. Stevie Nicks is the same \u2013 whenever she buys a house it's huge and she only uses one room. We love fucking hotels,\" he concludes. Occasionally, and without warning, Tyler bursts into song, flaunting a voice that is, by some measure, one of the most extraordinary instruments in American music, one that can give vocal-cord-busting performances of rock (Walk This Way, Janie Got a Gun), blues (Dream On, Sweet Emotion) and ballads (Don't Wanna Miss a Thing, Crazy).</p> <p>\"Doctors keep saying I will wear it out, but it just gets stronger,\" he says proudly.</p> <p>Does he do anything to protect the sound that gave him the nickname the Demon of Screamin'?</p> <p>\"Uh, clear my throat?\"</p> <p>Perry, still disarmingly attractive, sits, by contrast, almost immobile, eyes lowered, in nearly head-to-toe black and decked with silver necklaces. He veers from monosyllabic to chatty, from solemn to dryly amused at the world's foibles. The two men have exactly the same hairstyle: massive piles of dark hair with a lick of white in the front. Give or take various time periods when one or the other had seemingly or actually left the band, they have been playing together for more than 40 years.</p> <p>\"The two of us, we've been around so fucking long we've touched every port in the harbour,\" monotones Perry.</p> <p>\"Yeah! The mental harbour!\" Tyler chimes in excitedly. Perry decides to let that non-sequitur slide.</p> <p>Despite having a somewhat inconsistent output and only one Billboard No 1 (I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing, which they didn't actually write), Aerosmith is one of the most successful American rock bands of all time. Of course, this is partly down to simple longevity. Considering how improbable it is that either one is still alive today, let alone still playing together, Perry and Tyler, understandably, feel that this must be down to a higher power.</p> <p>\"When someone comes up and says: 'I had sex for the first time because of you guys,' that's the funny part. But when someone says: 'I got sober because of you guys,' that's when you realise that's why God said: 'You guys should stay alive, you guys should stay together,'\" says Perry.</p> <p>\"Guardian angels? Yuh think?\" retorts Tyler to a question nobody asked. He then proceeds to list all the evidence at hand that \"my guardian angel \u2013 I call him God\" has looked out for him, ranging from \"[Drug] ODs \u2013 sure! Shooting coke, car accidents,\" to the fact that he wasn't blinded when he would shoot his BB gun at the barn wall when he was seven years old: \"Boink! But never once!\"</p> <p>After countless stints in rehab the two men are clean and the only health issues are physical. Tyler's feet defy description: sharp corners of bone protrude in unexpected places, his toes are piled on top of one another, skew-whiff and he is in near constant pain, all due to a lifetime of jumping about in tight, heeled boots. Perry has one titanium knee, a legacy of a bad fall off a stage.</p> <p>\"Hey, you know,\" he shrugs. \"This stuff happens.\"</p> <p>Perry and Tyler met in the summer of 1970 when the 19-year-old aspiring guitarist drove up to Tyler's parents' house in New Hampshire to ask if their son wanted to see his band that night. Hearing Perry play \"made my dick sooo hard\", writes Tyler, who was born Steven Tallariccio, in his autobiography, before leaping with nary a pause to an analogy involving Helen Keller. \"My whole life I'd been searching for my mutant twin \u2026 I wanted that Mick-Keith thing,\" he writes.</p> <p>Tyler agrees that his life has been defined by three great loves: music, women and Perry, and not necessarily in that order. The two men are of clearly opposite temperaments, one hot and one cold, and Tyler is prone to what he calls \"LSD \u2013 Lead Singer Disease\". Various bad behaviour on everyone's part, exacerbated by their Herculean drug abuse, led to breaks between the two, including Perry leaving the band from 1979-84, and then, in turn, Perry announcing in 2009 that the band was looking for a new singer, much to Tyler's surprise. \"The press blows stuff out of proportion,\" Perry insists.</p> <p>\"Oh come on \u2013 it still pisses you off if I'm on the cover of the magazine and you're not,\" Tyler blurts out.</p> <p>\"It doesn't piss me off. It might annoy me a little,\" replies Perry.</p> <p>\"OK, it ANNOYS you,\" says Tyler, rolling his eyes.</p> <p>One relatively recent development that definitely annoyed Perry was when Tyler agreed in 2010 to be a judge on American Idol but didn't tell his bandmates.</p> <p>\"Why should I tell you? Four months earlier you were telling people you were going to get a new lead singer?\" Tyler says, the hurt still a little palpable in his voice.</p> <p>When Perry eventually saw American Idol on which his bandmate was a predictably enjoyable loopy star, his anger abated: \"I realised that I'd been on that programme \u2013 with Katy Perry, of all people. And I'd just forgotten about it.\"</p> <p>\"I wish I'd said that to you at the time!\" bursts out Tyler.</p> <p>\"Heh heh heh,\" Perry makes a triumphant chuckle. Tyler sighs, beaten again by his mutant twin. Ultimately, the relationship between them appears to be rooted in respectful acceptance: Tyler still displays a brotherly mix of awe and envy towards Perry (\"Joe Fucking Perry\") while Perry shrugs benignly that, \"if he wasn't the way he is, he couldn't do what he does\".</p> <p>These days both men are grandfathers and Tyler radiates when talking about his grandson, Milo, Liv Tyler's son. Milo loves to come over to Papa Steven's house in Boston: there is a pool with a slide, secret tunnels connecting the rooms and, apparently, trees growing inside.</p> <p>This sparks the surprising thought that perhaps rock stars, while not always great parents, maybe turn into terrific grandparents simply because their arrested emotional development makes them such jolly playmates. What does Tyler think of this theory \u2013 has being a rock star kept him young? He stares back, dumbstruck at the very question, and swishes his legs about, his mutilated feet flying through the air: \"Are you kidding? Positively! Just look at me!\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC is standing behind Sky in a row with the Board of Control for Cricket in India that could leave the radio and television commentators grounded in London for England's four-Test series which begins in Ahmedabad next month.</p> <p>Sky has been in dispute with the BCCI for some time over its demand for an additional $800,000 (\u00a3496,000), on top of the six-year rights agreement to stage Test cricket from India that was announced only last month, to cover the \"realistic costs\" of the facilities they will need at the grounds.</p> <p>The BBC is being asked for a comparatively modest $80,000 for the facilities required for live ball-by-ball radio coverage for Test Match Special \u2013 a fee, like Sky's, which had not been mentioned when their own deal to cover the series was concluded six weeks ago. But they are also refusing to pay. Both broadcasters see this as a point of principle, which means that a compromise between now and the start of the first Test on 15 November is anything but inevitable.</p> <p>Sky has already made arrangements for its usual commentary team, including Sir Ian Botham, David Gower and Nasser Hussain, to cover the matches from their studios in Isleworth, with viewers given the option of listening to Star's Indian commentators from the ground via the red button.</p> <p>But there is no guarantee that the BBC will cover the matches at all, as commentating from television pictures would leave them in the same position as testmatchsofa.com, the non-rights holding website which has been covering cricket on that basis for some time.</p> <p>A BCCI spokesman was unable to comment about the dispute on Thursday, when the Indian board was receiving another major boost to its swelling coffers as a Chennai-based television network purchased an Indian Premier League franchise in a 10-year deal worth around \u00a350m over five years.</p> <p>England will begin their preparations for the series in Dubai on Friday, when the emphasis will be heavily on spin. The three specialist spinners who have been included in the squad \u2013 Graeme Swann, Monty Panesar and Samit Patel \u2013 have been joined by four other current or future contenders in James Tredwell, Scott Borthwick, Simon Kerrigan and Azeem Rafiq, as well as Peter Such, the former Test off-spinner who is now the spin-bowling coach.</p>",
  "<p>David Adjaye, the architect chosen to design Washington DC's $500m <a href=\"http://nmaahc.si.edu/\" title=\"\">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a>, has topped a list of Britain's most influential black people, ahead of double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah and The Wire star Idris Elba.</p> <p>In the sixth edition of the annual <a href=\"http://content.yudu.com/A1zgh3/PowerList2013/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=\" title=\"\">PowerList</a>, the top 100 people regarded as role models in their fields, the Tanzanian-born founder of <a href=\"http://www.adjaye.com/\" title=\"\">Adjaye Associates</a> is hailed as an inspirational figure who saw off financial crisis during the recession to become one of the country's most high-profile architects.</p> <p>At No 2 is Pat McGrath, a make-up artist from Northampton who has worked with designers including Prada and Armani. Farah is third and at No 5 is Damon Buffini, the former chairman of the private equity firm Permira. Also in the top 10 are John Sentamu, the outspoken archbishop of York, and Chuka Umunna, the telegenic Labour MP and shadow business secretary.</p> <p>Michael Eboda, the editor who began the PowerList, said the initial idea was to show that \"there was more to the black community than footballers and entertainers\".</p> <p>\"Since then it's taken on a life of its own,\" he said. \"What we've realised is this is about role models primarily&#xa0;\u2026 It's become more about showing youngsters that with a bit of hard work and dedication this is what you can do. We feel the easiest way of showing somebody what's possible is by showing them somebody who's already done it, who maybe looks like them and has come from a similar background as them.\"</p> <p>Eboda said about 20,000 copies of the PowerList 2013 would be sent to schools across the UK.</p> <p>The qualification for selection on the list was \"the ability to alter events and change lives in a positive way\", Eboda said. It's not about how much money someone has but about how much influence they have.\"</p> <p>He said the list was a useful tool in smashing stereotypes.</p> <p>\"The truth is most people who are on screen and most footballers are not that influential when you judge it by that definition. They probably get paid a good sum of money and they're probably quite famous and well-known. But if you look at people who really&#xa0;\u2026 make things happen it tends not to be them. It tends to be people who are behind the scenes.\"</p> <p>This year, figures who have previously topped the list, such as Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of the Prudential insurance group, Baroness Scotland, Baroness Amos and the billionaire philanthropist Mo Ibrahim, have been moved to a Hall of Fame to make way for new names. Also in 2013's top 10 are businessman Ken Olisa, lawyer Sandie Okoro, and Karen Blackett, the chief executive of MediaCom.</p> <p>In 2009 Adjaye agreed a company voluntary arrangement with creditors to prevent his business collapsing and he has since consolidated his reputation as a creative showman and \"starchitect\" to celebrity clients. Eboda said he was inspirational not only for his achievements but his comeback of the past three years. Earlier this year he was present at <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/arts/design/groundbreaking-for-the-museum-of-african-american-history.html\" title=\"\">the ground breaking ceremony</a> of the African American museum on the National Mall in Washington DC, which was first proposed by black Civil War veterans nearly a century ago.</p> <p>In 2005, Adjaye incurred the wrath of the columnist and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter over problems with her house. She later wrote that she dreamed \"of ritually disemboweling\" him \"before mopping up the stormwater in my living room with his designer sweaters\". Adjaye, the son of a Ghanaian diplomat who came to Britain at the age of nine, said the row was a shame but that the problems had not been due to his designs.</p> <p>He is expected to attend <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/black-history-month-reception/\" title=\"\">a reception at Downing Street</a> on Thursday to mark Black History Month. Writing in the PowerList, David Cameron said: \"We should never underestimate the power of role models. When teenagers see high achievers who look like them, who have reached the top in law, business, politics, they're going to think: 'I can do that; I can go far too.'\"</p> <h2>Top 10</h2> <p>1 David Adjaye, architect</p> <p>2.

  "<p>Bani Walid was supposed to be safe. The last of Muammar Gaddafi's loyalists were supposed to have been purged from this Libyan desert town, after an eight-day offensive by the army. Instead, there was mayhem here on Thursday, as it became clear the Gaddafi loyalists are far from beaten.</p> <p>A mile into what has become a ghost town after weeks of fighting and siege, a checkpoint of tense young pro-government militiamen barred entry, saying fighting was continuing. The staccatto boom of an anti-aircraft gun mingled with the heavy thumps of rocket-propelled grenades from somewhere inside the town.</p> <p>Told to turn back, the Guardian found the road into townjammed with cars bringing several hundred refugees back home. Barring their way were two sand-coloured militia pick-up trucks.</p> <p>A bearded government militia commander could be seen with his pistol jammed against the head of the driver of a black sedan who was revving his engine. The commander withdrew his pistol, firing twice into the air, and the crowd panicked.</p> <p>Seconds later one of the teenage militiaman opened fire with a machine gun, the bullets blasting over the heads of the terrified refugees.</p> <p>Opening the back door of the car the Guardian was travelling, a man in a blue shirt lunged in, screaming that we should stay and witness what was happening. Then he scampered forwards, leaned in and began wrestling with the driver for the car keys. The driver put his foot down, the car shot forward, then swerved as a terrified little girl in a black dress ran into our path.</p> <p>We cleared the throng and stopped to talk with frightened refugees, some in shock. \"We ask them (the militia) 'what do you think your are doing', then they shoot in the air,\" said a bearded man in a black shirt who refused to give his name.</p> <p>\"Our government says we can come home, it was on TV, and the militia says no,\" said Mohammed Hamzen, wearing a long golden robe. \"I am here with my children. What can I do with them?\"</p> <p>With thousands of angry refugees stranded on the desert highway, and pro-Gaddafi gunmen still resisting inside the town, Libya's government has been left flat-footed by a crisis fast turning into its worst nightmare.</p> <p>After the UN secretary general, Ban Ki Moon, called for restraint from both sides, the Libyan government has been anxious to complete the capture of the town it says has been home to Gaddafi loyalists blamed for a string of kidnaps and murders.</p> <p>Instead, the battle continues and the anger of the refugees is sharpened because Eid, Islam's key festival, begins on Friday.</p> <p>Also clear is that it is the army, not its leaders, who are calling the shots. Last Friday, chief-of-staff Youssef Mangoush announced a 48-hour ceasefire to allow refugees to leave, but the following day the army launched its heaviest offensive of the battle, which has already cost an estimated 20 dead and 200 wounded.</p> <p>On Wednesday Mangoush announced the military operation was over and the town had been handed back to civil control. The reality on Thursday was that resistance has not yet been crushed.</p> <p>The aim of the Bani Walid operation was to eliminate the last resistance to a government itself in chaos, with parliament unable to agree a cabinet three months after being elected. Instead, the offensive has inflamed Bani Walid, and seen anti-government protests and shooting in another former Gaddafi stronghold, Sirte. The longed-for consensus July's elections were supposed to deliver remains a distant prospect.</p>",

If you liked Kurt Wagner's near-whisper of a voice and the way it crooned gently over that Nashville outfit's subtle evocations of early-70s US country and soul, you'll love what this Virginia musician and producer together with his Spacebomb House Band achieves on his debut album.</p> <p>Big Inner is soulful in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/19/bon-iver-bon-iver-second-album-review\" title=\"\">second Bon Iver album</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/30/new-band-gayngs\" title=\"\">Gayngs</a> way. Via a sequence of hushed, meditative songs it communicates a calm spirituality as well as a deep love of the dexterously intermingled soul, funk and country you would have heard 40 years ago on an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/17/popandrock10\" title=\"\">Al Green</a> or Curtis Mayfield record. Fully expect in these songs \u2013 which reference love, mortality and god and have an almost holy reverence for the beautiful, intricate instrumental performance \u2013 the kind of \"licks\" they used to describe as \"tasty\" and the sort of ensemble approach adopted by the Philly, Stax or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jul/17/bob-babbitt-motown-funk-brothers-dies\" title=\"\">Motown house bands</a>. White has even made <a href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/amattwhitejoint/playlist/5nQQOs0uXQwo12wMf7ueFd\" title=\"\">a Spotify playlist</a>, all Sly and Sun Ra, Dr John and the Upsetters, which comes with two definitions of music, borrowed from, respectively, Jelly Roll Morton (\"the peculiar form of mathematics and harmonies that was strange to all the world\") and Albert Ayler (\"the healing force of the universe\"). He means it, man.</p> <p>White, a 29-year-old from Virginia who also operates as a jazz arranger, spent four years in the Philippines during his youth with his evangelical Christian/missionary parents. He talks with missionary zeal about the healing power of music in the face of life's travails. He is especially passionate about the work done by his band and the auxiliary brass and string musicians and choir who all came to his Richmond attic to recreate the golden age of country-funk-soul. We were almost fooled into thinking there was an ironic inflection to his voice and the delivery of these inch-perfect versions (we nearly said \"pastiches\") of said era, but further investigation revealed that this is life-or-death stuff for White. There is even a moving but uplifting track on the album called Gone Away, written on the night his young cousin died. These are songs of faith and redemption that are born out of tragedy but with a determination to provide spiritual uplift: Big Love (\"Moving on like any other man should / Moving on like any other man would\") has a typically positive message, although he does find time for more earthly pursuits. Will You Love Me finds White coming on like his namesake <a href=\"http://www.lyricstime.com/barry-white-love-serenade-lyrics.html\" title=\"\">Barry</a> (\"Baby, you're magnificent / Child, you're intelligent / Honey, you can pay the rent with that smile on your face\").

  "<p>While many have hailed Turkey as a democratic role model since the start of the Arab spring, the country's treatment of its large Kurdish minority begs the question of whether such praise is justified. After months of increasing violence and the ever more hawkish stance of the AKP government, the Kurdish issue seems to have reached an impasse.</p> <p>Around 690 inmates in prisons across the country are taking part in a hunger strike, which was started on 12 September by 65 prisoners convicted of belonging to the outlawed Kurdish parties, the PKK and PJAK.</p> <p>According to the Human Rights Association of Turkey (IHD), there have been reports that the hunger strikers have been beaten, isolated and denied vitamin B1, salt and sugar water.</p> <p>The hunger strikers are demanding Kurdish language rights in education and in court, and an end to the solitary confinement of PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan, who is imprisoned on an island.</p> <p>While the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has recently hinted at the possibility of restarting talks with \u00d6calan, the AKP has not yet commented on the hunger strike, and pro-government media have ignored the topic.</p> <p>For Asiye Kol\u00e7ak, deputy chairwoman of the Istanbul headquarters of the pro-Kurdish BDP, the hunger strikes are the result of a political impasse: \"For over 30 years, all possible political means have been exhausted, but without success. The AKP continues its politics of assimilation and denial of Kurdish civil rights.\"</p> <p>According to a Crisis Group Europe report published in September, more than 700 people have died on all sides of the armed struggle in the last 14 months. Many fear that the Kurdish issue has reached a dangerous stalemate. \"We are at a dead end,\" said Sezgin Tanrikulu, deputy chairman of the main opposition party CHP and former president of the Diyarbakir Bar Association.</p> <p>Citing the decrease in inter-ethnic marriages in Turkey, Tanrikulu fears that the divide between Turks and Kurds might become unbridgeable: \"Violence continues unabated, people on both sides keep dying \u2013 doesn't this show that the current strategy is a failure? What we need is reconciliation. Dialogue has to be reopened.\"</p> <p>Koray \u00c7aliskan of the Istanbul Bosporus University believes that the so-called \"democratic opening\", an ill-fated attempt at rapprochement launched at the end of 2008, has failed: \"This is no opening, but rather democratic closure,\" he said. Referring to Erdogan's repeated public assertions that he would not debate with the BDP in parliament, he said: \"The government refuses to talk to legally elected [pro-Kurdish BDP] parliamentarians because of their alleged ties to 'terrorists', but says it is ready to talk to convicted terrorists in jail. Where is the logic in that?\"</p> <p>He added that the demands made by hunger strikers were not only reasonable, but legally justifiable: \"If an Italian needs to go to court in Turkey, the state is legally required to provide a translator. It should be the same for Kurdish citizens. And what are Kurds supposed to do with elective Kurdish classes? Turks should take those. Kurds already know their native language and simply demand equal education rights,\" he added, referring to the country's constitution, which enforces Turkish as the sole language to be used in schools.</p> <p>Kol\u00e7ak said that more than 8,000 BDP politicians and activists were in jail \u2013 of whom 4,000 were arrested in 2011 under arbitrary terrorism charges \u2013 including MPs and serving Kurdish mayors.</p> <p>Tanrikulu said: \"The AKP made Kurds believe that they would find a solution. But the trust in the government is gone.\" He does not believe that the all-party parliamentary committee set up in October 2011 to draft a more democratic constitution will resolve things: \"In such violent times and in such a tense atmosphere, it will be hard to find viable compromise. First we need to end this polarisation between all factions.\"</p> <p>Tanrikulu continued: \"I do not agree with exploiting human bodies for political activism, but now is not the time to discuss this. Now is the time to end it. The government and the Ministry of Justice have to take the initiative; it's in their hands to come to an agreement.\"</p> <p>The Turkish Medical Association warns that time is of crucial importance. According to lawyers who visit the hunger strikers, several are now in a critical condition and the Ministry of Justice has refused to grant doctors permission to check on fasting inmates. The ministry was not available for comment.</p> <p>Turkey has a history of \"death fasts\": in 1996, 12 inmates died during hunger strikes protesting against isolation cells in high-security prisons, while a fast against the cells between 2000 and 2007 claimed 122 lives.</p> <p>\"What will happen when the first hunger strikers die in prison now?\" \u00c7aliskan asked. \"One MP has joined the death fast already. What happens should he die? Which Middle Eastern country will be able to hold up Turkey as an example for democracy then?\"</p>",

  "<p>Self-publishing is becoming \"mainstream\", with new figures revealing the number of do-it-yourself books published in the US has exploded, tripling in the last five years to reach almost quarter of a million titles in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.bowker.com/en-US/aboutus/press_room/2012/pr_10242012.shtml\" title=\"\">New analysis from Bowker</a> \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/about/index.html\" title=\"\">which issues ISBNs for books published in the US</a> \u2013 shows that writers are jumping into self-publishing at an unprecedented rate. The number of self-published books in America grew by 287% to 235,625 books between 2006 and 2011.</p> <p>Self-published ebooks make up 37% of that total, with 87,201 released in 2011, and are the fastest-growing sector, up 129% since 2010, with print growing 33% in the same period.</p> <p>\"This is no longer just vanity presses at work \u2013 self-publishing is out of the dark corners and making its way into the mainstream,\" said Bowker's Beat Barblan, adding that earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/02/self-published-authors-bestseller-ebooks\" title=\"\">four self-published authors had seven novels on the New York Times ebook bestseller list</a>. In 2011, America's 148,424 self-published print books accounted for 43% of the total print output, Bowker said. A comparison for ebooks is impossible to provide as there are no reliable figures for the total number of ebooks published in the US.</p> <p>\"It feels as though the ground is shifting at the moment \u2026 It's quite liberating. Some sort of transition was overdue,\" said author Polly Courtney, who returned to self-publishing last year after publishing three books with HarperCollins, because she was unhappy with the way they aimed her titles squarely at the chick lit market. \"The growth rate is amazingly high. The UK is considered to be a couple of years behind the US but I think it's going the same way here too.\"</p> <p>The UK was not part of the new analysis, though some books published in the UK will also have been assigned an ISBN in the US.</p> <p>According to Bowker Market Research's Books &amp; Consumers UK survey, self-published books accounted for around 11% of all ebooks purchased by UK consumers in the first half of 2012, and just over 1% of volume purchases of print and ebooks overall.</p> <p>Adam Croft, whose self-published thrillers have hit Amazon's bestseller lists, suggests that \"self-publishing is increasing massively\" in the UK, too - and he couldn't be happier.</p> <p>\"I can only see this as a good thing. Publishing, up until now, has been one of the only real closed markets in a free market economy,\" said Croft. \"Why do we have publishers who have positioned themselves as the 'experts' on what we should and shouldn't be able to read? This is particularly relevant in the world of art, as it is criminal that the world should not be able to create and share art (including literature) freely.\"</p> <p>Courtney, though, pointed out that the sheer volume of self-published material being released \"has the potential to devalue the quality, to remove all the filters that were in place. There are issues.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think anyone knows where this is going. It's happening so quickly, and in these early days there are quite a lot of negative repercussions \u2013 we're awash with content, and the overall quality is going down,\" she said. \"Whenever I talk about self-publishing I'm always very careful to explain what I mean \u2013 yes, it's about taking control yourself, but you should involve experts in the process to replicate \u2013 or better \u2013 what traditional publishing does. I've got quite a few editors, a team of readers, a cover designer, and that's what I'd advise anyone to do who's self-publishing. Quite a lot of people don't do that, though \u2013 it's about doing it all themselves, they rush it through, and it means the quality is low.\"</p> <p>But Croft was unconcerned, arguing: \"No matter what publishers say, the best books will always rise to the top.\"</p> <p>\"If they aren't any good, people won't buy them and recommend them to their friends,\" he said. \"A publisher's book being number one doesn't mean a whole lot \u2013 just that their PR team have created a successful buzz. It does not mean it's a good book by any stretch of the imagination.

  "<p>So much for showbiz perks: Rory Kinnear can't even get a cup of tea. We're in <a href=\"http://www.thekingsarmsse1.com/\" title=\"\">a pub near London Bridge</a> and Kinnear is pleading \u2013 ever so politely \u2013 with the barmaid. \"Don't have the staff,\" she replies, face like stone. It's mid-afternoon last Wednesday. He settles for a half of bitter, looking sheepish and a touch guilty, like an accountant who's just missed a&nbsp;tax deadline.</p> <p>I'm secretly hoping for a hissy fit, but within seconds of meeting him you sense this isn't really Kinnear's style. We're here to talk about his turn in Skyfall as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Tanner\" title=\"\">Bill Tanner</a>, M's long-serving, long-suffering sidekick, a drudge if ever there was one: the kind of spy who, if Bond lent him the Aston Martin, would only fret about where to park it. While 007's other modes of transport in this latest instalment include the roof of a train and a glossy luxury yacht, you can imagine Kinnear's version of Tanner breaking a sweat on the 7.32 to Waterloo.</p> <p>On the face of it \u2013 Kinnear is charmingly eloquent on the shortcomings of his face and hairline \u2013 it seems like perfect casting. But that would be to misjudge what makes him one of the sharpest actors of his generation. Kinnear's defining talent is being indefinable. There aren't many actors who have tackled Denis Thatcher (in BBC4's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jun/13/margaretthatcherthelongwalktofinchley\" title=\"\">The Long Walk to Finchley</a>) and Brian Epstein (for another BBC project, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sv451\" title=\"\">Lennon Naked</a>), still less followed them with one of Shakespeare's most enigmatic roles, Bolingbroke, in last summer's TV adaptation of the histories, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00s90hz\" title=\"\">The Hollow Crown</a>.</p> <p>His range on stage is still broader. Not only can he be outrageously funny \u2013 he stole the show (and won an Olivier) as a preening, <em>ciao</em>-ing Restoration fop <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/feb/11/theatre\" title=\"\">at the National in 2007</a> \u2013 but he has also mastered some of the darkest roles in the repertoire: notably the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/oct/08/hamlet-review-rory-kinnear\" title=\"\">Prince of Denmark</a> himself. He is embarrassed when I mention this glittering roll-call \u2013 he had assumed his looks meant a long haul of murderers in TV detective series. He grins lopsidedly. \"If my face popped up, you could pretty much guess whodunnit in the first five minutes.\"</p> <p>But then came the Bond \"juggernaut\" (his word), which Kinnear was <a href=\"http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/allies/tanner3.php3?t=mi6&amp;s=qos\" title=\"\">invited to leap aboard</a> with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\" title=\"\">Quantum of Solace</a>. Though he is the first to admit that Tanner isn't a stretch (\"someone said I should be commended for services to plot exposition\"), he insists that playing MI6's desk-bound human Filofax is trickier than it looks. \"The irony is, most of what I'm saying, I have not a clue what any of it means. There's a sequence where I'm bringing Bond back into MI6, filling him in on what's happened, and I literally just had to learn everything syllable by syllable.\" He looks deadpan. \"You can probably see that in my eyes.\"</p> <p>He doesn't seem the most absorbing character. \"With a part that can be quite functional, actually that's the fun thing \u2013 you do have to create a living, breathing backstory.\" Still, he must have looked enviously on Daniel Craig's travel itinerary. \"But on the upside, most of the time, I got to walk to work.\"</p> <p>This, actually, is the surprising thing about Skyfall: although the producers have hardly lost their taste for exotic setpieces (a whole island off Macau! Forcibly depopulated!), they have opted to celebrate Bond's half-century on screen by serving up what might be his most domestic setting yet. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/21/skyfall-sam-mendes-daniel-craig?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">In Sam Mendes's hands</a>, as 007 claws his way through the bowels of London, chasing Javier Bardem's bulging-eyed baddie through tube tunnels and the Piranesian cathedrals of the sewage system, you wonder whether the hero of the piece is Bond himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/13/skyfall-james-bond-first-look-review\" title=\"\">or the city he inhabits</a>. The backroom boys, Tanner among them, get a turn in the spotlight; even Judi Dench's M ends up in the firing line \u2013 literally so, when the official inquiry she's summoned to turns into a&nbsp;Whitehall spin on the OK Corral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398346630\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351173146853/rory-kinnear-in-Skyfall-008.jpg\" alt=\"rory kinnear in Skyfall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Most of what I'm saying, I haven't a clue what it means' \u2026 Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner in Skyfall.

Not only is Mendes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jan/06/sam-mendes-james-bond-notes\" title=\"\">probably the UK's most successful expat theatre director</a>, but this is the only Bond I can think of where the hero is supported by no fewer than four former Hamlets. Kinnear counts them off. \"Me, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/16882678\" title=\"\">Ben Whishaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK0elA5s1z8\" title=\"\">Ralph Fiennes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/8829\" title=\"\">Albert Finney</a>. And I think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jul/01/judi-dench-shakespeare-and-me-hamlet\" title=\"\">Judi's been in the play a couple of times</a>.\" Did the subject come up on set? He guffaws. \"There's a lot of sitting around, and there was this very annoying game Judi used to play: she'd say a line from Shakespeare, and I'd have to know the next one. And of course I could never get them.\"</p> <p>More demanding has been his role in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441940/\" title=\"\">Broken</a>, the debut feature by yet another theatrical alumnus, director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/23/rufus-norris-theatre-director-portrait\" title=\"\">Rufus Norris</a>, part of <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/broken-cannes-review-326741\" title=\"\">critics' week at Cannes</a> and warmly received at the London film festival. Though the budget is a squillionth of Skyfall's, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/18/broken-review\" title=\"\">its ambition is huge</a>, and Kinnear is given a chance he must have been yearning for, to show what he's capable of on the&nbsp;big screen.</p> <p>He plays a washed-up, recently widowed father of three living in a mouldering cul-de-sac \u2013 a ravening werewolf of a man whose ferocious adoration for his daughters results in psychopathic violence towards everyone else. One moment we see him ironing the family wash; the next he's smashing a guileless neighbour's forehead into the bonnet of a car.</p> <p>\"It's entirely to do with the fractured love he has for his family,\" Kinnear says, thoughtfully, \"the grief he's going through. He's part of a culture that is unable to talk about emotions in a literate way, so he just lashes out.\"</p> <p>Kinnear's gift to the role is his subtle balance between thuggish menace and bruising pathos: its emotional crux is a silent long shot of him pacing with bewildered sorrow in a hospital corridor, like a bear on the end of a chain. He shrugs. \"You've got to find something that feels like an extension of yourself. That doesn't mean you're like these people, but that's the interesting thing about acting \u2013 recognising that there's so much we shut ourselves off from in order to function as civilised members of society. That's as true of Hamlet as of a&nbsp;guy living in a cul-de-sac.\"</p> <p>Some have wondered whether \u2013 at least in one regard \u2013 Kinnear's interest in characters on the edge reflects <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/sep/19/rory-kinneary-hamlet-national-hytner\" title=\"\">his own experience</a>: his father, Roy, a much-loved, much-admired character actor, was killed when Rory was 10, in <a href=\"http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5848748\" title=\"\">a film stunt that went horribly wrong</a>. Has his father's reputation ever weighed heavily? \"No, actually. It's mainly journalists who ask. No one in the acting profession has anything but fond memories and funny stories. Pretty much everything I do, I'm given a little scrap that offers a greater picture of his life.\"</p> <p>Since graduating from drama school 11 years ago, he has rarely been out of work. Things are especially busy at the moment: he's shooting a Channel&nbsp;4 drama called <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/stellar-casting-announced-for-channel-4-drama-southcliffe\" title=\"\">Southcliffe</a>, then it's&nbsp;rehearsals for Othello at his old roost the National, where <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/9038892/National-Theatre-season-Hustle-star-Adrian-Lester-to-play-Othello.html\" title=\"\">he will play Iago to Adrian Lester's Moor</a>. Home life is equally hectic: he and his wife <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/arts/theatre/rory-kinnear-good-show-sweet-prince-6541358.html\" title=\"\">Pandora Colin</a> have a two-year-old son, and have just moved house (\"no let-up,\" he says cheerily). Is he happy with Skyfall? He hasn't had time to see&nbsp;it yet.</p> <p>I can't resist showing him a <a href=\"http://fuckyeahrorykinnear.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">fansite</a> I've dug up on the web.

  "<p>Homeowners living along the proposed path of the high-speed rail link will be given access to a hardship scheme if they are unable to sell their house, even if is outside the area earmarked for development, the government has said.</p> <p>Since plans to build the HS2 link joining London with the north of England were first announced, homeowners along the anticipated route have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/may/15/high-speed-rail-house-compensation\" title=\"High-speed link derails plans to sell  and a boy's place at school\">reported problems</a> finding buyers for their homes, and there have been growing concerns that some properties would become unsellable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/consultations/property-compensation-london-to-west-midlands\" title=\"\">A consultation scheme</a> on compensation arrangements for properties affected proposes compensation that goes \"above and beyond what is required by law\" as a result of \"the exceptional impact of the construction of HS2\".</p> <p>Under the plans the government will introduce a streamlined system of voluntary purchase for people whose homes are in a \"safeguarded area\" within 60 metres of the rail link.</p> <p>There will be a sale-and-rent-back scheme so those whose homes will be demolished to complete the scheme can sell their property but continue to live in it until it is knocked down, and a hardship scheme to help those between London and the West Midlands who live outside the safeguarded area but are still unable to sell their home as result of the construction.</p> <p>Applicants to the hardship scheme will need to show they have made \"all reasonable efforts\" to sell \u2013 the property will need to have been on the market for at least 12 months prior to an application being made, with no offer received within 15% of the price it would have fetched without HS2 going ahead. They will also need to show they have a pressing need to move. If they can, the government will buy their property at the normal market price.</p> <p>The government said past experience of large infrastructure projects had \"shown the effect on local property markets is at its highest during the planning, design and construction phase of a project\" and that the real impact was consistently less than feared.</p> <p>James Del Mar, head of estate agent Knight Frank's HS2 team, said property owners should find out which zone their home was in and respond to the consultation if they were unhappy with the compensation arrangements.</p> <p>\"Whether the 60-metre safeguarding strip will be adequate along the entire route is debatable, but it does seem wrong that the 'sale-and-leaseback' scheme only applies to those whose houses will need to be actually demolished. Other properties should also qualify,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are still going to be many people who will not qualify for any form of compensation for the loss in value of their homes caused by HS2 until a year after the line has been operational. That strikes me as iniquitous, particularly to those who live outside the voluntary purchase zone and want to move home, but will not qualify for the revised hardship scheme even though HS2 has reduced the value of their homes.\"</p> <p>When the government announced its plans to go ahead with the route, which will eventually see trains running at speeds of up to 225mph to Manchester and Leeds, it said more than 65% of the 55,000 responses to its consultations had mentioned property.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jan/10/hs2-house-prices-high-speed-rail\" title=\"HS2 and house prices: what the high-speed rail link means to you\">HS2 and house prices: what the high-speed rail link means to you</a></p>",
  "<p>In the mess that is the current US political climate, the best person to lead Americans through the dense fog of a tanking economy and complicated foreign policy might be a man&#xa0;whose most famous companion led him, one stormy Christmas Eve, through the fog with a bright red nose. </p> <p>Nevada resident Santa Claus is running for president and he announced Wednesday that singer Tracy Chapman \u2013&#xa0;not Rudolph \u2013&#xa0;would be his choice for running mate.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard either of the big boys talk about anything with respect to children, so I'd like to use that as a platform to insinuate my views on children, their health, safety and welfare and that's what I meant by restoring America's heart and soul,\" Claus told the Guardian. \"We have presidents and candidates and all these other politicians that are really into the whole war machine, some other things that aren't particularly good for children in my view and I would like to see voters consider changing that.\" </p> <p>Voters in 15 states can write in Santa Claus as their nominee for president on the November ballot. This includes key swing states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which means in a best case scenario he could get 108 electoral votes and have an actual influence on the election. </p> <p>If elected, the first thing he would do in office is work towards the main cause he advocates for, children. \"I think I would probably streamline the fostering and adoption system, it only takes 10 minutes to do it and it doesn't cost any more than we're already spending on those systems,\" Claus said.</p> <p>Claus is an advocate for vulnerable children full-time and decided in 2008 he would like to see a change in how politicians address issues that affect children and would lead that change himself by running for president.</p> <p>\"I have a heart for children and their future and I think they are being left behind in a big way. I'd like to see that change,\" Claus said. </p> <p>From 2005 through 2007, he visited every governor's office in the country on Santa's Bless the Children Tour to speak with them about issues affecting children. He specifically mentioned the desire to consolidate the fostering and adoption files in different states and to streamline the record-keeping process. </p> <p>The politician's staff were receptive to his talking points, except for the office of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who did not like the Santa shtick. </p> <p>This is his second time running for president and he increased his focus on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheSantaClaus\">social media</a> this election cycle, a move that has kept his campaigning costs under $200. </p> <p>Before becoming Santa Claus, he was as a communications consultant for the New York police department where he set up the first video unit for a law enforcement branch in the US. </p> <p>He now resides in the appropriately alpine Lake Tahoe. It was there that he decided to change his name to Santa Claus while walking to the post office. Claus is a monk and bishop and was praying to figure out how he could use his bearded Santa-like appearance to help children. He said he asked God if he should change his name and about 10 seconds later, a man yelled from a car: \"Santa, I love you.\" </p> <p>The next week, the man formerly known as Thomas O'Connor applied for a name change and he was Santa Claus less than a month later. Claus estimates he is one of a half dozen people with that name, though he couldn't get a straight answer from the social security administration to confirm. </p> <p>He also has a screen actors guild membership, which means he is the only person who can officially endorse products as Santa Claus. </p> <p>His chances of getting elected president are considerably low, even in the states where people might write in Santa Claus because they don't like other candidates without realizing an actual candidate has that name. </p> <p>\"As it happens, states that do permit the write-in candidates and recognize us don't count the ballots for us,\" Claus said. \"Unless we actually had a shot to win that particular state, they are not gonna bother with it \u2013 which I understand \u2013 but I don't appreciate it.\"</p> <p>And with the holiday season approaching, Claus has one last message for the electorate and non-voters alike: \"From Santa, the greatest gift you can give is love, not presents.\"</p>",
  "<p>The economist Robin Marris, who has died aged 88, saw good theory as the key to solving real problems. In the 1950s and 60s he worked closely with the Labour party \u2013 in 1956 Hugh Gaitskell came to seek his views on Suez (rejecting with disgust an accidentally offered mixture of sherry and water, rather than Scotch) \u2013 and when in 1964 Harold Wilson's incoming government established a Ministry of Overseas Development, Robin was recruited to advise its first two ministers, Barbara Castle and Anthony Greenwood.</p> <p>Dismay in the 1970s at what he saw as abuse of trade union power led him to become disillusioned with socialism. However, in the 1990s he became a Labour supporter again, dedicating his last book to Clare Short, the international development secretary.</p> <p>In How to Save the Underclass (1996), Robin argued that in Britain and other rich countries, universal access to education and Thatcherite liberalisation (of which he approved) had created a \"severe meritocracy\" in which the least able were left unacceptably far behind. The best solution lay in policies to accelerate growth which would boost demand for unskilled labour. Failing that, a generous welfare state, financed by higher taxes on the more able, would be necessary, though it might have difficulty in attracting electoral support.</p> <p>Ending Poverty (1999) covered the whole world and presciently stressed the importance of good macroeconomic policies in developed countries and good management of the international financial system, as well as the need for increased aid to promote education and industrialisation in developing countries.</p> <p>Robin was best known to economists for his major contribution to our understanding of corporations. His book The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism (1964) helped fill a gap in economics in that textbooks assumed that markets were usually supplied by a multiplicity of small firms, even though in reality most output was produced by large firms. It focused on the separation of ownership from management in large firms and on the weakness of shareholder control, which allowed managers considerable discretion.</p> <p>In Robin's view, managers used their discretion primarily to make their firms grow faster than shareholders would prefer, since in larger firms managers get higher salaries and status. He also argued that this was socially desirable: growth-seeking firms make countries grow faster. His work attracted much academic attention, and JK Galbraith's use of it in his 1966 Reith lectures and subsequent book, The New Industrial State, made it known to a wider audience.</p> <p>Since then, economics and the world have moved on, as Robin recognised in a 1998 revision of The Economic Theory of Managerial Capitalism. The existence of large firms is now explained theoretically by their ability to reduce what would otherwise be prohibitive costs of transactions among many small firms. The behaviour of managers is theorised as one of many examples of the problems that arise when principals have to act through agents. The share of managerial remuneration in the form of stock options and bonuses has also been increased, with the aim of aligning the interests of managers more closely with those of shareholders. Stock options have certainly altered managerial behaviour, though not necessarily for the better.</p> <p>Before and after he worked on large firms, Robin's research interests were in macroeconomics and the labour market. In the 1950s he undertook an innovative study of shiftwork. And in 1991 he published a remarkable book, Reconstructing Keynesian Economics with Imperfect Competition, in which he showed how Keynesian macroeconomic theory, of which he was a lifelong advocate, made sense only when combined with the theory of imperfect competition.</p> <p>Both strands of theory were invented in Cambridge in the 1930s, but, as the book intriguingly argues, sexual rivalries among the theorists kept them apart. This book was among the first to include a disk with a simulation model to run on personal computers, of which Robin was an early user.</p> <p>Robin was born in London, where his father was a senior civil servant, and educated at Bedales school, Hampshire, and King's College, Cambridge. His undergraduate studies were interrupted by three years of second world war service as an RAF pilot (achieved by pretending to be older than he was), but he eventually graduated in 1947. After two years in the Treasury and two years with the UN in Geneva, he returned to Cambridge in 1951 as a fellow of King's and a lecturer (later a reader) in the economics faculty, posts he held for the next 25 years. A long series of students, including me, benefited from his lively mind and warm personality \u2013 though his Carnaby Street suits and Mini Cooper S misled some of us into thinking that dons in general were sexy.</p> <p>In 1976, for a mixture of personal and professional reasons, he moved to a chair at the University of Maryland, where for three years he was head of department, and in 1981 to Birkbeck College, University of London, where again he served as head of department and from which he retired in 1987. At Maryland, he succeeded in raising academic standards, but in both places his headships were stormy and at Birkbeck aggravated by his intolerance of Marxists.</p> <p>Management was not one of Robin's strengths. Nor, alas, was marriage. Attractive to, and attracted by, women, he broke up with three wives in succession, though he is survived by his four children, Veronica, Sarah, Toby and Caroline. He was, however, one of the cleverest economists of his time and wonderful company \u2013 in seminars, at home, at restaurants, parties or on his little boat on the Solent \u2013 full of ideas and information, witty, charming and generous.</p> <p>\u2022 Robin Lapthorn Marris, economist, born 31 March 1924; died 25 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Lost in Showbiz pitches up to you reeling. It's been quite the week for celebrity news. First came the story that Prince Harry is apparently amusing his brothers in arms over in Afghanistan <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4603970/Gunships-and-Pips-party-tips.html\" title=\"\">by reading aloud from Pippa Middleton's book Celebrate \u2013 A Year of British Festivities for Family and Friends</a>: I know, I know, those long nights must just fly by. </p> <p>Hot on its heels came the greatest celebrity lawsuit in history: that's right, better even than the 31-year-old woman who last year attempted to sue P Diddy for $1tn and accused him of masterminding 9/11. This time, <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/justin-bieber/66785\" title=\"\">Justin Bieber has been sued by a man from Michigan</a> claiming the teen sensation stole his credit card and went on what sounds like the most esoteric shopping spree since Lost in Showbiz took to eBay after a few gins and later found itself in receipt of a K-Tel Rap'tou food processor, a guide to converting to Rastafarianism and a signed copy of No Parlez by Paul Young. Bieber, on the other hand, is alleged to have spent a grand total of $426.78 on a pregnancy termination for Selina Gomez, some cocaine for P Diddy \u2013 him again! \u2013 and a penis-enlargement operation. This seems like quite a haul for just over \u00a3250 to Lost in Showbiz: it paid close to that figure for its Paul Young album alone, but that's a bitter small-hours bidding war with a man from Stockton for you.</p> <p>The plaintiff furthermore claims that R&amp;B star Usher broke into his bedroom on 4 July, \"sodomized me with a firework ... while blaring Katy Perry's firework song in my ear drums\". Lost in Showbiz has no comment to make on this, beyond bringing it to Prince Harry's attention, with a cry of: HRH! Put your sister-in-law's cookbook down! This is how squaddies ought to amuse themselves in barracks!</p> <p>Of course, these pale in significance when compared with the biggest and saddest story of the week. Lost in Showbiz scarcely knows what to say about the news that <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4608151/leandro-penna-why-i-dumped-jordan.html\" title=\"\">Katie Price and Leandro Penna have broken off their engagement.</a> It dismissed those who saw the relationship as merely another publicity stunt: it can think of few things more authentically romantic, more indicative of a determination not to exploit your relationship for financial gain, than starring together in a Katie Price lingerie advertising campaign, or as Penna put it, \"<em>la sensual campa\u00f1a</em>\". It gave short shrift to anyone who suggested the relationship was doomed from the start, given that they were unable to communicate with words \u2013 he spoke little English, her Spanish was <em>hororoso</em>, as they say in La Pampa.</p> <p>But what are mere phonological barriers than something surmounted in a single bound by those fluent in the universal and unspoken language of love? \"The connection we have is so intense,\" offered Penna, before offering a striking example of the profundity of the bond the two shared. \"Like sometimes I'll be sitting and moving my head from side to side and she will know I'm looking for the remote control.\"</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz confesses it had known the relationship was on shaky ground for some time. Earlier this week, its hopes were bucked by a report in Closer magazine, which detailed their problems, but offered a shining beacon of hope: \"In an effort to patch things up with Leandro, she's taking him to Alton Towers theme park in Staffordshire\". What self-respecting 26-year-old in a failing relationship wouldn't be mollified by a visit to romantic Alton Towers, or, as Lost in Showbiz thinks of it, Paris with an inverted rollercoaster, a \u00a328.95 All-Day Dining Deal and regular meet and greets with \"park mascot\" Squirrel Nutty? How does the old saying go? The West Midlands in October is for lovers. Imagine the scene: a long amorous stroll around the Zombies! Scare Zone, perhaps a photo with Squirrel Nutty, followed by a romantic candlelit dinner for two at the Explorers Pizza Pasta Buffet or the Pirate Pasty Co. Who wouldn't find love's fire aflame once more?</p> <p>But it was not to be. Their sensual <em>campa\u00f1a</em> has come to a close. We can perhaps take some succour from the amiability of their parting, clearly a mutual decision taken for the common good, as evidenced by their statements. She: \"We really wish each other nothing but the very best and will remain the very best of friends.\" He: \"She is crazy. Katie's brain is not wired right, or the wires don't connect properly. I don't know what's wrong with her.\"</p> <p>Penna is apparently planning to head back to South America. Lost in Showbiz isn't afraid to say it will miss him, particularly on Twitter. It will miss his insights into the world of the Premiership: \"I am very happy that as soon as Tevez arrived in England he told me I am going to do everything to shut up the Italian's arse.\" It will miss his frank appraisals of Price's ex-husband, cross-dressing cage fighter Alex \"The Reidinator\" Reid \u2013 \"what a weird freak gay\" \u2013 and indeed, the shortcomings of the British police force. \"We are waiting for over an hour the police arrive!\" he tweeted, following a pickpocketing incident last year. \"Happens that we have reached the skinny signed it reached into the jacket ... Call the police and tell me that no police are available I fucking!\"</p> <p>It fears we will never see his like again. For solace, it turns to the pages of Pippa Middleton's Celebrate, and raises a gin-based \"creepy cocktail\" to his memory. Then it has another gin-based \"creepy cocktail\" and goes on eBay.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2012 to remove an erroneous suggestion that Basra is in Afghanistan. Basra is in Iraq.</p>",
  "<p>Zach Miller has his sales pitch down to a tee. A DVD with your team's season highlights, $10 (\u00a36) a pop. Individual player highlights, $5 (\u00a33) per game; for $20 (\u00a312), he'll throw in the whole season.

He's also a high school student. In fact, he counts the mother of one of his school's aspiring athletes as his first ever sale. \"I remember the satisfying feeling of placing a hefty check in my pocket\", he recalls. \"Before turning it in to the finance department.\"</p> <p>Miller is one of thousands of US teenagers who have participated in the <a href=\"http://www.ja.org/involved/involved_students_comp_n_america_co.shtml\" title=\"\">JA Company of the Year</a> competition. Designed by youth charity<a href=\"http://www.ja.org/\" title=\"\"> Junior Achievement</a>, the competition invites young people to build their enterprise skills by setting up their own company.</p> <p>\"This [the competition] gives them a great grounding and foundational understanding of what it takes to start and run a business,\" says Stephanie Bell, spokesperson for Junior Achievement (JA). \"Because they might have a great idea, but just not know how to go about getting it started.\"</p> <p>The impact on these young people's futures is self-evident. Bell cites a long list of successful entrepreneurs to have passed through the ranks of Junior Achievement. The ripples spread further too. Employment is one of the central issues in the current US presidential election campaign: how to create American jobs, and how to keep them. JA's Company of the Year taps into precisely that agenda.</p> <p>Bell adds: \"In the US, small businesses are the engine of job creation. JA believes in the importance of fostering an entrepreneurial spirit among young people \u2026 because frankly that's what is going to help the US remain competitive in the global market.\"</p> <p>Enterprise skills are only one aspect of JA's suite of two dozen programmes. The remainder focus on either work readiness or financial literacy. Employers regularly complain about young people being ill equipped for the world of work. Through its work with schools, JA seeks to tackle that criticism head-on.</p> <h2>Business buy-in</h2> <p>One of the critical reasons behind the charity's long-running success (it's been going since 1919) lies in its ability to engage the business community. Companies not only help to financially support the work of the charity's 121 offices across the US, but they donate staff time too.</p> <p>AT&amp;T is one such example. Under its newly-launched AT&amp;T Aspire Mentoring Academy, the US communications firm aims to provide one million hours of mentoring support over the next five years \u2013 much of that delivered by working with Junior Achievement.</p> <p>One of the academy's core activities is a job-mentoring programme, which sees groups of high school students spend a day at the company's offices. As well as gaining a taste of the workplace and career advice, the students are set a business problem to solve.</p> <p>\"The problem is set around a real-life issue that an AT&amp;T employee might have, whether that's sales, project management, customer service, human resources technician, and so on. That way students can make the connection between the workplace and their education\", says Brad Yates, the academy's director.</p> <p>Bell insists that such insights from the workplace are \"complementary\" to the school system, not in competition. Junior Achievement takes what students are learning in maths, science, technology and other core curriculum subjects, and demonstrates how these tangibly play out in the world of work.</p> <p>The educational benefits to the students are not only clear but calculable, according to Yates. He cites a study by <a href=\"http://weteachscience.org/\" title=\"\">We Teach Science</a>, another online e-mentoring charity with which AT&amp;T partners. For every hour of mentoring, students' test results were shown to increase by an average of 1.6%. \"That means we'll take someone who has a low likelihood of success, and place them in a position to be successful in high school,\" Yates says.</p> <p>Companies stand to benefit too. Many employees state that volunteering in their communities gives a sense of satisfaction. In harsh commercial terms, that feeds into better retention levels and higher morale. For firms that recruit from nearby schools and universities, any step to increases the capacity of the local talent pool makes bottom-line sense.</p> <h2>Global movement</h2> <p>Junior Achievement isn't just a US phenomenon. The charity now counts links in 120 countries, extending the total reach of its programmes to around 10.5 million young people.</p> <p>In the UK, it trades under the name of <a href=\"http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Young Enterprise</a>. Financial services firm <a href=\"http://www.capitalone.co.uk/aboutus/csr-community.jsf\" title=\"\">Capital One</a> is among its major corporate supporters. For the last three years, employees from the company's main office in Nottingham have been running sessions in financial literacy in local schools.</p> <p>Advice about money management, debt and personal finance in general often gets overlooked in the classroom due to more pressing social concerns, says the company's head of corporate responsibility Alison Gardner. Teachers themselves aren't necessarily that clued up on the subject either. In contrast, Capital One's employees live and breathe this stuff. \"They are using it every day at work, so why not in the schools too?\" Gardner states.</p> <p>Gardner admits that there might be \"a degree of cynicism\" about a company's motive for going into a school or about their ability to deliver. That's where the charity's heritage and brand comes in. \"By partnering with Youth Enterprise, which is unbiased, has a great reputation and strong links with local schools, it really helps us to engage with students in a different way.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A certain online encyclopedia describes <strong>Assassin's Creed III</strong> (PS3/Xbox360/WiiU/PC) as a \"historical action-adventure open world stealth video game\". It is both a long-winded description and an incomplete one. It is, arguably, missing the words \"free-running\", \"management\" and \"martial arts\". And it is definitely, undeniably, missing the vital key word \"epic\". Because \u2013 and I say this having only scratched the surface \u2013 this game is so epic it looks set to make Ben Hur look like a child's cartoon flipbook.</p> <p>The third instalment of the Assassin's Creed story takes place over a sizable chunk of the 18th century, in the stirrings, midst and aftermath of the American revolution. As in previous editions, this is framed with science-fiction set in the present day: the Animus, a machine capable of reading memories out of our genes, plunges modern hero Desmond Miles back into the lives of his ancestors: the secretive order of Assassins, engaged in a millennial battle with the dastardly and deadly Templars.</p> <p>This time, though, the stakes are higher than ever. The world of the present is just a month or so away from being engulfed in an apocalyptic cataclysm and Desmond's genetic memories are humanity's only hope of working out how to stop this happening. Specifically, it's the life of his ancestor Connor Kenway, a half-British, half-Native American assassin, that holds the key to staving off the end of days.</p> <p>And what a life it is, full of intrigue, betrayal, warfare at land and on the high seas and, above all, freedom. Both in the sense of the great struggle against America's wicked British oppressors and in the sense of: \"Wow, you can do absolutely bloody anything.\" Because alongside the grand central narrative stretching across continents and centuries are a labyrinth of side-quests, meaty distractions and hidden gems.</p> <p>Take, for example, your Homestead, an old colonial estate that forms the base of Kenway's operations and, if you're not the home improvement type, little else. Take an interest in its affairs and you'll soon discover there's a wealth of tasks to be getting on with. Recruiting settlers, for one. You'll want to seek out, among others, carpenters, a butcher and an innkeeper, to keep buildings up, mouths fed and spirits high. You can even organise them into an efficient trading machine, crafting and shipping goods all over the eastern seaboard.</p> <p>Then, as you grow frustrated with the taxes imposed on your new empire, you'll want to head out into the wilderness and conquer the Templar forts along your trade routes. And when the land is yours \u2013 or before \u2013 you may choose to hunt on it, tracking, baiting, trapping and skinning wolves, bears, panthers and other wildlife and taking the pelts and innards back to be traded or crafted into useful gear.</p> <p>Tire of the land, and you can head out on to the ocean in your trusty ship, waging naval war against the Templars, living the life of a salty privateer or following dusty maps in search of the legendary Captain Kidd's treasure. If you find your beloved vessel's not up to the journey, a short visit to the Harbourmaster will set him to work upgrading it. Fancy a quiet break and you can wander about the harbour, watching the crew at work, rigging sails and bickering below decks, or climb the crow's nest for a spectacular view of the open sea or the sprawling, freely explorable cities of Boston and New York.</p> <p>Or you can do none of that. Ignore the siren call of the sea, the hunt, the homestead and the market, and there's still the noble business of assassination to be getting on with, and it's here, in the campaign's core missions, that the developers have really flexed their cinematic muscles.</p> <p>In one short session with the game, I've chased a target on horseback through a vast chaotic battle, performed a quiet stabbing amid the gentry of a crowded theatre, eavesdropped from a rooftop on a young George Washington and ambushed a convoy of two dozen musketeers. All of which looked incredible, largely thanks to an elegantly simple control setup and a combat engine that turns every little scuffle into a fluid John Woo masterpiece.</p> <p>If the rest of it is as gorgeous, rich, intelligent and exhilarating as these first few hours, we may be looking at something more than a mere contender for the game of the year. It just might be the defining epic of a generation of consoles.</p>",

  "<p>A former aide to Malawi's late president Bingu wa Mutharika is among six men who have been arrested over the murder of a student activist initially said by police to have killed himself.</p> <p>Noel Masangwi, a high-ranking official in the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), was detained in a pre-dawn raid over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/15/malawi-africa-creeping-dictatorship?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">killing of Robert Chasowa</a>, a critic of Mutharika's government.</p> <p>Chasowa, who studied engineering, was found dead at a college campus in Blantyre in September last year. Police said he had jumped to his death from a five-storey building and produced bogus suicide notes as evidence.</p> <p>But a judge-led inquiry ordered by the president, Joyce Banda, who succeeded Mutharika after his death in April, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/student-activist-murdered-malawian-inquiry\" title=\"\">ruled that Chasowa had in fact been murdered</a>. Banda promised that the culprits would \"face the full wrath of the law\".</p> <p>The arrested men include Stanford Horea, a police officer, Mike Chitenje, a leading boxing promoter and DPP member, and Lewis Ngaland, the DPP's director of youth. The DPP youth wing was accused of using violence and intimidation against Mutharika's opponents.</p> <p>Kelvin Maigwa, a police spokesman, said the arrested people were likely to be charged with murder, which carries a maximum sentence of death. \"The operation is ongoing,\" he added.</p> <p>Chasowa, the chairman of a student activist group, Youth for Democracy (YFD), had published anti-government leaflets before his death.</p> <p>When he died, police produced two alleged suicide notes and a postmortem report to support their claim that he had taken his own life. But the pathologist Charles Dzamalala, who conducted the autopsy, found that Chasowa had been bludgeoned to death.</p> <p>Chasowa's father, Austin, welcomed the arrests. He told <a href=\"http://www.bnltimes.com/index.php/daily-times/headlines/national/12036-chasowa-bitter-over-sons-murder\" title=\"\">Malawi's Daily Times newspaper</a> on Thursday: \"Robert was killed. The same people who denied that Robert had been killed are the suspects now. I don't know who to trust. The state lied to me.</p> <p>\"But of course I am glad and relieved in the way things are moving. I want to know what crime Robert committed to deserve such a brutal death. That is what I am interested in; not compensation.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks back, as part of our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/series/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-at-west-yorkshire-playhouse\" title=\"\">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof reviewing project</a> in partnership with the West Yorkshire Playhouse, we arranged a joint interview with the stars of the show, Zoe Boyle and Jamie Parker, who play Maggie and Brick respectively \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/16/cat-hot-tin-roof-zoe-boyle-jamie-parker\" title=\"\"> but we wanted you to ask the questions</a>. Thanks to everyone who sent them in. Here are their reactions \u2026 </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18944443\" title=\"\">grumpy99</a></h2> <p>Congrats to the director and cast \u2013 the play was well worth the trip to Leeds. Reflected both the tragic and farcical elements of family life. Found the production cool rather than sultry. Was this understatement deliberate?</p> <p><strong>Jamie Parker:</strong> The brilliance of the play, for me, is in its ambiguities. So much is left unanswered, and unsaid, that any audience is obliged and encouraged to fill in many of the gaps themselves, based on their own experiences and empathies (or lack of them) for the characters. This includes distinctions such as those between hot and cold in the play. Many have commented on the heat of the production, which is of course paradoxical given Brick's coldness towards Maggie. All I can say is I had no specific intention on that front. I wonder, if you'd seen the play on another night, surrounded by a different audience, whether you may have felt totally different about that aspect of the show.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18954312\" title=\"\">Melon15</a></h2> <p>What's it like performing with such a clearly defined structure? Is it preferable to only having the one break during the show? And do you approach the acts differently, knowing there's a particular mood you have to conjure, or a particularly emotional or difficult section?</p> <p><strong>Zoe Boyle:</strong> Originally we were just going to have one interval between acts two and three, but when we ran acts one and two together, Sarah Esdaile felt it just didn't work. I think she was right: Tennessee intended the play to have two intervals, and we all felt each act was like a play of its own and had to be given space to breathe. The one problem I have is with it generating the same energy at the top of act two, as at the end of act two. The action is continuous, but I have 50 minutes to get into that emotional peak by the end of act one \u2013 and it can be tricky to match it after a 15-minute interval. But it does give Jamie a much-needed loo break!</p> <p><strong>JP:</strong> From my point of view it's luxurious, because I have little or none of the pressures of \"driving\" scenes that Zoe and Richard and the others have. In many ways I simply go on stage, having made myself as available to the play as possible, and just sit or lie there, drinking, allowing the play to happen to me. It's fantastically carefree, compared with playing, say, Henry V, which is entirely about taking control of every situation. My job is made infinitely easier by the quality of the writing and the force with which my confreres verbally and emotionally repeatedly punch me in the head and heart. And the extra interval is so I can go for a pee \u2026</p> <h2>Varietas, via email</h2> <p>Stage or screen \u2013 which is better?</p> <p><strong>ZB: </strong>Both. But having done mostly television recently, it felt like a real luxury to have a rehearsal period. Just having time to really investigate and explore the material has been really rewarding.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19014261\" title=\"\">ShakespeareMad</a></h2> <p>I would like to know more about the rehearsal process, such as whether you had to struggle a lot to get the accents right or whether they came quite naturally. Also, the play is frequently a power struggle between the characters, and the three acts become, among other things, three different angles of this struggle; did you experiment with playing the scenes in a variety of different ways in terms of who has the upper hand in each relationship at each moment?</p> <p>One more question. As Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a multilayered, deeply nuanced text, which has often made it the victim of academic study, did they approach the text from an academic perspective at all during rehearsals?</p> <p><strong>JP:</strong> We spent a long time going through the text line by line, examining it for things that remain unspoken. In all the best plays, for every line written to be spoken aloud there is a list of lines that go unsaid. Rehearsals, for me, are about choosing which unspoken lines to say, and gradually becoming more and more specific in whichever choice you make \u2013 even though those choices may change from night to night and indeed from line to line.</p> <p>The accent just needs you to go for it, and trust that the dialect coach will keep you on the straight and narrow.</p> <p><strong>ZB:</strong> The accent was trickier than I expected. I've played American roles on a few occasions and worked in the States, so I thought I had a good grip on the southern accent. But once you get into more specific territory, you realise where you're going wrong! The thing to do is just work on the accent and then forget about it in performance. Just trust (and hope) that it's there. In terms of the status shifts that occur in the play, we didn't set about finding a structure for them in rehearsal. The struggles come from the conflicting objectives of the characters. So as long as you pinpoint them, and then play your intention truthfully, the struggle comes on its own.</p> <p>I think all the academic writing about this play is very interesting, and we did engage with it, mostly at the beginning of the process. The one thing I didn't particularly find helpful was Elia Kazan's note to Tennessee Williams to make Maggie more \"likable\" in act three. I didn't like to think of her as being liked or not liked by the audience. It can inhibit your choices. And for all her bitchiness, I think Maggie is a pretty cool cat!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18889689\" title=\"\">InestableVacio</a></h2> <p>Just wanted to say that I loved this year's Henry V at the Globe and thought Jamie was brilliant as Hal.</p> <p><strong>JP:</strong> Thanks for making a dream come true! Wanted to play him since I was eight or nine, and I'm sobered and humbled by the memory of those audiences who were willing to be re-enchanted by the play built around my all-time hero.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19064064\" title=\"\">AndrewDickson</a></h2> <p>What's it like to perform when you're under such scrutiny, from us and everyone who's blogged, tweeted or written about the show? Does it feel different?</p> <p><strong>ZB:</strong> This is the first thing I've done where I've been sure to be reviewed. I think I was more nervous about the fact that it's such an iconic role because of the film. People can have a preconceived idea of how it should be played. But I try my best not to think about that.</p> <p><strong>JP:</strong> Hasn't bothered me on this one so much. I wonder how much of that is Brick rubbing off. I hope I'm carefree about it, as opposed to not caring. I want the play to be well-received, and I'm open to any criticism I feel is valid. I don't claim to have got a single performance \"right\" in my entire life, and the fascination remains for me in the way in which an actor can stand in the same place on the same stage and say the same lines in the same way, and yet on a different night have such a wildly different effect in the room. There's the respect in which film cannot directly compete with theatre \u2013 the simple fact of being in the same room as these events makes you complicit in them somehow. On many nights, you feel as if you've not done well enough; and on the nights when a play really flies you wish you could bottle it. And of course in film, if you really nail it, even just once, it's there forever. In theatre, it's gone as soon as it's said, unless it lingers in the memories of those who were there to witness it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19044075\" title=\"\">AlfredHickling</a></h2> <p>What's actually in all those bottles in the liquor cabinet, and how do you manage to control your bladder?</p> <p><strong>JP:</strong> Ha! It's watered-down flat Coke. And I'm not thinking too closely about the bladder issue, in the hope that it won't become an issue \u2026</p>",
  "<p><strong>What will the open data user group be doing?</strong></p> <p>In order for the government to release the right data we, as a community, need to act with a single voice and clearly set out the argument that certain open datasets have the potential to deliver broad benefits. The government doesn't always find it easy to understand what open data users want and need, and which datasets would have the biggest impact if released for free, so we're acting as the bridge between the open data community and government.</p> <p><strong>What do you want to achieve in the role?</strong></p> <p>I'd like ODUG to be recognised for success in representing open data users at the heart of government, by targeting public sector data that has a clear benefit in being released for free, and by working with the government to make that happen.</p> <p>I would also like to help more public sector bodies discover that releasing open data can result in great benefits for their own organisations. In many cases, opening up data publicly drives the improved use of data and management information internally \u2013 which can lead to a better understanding of your own organisation and help drive innovation and higher performance.</p> <p><strong>What are the challenges facing the open data agenda?</strong></p> <p>One of the key obstacles we need to overcome is to convince public sector data owners or custodians to release their data without restrictions, either through licensing or costs. There is also a longer term challenge of stimulating a culture change across the whole of the public sector to embed a presumption to publish, and making this part of day-to-day business. A number of organisations make a tidy profit charging for data but we don't see this as being the best way for the UK to get the full benefit from the underlying costs of producing these datasets. Convincing people isn't always easy, especially when departments are operating under spending constraints.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Do citizens need to be better engaged to get the most from open data?</strong></p> <p>Some citizens are already actively involved. Open data opens up the door for technology-based start-ups to get into business or to drive new business. But this is only possible when individuals and organisations have the skills and understanding to analyse and produce insights from the data. ODUG is working closely with the <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\">Open Data Institute</a> to help foster a new ecosystem of individuals and organisations so that we all realise the value of open data. However, many citizens still need to be informed about the potential of open data and what this can mean to them as individuals. The average person is getting on with their life and will only interact with the government driven by an immediate need for a public service. One of the challenges is to demonstratethat it can lead to benefits on all sides; for citizens, organisations and for government itself.</p> <p><strong>What's your background and how will it inform your role?</strong></p> <p>My first degree is in electronic and electrical engineering, and I have previously worked with and for organisations of all sizes, from start-ups to global corporates. I also have five years experience working in central government. So, I have a strong private sector background, coupled with hands-on experience of policy design and delivery. I understand the challenges on both sides of the fence.</p> <p><strong>Is there enough consistency in approach between departments?</strong></p> <p>Whitehall culture can seem strange, especially when you first arrive from the private sector. The common theme I have noticed across central government is that there can be a reticence to try something new, for fear of failure. In my opinion, a culture which allows people to try and fail increases levels of aspiration. The first law of innovation and improvement is that appropriate levels of risk need to be taken, and failure needs to be tolerated and viewed as an opportunity to learn and improve.</p> <p><strong>What has been your biggest achievement?</strong></p> <p>Being part of a UK start-up which went public on Nasdaq in 1996; personally turning around two technology companies \u2013 both of which were successfully acquired within a year of my involvement \u2013 and completing my MBA at London Business School whilst working full-time.</p> <p><strong>Who, or what, has taught you the most about leadership?</strong></p> <p>My worst personal experiences of different leaders have taught me more than the positive ones. For certain individuals who lead entirely from the front it's all fine whilst everything goes well. When it doesn't they can falter \u2013 either to protect themselves or because they simply don't know what to do next. I have learnt two things from this \u2013 the importance of maintaining strong leadership whilst working as a team, and the importance of asking for help when you need it \u2013 wherever you are in your career, or whatever your job.</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style?</strong></p> <p>My underlying leadership skills were developed in start-up environments where job title and hierarchy count for less than raw intellect, actual delivery and individual and group achievements. I'm fairly informal in my approach but I like to cut to the chase quickly when I get down to business. I try to relate to everyone on an individual basis and pull teams together in a way which plays to each person's strengths.</p> <p>I always aspire to lead a 'no-surprises', 'no-blame' culture where problems can be surfaced earlier rather than later. To achieve this, your team needs to have faith in your full support for them at all times, and to know that you will take personal responsibility \u2013 whatever happens.</p> <p><strong>If you could take three things to a desert island what would they be?</strong></p> <p>My iPad (even without an internet connection), a supply of decent red wine, and a feather pillow.</p> <p><em>The ODUG have just released a form on </em><a href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk/odug\" title=\"\"><em>data.gov.uk</em></a><em> for businesses and individuals to highlight those datasets which would be the best to release for free</em></p>",

  "<p>When Traci Maccoux, 22, a graphic-design student from Minnesota, got a call on her cellphone warning that she was at risk from meningitis from a potentially contaminated steroid injection, she laughed it off.</p> <p>She was too young, she thought, as many of those who contracted the disease were in their 60s or 70s. Besides, Maccoux has a chronic pain condition and had spent the summer looking for a sympathetic and reputable clinic to treat it. Now that she had found one locally and had her epidural steroid shots, she wanted to get on with her studies, get back to her recent passion for photography and forget about all that medical stuff.</p> <p>Days later, when the headaches and vomiting came, she put on a pair of sunglasses and dismissed it as a bad migraine, which she has had before. Her mother, Cathy, had difficulty persuading her to go to hospital to get tested, just in case.</p> <p>On 5 October, the results of her lumbar puncture confirmed the worst. The black mould, aspergillis, had been detected in her spine. She became the fifth person in Minnesota to test positive for fungal meningitis linked to the tainted steroid produced by New England Compounding Center (NECC).</p> <p>Maccoux is one of more than 300 patients in 17 states who have been diagnosed with the disease from the outbreak linked to NECC. Some have had strokes associated with the infection. On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said another person had died, bringing the death toll to 24. Up to 14,000 people have been told they are at risk, though most are not expected to become ill.</p> <p>\"I was alone when I got the call,\" said Maccoux, who has has reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a condition that causes chronic pain in the arms and legs and for which she sought the steroid shot. \"I was shocked. I thought: that's not possible. There are thousands of people who got that injection.\"</p> <p>When she got to hospital, doctors told her the fungus was in her brain and that, without treatment, it could kill her. \"It hit me then,\" she said. \"I started to get a little scared.\"</p> <p>Little is known about these affected individuals, save what appears in sporadic news reports, amid a scandal that has brought in its wake a litany of unanswered questions regarding oversight and responsibility for regulating compound pharmacies, of which NECC was one.</p> <p>But the diagnosis has pitched Maccoux and her family, who have coped with her pain since she contracted RDS at the age of 11, into a \"whole different ballpark\" of suffering.</p> <h2>Step into the unknown</h2> <p>Maccoux had two sets of two injections, in July and August at the Maps pain clinic in her Minnesota suburb, to alleviate the pain associated with RSD and to allow her to prepare for college life. The clinic is one of 75 that received contaminated steroids from NECC. It is not clear how many vials were contaminated among the tainted batches sent, according to CDC.</p> <p>But for Maccoux, the past three weeks have been a nightmare of operations, blood tests, new drugs and a frightening lack of knowledge from medical professionals about everything to do with the infection.</p> <p>She has been told very little about her prognosis, the treatment or the long-term side effects of the anti-fungal drug which she may have to take for up to a year, she said. She still has headaches and she has been told not to drive. She gets tired easily. She has had to drop out of her semester at college because of the battery of operations and tests she has had to undergo.</p> <p>Her initial drug treatment caused aural hallucinations which she described as \"kind of creepy\". <a href=\"http://www.rxlist.com/vfend-drug/patient-images-side-effects.htm#sideeffects\">The second drug, Voriconazole</a>, worries her more.</p> <p>\"It was kind of scary and it still is,\" she said. \"They don't know the long-term side effects of what they are doing. They haven't used the medicine much. The doctors don't really say much; they are going by what the CDC says. They haven't experienced this type of infection before and that's scary, too.\"</p> <p>\"I have to be on it for three or four months and that's only if I'm doing well.\"</p> <p>The possible side effects listed from Voriconazole are wide-ranging and include behavioural changes, visual disturbances, problems with speech and skin problems. Another issue for Maccoux and her family is the availability and the cost of the medicine. At $75 dollars a tablet and at three tablets a day, it costs them over $6,000 a month. And the hospital will only dispense two or three tablets at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398361499\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/24/1351108011933/New-England-Compounding-C-006.jpg\" alt=\"New England Compounding Center, Framingham, Massachusetts\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New England Compounding Center, Framingham, Massachusetts.

Pritzker, who is representing about 40 of those affected by the health scandal, has described it as a example of \"corporate irresponsibility abetted by regulatory failure\", and has called on Congress to set up a compensation fund for people injured and the families of those killed by the outbreak.</p> <p>There is also an application under way to have a multi-district litigation (MDL) suit, which will bring litigants together under one court. Lawyers representing those affected expect NECC, which is no longer operational, to declare itself bankrupt and thus complicate the legal process further.</p> <p>As the outbreak has progressed, a picture has emerged of NECC as a company that repeatedly failed to follow standard procedures to keep its facilities clean and its products sterile. NECC was violating state law by shipping drugs in bulk without patient-specific prescriptions, officials from Massachusetts state have said.</p> <p>Records released this week also show the state knew NECC had violated prescription laws over the past decade, but the state never took disciplinary action, despite complaints from doctors and officials in Iowa, Wisconsin and Texas.</p> <p>One former compound pharmacist, Eric Kastango, who now works in quality control, described it as a \"preventable\" tragedy. Amid calls for about loopholes in federal regulation to be closed to better regulate compounding pharmacies, questions are increasingly being raised about the regulation of the company by the state.</p> <p>Lawsuits are rising in number and broadening in scope, with some attorneys filing suits against the pain clinics and the physicians who administered the shots.</p> <h2>'It could be a year before I'm done with the medicine'</h2> <p>Asked whether the drugs are working, Maccoux said: \"They can't really tell us.

It could be a few months to a year before I'm done with the medicine.\"</p> <p>The infection has also had an impact on a pain treatment that Maccoux was getting for her RSD, which flares up twice a month but which was beginning to be brought under control.</p> <p>Very quickly after her diagnosis, Maccoux had to undergo a spinal operation to remove a spacer for a spinal-chord stimulator \u2013 a device which had been inserted to treat her chronic pain with electrodes which alter the signals in her brain, turning the pain into tingling.</p> <p>Doctors told her if she kept the spacer, the fungal infection would never go away. Because of the infection, she was told, she would never be able to get the spacer inserted again \u2013 closing the door on a treatment for her pain that had not long been opened.</p> <p>\"I was not happy about that,\" she said. \"That was a huge problem.

  "<p>David Cameron used a major speech this week to take a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/21/david-cameron-law-and-order\">tougher stance on crime and punishment</a>. He focused on the need for \"retribution\" against offenders as part of the justice process. Talking tough on crime is a well-worn tactic in politics, especially for parties ailing in the opinion polls.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/24/birmingham-equal-pay-victory-women-city\" title=\"Birmingham equal pay victory for women may impact City of London\">Birmingham council workers'</a> recent victory means workers now have six-years to make an equal pay claim in the high court. In other words, they are not limited to making such a claim within a six-month window to an employment tribunal, which Birmingham Council were arguing should be the case under its interpretation of existing legislation.</p> <p>As women make up more than half the UK workforce, and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/gender-pay-gap/situation-europe/index_en.htm\" title=\"European Commission: The situation in the EU\">previous EU surveys</a> have shown the country as having one of the highest pay gaps between men and women, will this open the floodgates to other claims going back six years, especially in traditionally male dominated industries? What actually amounts to \"pay\" for the purposes of a claim being made? And what may be on most people's minds is how they actually find out if they are being paid less than their gender counterparts?</p> <p>Laws on equal pay have existed for more than 40 years, and the latest legislation is in the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents\" title=\"Equality Act 2010\">Equality Act 2010</a>. The act requires that, where men and women are employed on equal work, the terms of their contracts should also be equal, including pay. This law applies where there are differences in equality of terms between men and women, but does not apply to those persons of the same sex.</p> <p>For the purposes of the act, \"equality of terms\" includes contractual pay, but can also embrace other terms and conditions of employment such as the provision of a company car, healthcare and other benefits \u2013 therefore, a differential of any such terms can give rise to a claim.</p> <p>If you think you have been paid less than a gender counterpart, how do you find out what they are earning and how would this best be tackled with your employer? As a starting point, you need to establish who exactly you are comparing yourself with of the opposite sex.</p> <p>That person should be employed on \"like work\", \"work related as equivalent\" or \"work of an equal value\" basis. This person then becomes your \"comparator\" and must be in the \"same employment\" as you, meaning it must be with your employer or an associated employer.</p> <p>Once you establish who your comparator is, you are entitled under the act to ask your colleagues about their pay in order to establish whether there are inequalities. However, there is no obligation on your colleague to respond and you cannot be penalised by your employer for having such discussions.</p> <p>In addition, under section 138 of the act there is a questionnaire you can send to your employer to <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/equality-act-publications/complaints-Equality-Act/\" title=\"Home Office: Process for complaints under the Equality Act 2010\">seek further information in relation your concerns about unequal pay</a>. This is to establish whether your employer agrees with your assertion of carrying out the same role as the opposite sex, confirmation of what the pay differential amounts to, and whether there is a \"material defence\" to such differentials.</p> <p>The types of \"material defence\" that could be raised by an employer include geographic locations or market forces necessitating the need to retain employees carrying out particular roles at a higher salary. An employer must show that all the differences are attributable to the reasons they provide.</p> <p>As always, it is often best to approach your employer on an informal basis to see if matters can be resolved. If proceedings are ultimately necessary, you can either bring a claim in an employment tribunal at any time while you are still employed, or within six months of leaving your job.</p> <p>Alternatively, after yesterday's judgement you have six years to bring a claim in the high court, although it was specified that claims should be brought in the employment tribunal where it is still possible to do so. The fact you now also have a longer time period does, however, leave your employer exposed. Whether this will lead to a rush of historic claims remains to be seen.</p> <p>Do you know how much your colleagues earn? Have you found out or suspected you were being paid less than your gender counterpart? And did you do anything about it?</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer with </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/philip_landau.htm\" title=\"Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The Virgin boss Richard Branson is to fly to Moscow to lobby the Russian government to open its airports to more UK airlines after the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on Wednesday awarded rights to the last flight slots to Moscow to a rival airline, easyJet.</p> <p>Virgin have long held ambitions to fly to Moscow and have not ruled out legal action over what they describe as a \"disappointing, surprising and strange\" decision by the CAA.</p> <p>Branson is due to meet Vladimir Putin but talks on the airline issue will be held with other officials and politicians. He said it was time for \"open skies\", and that decisions on how many airlines fly between countries were best left to a market \"rather than a civil servant\".</p> <p>EasyJet will operate a 180-seat Airbus A320 on its twice-daily services from London Gatwick to Moscow Domodedovo airport. It expects to fly more than 230,000 passengers in its first year of operations, starting next spring, with fares as cheap as \u00a3125 return.</p> <p>Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive, said it was the right decision for consumers in the UK and Russia, and that the airline would serve business and leisure travellers alike.</p> <p>However, Virgin claims that the vast majority of the market is made up of business travellers who would prefer to fly to Heathrow. Branson said: \"Our plane was far more suitable for the route. The 125,000 extra seats we would have put on would have meant people ended up paying less.\"</p> <p>While Branson said he thought there was room for easyJet and Virgin, he claimed Virgin's bigger Airbus A330 would also have allowed it to compete in the cargo market, 42% of which is owned by British Airways. \"BA must be smiling today,\" he added.</p> <p>While Branson stressed that he did not think \"this is a train situation\" \u2013 a reference to the west coast rail franchising fiasco, where legal action from Virgin overturned the government's original decision \u2013 he said he did not rule it out.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic's chief executive, Steve Ridgway, confirmed that a team in London was looking at the judgment. He said judicial review was \"always an option\".</p> <p>The CAA, under a bilateral agreement with Russia, has the right to award two daily London to Moscow slots to two UK airlines. BA retained the pair it held but the other had to be reallocated after the national carrier took over BMI, which also flew the route.</p> <p>Branson and Ridgway were speaking in Delhi before Virgin's inaugural flight on a new route from Mumbai.</p> <p>While the airline is expanding its own services, Branson ruled out any further moves into Indian aviation, despite recent legislation relaxing foreign ownership rules. He told an Indian business audience that while he welcomed the moves, India needed to go further to attract investment. He added that he expected several airlines to go bust in an overcrowded domestic market.</p>",

Far from being a blessing, minerals have an adverse impact, the argument goes. This is because commodity exporters face a decline over time in the relative prices of their products and also because of the \"Dutch disease\", whereby the resource sector drives up the value of the local currency, hurting the competitiveness of manufacturing exports.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/5398.html\" title=\"\">influential study by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner</a>, covering 97 countries between 1971-89, it was found that natural resource exporters grew at appreciably lower rates than other countries. More recent work, however, disputes the methodology used by Sachs and Warner. <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=izfIXniUJ7IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=lederman+and+maloney+and+resource+curse&amp;ots=Jre1z6C6dR&amp;sig=_TlOp9x16plkBKUChMiFGHxHvHE#v=onepage&amp;q=lederman%20and%20maloney%20and%20resource%20curse&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Daniel Lederman and William Maloney</a>, for instance, have suggested that natural resources are neither curse nor destiny, asserting instead that it's a mixed bag: some resource-rich countries perform poorly, others do not.</p> <h2><strong>What are the relative growth figures for resource-rich and resource-poor countries?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely\" title=\"\">A recent World Bank study, Africa's Pulse</a>, compared growth of Africa's resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries between 1980 and 2010. In the 1980s, both sets of countries experienced a virtual stagnation in per-capita gross domestic product. Overall, resource-rich countries were unable to harness resource wealth in the first two decades. Since 2000, however, it has been a different story: higher growth in all groups, with oil-rich countries in the lead. The oil producers achieved sustained growth over the past decade, with some growing faster than others. Angola and Equatorial Guinea experience annual average growth rates of more than 7%. At the lower end, Nigeria, Sudan and Cameroon had rates of 3-6%.</p> <h2><strong>What impact has economic growth had on poverty and inequality in Africa?</strong></h2> <p>Not much. The same World Bank study said strong economic growth over the past decade in Africa has had little impact on poverty rates. Some countries \u2013 Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon \u2013 have actually seen an increase in the percentage of their population living in extreme poverty. \"Overall, the decline in poverty rates in resource-rich countries has generally lagged that of the region's non-resource rich countries,\" said the bank. \"Income distribution remains highly unequal in most countries in the region \u2026 To a large extent, the benefits of growth have not reached the poorest segments of society.\"</p> <h2><strong>How do resource-rich countries score on accountability and governance?</strong></h2> <p>Poorly. The <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/worldwide-governance-indicators\" title=\"\">World Bank's governance indicators</a> show that oil-rich countries in Africa systematically perform worse than other country groups in terms of voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law and the control of corruption, with Chad and Sudan among the worst performers. As the World Bank notes, where governments are heavily dependent on resource rents rather than on direct taxes from citizens, \"the chain of accountability between citizens and governments can be weak. Also, natural resource abundance can be associated with weak checks and balances, because the generation of large rents motivates political elites and powerful private actors/groups to capture these rents for the benefit of a few over the common economic interest.\" Although there may be no resource curse on growth, it seems to manifest itself in relation to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/25/niger-resources-nigerien-people-video\" title=\"\">concentration of wealth and accountability</a> (video).</p> <h2><strong>What is being done to improve accountability?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/17/france-eu-transparency-resource-curse\" title=\"\">France is making a big push for the EU's directives on transparency and accounting</a>, currently making their way through the EU. The directives, which were approved by a key European parliamentary committee in September, require publicly quoted companies in the extractive industries to publish their payments to foreign governments \u2013 not just country by country, but also project by project \u2013 without exception. The directives would be in line with <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/news/sec-to-vote-on-conflict-minerals-resource-payments-rules\" title=\"\">US rules under the Frank-Dodd act</a>, although <a href=\"http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-10c/general-interest/api-others-sue-over-dodd-frank-payment.html\" title=\"\">are under legal challenge</a>. France wants to broaden these transparency rules to forestry and fishing eventually.</p> <h2><strong>How much do African economies depend on natural resources?</strong></h2> <p>Oil, gas and mining are important sectors and account for a major source of income. Economic rents from minerals in sub-Saharan Africa came to $169bn (\u00a3105bn) in 2010. In Nigeria and Angola, two of Africa's biggest oil producers, the combined size of the rents was more than $100bn. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/25/africa-diversify-resource-curse-thinktank\" title=\"\">Government revenues from natural resources</a> \u2013 a combination of tax and royalties \u2013 accounted, on average, for 45% of total general revenues in resource-rich countries.</p> <p>The economist <a href=\"http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econpco/research/africa.htm\" title=\"\">Paul Collier</a> says African resource reserves may be underestimated, as less exploration has taken place in Africa than in other regions. African countries' share of global reserves and production of non-fuel minerals is considerable as well. Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a combined share of 6.7% of total world copper production, while Ghana and Mali account for 5.8% of total world gold production.</p>",

  "<p>The BBC Trust chairman has defended George Entwistle's performance before parliament, saying he was unfortunate to be engulfed by a \"tsunami of filth\" \u2013 his description of the Jimmy Savile scandal \u2013 less than two weeks into his new role.</p> <p>In a Radio 4 interview, Lord Patten also admitted that the Savile sex abuse scandal had done \"terrible damage\" to the corporation's reputation.</p> <p>Patten's defence of the beleaguered BBC director general on Thursday came as Entwistle asked Radio 5 Live controller Adrian Van Klaveren to lead the corporation's editorial coverage of the Savile child abuse scandal, taking over responsibility from BBC News director Helen Boaden and her deputy, Steve Mitchell.</p> <p>The BBC's appointment of an executive with no involvement in the dispute over why a Newsnight story on Savile was dropped in December 2011 to oversee its reporting of the scandal comes against a background of intense scrutiny and criticism of the corporation's handling of the affair.</p> <p>Internal BBC discord over the scandal, described as a \"civil war\" by some papers on Thursday, has been highlighted by what <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/story/2012-10-21/panorama-jimmy-savile-investigation/\" title=\"\">ITV News reported was a \"verbal confrontation\"</a> between Meirion Jones, a journalist who worked on the spiked Newsnight story, and its head of editorial policy, David Jordan, in front of colleagues late on Wednesday.</p> <p>Speaking on The World At One, Lord Patten said: \"It was a very, very difficult initial baptism of fire for a new director general of the BBC. This broke over him, this great tsunami of filth, broke over him 11 days into the job\".</p> <p>The peer resorted to unlikely political comparisons, saying that the great Victorian prime ministers would have found it difficult to endure the grilling from the culture, media and sports select committee on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"If there had been a combination of Benjamin Disraeli and Mr Gladstone they would have had a pretty tough job. I'm not criticising the select committee. I think John Whittingdale did an exemplary job in managing that as he did in the Murdoch inquiries,\" said Patten.</p> <p>However, he conceded that he thought the Savile scandal was very damaging to the BBC \u2013 and voiced concerns for the victims of the late presenter of Jim'll Fix It.</p> <p>Patten said: \"Our main concern has to be for the victims of the abuse and worse, men as well as women, but mostly women, who have been marooned for years trying to tell their stories and not being believed, including it seems, by the BBC and secondly we have to consider the terrible damage to the reputation to the BBC which has hitherto been a national institution that has been trusted.\"</p> <p>The peer and former Tory party chairman said it was he who insisted that a controversial blog by the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, had to be corrected after he was informed of inaccuracies in relation to the programme's original investigation into Savile. Patten said that he demanded changes to the blog on Sunday.</p> <p>The BBC's correction altered Rippon's initial explanation about the decision to shelve the Newsnight Savile film and followed objections about the editor's version of events by the reporter behind the investigation, Liz MacKean, and Jones.</p> <p>Patten had previously supported Rippon's explanation for dropping the programme's Savile investigation \u2013 and explained his decision to do so: \"Should I have disbelieved what a senior editor said? I have at a certain point to believe. I can't disbelieve everything that is said \u2026 my concern is to get to the bottom of what's happened.\"</p> <p>He also rejected claims that he had acted inappropriately earlier this week when he told Maria Miller, the culture secretary, to stop interfering in the BBC Trust's management of the crisis, reminding her that the corporation was not a government body.</p> <p>\"I think it's important in view of what some people have said. It's quite important to remember the BBC is independent. It is answerable to licence fee payers, it is not an agent of the government. We are a national broadcaster, we are owned by the license payers,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this week Miller told Patten that he needed to be aware of the deep public concern over the Savile scandal and the impact it was having on public confidence in the BBC.</p> <p>Labour leader Ed Miliband on Thursday said the BBC had not handled the Savile scandal well and Entwistle needed to \"get on top of what's happening\". \"I think his job is to show that he realises the gravity of what's happened,\" he added.</p> <p>Miliband also called for the government to set up an independent inquiry into the Savile scandal. \"What I would like to see happen is an independent inquiry, commissioned by government, covering not just the BBC but all of the institutions that frankly allowed Jimmy Savile to get away with the terrible things that he appears to have done,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think the BBC hasn't handled this situation as well as it could have done ... It would be easier to restore confidence if the inquiry was commissioned outside and looked at all the institutions concerned.\"</p> <p>Van Klaveren revealed that Entwistle had asked him to take over as \"editorial lead\" of the BBC's Savile scandal coverage in an internal email, seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>He described his role as \"supporting Helen Boaden, Steve Mitchell and the whole [BBC News management] team through what is likely to be an exceptionally demanding period\".</p> <p>Boaden, Mitchell and Entwistle face questions about how much they knew about the spiked Newsnight Savile story in late 2011, with claims it was ditched following pressure from senior executives. The BBC has repeatedly denied this, saying Rippon alone took the decision not the broadcast the report in early December 2011.</p> <p>The former head of Sky News, Nick Pollard, is heading an inquiry into what happened with the Newsnight Savile story, which is expected to be completed within six weeks.</p> <p>Salford-based Van Klaveren said his new job would last until Christmas, with Jonathan Wall taking over as acting Radio 5 Live editor for that period.</p> <p>Wednesday's confrontation between Jordan and Jones took place at Broadcasting House in central London after the former had appeared on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ngmcs\" title=\"\">BBC Radio 4's The Media Show</a>, broadcast at 4.30pm.</p> <p>A BBC spokesman told ITV News there was a brief discussion about a \"single isolated incident\".

Underneath everything that you'll see at first is the same Windows that anyone who has been using Windows 7 since October 2009 is used to seeing.</p> <p>But it's that +1 that you'll see first \u2013 and that's where, for many people, the surprise may start. Microsoft has completely rethought the initial experience \u2013 the process by which we start interacting with a computer when its screen comes on \u2013 and replaced the \"desktop\" with a series of large tiles which you swipe (with a finger, if you're using a tablet or touchscreen laptop, or mouse) from side to side. \"Modern UI\", as it's called, involves big tiles without the fussy \"Close\" or \"Minimise\" or \"Maximise\" buttons.</p> <p>I've been using the final version of Windows 8 for a couple of months on a Samsung touchscreen tablet. Some people may find it disconcerting \u2013 the more ingrained you are in how Windows 7 does things, the harder the adjustment may be. But after a while, the new version feels relaxing; natural, even.</p> <p>The \"Start screen\", as Microsoft calls it, consists only of those big tiles, and completely replaces the desktop you first see on Windows \u2013 although, let's be clear, that old Windows desktop is still there. It's just hidden one layer down, and if you want to jump down into it there's a perfectly good fireman's pole in the form of a tile called \"Desktop\". Click or touch that, and you're in Windows 7.</p> <p>The Start screen houses whatever you want it to on those tiles \u2013 which can be \"live\", so that the weather tile shows the forecast, the Mail tile shows the mounting unread toll, your Calendar tells of the next meeting \u2026 it's a helpful, innovative experience. (Not coincidentally, the Xbox already does, and the smartphone version of Windows, called Windows Phone, does the same; Nokia, HTC and Microsoft all hope that Windows 8 will give that side of the business a big boost too.) You can \"pin\" Windows 7 apps to the Start screen, and you can also download free or paid app from the built-in Windows Store \u2013 which has only about 10,000 apps so far, but it's growing fast.</p> <p>Using \"Modern UI\" apps does take some getting used to. It's a minimalist experience which does away with all the clunky windows and scroll bars of the \"old\" Windows. The entire screen is filled with whatever you're doing, without any of those pesky Close or Minimise buttons. Whether it's Internet Explorer, or the \"social\" app (which ties together your social networks in one place), or the Mail app, the whole thing takes up all of the screen. There is a neat system that lets you view two windows at once \u2013 a second one can be dragged in from the right, and then takes up roughly one-fifth of the screen; you can't do that with an iPad. However, two is all you get; you can't pull in another window and have three apps in view.</p> <p>The control buttons are hidden, and the navigation to get you around the rest of the system \u2013 back to the \"Start screen\" \u2013 is squirrelled away off the right-hand side of the screen. Move the mouse there, or swipe in from the edge, and the \"Charms\" (as they're charmingly called) appear. Those take you back to the Start screen, or to elements such as the Settings panel (though not all of the old Control Panel).</p> <p>But it's around this point that the \"+1\" nature of this all gets slightly uncomfortable. If, for example you want (for some reason) to change the date on your computer, you won't be able to do it in the big Modern UI tiles. You'll have to take the fireman's pole down to Windows 7. And there it's all suddenly \u2026 the same again. It's like Bobby stepping out of the shower in Dallas. Or, to put it another way, it's like you're in HG Wells's Time Machine, and have come away from the happy Eloi above, in their big-tiled world, and discovered the Morlocks labouring away beneath. All those Close, Minimise, Maximise buttons. Title bars on windows. Resizing. All that stuff you've been doing since Windows 3.1 all those years ago. Weirdly, there's a version of Internet Explorer down there too which doesn't have the same windows as the one \"above\" \u2013 so you can have two versions of Internet Explorer going with totally different screens.</p> <p>One other point: the \"below\" version of Windows 8 is like Windows 7 \u2013 except there's no Start button. It's gone. You're intended to find your way around to programs via search (via the Charms, which are still there on the right). Once you've accepted that, you'll find that Windows 8 \u2013 or 7+1 \u2013 runs quicker, more securely, and much more like the operating systems we're used to on tablets and smartphones, which are themselves becoming the principal way people do computing; if you include them in your totals, PCs are barely a majority of the computers now in use worldwide.</p> <p>So for Microsoft, Windows 8 is a huge leap forward \u2013 and yet it's doing it while holding all the baggage of the \"old\" Windows going back decades. Expect some cries of pain in the weeks and months to come as people adjust. However, viewed more broadly, it couldn't do anything else: the desktop paradigm is getting tired, and the tiles approach is fresh and quickly becomes intuitive. In a few years, taking a trip down to the Morlocks' level may feel like a fleeting visit to a long-forgotten friend: so much to talk about, but much more important things to do elsewhere.</p> <p>That Windows 8 is going to be a huge hit is a given; PCs sell in big enough numbers that it's a given. What will be fascinating to watch is how it is received \u2013 and whether it does better for tablets than on PCs (where corporations can \"downgrade\" to Windows 7). With everything to play for, Microsoft's refreshed the way to think about computing.</p>",
  "<p>\"During a little over half a century the town has been transformed and ennobled,\" reflected the legendary mayor of Birmingham, <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Lib-Central-Archives-and-Heritage%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092751966&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper\" title=\"\">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, in 1892. \"Rookeries and squalid courts have given way to fine streets and open places. Baths and washhouses are provided at a nominal cost to the users. Free libraries and museums of art are open to all the inhabitants; free schools and a school of art are provided for their education.\"</p> <p>Victorian Birmingham \u2013 the \"Venice of the Midlands\" \u2013 was the model of municipal socialism: an active local government using public funds to elevate the life of its citizenry. So it is desperately cruel that today's leader of Birmingham city council, Sir Albert Bore, was this week forced to announce \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/23/birmingham-city-council-cuts-warning\" title=\"\">the end of local government as know it</a>\".</p> <p>With \u00a3600m to deliver in cuts to local authority provision \u2013 50% of its controllable budget \u2013 Birmingham's <a href=\"http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/council-house\" title=\"\">Council House</a> faces the real prospect of being decommissioned. In Liverpool, Manchester, and Stoke-on-Trent it is the same: a devastating combination of Westminster cuts and ever-rising demands on core, statutory provision means that the heroic, civilising function of local government looks close to collapsing.</p> <p>At times like this, it is worth remembering why local government emerged in Britain. At the height of the industrial revolution, life expectancy at birth in Liverpool was 26 years \u2013 the lowest since the Black Death. Across Britain's towns and cities, the free enterprise and lax planning of the 1800s was yielding both incredible riches and desperate poverty. These were the two nations of rich and poor, \"between which there is no intercourse and no sympathy\", which so horrified Benjamin Disraeli.</p> <p>Beginning with the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, which introduced the modern town council, it was now local government's ambition to check the avarice of capital and civilise the urban, industrial world. To begin with, this meant reforming sewerage and cesspits, housing conditions and pollutants, the keeping of animals and the proximity of factories.</p> <p>But in the latter half of the 19th century, horizons expanded. \"It now became the ambition of young men, and cultivated men, and men of high social position to represent a ward and to become aldermen and mayors,\" as a Birmingham history put it. And they wanted to do more than fix the gas and water. Inspired by the memory of Florence and Siena, Bruges and Ghent, Birmingham councillors started to talk of the importance of beauty and dignity to their communities. This was the civic gospel at work and in its wake came the great civilising institutions of provincial Britain: the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum and Liverpool's St George's Hall with their programme of concerts, and myriad schools, parks, swimming pools, and housing estates \u2013 even telephone systems, pubs, and farms. And it was all a source of intense pride. \"The modern ratepayer has the satisfaction of knowing that, while he pays for the support of museum and art gallery, the institutions are his property and dedicated to his service,\" as a civic leader said of Glasgow.</p> <p>The interwar years saw the Indian summer of local government, with a remarkable programme of building and beautification across Britain's suburbs. But then came the second world war and a centralised polity which the Attlee nationalisations only entrenched. Each successive decade saw Whitehall emboldened and local government progressively weakened as local tax and spend powers fell to ministerial dictat.</p> <p>But the current crisis is of a different order. The brutality of the cuts inflicted on local government is only being compounded by the escalating costs of statutory provision. An ageing population, family breakdown, and falling housing supply mean that the costs of social care, safeguarding young people, emergency shelter and all other legal demands on council budgets are denuding any capacity for funding broader services.</p> <p>As Bore suggests, what is at risk are the beneficial, local, enlightening activities that councils have traditionally run \u2013 from museums to parks to swimming pools and community halls. These are the facilities that provide low-income families with access to culture, music and exercise. Yes, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Council and sporting bodies can fund some of the gap. But across Britain, a quiet misery is taking place as community asset transfers lead to the irreversible loss of civic institutions and the draining of social capital.</p> <p>The noble and transformative forces that Joseph Chamberlain regarded as civilising urban life \u2013 the raison d'etre of local government since the 1830s \u2013 are being lost. And we are in danger of returning to two nations.</p>",

  "<p>Leading care home chains and providers of care for people in their own homes are to face new controls following the collapse of Southern Cross, the biggest company in the sector.</p> <p>Ministers plan to introduce an extra system of regulation for larger care providers to improve early warnings if businesses are running into trouble and to ensure contingency plans are in place if they cease to trade.</p> <p>The \"central oversight regime\" will require companies to file regular reports on their financial health and borrowings. If the figures exceed set limits, a business will be declared to be in \"distress\" and a contingency plan enacted.</p> <p>Most care sector leaders welcomed the plans. But care companies were more guarded and are likely to oppose the Care Quality Commission being given the regulatory role. The CQC is one of two options on the table.</p> <p>Southern Cross collapsed last year after it ran out of money to pay the landlords who owned most of its 752 homes. The Department of Health, local councils and social care leaders had to mount an emergency operation to ensure none of the homes' 30,000 residents were left without accommodation.</p> <p>Almost all the company's homes were taken over by other providers, but ministers fear that might not happen again in the event of another crisis. </p> <p>First details of the new regulatory regime emerged at the annual National Children and Adult Services conference in Eastbourne. Health department officials said the Southern Cross affair had exposed a gap in checks on private companies and charities, which account in England for 91% of residential care and 84% of care at home.</p> <p>William Vineall, the department's deputy director for social care policy and legislation, said: \"As government, there was not a mechanism in place that we could call on to handle this process.\"</p> <p>Plans for the regime will be issued for consultation before the end of the year. Final proposals are expected to be agreed by next spring and will be included in the care and support bill.</p> <p>The regime will be designed to be \"light touch\", avoiding unnecessary red tape, and will be limited to larger providers \u2013 although some smaller companies that are dominant in certain regions or deliver specialist care are likely to be included.</p> <p>Rachel Armstrong, the department's policy manager for social care markets, said: \"There are greater risks in ensuring continuity of care for individuals receiving services from the largest providers simply because it is far more difficult to do so.\"</p> <p>The officials ruled out creating a new regulatory body to run the system and said it would come under either the CQC, which checks on care quality, or Monitor, the NHS trust regulator, which will have a greatly expanded role under the government's NHS shakeup.</p> <p>The CQC has been unpopular with many care providers, who have to pay to register with it and to undergo quality inspections. It has been involved in a number of controversies over its effectiveness.</p> <p>Michael Rumsby, policy officer of the English Community Care Association, which represents the leading private care companies, said: \"We appreciate the concern that the department has about very large providers, but it remains to be seen whether a regulator could competently achieve what they want.\"</p> <p>Peter Hay, director of adult social care in Birmingham, said the plans were a great step forward on a vital issue. \"I think the movement is huge and very welcome,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A striking portrait by Sir John Everett Millais of Katey, the favourite child of Charles Dickens, in mourning for her first husband but on the point of a second very happy marriage, is coming up for auction in the bicentenary year of her father's birth.</p> <p>The painting has been included in many exhibitions about both Dickens and Millais, one of the stars of the pre-Raphaelite movement, including the major retrospective at the Tate in 2008. It will be sold at Sotheby's in London next month, estimated at up to \u00a3200,000, from the estate of the US collector Katherine Mellon.</p> <p>Millais had already used Katey as the model for a famous painting, The Black Brunswicker, showing her as a distraught girl pleading with her soldier lover not to go to war. According to her biographer, Dickens's great-great-great-granddaughter Lucinda Hawksley, Katey \u2013 by then an artist herself \u2013 chose the pose for the portrait, walking into the artist's studio then looking slightly back towards him, confident and subtly sexy in her demure black dress.</p> <p>Katey first married aged just 20 to escape the unhappy household after Dickens brutally separated himself and their children from his wife Catherine, moving away to live with his sister-in-law Georgina as housekeeper. She married the much older Charles Collins, brother of the novelist and family friend Wilkie Collins. Another of the family recalled discovering her father weeping into his daughter's wedding dress on the night of the marriage, muttering: \"But for me, Katey would not have left home.\"</p> <p>Dickens died in 1870, and Collins three years later of cancer. The marriage was apparently amicable but sexless and Hawksley believes that during it Katey had an affair with her fellow artist Val Prinsep. Within months of being widowed, she had a secret registry office marriage to another artist, the Italian-born Charles Perugini, and the following year a more formal church wedding at which Millais was a guest. Their only child died as a baby, but the marriage was a very happy one, with a circle of artistic friends including JM Barrie and George Bernard Shaw.</p> <p>She outlived Perugini too, and late in life gave a wealth of biographical information about her father to Gladys Storey. After her death in 1929, Storey's book Dickens and Daughter first revealed his affair with the actress Ellen Ternan \u2013 the real cause of the breakup of her parents' marriage.</p>",
  "<p>I was probably 12 years old the first time I saw an Amitabh Bachchan film. It was the early 80s and video players were relatively rare. My family did not own one so my father would, like many Asians at the time, hire a machine, which he would pick up on a Friday evening and return on Sunday. The cost of the video hire was, I recall, \u00a35, and my dad and I would also select three or four films to watch on the Friday and Saturday evening. Invariably, these films would star Amitabh Bachchan. </p> <p>Bollywood movies \u2013 especially those released in the 70s and 80s \u2013 are today often viewed as gaudy kitsch, but the pleasure I derived from titles such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085361/\" title=\"\">Coolie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082797/\" title=\"\">Naseeb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/79618/sholay\" title=\"\">Sholay</a> was entirely unironic. In part this was because Bachchan, known as the Big B, offered such a startlingly different version of what it meant to be Asian compared with what was on our TV screens. Asians hardly featured on British television, and when they did it was mostly as the butt of jokes on shows such as Mind Your Language and It Ain't Half Hot Mum \u2013 both of which my family enjoyed, as it happens \u2013 but Bachchan was submissive to no one, and he always got the girl.</p> <p>My father and I did not have much in common. He was a traditional first-generation working-class Pakistani authoritarian father, and I was wrestling with what it meant to be a second-generation British Asian kid. But the moment an Amitabh Bachchan film started, there would be an immediate ceasefire in our generation clash: he was the one thing we could all agree on. Bachchan was the anti-establishment rebel who was respectful to his faith and his family; he was a lover and a fighter; he was all things to all people. I remember doodling his name in the margins of my exercise book and in the back of my teenage diary. I would walk around the school playground singing songs from films such as <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083349/\" title=\"\">Yaarana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079963/\" title=\"\">Suhaag</a>. Bachchan was nothing less than a god to me, and in that I was hardly alone.</p> <p>Amitabh Bachchan's films from that era were undoubtedly escapist, but they were also reflective of the time. His rise coincided with the imposition of India's state of emergency, introduced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi\" title=\"\">Indira Gandhi</a>. Screenwriters such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim-Javed\" title=\"\">Salim-Javed</a> began to write scripts that reflected the frustrations of its people. Bachchan, the son of a poet, became a working-class hero: the ordinary man who was willing to stand up and fight against the injustices of the establishment. Those films are seared into the consciousness of all of us who saw them and it is their greatness that explains the adoration he still commands. When he suffered a near-fatal accident while filming Coolie in 1982, it provoked an outpouring of national grief: Indira Gandhi visited his hospital bedside, fans went on hunger strike and someone even walked backwards for 300 miles as penance.</p> <p>Bachchan survived the accident but his film career stalled in the late 80s, marred by a disastrous entry into politics and some ill-advised business ventures. I stopped watching his films: I had discovered other gods, and did not want to see a man in his 50s trying to play the part of an action hero. It may have seemed that he was on his way out, but a rebirth arrived: he was asked to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxIN1Fa5Kpk\" title=\"\">present the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a>. The hysteria that ensues when someone discovers Amitabh Bachchan is on the phone to them is considerably greater than anything Chris Tarrant has generated. The show is massive in India and so, again, is Amitabh Bachchan.</p> <p>Today, Bachchan is the head of a film dynasty that includes his son, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Bachchan\" title=\"\">Abhishek</a>, and his daughter-in-law, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishwarya_Rai\" title=\"\">Aishwarya Rai</a>. He is still making films but, for me, it is his 70s and 80s classics that remain unsurpassed. In recent years, I have taken to watching those films again and, much to my delight, they have stood the test of time: they really are as good as I remember them. But there is a difference. When I watched them as a child, they yielded unalloyed pleasure; today, it is a bittersweet sensation. I recall how I watched the same films with my whole family. My father is long dead and my family has fractured \u2013 partly as a result of the choice I made in whom I married. I never see my older sister and I hardly talk to my older brother. The picture I have from my childhood of a family happy and united is gone forever, my life has changed for good and the only thing that has remained constant are those films.</p> <p>I was recently lucky enough to interview the man himself over the phone. Afterwards, I went over to my wife, who is not Asian, and told her about the conversation. I tried to explain why I had been so excited. I told her about watching those old films and how I had never been happier than during those days when my dad was around. As I was speaking I realised that, suddenly and without warning, I was crying.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nk147\" title=\"\">The Big B at 70</a>, presented by Sarfraz Manzoor, is on BBC Radio 4 on 27 October at 10.30am.</p>",

I don't know what you do about that. It's easier to deny.\"</p> <p>Asked what was needed to wake people up, the veteran broadcaster famous for series such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Collection\" title=\"\">Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy\" title=\"\">Planet Earth</a> said: \"Disaster. It's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? Even disaster doesn't do it. There have been disasters in North America, with hurricanes and floods, yet still people deny and say 'oh, it has nothing to do with climate change.' It visibly has got [something] to do with climate change.\"</p> <p>But some US politicians found it easier to deny the science on climate change than take action, he said, because the consequence of recognising the science on man-made climate change \"means a huge section from the national budget will be spent in order to deal with it, plenty of politicians will be happy to say 'don't worry about that, we're not going to increase your taxes.'\"</p> <p>Neither Barack Obama or Mitt Romney mentioned climate change in three TV debates, despite a summer of record temperatures and historic drought in the US.</p> <p>Romney used Obama's commitment to taking action on climate change <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">as a joke in his convention speech</a>. The president later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">hit back by saying</a> \"and yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke.\" However, environmentalists have been critical of Obama's silence on the subject and the Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">went as far as saying</a> it meant he was, in effect, \"another climate denier\".</p> <p>Attenborough said he thought the US's attitude towards climate change and the environment was not just because of politics, but because of the country's history. \"[It's] because they're a pioneer country. There has been the wild west, the western frontier\u2026 that's still there, you see it in the arms business, the right for everyone to bear arms. It's part of the pioneer stuff that you've [Americans] grown up with.\"</p> <p>By contrast, he said, people in the UK had \"grown up with a mythology of black industry and wrecking the countryside.\"</p> <p>The current financial crisis has made it problematic for politicians to show leadership on climate change, Attenborough acknowledged. \"Well it's a very difficult time to do it [show leadership]. In times of recession, it's a very difficult time to advance these arguments [on the urgency of tackling climate change] that mean you have to spend even more money and take money from taxes to do things,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet he also warned that it was becoming clear the impacts of climate change were worst than had been expected. Talking about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">record Arctic sea ice melt this summer</a>, he said: \"The situation is worse than we thought [in the Arctic]. The processes of melting are more volatile than we thought. More complicated. The ice cap is really melting faster than we thought.\"</p> <p>The 86-year-old naturalist, who is also a patron of the charity <a href=\"http://www.populationmatters.org/\" title=\"\">Population Matters</a>, said many of the environmental problems the world faced could be helped by addressing human population, which is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/seven-billionth-baby-born-philippines\" title=\"\">believed to have reached the 7 billion mark last year</a>, and is forecast to reach 10 billion by the middle of the century.</p> <p>The solution, he said, was to raise living standards and increase democracy in developing countries. \"The only way I can think of it [tackling population] is by giving women the rights to control their own bodies and control how many children they have. In every circumstance where women have that right, where they have the vote, where they are proper medical facilities, where they are literate, where they are given the choice, the birth rate falls,\" he said. \"That is a good start, if that could be spread.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You can read more of Sir David Attenborough's views on climate change and animals in this Sunday's Observer magazine</p>",
  "<p>Almost 30,000 schools are being urged to relax their school uniform rules and not force parents to buy clothing from specific shops.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Office of Fair Trading</a> (OFT) has written to 29,500 state primary and secondary schools in the UK asking them to review their uniform policies, claiming families are spending \"tens of millions of pounds\" more than they need to on clothing.</p> <p>The request follows an OFT survey which found that 74% of state schools require households to purchase uniforms from approved retailers or suppliers, forcing parents to fork out \u00a35-\u00a310 more than they would for each equivalent item elsewhere.</p> <p>In one example, the OFT found the average price for a sweatshirt for secondary school boys with a single retailer arrangement was \u00a312, compared to \u00a35 for a similar item at a supermarket. For a secondary school girls skirt the equivalent figures were \u00a315.40 and \u00a35.</p> <p>For every \u00a31 difference in price per item, the total detriment to parents of primary and secondary school age children is \u00a310.4m a year, rising to \u00a352m at a typical price difference of \u00a35 an item.</p> <p>There is no legislation that deals specifically with school uniform or other aspects of school pupils' appearance, such as hair colour and style or the wearing of jewellery and make-up \u2013 this is for the governing body of each school to decide.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/schoolethos/b0014144/schooluniform\" title=\"Department for Education guidelines\">Department for Education guidelines</a> suggest a school's governing body \"should be able to demonstrate to parents how best value has been achieved and keep the cost of supplying the uniform under review\".</p> <p>The OFT argues schools can still have smart uniform policies without appointing a single supplier. Susan Oxley, assistant director in the OFT's goods and consumer group, said: \"When schools require that uniforms are bought from a preferred supplier or shop it can act as a 'tax' on families, which mostly goes to the chosen retailers.</p> <p>\"However, when families are able to shop around for school uniform items it can drive competition and bring down prices for all. We know schools don't want families to be left out of pocket, and we have written to schools across the UK asking them to review their policies and supplier arrangements.\"</p> <p>Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, welcomed the move, claiming the current situation prevented some children from attending their preferred school. \"Where schools use only one supplier, the cost is very often prohibitive to families on low or even average incomes,\" she said. \"This is a barrier to being able to apply for schools where the uniform is expensive and is in effect another form of selection.\"</p> <p>She added: \"If we are to try and address issues of poverty and the barrier it provides to education, then the cost of school uniforms alongside the cost of shoes, trips and school meals must be kept down.\"</p> <p>Citizens Advice is currently running the <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/addingupcampaign\" title=\"Citizens Advice: Adding up campaign\">Adding-Up campaign</a> to help families struggling to meet the costs of schooling. It recommends schools make sure uniform is available from a range of outlets and that they offer sew-on or iron-on badges that can be put on plain clothing. Struggling parents can also ask their local authority if it provides a school clothing grant.</p> <p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, welcomed the OFT's move: \"The excessive costs of some school uniforms are putting serious pressure on parents' purse strings. Citizens Advice wants schools across the country to help families by adopting sensible, low-cost policies on uniform which comply with government guidance on affordability.</p> <p>\"As many families have to turn to local charities for help (or risk their children facing discipline for not having the correct uniform), we'd like to see more local authorities provide school uniform grants for those in financial need.\"</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever seen a bear try to make sense of a teapot? It's a terrible business. Unable to wrap its paws around the handle or grasp the pot's purpose in its tiny mind, the bear gets bewildered, then it turns irate, and finally it gets furious and flies into a terrible rage. Which is why, when you have a bear over to tea, you should always offer to play mother and do the pouring yourself.</p> <p>So, if you learn nothing else from this article, at least you have one new little nugget of knowledge to take away with you. And if you think it's unlikely you'll ever find yourself across the table from a bear brandishing a teapot, let me introduce you to the closest thing \u2013 a cricket administrator making a hamfisted attempt to engage with social media.</p> <p>This time last week I, like many people, had never heard of Kenwyn Williams, the executive secretary of the United States of America Cricket Association. Seven days on, things have changed. I, like many people, have now heard of Williams. And the man himself is no longer the executive secretary of the USACA because <a href=\"http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/btw/archives/2012/10/usaca_suspends.php\" title=\"USACA suspends Willliams  Cricinfo\">he has been suspended from his post</a>.</p> <p>Williams' is one of the great self-inflicted wounds, almost \u2013 if not quite \u2013 up there with the memorable occasion when British General William Elphinstone dropped one of his own pistols and accidentally shot himself in the buttock.</p> <p>Learned bunch as the world cricket forum readers are, you'll all no doubt know that Elphinstone was described by one of his peers as \"the most incompetent soldier who ever became a general\". History does not yet know quite how highly Williams' contemporaries rate his own handiwork \u2013 the USACA board is due to hold a hearing examining his behaviour on 10 November \u2013 but we can only note that in the cases of both British generals and cricket administrators, the competition for the title awarded to Elphinstone is especially fierce.</p> <p>This fiasco \u2013 the latest in a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/282227.html\" title=\"Cricinfo story\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/511883.html\" title=\"Further Cricinfo reading\">long</a> line in the USACA's recent history \u2013 began on 13 October, when Williams took objection to an <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/586519.html\" title=\"Cricinfo article by Penna\">article written on Cricinfo by Peter Della Penna</a>. I've never met Della Penna and can tell you nothing about any loyalties or alliances he may or may not have among the game's officials in the US. But I do know that I like his work, and that he has worked, tirelessly and determinedly, to shed a little light on the decidedly murky world of cricket administration in that country.</p> <p>Williams snapped. A message was posted on the USACA's official Facebook page: \"Peter Della Penna continues his unethical journalistic bias by writing yet another scathing article on USA cricket's internal affairs.\" Ouch. Williams was soon challenged to back up his claim. And he started swinging his punches so wildly that he ended up clobbering himself in the chops. Repeatedly. Firstly, he threatened to sue Della Penna:</p> <p>\"If you were any 'journalist', you would realise that your blogs are overly obsessive and therefore not covered by any protection under the law as none of you are professional journalist [sic]. And yes Peter, you will be sued.\"</p> <p>\"What other sport in the USA,\" Williams complained, \"has three people constantly baddgering [sic] its administrators? There is a clear agenda to defame the organisation.\"</p> <p>Williams then turned on Martin Williamson, who is not only an excellent cricket journalist but also managing editor of ESPN Digital Media in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It's worth bearing in mind at this point that ESPN, an American company, owns Cricinfo, which is the most read cricket website in the world, and has almost a million readers in the USA alone. That bang you just heard? That'd be the sound of a man shooting himself in the buttock.</p> <p>\"In the USA, journalists need to be QUALIFIED and belong to an organisation that endorses their profession,\" Williams raved. \"There are ethical standards that needs [sic] to be met. Bloggers \u2013 like yourself and Peter get around this professional endorsement by only using the internet to spew venom. Ask yourself if your garbage could ever be considered for publication in the magazine. Reason: you and Peter and other bloggers are unqualified as professional journalists.</p> <p>\"America has standards Martin \u2013 you don't just wake up one day and decide that you are a journalists [sic]. Especially if your career before your obsession with USACA was selling knives for a living. Sorry \u2013 send Peter to journalism school to learn the basics. Then send him to the New York Press Club to become a member and then to the NYPD to get a press pass. I need to see credentials and so will a judge.\"</p> <p>Exactly why Williams wanted to send Della Penna to the New York Police Department isn't clear. But he was only just warming up. He became oddly fixated on the previous careers of both Della Penna and Williamson. \"For an organisation not to adress [sic] the inaccuracies and defamatory statements by a bizzarre [sic] ex-knife salesman is bizzarre [sic]. Welcome to the age of social media. EVERY organisation does it,\" he shot at Della Penna, before pausing to reload and take aim at Williamson: \"MW on your resume \u2026 I actually doubt that you worked for Barclays after HS there is no record of it. My basic point \u2026 any bloke can tout himself to be a journalist. As you well know you are hiding behind the internet.\"</p> <p>\"Again,\" Williams added. \"These people are not 'journalist' [sic] by any variation on the definition of the profession. I beg Peter and Martin to prove to me they are qualified as journalists. They are internet bloggers and have NO journalistic privilege. NONE!!! ESPN will have to make a decision on these two if they want to do business with USA cricket.\"</p> <p>On and on it goes. For the sake of space, I'll suggest that you if you'd like to read more you go and have a look <a href=\"http://cricket.about.com/od/domestic/a/The-Usaca-Social-Media-Debacle.htm\" title=\"Social media debacle\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sportskeeda.com/2012/10/18/knives-out-in-usas-facebook-fight-club/\" title=\"Facebook fight club\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rantsports.com/clubhouse/2012/10/16/the-usaca-shows-the-world-how-not-to-use-social-media/\" title=\"How not to use social media\">here</a>. By now, news of Williams meltdown had spread, and he had gone on to swap shots with Iain O'Brien, the former Kiwi fast bowler, who was told by Williams, somewhat cryptically, that \"I am a marketing and brand expert as you can well see. It looks bad but its intended.\"</p> <p>A little like a man who has spent so long shovelling that he hasn't realised how deep a pit he has dug for himself, Williams suddenly stopped, looked up, and realised he needed a way out.</p> <p>He offered a free iPad to whoever left the 1,000th comment on the thread and then explained that \"Everything I do is a calculated risk. I needed to silence Peter's informant and that has been accomplished. I also needed to let the world know that ESPN is sponsoring two of the worst bloggers on the planet. We need bettr [sic] writers if USA Cricket is going to progress. Their obsession with USA Cricket is uncanning [sic] \u2013 especially for Martin who does not even live here or understand our culture.\"</p> <p>The USACA's \"marketing and brand expert\" certainly moves in mysterious ways, as far beyond our ken as the teapot is to the bear. The thread has since disappeared. As have, one imagines, Mr Williams' chances of promotion.</p>",
  "<p>The self-proclaimed Tibetan government in exile has called on Tibetans to stop setting fire to themselves to protest against what activists say is Beijing's heavy-handed rule in the region.</p> <p>\"We understand what is driving them to do it but we appeal to Tibetans not to go for these extreme acts,\" a spokesman told the Guardian.</p> <p>The call comes after a Tibetan farmer set himself ablaze in front of a market in remote north-west China on Tuesday. It was the second such death in 48 hours. Both protests occurred <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/tibetan-self-immolates-chinese-rule\" title=\"\">close to the Labrang monastery in Gansu province</a>, the site of numerous protests after deadly ethnic riots in 2008.</p> <p>The two deaths bring the <a href=\"http://www.savetibet.org/resource-center/maps-data-fact-sheets/self-immolation-fact-sheet%C2%A3LhamoKyab\" title=\"\">total self-immolations to 58 since March 2011</a> with eight in the past month, campaigners say. Many of those setting themselves alight have called for the return of the Tibetans' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as they have died. The Chinese government has confirmed some, but not all, of the self-immolations. \"There is no basic freedom in Tibet. That is why people commit these extreme actions. We are very, very concerned but they are the ones inside Tibet suffering. They are the ones to decide,\" the spokesman for the Tibetan government in exile said.</p> <p>The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet named the most recent man to die as Dorje Rinchen, a farmer in his late 50s, who it said set himself on fire on the main street in Xiahe township and died later. The group quoted a Tibetan from Xiahe who currently lives in exile as saying that Dorje had asked young Tibetans not to follow his example.</p> <p>Despite such appeals, support in Dharamsala in India \u2013 where the Dalai Lama is based \u2013 appears strong for the dramatic protests, however.</p> <p>\"It's a reminder of our situation, and a wake-up call for the rest of us, especially the younger generations,\" said Nyima Dorjee, a 23-year-old Tibetan-born cook. \"Freedom never comes for free. We can't just sit doing nothing. One has to hit a stone against the wall to make a sound.\"</p> <p>In an attempt to stop such protests, police in Gansu have offered rewards of $7,700 for information about planned self-immolations.</p> <p>The local police force said on Sunday that the immolations had \"seriously impacted social stability and harmony as well as people's ability to live and work.\" Informers will receive 50,000 yuan ($7,700) for tipping police off about immolation plans and up to 200,000 yuan for providing information on the \"black hands\" who help organise such protests, the police said.</p> <p>\"Self-immolation is an extreme suicidal behaviour that goes against humanity, society and the law and deprives people of their right to life,\" it said. \"The instances of self-immolation that have occurred recently in our prefecture are part of a political conspiracy by the Dalai clique that means to split China and undermine national unity.\"</p> <p>The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet to India in 1959 amid a failed uprising against Chinese rule and has been based in Dharamsala ever since, has neither condemned nor encouraged the immolations, simply saying that it is \"<a href=\"http://tibet.net/2012/10/23/nbc-interviews-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama-on-self-immolation-tragedy-in-tibet/\" title=\"\">difficult to judge if these methods are right or wrong</a>\".</p> <p>Suicide is forbidden in Buddhism, but could be justified if the motives are pure, such as a genuine desire to help others through self-sacrifice.</p> <p>Posters showing the faces of the dead \u2013 dubbed \"martyrs\" \u2013 now line streets in Dharamsala and there are frequent memorial events, such as candle-lit vigils. A drama staged this week at the main school for Tibetan refugees in the town depicted a self-immolation, locals said.</p> <p>\"I feel sad, like the rest of the Tibetans. I am old and I have seen a lot [of bad things] throughout my life,\" said one resident, Yedrong, 68. \"But now seeing those brave souls I have hope.\" Chinese authorities routinely deny Tibetan claims of repression and have accused supporters of the Dalai Lama of encouraging the self-immolations.</p> <p>China's foreign ministry on Wednesday repeated its claim that supporters of the Dalai Lama have been inciting the deadly protests \"to achieve their separatist goal\".</p> <p>China says Tibet has always been part of its territory. Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries.</p> <p>Most of the recent self-immolations have been in a broad swath of the east of what was historically considered Tibet but which is now inside the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Sichuan.</p> <p>Some experts say this is because issues of cultural identity in these more mixed regions are problematic for young Tibetans living there compared to the Tibetan heartland. Others say it is simply because the authorities have less control, with fewer restrictions on the internet, for example.</p> <p>The tactic is non-violent and thus respects the spirit of the Dalai Lama's \"middle way\" strategy despite increasing frustration inside Tibet with the lack of progress the approach has brought, one Dharamsala-based analyst said.</p>",
  "<p>The outspoken governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, is to launch a political party, raising the possibility that a new rightwing force in Japanese politics will emerge in time for a general election due by next August.</p> <p>Ishihara, an unabashed nationalist, sparked a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/16/japan-embassy-beseiged-chinese-crowd\" title=\"\">diplomatic crisis with China</a> in April when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/tokyo-governor-senkaku-islands-china\" title=\"\">announced plans to buy</a> the Senkaku islands \u2013 which are claimed by both countries \u2013 and bring them under the control of the Tokyo metropolitan government.</p> <p>The move forced Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to offer a rival bid to buy the islands from their private Japanese owners and prevent them from falling into Ishihara's hands.</p> <p>Ishihara had hinted that he would develop the Senkakus, a move certain to infuriate China, which refers to them as the Diaoyu. In an apparent attempt to placate Beijing, Noda has said he will not build on the territory.</p> <p>Ishihara said at a packed news conference on Thursday that he would resign as governor immediately and aimed to fix Japan's political and economic problems.</p> <p>\"I'm returning to national politics by forming a new party with like-minded colleagues,\" he said. \"I will try to do nationally everything I have been striving to do for Tokyo.\" The new party's name has yet to be announced.</p> <p>Ishihara, 80, who entered parliament with the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) in 1968, compared the country's bureaucrats to the shogunate regimes of feudal Japan. \"We must fix the inflexible rule of the central government bureaucrats,\" he said.</p> <p>It is not clear how much influence Ishihara's new party will have on national politics. His rightwing populism has won over Tokyo residents, securing him four straight terms as governor over the past 13 years, but other voters are wary of his provocative nature.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest the main opposition LDP could win the most seats in the lower house under its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/japanese-nationalist-tipped-pm-china\" title=\"\">new leader</a>, Shinzo Abe, but may have to look to smaller parties to form a coalition government. The governing Democratic party of Japan is expected to be punished over Noda's handling of the economy and tax increases due to be phased in over the next three years.</p> <p>Ishihara has not ruled out joining forces with another new party formed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/toru-hashimoto-tipped-future-japan-leader\" title=\"\">rightwing mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto</a>. \"There is momentum in Osaka, too, and I want to join hands [with Hashimoto's party],\" Ishihara said. The Asahi Shimbun quoted a senior member of the minor Sunrise party of Japan as saying the group's five MPs would join Ishihara.</p> <p>Ishihara is unrivaled in his ability to antagonise Japan's neighbours. He has described the Japanese army's slaughter of as many as 300,000 civilians in Nanjing in 1937 as a fabrication, and called on Japan to develop a nuclear deterrent against China and North Korea.</p> <p>Last year he drew widespread criticism after describing the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, in which almost 20,000 people died, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/tokyo-governor-tsunami-punishment\" title=\"\">divine punishment</a> for the \"egotism\" of the Japanese people.</p> <p>During his term as governor, he has made derogatory remarks about women and foreigners, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/15/japan.france\" title=\"\">insulted Francophones</a> by dismissing French as a \"failed international language\". In 2010 he suggested <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/17/mickey-mouse-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">gay people were \"deficient\"</a>, after watching same-sex couples take part in a parade in San Francisco.</p> <p>Yet in Tokyo at least, he has remained remarkably popular. He downed a glass of the capital's drinking water in public at the height of the Fukushima nuclear crisis to reassure residents about its safety, and has won plaudits from environmentalists for restricting diesel emissions.</p> <p>He outlined his nationalist agenda in his 1989 book, The Japan that Can Say No, written with Sony's co-founder Akio Morita, which urged the country to end its dependence on the US for its security. A prizewinning novelist at 23, Ishihara wrote the screenplay for I Go to Die For You, a 2007 film that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/28/worlddispatch.secondworldwar\" title=\"\">glorifies kamikaze pilots</a> who flew on suicide missions towards the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Like many Japanese conservatives, Ishihara wants to abandon the country's postwar constitution, which forbids the use of force as a means of settling disputes, and build a stronger, more active military. \"There are several major contradictions that we hope the state itself will solve,\" he said on Thursday. \"The biggest is the Japanese constitution, which was imposed by the [US] occupying army, and is rendered in ugly Japanese.\"</p> <p>Japan does not have to hold a general election until next August, but Noda is under pressure to go to the polls early, having promised opposition parties he would do so in return for their support for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/26/japanese-tax-rise\" title=\"\">rise in the consumption tax</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012. We mistakenly called Shinzo Abe Shintaro Abe. This has been corrected. It was further amended on 9 November 2012 to correct the spelling of the mayor of Osaka's first name. The original said Turo Hashimoto, when it should have said Toru Hashimoto.</p>",
  "<p>Growth of 1% in one quarter, the strongest in any quarter since 2007, is a cause for gentle celebration inside the Treasury, a moment to open the Lambrusco rather than the Veuve Clicquot. It is fair to say that Britain is out of recession and to claim the economy is healing, so long as George Osborne does not give a date for the patient to be given a full discharge from hospital.</p> <p>But the chancellor was careful to point to the constellation of more positive economic news: the lower than expected borrowing, the halving of inflation, the gentle signs that the eurozone emerges from its two years of chaos, and above all the UK labour market's unexpectedly strong performance. His hope is that confidence, the oil that lubricates the wheels of the economy, will start to return, boosting demand and creating a virtuous cycle.</p> <p>His spokesman sensibly declined media offers to say we were through the worst, simply arguing the government's policies were working, pointing to the net growth of 1 million in private sector jobs.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the numbers provide a much better backdrop for Osborne to deliver his autumn statement in December.</p> <p>For Ed Balls the task is to look cheerful that the economy is improving, even though his whole political strategy is built around the economy flatlining through to 2014.</p> <p>The shadow Treasury team have to catch the public mood. It is fatal to look like the misanthropes hoping for the worst.</p> <p>But does it mark the end of the whole \"too far, too fast\" mantra?</p> <p>The growth was at the higher end of expectations, but still left the economy broadly in the same position as a year ago. There is also every sign that the fourth quarter figures will fall back partly due to the extent which third quarter figures have been inflated by Olympics sales and the slow growth in the second quarter due to bank holidays and wet weather. It is better for Labour at this stage to let others point to the remaining underlying problems and wait for the zig-zagging economy to zig back through 2013.</p> <p>The manufacturing employers' association EEF, for instance, warned: \"With survey data particularly in our major markets pointing to difficult trading conditions in recent months it's unlikely this pace of expansion will be maintained into the new year. As such, the pressure is still on for the government to set out a clear vision of its economic priorities in the forthcoming autumn statement.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the CBI warned that this was a London-led boom, and the majority of the growth was due to the Olympics and jubilee.</p> <p>Labour has long expected modest annual growth of around 2% in 2014, but believes that the electorate will still be suffering from a squeeze in living standards, and will feel no cause to thank the government for its experiment.</p> <p>But there may have to be a pivot in the Labour messaging. The point is well put by Marcus Roberts from the Fabian Society: \"What difference does the return of growth mean to a family struggling from rising prices and frozen wages?</p> <p>\"By pivoting to an economic message that emphasises these things, Labour can leave the Tories in the position of spouting economic stats that have little relation to people's real lives. Instead, Labour can tell stories about the pressure families face and the difference a Labour government can make with actions like utility company regulation to bring prices down, the living wage, vocational training and even radical ideas like rent caps to control spiralling housing costs.\"</p>",

This is another sign that the economy is healing and we have the right approach,\" the chancellor said.</p> <p>However, the ONS pointed out that GDP growth \u2013 the strongest rate since the third quarter of 2007 \u2013 had been artificially boosted by two short-term factors: the Olympic Games, which fell in July and August, and the bounce-back from June's extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee.</p> <p>All of the income from Olympics tickets was counted towards economic output in the third quarter, whenever it was spent, and the ONS believes ticket sales alone may have added 0.2% to GDP. It said it was \"not possible to quantify\" other effects, such as increased employment and a boost to creative industries.</p> <p>In the second quarter of the year, when growth declined by 0.4%, the ONS said output had been depressed by the extra bank holiday cutting the number of working days, and could be up to 0.5% higher in the third quarter as a result.</p> <p>Amid a storm of criticism of the government's deficit-cutting strategy, including a major anti-cuts march last weekend, Osborne used the figures to insist that his approach was helping to build a stronger economy.</p> <p>\"By continuing to take the tough decisions needed to deal with our debts and equip our economy for the global race we're in, this government is laying the foundations for lasting prosperity,\" he said.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the return to growth, but said: \"This is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.</p> <p>\"Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago \u2013 12 months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year.</p> <p>\"And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best.\"</p> <p>The ONS gave little breakdown of which parts of the economy had expanded most strongly, since Thursday's release is an early estimate, but it believes construction suffered a 2.5% decline in the quarter, while distribution, hotels and restaurants expanded by 1.6%, transport by 0.8%, and business services and finance \u2013 which includes the crisis-hit banking sector \u2013 by 1%.</p> <p>City economists said the 1% expansion was larger than they had expected, but warned that it was unlikely to be repeated in the months ahead.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, of the data provider Markit, said: \"The government will most likely make the most out of this good news, but unfortunately it is unlikely that the UK will see such a strong performance again for some time. In reality, the danger is that this figure fuels a misguided belief that the economy is on the mend, when in fact there is plenty of evidence to suggest that momentum is being lost again.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There is a real risk that a return to contraction might be seen again in the fourth quarter.\" Treasury officials conceded that the strong 1% growth rate was unlikely to be repeated in future quarters.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"While the third-quarter GDP growth of 1.0% is encouraging and welcome news, the UK is by no means out of the economic woods and further relapses remain a very real possibility. Fiscal austerity, tight credit conditions, muted global economic activity and still serious problems in the eurozone are all likely to hamper growth.\"</p>",

Although the continent has 30% of the world's extractive resources, and produces more than 60 different types of metals, ores and minerals, even countries with relatively strong governance records are failing to distribute this wealth, or invest it adequately in development.</p> <p>A paper published this week by the <a href=\"http://www.ecdpm.org/\" title=\"\">European Centre for Development Policy Management</a> argues that an overreliance on the extractive industries, rent-seeking behaviour (ie obtaining special favours) and corruption among politicians, and a lack of transparency has sustained the \"resource curse\".</p> <p>\"Substantial rents available to resource-rich countries caused a disproportionate reliance on petro-dollars,\" according to Isabelle Ramdoo, author of <a href=\"http://www.ecdpm.org/Web_ECDPM/Web/Content/Download.nsf/0/6A371689F627EFF1C1257AA00049445D/$FILE/DP136_Final%20Layout.pdf\" title=\"\">From Curse to Purse</a> (pdf). \"Countries remain heavily dependent on a few economic sectors and on exports of primary products, making them highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as commodity prices, exchange rate fluctuations and external demand. Furthermore \u2026 infrastructure deficits remain a major hurdle to competitiveness and to private-sector development.\"</p> <p>The paper highlights that Nigeria and Angola rely almost entirely on oil and gas for foreign exports and have failed to develop other sectors. Although Nigeria has only 2.9% of the world's oil and gas reserves, it accounts for more than 90% of its export revenue. Angola has 2.6% of the world's oil and gas, but they account for 99% of its export revenue.</p> <p>\"This is not a question of perception. It is a fact that extractive resources drive away the rest of any significant business you could be doing,\" said Ramdoo. \"It really crowds out other sectors.\"</p> <p>Ramdoo said ensuring an appropriate tax system and preventing capital flight \u2013 estimated to have cost Africa $854bn (\u00a3533bn) since 1970 \u2013 could harness resource revenues for development. Savings funds, investments that diversify the economy, and greater transparency by governments \u2013 including the publication of data on revenues and expenditure \u2013 are also recommended.</p> <p>\"The time has come for Africa to profit from the 156% increase in mining companies' profits,\" Carlos Lopes, UN undersecretary general and executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), told the <a href=\"http://new.uneca.org/adfviii/adf_news.aspx\" title=\"\">eighth African Development Forum</a> in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, this week.</p> <p>\"Africa ought to be using the sector and its resource rents to drive socio-economic development. This means investment in infrastructure, research and human capital development, through conditionality for local content. This is what other regions have done; this is what Africa needs to do,\" Lopes told the forum, the focus of which is governing and harnessing natural resources for Africa's development.</p> <p>However, this will not be easy. Attempts to bring more transparency to payments for oil and gas are being challenged. This month, the <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/library/global-witness-condemns-api-lawsuit-strike-down-dodd-frank-oil-gas-and-mining-transparency\" title=\"\">American Petroleum Institute</a> <a href=\"http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-10c/general-interest/api-others-sue-over-dodd-frank-payment.html\" title=\"\">filed a lawsuit</a> attempting to overturn <a href=\"http://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/cardin-lugar-respond-to-big-oil-challenge-to-transparency-regulations\" title=\"\">US legislation</a> on anti-secrecy and transparency in mineral payments.</p> <p>Campaigners in west African countries have linked the lack of transparency in oil and gas revenues to the failure of government to use newfound mineral wealth for the good of its people. \"Transparency is the principle that will allow us to truly benefit from our resources,\" said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/25/niger-resources-nigerien-people-video\" title=\"\">Ali Idrissa, a campaigner for transparency in Niger</a> (video). \"People used the money from uranium to build themselves houses and make themselves rich.\" Niger exports oil and uranium but remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with 62% of the <a href=\"http://ddp-ext.worldbank.org/ext/ddpreports/ViewSharedReport?REPORT_ID=9147&amp;REQUEST_TYPE=VIEWADVANCED&amp;DIMENSIONS=159\" title=\"\">population living in poverty</a>.</p>",
  "<p>We are going through a time of great change, a wholesale rethink of how we want to live and how to shift the tectonic plates of our economy so sustainability is at its heart. All our discovery vocations \u2013 engineering, architecture, physics and astronomy, technology, design and social sciences \u2013 are being mashed together, re-purposed, pulled into creative focus. This is part of a deep recalibration of meaning and values, shifts in thinking in our wider sphere that the arts and culture reflect \u2013 and sometimes lead.</p> <p>External forces are asking us to articulate what we value: financing the arts, how to pay for content, intellectual property and freedoms, philanthropy and profit, entitlement, and artistic legitimacy form rich seams of thought. I'm pretty sure that in time this will be recognised as nothing short of a renaissance. And no wonder.</p> <p>Because this is inspired by the greatest challenge we will ever have to rise to \u2013 how to understand, accept and live at peace within the parameters of the natural world. Our planet's generative capabilities remain eons ahead of human imagination. The interdependent and endlessly reactive forces that we see in nature, the resilience and invention, represent creative recycling on the grandest scale, an inexhaustible source of inspiration, which we are far from understanding fully yet all benefit from marvellously.</p> <h2>Caught in a paradigm</h2> <p>Our anthropogenic age of fossil fuels is only 150 years old, a brief whisper in the context of the 3.8bn years for which life has existed, but boy, is it making a noise. Every year that <a href=\"http://www.juliesbicycle.com/\" title=\"\">Julie's Bicycle</a> operates the picture seems to get bleaker \u2013 emissions and population increase, ecosystems degrade, and for many life gets much tougher. But we also have real solutions tabled on a daily basis. Never before have we seen such widespread creativity and ingenuity.</p> <p>Resolving our environmental issues will be supremely difficult. Gathering the will to accelerate change is going to take the sort of leadership and cultural focus rarely seen outside the context of war.</p> <p>Fortunately there is an abundance of good ideas, productive economic alternatives, money, technology, entrepreneurial and cooperative endeavour to pull us out of this fix. The renewable energy industries, local, organic and conservation movements, plant sciences, true cost accounting and the circular economy are some examples \u2013 the green market represented some $1.4 trillion in 2011.</p> <p>And political shifts, while agonisingly slow, are happening. Already 118 countries are working to carbon targets and we have fledgling international cooperation across Europe and many developing economies. Despite progress, however, we need to be swifter. The costs of scaling up low carbon technologies are considerable, high standards of living fiercely protected, sensible debate often stifled and the sheer scale of the task has resulted in widespread confusion and inertia. Even the most committed are often fatigued by climate change. I have three central points:</p> <p>\u2022 There has never before been such an exciting time to be involved in sustainability within the creative industries \u2013 now is the time to act.</p> <p>\u2022 It is the responsibility of the cultural industries to make sure there is the process and will to fill the existing leadership vacuum</p> <p>\u2022 Cultural leadership is imperative on this</p> <h2>Leading by doing</h2> <p>Julie's Bicycle was founded five years ago when climate change and environmental action looked very different. We wanted to pick a path that gathered the energy and inventiveness of the creative sectors without the complexity and confusion. The arts can do something very few other industries can \u2013 we squeeze the human heart so that it beats differently \u2013 and for that we are hugely desirable. Our job to is to put sustainability and its principles of resilience and strength, creative regeneration, and respect for the earth at the centre of our artistic vision.</p> <p>In April 2012, <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Arts Council England</a> announced that it was putting sustainability reporting into its funding agreement, a world first and a hugely important signal, both domestically and internationally, that this matters. Julie's Bicycle is now six months into the three-year strategic partnership with the council to make this happen. In another six months we should have a fledgling base line in place with energy and water data from over 1,000 organisations. This is an incredible resource.</p> <p>For the first time we will know what our environmental impacts are, how they compare across sectors, regions, activities, what works and what doesn't. Environmental policies will be sitting equally alongside other governance frameworks and, with some prompting, we expect boards and CEOs to be thinking hard about sustainability and what it means for these austere times \u2013 and for posterity.</p> <p>This rich information, quite unique, gives us the power of self-determination. It allows us to talk back, to hot house good ideas and dispense with time wasters. It supports innovation, and prudence. And it makes a compelling business case for savings and investments into the arts. ACE has steadily extended its commitment to sustainability this year, adding more organsations and advocating confidently on the issue. This has been a year of great anxiety and yet ACE hasn't faltered.</p> <h2>The power of cultural partnerships</h2> <p>This is a wonderful lead from ACE, but what has happened to make it possible? First, the arts are bringing exposure to the science. They allow us to see beyond the imaginable, interrogate the detail and develop fresh perspective. The work of individual artists, and of organisations such as Battersea Arts Centre, Shambala festival and <a href=\"http://www.artichoke.uk.com/\" title=\"\">Artichoke</a> is exploring the public mass of creative noise and diversity.</p> <p>Second, it's about the exponential force that cultural partnerships are bringing. In Manchester we have been working with a group of over 25 iconic and heritage organisations. CEOs are boldly aligning, and then stretching the frameworks they work within.</p> <p>Third, the business case: legislation, governance, brand, and stakeholder expectations. This is well-trodden territory but worth remembering in the context of the arts. We carry enormous value to possible partners \u2013 <a href=\"http://glyndebourne.com/\" title=\"\">Glyndebourne's</a> wind turbine did as much for the profiling of wind power as it did for the opera \u2013 and is bringing finance to both.</p> <p>Earlier this month we did an analysis for ACE of 86 organisations and identified real savings of, collectively, \u00a3700,000. Scaled up to the sector that could total \u00a315m across 2011 and 2012.</p> <h2>Thinking and acting as one</h2> <p>Collectively as the creative industries we convene an incredible network. Our impact goes far beyond our individual footprints and together we can change paradigms, but we must work together. From joint procurement of green goods, connecting with emerging trends, exploring the impact of digital technologies, or sharing knowledge around reshaping our arts ecology \u2013 we must continue to think ahead and learn from each other.</p> <p>At Julie's Bicycle we are increasingly looking at other ways of modeling our arts ecology. Our 'coalface' is the interchange between the sustainability and creative spheres and we are constantly looking at what each can learn from the other. The principles of the circular economy whereby the concept of waste is eliminated, and how it could be applied to the arts is one that fascinates me. I wonder if we could base, say, our touring industries on a circular production model, just pushing the boundaries of recycling in all directions a little bit further, working with other industries and manufacturers?</p> <p>And just in case it gets lost, our key agent for change is ethical. In all our conversations, with ACE, artists, government, it is tacitly acknowledged that this is the right thing to.</p> <p>So what's the plan? At Julie's Bicycle we have a few key principles:</p> <p>\u2022 'Doing' sustainability has a direct impact on artwork so we don't keep the processes separate</p> <p>\u2022 We work together at scale at a whole system level, and with other agents, disciplines and ideas</p> <p>\u2022 We use our amplified voices across the creative supply chain \u2013 artists and CEOs</p> <p>\u2022 We articulate value in material and non-material ways for financial, political and cultural leverage</p> <p>\u2022 We actively support markets, harness emerging trends and use sustainability as a business parameter</p> <p>We also think ahead, and we must. We need to cement the narrative from thermostat to theatrics. Creativity is the most sustainable and renewable energy source on the planet.

  "<p>The jury has returned its verdict in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/24/victoria-station-killing-sofyen-belamouadden?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">final trial of the 21 young people charged with murder</a> at London's Victoria station in March 2010. The prosecution had no clear evidence of who struck the fatal blows, so they relied on \"joint enterprise\", the controversial legal doctrine which can make a group liable for a crime committed by one of its members. It works like this: when A, B and C participate together in one crime, during which A commits a second crime which B and C have foreseen he might intentionally commit, joint enterprise makes them all guilty of it.</p> <p>Proof of being jointly liable for a crime is not usually problematic: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-verdict-guilty-murder\" title=\"\">Norris and Dobson were found guilty</a> in 2012 of the murder of Stephen Lawrence without proof that either of them actually stabbed him, but because they were part of the small group that included the killer, and they were all in it together. Evidence of the victim's blood and hair on their clothes showed that they must have been extremely close to him when he was stabbed. There was no innocent explanation.</p> <p>The difficulty arises when the participants are more diffuse. Take a fight between two gangs of youths, which ends in a fatal stabbing. One person may have murder in mind, some just a fight, others may have joined in casually with no clear idea of how events would unfold. If those at the fringe are guilty of, for example, affray (fighting in public), and there's evidence that they knew or found out that some of their mates were armed with knives, the jury may think that at some stage they foresaw that the knives would be used to kill or cause really serious harm. The jury must convict them of murder, even if they played no direct part in the killing, and may have been some distance away. Normally the prosecution must prove intent to kill or cause really serious harm to secure a conviction for murder. But under joint enterprise, a marginal player can be guilty without himself intending to kill or seriously injure anyone.</p> <p>This can be a cause for concern. It is akin to the infamous use \"common purpose\" by the South African authorities used under apartheid to criminalise individuals regarded as politically suspect, and whole groups taking part in protests. It has its roots in English law and was routinely misused by the repressive South African state. It reared up again briefly in August 2012, to justify <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/south-african-miners-charged-murder\" title=\"\">the arrest of hundreds of strikers at the Malakana mine</a>.</p> <p>Our joint enterprise law doesn't require a common purpose \u2013 just that those committing the first crime foresee that the second crime might be committed. It places an unusually heavy burden on a jury by obliging them to convict people who they may well think are barely involved. In some cases they may even defy the law and acquit people who they feel uncomfortable about convicting, even if all the legal boxes are ticked. A different jury, on similarly tenuous facts, may take against a defendant and convict. Especially for young people, even time in custody on remand is acutely difficult and damaging, if they are eventually acquitted.</p> <p>Genuine anxiety about gang violence lies behind this use of joint enterprise. There is a tenable view that if you join a gang, you must take responsibility for what other gang members do. But joint enterprise can work like a drift-net, drawing in people who on a commonsense view are too remote from the killing to share responsibility for it.</p> <p>The result is an increased risk that the wrong people end up with convictions for murder. A remedy would be to differentiate between degrees of murder with corresponding sentences, to reflect different levels of involvement. The Law Commission made proposals for reform in 2006. But politicians won't have it.</p>",
  "<p>In my favourite works of horror and supernatural fiction, the landscape itself is at least as important as whatever beasts or phantoms may roam across it. From the deserted strands of MR James to the Danube of <a href=\"http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/literature/blackwood/stories/willows.htm\" title=\"\">Algernon Blackwood's \"The Willows\"</a>, there seems to be a deeper resonance to those stories in which location is a junction between the mundane and the weird. HP Lovecraft, the American writer who, in a flurry of activity in the mid-1920s, defined the \"<a href=\"http://www.hplovecraft.com/popcult/mythos.asp\" title=\"\">Cthulhu Mythos</a>\" \u2013 a series of interconnected stories that <a href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mythfolk/message/2950\" title=\"\">Luc Sante has called \"a sort of unified field theory of horror\"</a> \u2013 is particularly good at this. In his best stories, his descriptions of landscape are so meticulous that their woods and valleys are loaded with menace long before anything shambles or crawls through them. </p> <p>The vast wastes and visibly ancient geology of Antarctica are fundamental to Lovecraft's long story \"At the Mountains of Madness\". In \"The Whisperer in Darkness\", the evocation of rural Vermont's \"unfrequented hills\" and lonely farmhouses are the story's highlight. But supreme within Lovecraft's work is his own invented corner of New England, Arkham (based on Salem and \"full of witch legends\") and the surrounding Miskatonic Valley. It's here, and to the economically but indelibly drawn landscape of <a href=\"http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/thecolouroutofspace.htm\" title=\"\">\"The Colour Out of Space\"</a>, that I most often return, especially at this time of year. Just consider the story's opening sentences:</p> <blockquote> West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glimpse of sunlight. </blockquote> <p>At Halloween, what reader could resist turning the page?</p> <p>The narrator of this 1927 story is a surveyor, taking measurements for a new reservoir. Folklore has it that the hills and vales he's visiting are \"evil\", and on arrival he can see why. The trees \"grew too thickly, and their trunks were too big for any healthy New England wood. There was too much silence in the dim alleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay.\" The epicentre of this bleak zone is a \"blasted heath\", \"five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a grey spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields\". At the centre of this stand the remains of a house and a stagnant well.</p> <p>Intrigued, he unearths vague stories about a family, the Gardners, that \"had disappeared or was killed\" in the 1880s. He then tracks down Ammi Pierce, a local whose old house stands \"where the trees first begin to get thick\". There the narrator hears a story about a meteorite and the after-effects of its impact that makes him resign his post, so intent is he on never returning to that \"dim chaos of old forest and slope\". I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it, but a compelling feature of the story is the way in which contamination spreads through the land to which this farming community is tied. First the fruit of Nahum Gardner's orchard spoils, then the wildlife in the area begins to grow misshapen, \"in a queer way impossible to describe\". Those last three words are very important: elsewhere in his work, Lovecraft does sometimes strain to describe, which pushes a fair proportion of his stories past horror into ludicrousness. Here, by contrast, when Nahum Gardner's wife is driven mad by trees that move on windless nights, and the shifting windows and walls of her house, she screams \"about things in the air which she could not describe. In her raving there was not a specific noun, but only verbs and pronouns.\"</p> <p>Lovecraft's prose can be riper than corpses, but in \"The Colour Out of Space\" he displays an uncommon degree of control. Here, the most extraordinarily disquieting phrases bloom beside one another. On a single page we are told that the Gardners' pigs \"began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died\"; that the Gardners themselves, driven almost beyond reason, shambled about with a \"stolid resignation about them all, as if they walked half in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom\"; and that, simply and unsparingly, \"Thaddeus went mad in September after a visit to the well\".</p> <p>It was with the composition of \"The Call of Cthulhu\" in 1926 that Lovecraft began the story sequence, of which \"The Colour Out of Space\" is one, that encompasses his conception of \"cosmic horror\". These works, responding to Darwin, Freud, and the anthropology of James George Frazer, engage with the dethroning of anthropocentrism. Lovecraft's terrifying extraterrestrials position humans as one, very inferior race among many, and show life to be a short, fraught struggle on the lip of a void. His strikingly evoked landscapes are, finally, just strips on the fringe of oblivion. As <a href=\"http://www.stjoshi.org/intro_epicure.html\" title=\"\">Lovecraft's biographer ST Joshi</a> has it, \"whereas most of the religions and mythologies in human history seek to reconcile human beings with the cosmos by depicting a close, benign relationship between man and God, Lovecraft's pseudo-mythology brutally shows that man is not the centre of the universe, that the \"gods\" care nothing for him, and that the earth and all its inhabitants are but a momentary incident in the unending cyclical chaos of the universe\". Happy Halloween.</p>",
  "<p>Mistakes a person can make during the first term of university and whether I made them:</p> <p>\u2022 Declaring your drunken love to a sober and unimpressed flatmate, having known them for all of 12 hours. Check.</p> <p>\u2022 Turning up to a lecture late and quickly finding a seat, only to realise Mechanisms of Neuronal Death is not on the law syllabus. Check.</p> <p>\u2022 After weeks of ignoring an increasingly sick feeling, admitting to yourself you've made a dreadful mistake, and that the course you have signed up to spend the next three years studying is not the one for you. Sadly, check.</p> <p>I chose to study law at university in 2009 quite simply because I thought it would be a good degree to have \u2013 an impressive degree. When it dawned on me that this was not the way I wanted to go about getting a university education, I felt terrible: frustrated, anxious and furious with myself for making such a hugely wrong decision.</p> <p>And so, I dropped out. <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2064&amp;Itemid=141\" title=\"\">According to the Higher Education Statistics Authority</a> (Hesa), 8.6% of students in the academic year 2009-10 withdrew from university in their first year, up from 7.9% the year before.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9173784/University-drop-out-rate-soars-by-13pc-in-a-year.html\" title=\"\">The Telegraph takes the view </a>that this rise in dropout figures (the most recent available) is \"promoting fears that taxpayers' money is being wasted\".</p> <p>It will be interesting to see what effect 2012's rise in tuition fees has on dropout rates. Knowing that they are going to pay as much as \u00a39,000 a year is making students more cautious about choosing their course in the first place, and they will certainly think long and hard about quitting.</p> <p>But how much would withdrawing from your course really cost you? Well that depends on the time of year you quit.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.sfengland.slc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Student Finance England</a> (SFE), here's what would happen if you dropped out this year: \"In the academic year 2012-13, tuition loans are paid to universities and colleges in three instalments which are split 25% for the first term, 25% for the second term and 50% for the third term. Each payment is made after the university or college has confirmed the attendance of the student with the Student Loans Company.</p> <p>\"Therefore if a student withdraws from the course before the start or never actually enrolls, no tuition loans are payable. If the student withdraws during the first term only 25% of the tuition loans is payable, 50% if they withdraw during the second term and the full 100% of the tuition loan if the student withdraws during the third term.\"</p> <p>There'd also be implications for your maintenance loan or grant, and SFE suggests that if you're thinking about dropping out, you should phone and speak to one of its advisers about your specific case.</p> <p>It's not just about money though. Withdrawing from university is by no means an easy decision to make. From the initial doubts, through the teary phonecalls with parents, to the eventual signing of the withdrawal form, the process is psychologically exhausting. It's both reassuring and sensible to leave with a plan, even if it's just short term.</p> <p>When I dropped out of university, I knew that I wanted to reapply elsewhere to study English the following academic year. I made sure I didn't waste the rest of the year wallowing in self-pity. Luckily, I managed to get a job, allowing me to save a proportion of my earnings for the student days that awaited me.</p> <p>Each university will have welfare advisers who are able to provide guidance and support. But the final decision needs to be taken alone. Ignore persuasive parents and forceful friends \u2013 you are the only one who truly knows what you want and how you want to go about getting it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398342640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Trinity Mirror's new chief executive, Simon Fox, has discovered one of the acute problems of running a national newspaper company - it attracts disproportionate publicity.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/24/trinity-mirror-investigation-phone-hacking\">email to staff about the allegations of phone hacking at TM's three national titles </a>he said he was \"deeply concerned\" in the \"absence of evidence [how] four unsubstantiated claims can attract publicity of such magnitude\".</p> <p>This naive response reminds me of similar complaints by a former Trinity Mirror CEO, Philip Graf. He was hardly known outside the industry when running a regional newspaper chain. </p> <p>Once his company was merged with the Mirror group in 1999, however, he found himself in print on a regular basis - and often the butt of harsh criticism. He was forever lamenting what he regarded as undue media attention.</p> <p>Well, Mr Fox, you'd better get used to it as well. This is media narcissism in action. It goes with the territory. We journalists are, unsurprisingly, consumed with intense interest about our industry. Our gossip goes viral as a matter of rote.</p> <p>Of course, accountants and builders and doctors, all trades and professions, are consumed by what happens in their own worlds too. But they don't have the means at their disposal to publicise it. It's our business after all.</p> <p>For publicly quoted companies, such as Trinity Mirror, the peril is obvious: the City, even when warned by analysts to ignore stories, goes into a spin. </p> <p>The dip in TM's share price following the initial revelation that four public figures were about to take legal action has not recovered. And news of a fifth claim by an unidentified \"high-profile businessman\", <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/81c5f31a-1df9-11e2-8e1d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AHyjHM4N\">as reported in the Financial Times,</a> will hardly calm investors' nerves.</p> <p>Look at the current price. As I write, it stands at 62p, down from its 75.25p high, and showing no signs of bouncing back.</p> <p>It is also the case, as Fox clearly fails to understand, that hacking is a toxic subject. Any extension of allegations outside News International was bound to gain headlines. </p> <p>It was right, of course, to announce an internal investigation into the four civil claims brought by ex-England football manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, former footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Shobna Gulati, and Abbie Gibson, the former nanny to David Beckham's children.</p> <p>Eriksson's relates to the Daily Mirror, in the days when Piers Morgan was editor. The claims lodged by the other three allege hacking at either the Sunday Mirror or The People.</p> <p>A Trinity Mirror spokesman said: \"As we have previously stated, all our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct.\"</p> <p>Yes. The company has always robustly defended itself against phone hacking on those grounds. But did the journalists work within the law back in the day when the News of the World was using similar illegal techniques? That's the question that should have been asked and investigated by Fox's predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/oct/24/trinity-mirror-simon-fox\">as I pointed out yesterday.</a></p>",

  "<p>One of the toughest nuts to crack in our current workforce statistics is the number of older people suffering unemployment for 12 months or more \u2013 some 192,000 at our last count. Many people who have had successful careers and developed excellent skills and experience can find the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/12/unemployment-among-older-workers-soars\" title=\"\">current job market frustrating and discouraging</a>. Why is this?</p> <p>Employers' perceptions of older people are a major barrier. Hirers often have a mental picture of the person they want and this can include the unspoken assumption that the appointee will be significantly younger than themselves.</p> <p>A survey by <a href=\"http://www.taen.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Age and Employment Network (TAEN)</a> found that more than two-thirds of older job seekers believed their difficulties stemmed from being \"too old.\" Nearly half believed they were viewed as \"too experienced\" and were rejected for a variety of reasons, including because \"they are too big for this job\" or \"you would be bored by this\".</p> <p>It seems that older job seekers lose on both counts. If they don't have directly relevant experience in the same role and sector, no one wants to give them a chance, but there are virtually no internships or work experience programmes for older people. For example, if they lack the IT skills of younger job seekers, many assume that they can't or won't learn. Moreover, training grants, which are widely available for younger job seekers, are less common for the older person. The skills and qualifications structure has changed enormously and older job seekers are less likely to have the proof of vocational competence. Many older jobseekers feel frustrated because their practical know-how is excellent but many struggle to even get interviews.</p> <p>But there are ways older jobseekers can improve their chances of employment. Here are a few tips to give you extra confidence and demonstrate your employability:</p> <h2><strong>Look at your strengths</strong></h2> <p>You need to know what skills you have that employers will find useful. The skills you have honed over decades will only get you work if they are required. Conversely, many people also have transferable skills that they don't even realise.</p> <p>Review your key strengths, identify weaknesses and draw up a personal action plan with practical steps on how to move forward in your career. Think long and hard before committing yourself to study for a paper qualification, but if there is a way of accrediting your existing competencies this could be beneficial.</p> <p>Be prepared to take a \"bridge job\" or even a volunteering role for short spell to help fill an important gap in your skills profile \u2013 it will impress employers that you are not afraid to learn and can act strategically.</p> <h2><strong>Refresh your CV</strong></h2> <p>The whole idea of a single paper version of your CV is pass\u00e9; make sure you can send it electronically. The first page must make the reader want to scroll down for more and must be free of CV jargon. Take advice from friends as to whether it looks professional, neat and clean.</p> <p>Keep your core CV that includes most of what you want to put down, and then look carefully at what is required for each job and offer a fresh and relevant CV for each application. Strip out all the stuff you don't need; make it relevant and apply transferable skills. Try and fit it on two pages.</p> <p>If you don't receive a response to your application, check it has been received and if you do not hear back, ask for feedback.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>Do you have to mention your age?</strong></h2> <p>No but don't be defensive about it. Display confidence, energy and professionalism and stress your key assets.</p> <h2><strong>Changing jobs in the same field</strong></h2> <p>If you have spent years in one job this is where you may feel most comfortable in searching for work. Your contacts may be able to give you early hints of upcoming jobs; find out who to write to and get in early with an informal email and attach your CV. Say that you are interested in any future career openings \u2013 even to fill in at short notice as this can lead to something longer term.</p> <h2><strong>Changing career path</strong></h2> <p>You may decide to change your career and do something that has always interested you. Such changes can be more difficult to make in mid-life \u2013 it would be difficult to train as a lawyer in your 50s, for example. If you are willing to take a course or two or get voluntary experience, however, it is possible. You will need to stand out ahead of other applicants so putting in extra effort will show the added value you could bring.</p> <h2><strong>Self-employment</strong></h2> <p>This is often considered an attractive option by older people who have tried unsuccessfully to get back into employment. But is likely to entail a good deal of work. You will have to learn to be self-sufficient or you may need to take a business course. This option can be fulfilling, however, and for many older people being your own boss can be a welcome relief.</p> <p><em>Chris Ball is the chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.taen.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>TAEN</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The Council of Ministers would therefore need to improvise one according to its own design.</p> <p>Second, an independent Scotland could either be considered a successor state, inheriting the United Kingdom\u2019s rights and status, or a new applicant, but would have no automatic right to the former. A political decision would have to be taken by the Council of Ministers acting unanimously.</p> <p>Third, even if Scotland was granted the status of a successor state, there would still have to be extensive negotiations to disentangle Scotland\u2019s legal and financial obligations from those of the United Kingdom. There would be no certainty that Scotland would get a good deal out of those negotiations given that it would be UK rather than Scottish ministers sitting in the relevant EU decision-making bodies.</p> <p>What emerges from this is that the real determining factors are political rather than legal. The status and rights of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU would be decided by a body comprised of twenty-seven countries (possibly more by the time it happens), any one of which might use its veto to block the process in pursuit of its own national interests and to the detriment of Scotland\u2019s.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2012/10/25/real-choices-for-labour/\">\u2022 Progress has launched the Purple Papers, an attempt to start a debate on the hard policy choices that would face a Labour government in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The election of Helle Thorning-Schmidt\u2019s social democrats in Denmark last October and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France this year were notable exceptions. The fate of both, though, should be at the forefront of Ed Miliband\u2019s mind as he builds on the momentum of his \u2018One Nation Labour\u2019 conference address.</p> <p>Six months after its election victory, Thorning-Schmidt\u2019s party had plummeted to 16 per cent in the polls, its lowest ratings in a century. In France, Hollande has seen the sharpest decline in popularity of any newly elected president in the history of the fifth republic. Hollande\u2019s socialist deputies and their Green allies are in revolt against the president\u2019s request that they approve the European fiscal pact he disingenuously vowed to renegotiate. The Red-Green Alliance, which formed part of the electoral bloc that brought Thorning-Schmidt to power, are up in arms at the prime minister\u2019s tight fiscal policy and centrist welfare reforms. While the fate of neither government is by any means sealed, both are suffering from a failure to prepare the voters prior to coming to office for the tough decisions they would have to take.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/10/miliband-sneaking-power-without-plan-government\">\u2022 Rafael Behr at the New Statesman says Ed Miliand needs to prepare the voters for what Labour might need to do in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Miliband's] plan involves promising epoch-defining change to the way society and the economy are structured without divisive talk of winners and losers \u2013 the cosy one-nation revolution. It is a feasible strategy for sneaking up on power but with a hollow mandate. If Miliband forms a government without permission to inflict pain or make enemies, he will quickly find Britain ungovernable.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/10/ed-balls-is-still-in-denial-about-the-deficit/\">\u2022 Jonathan Jones at Coffee House says Ed Balls was not telling the truth on the Daily Politics when he said the Treasury did not know there was a structural deficit before 2007.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20080858\">\u2022 Mark D\u2019Arcy on his BBC blog pays tribute to the later Walter Harrison, the former Labour deputy chief whip.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Harrison ran one of the most effective whipping operations in parliamentary history, conjuring majorities out of thin air week in, week out. Famously, he provided disguises so that Labour MPs could vote twice in a division, after the Conservatives called an unexpected vote - in breach, he thought, of an agreed deal.

The first minister said he expected to be cleared of breaching the code, telling Holyrood he had been exonerated in all five of the previous occasions he had been referred under the code since becoming first minister in 2007.

We can see that with unemployment falling, with a quarter of the deficit paid down in the last two years. There is more to do but these figures are good progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any growth in the economy is to be welcomed, the picture is clouded by the artificial boost to the economy generated by Olympic ticket sales \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime occasion - which was responsible for 0.2 per cent of this growth.</p> <p>\u201cToo much of the growth is centred on London and the service sector, a more realistic indicator is that the construction industry is still in the doldrums and its contribution to the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures declined by 2.5 per cent.</p> <p>David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s austerity polices are still causing serious problems to the economy which remains flat. If you strip away the economic fillip created by the Olympic ticket sales, you have an economy stuck on the starting blocks with anaemic growth, and you still have the food banks on the rise and long-term unemployment on the increase.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and Jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum.</p> <p>We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, the Plaid Cyrmu Treasury spokesman</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures today showing a return to growth in the past quarter are very welcome but the reality is that the economy has flatlined in the past year and for most people life is harder than before the crash.</p> <p>In Wales, we still have 50,000 more people unemployed than in 2007, showing the need for Leanne Wood\u2019s Plan C programme to create jobs in Wales. A Party of Wales government would be a real boost for Wales.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Graeme Leach</strong>, chief economist at the Institute of Directors</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bounce back in GDP growth is good news but not enough to pop the champagne corks. More than half of the quarterly increase is attributable to the Olympics and the reversal of the Jubilee effect in Q2.</p> <p>The key message is that we\u2019re out of recession but uncertain where we\u2019re going. Not for the first time we need to heed the warning that you can\u2019t see the road ahead through the rear view mirror.</p> <p>Our view is that growth will continue in Q4 but we have to recognise there could be a fallback.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, the IPPR's chief economist</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weak growth for the past two years can be partly accounted for by the combination of high food and energy prices, which have hit consumers hard, exports falling short of expectations due to the euro crisis and a shortage of credit for small businesses which has led to weak business investment. It is also clear that the Government\u2019s austerity plan has held back growth.</p> <p>\u201cThe outlook is still very uncertain, not least due to the prospect of increases in food and energy prices renewing the squeeze on households. The Chancellor should respond in his autumn statement. Spending on infrastructure gives the biggest boost to the economy in the short-term. George Osborne should announce an immediate increase in infrastructure spending of \u00a315 billion over the next two years to kick-start growth.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089202db5794584b1c13f57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T11:19:10.052Z\">12.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here.</a> And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/24/all\">here.</a></p> <p>As for the rest of the papers, here is<a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/todays_must_reads.html\"> the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads,</a> here is <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/frontpage/2012/10/newslinks-for-thursday-25th-october-2012.html\">the ConservativeHome round-up of today's politics stories </a>and here is <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/10/morning-call-pick-papers-6\">the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles in today's papers.</a></p> <p>And here are some stories I found particularly interesting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/1bnayear-black-hole-in-university-funding-revealed-8225465.html\">\u2022 Richard Garner in the Independent says a new report shows the new tuition fee system created by the government could cost more than the system it replaced.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A \u00a31bn-a-year \u201cblack hole\u201d in university funding means the Government\u2019s new \u00a39,000 fees regime is in danger of costing taxpayers more than the old system.</p> <p>A report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi), a highly respected think-tank, says the Government has \u201cseriously understated\u201d the cost of its higher education reforms.

I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome,</a> the BBC and the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Duncan Smith said that families living on benefits, and very wealthy families, were more likely to have large numbers of children than families on average incomes.</strong> That was because families on average incomes had to decide how many children they could afford, he said. Families living on benefits should be forced to make the same decisions, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you look at families across the board in all incomes, you find that the vast majority make decisions about the numbers of children they can have, the families they want, based on what they think they can afford and how it\u2019s going to work. Where you see the clustering of large families is really down at the very lowest incomes \u2013 those on significantly levels of welfare \u2013 and those on the very top incomes. In other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the bills - they make the decisions about their lives, even if they would sometimes have extra children, they make decisions. People who are having support through welfare are often free from that decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith said he wanted to support out-of-work families with children. But he also wanted to make them realise that \"you have to cut your cloth in accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he was considering capping child-related benefits for families after they have more than two children.</strong> \"My view, if you did this, you would start it for people who begin to have more than, say, two children,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was right to cap housing benefits because paying more than \u00a3100,000 a year for some families was \"madness\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said benefits should be \"temporary\" for most people and that the welfare system should encourage people to find work.</strong> This was what universal credit would do, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Benefits should be for many people \u2013 unless you\u2019re chronically sick \u2013 a temporary place. It\u2019s a place you then move on into work. And we want to help you do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the current welfare system \"destroys lives\" because it allows people who should be working to remain on benefits long-term.</strong> That was why the government was reforming the system, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted far too long in this country that it is possible just to stay on benefits, that we write them off, and we work only with those who get up in the morning and go to work. And that\u2019s simply not acceptable. It\u2019s not acceptable because it destroys their lives; it also destroys the lives of taxpayers who have to pick up that bill to pay for them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50890aeb95cb4897f0db52ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:48:27.841Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-98771c64-8a0b-4fdd-857d-5567f1d8217e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351158402840/03803a12-ef80-406a-bd60-3a8579f99cb1-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Balls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor  Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the shadow chancellor, has now put out a statement about the GDP figures. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's good news that, with the help of the Olympics, Britain is finally out of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.</p> <p>Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago - twelve months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year.<br>And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best. The complacent thing to do now is simply to wait and hope things will get better. The cautious thing to do is to act now to secure and strengthen growth in our economy.&#xa0;</p> <p>Britain needs a plan to secure and sustain a strong economic recovery, including using funds from the 4G mobile spectrum auction to build 100,000 affordable homes, a temporary VAT cut and a bank bonus tax to fund jobs for young people out of work. We also need action to ease the squeeze for people on low and middle incomes, rather than a tax cut for millionaires. And we need long-term changes to make our economy stronger, including a long-term plan to rebuild our infrastructure and radical reform of the banks.</p> <p>In the two years since the spending review our economy has grown by just 0.6 per cent, compared to the 4.6 per cent George Osborne said his plan would deliver and growth of 3.4 per cent in the USA and 3.3 per cent in Germany. So the question for the coming months is whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years and not keep falling behind as other countries move ahead.</p> <p>A one-off boost from the Olympics is welcome. But it is no substitute for a plan to secure and sustain the strong recovery that Britain desperately needs if we are to create jobs, get the deficit down and make people better off.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089064d95cb4897f0db52e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:28:45.935Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Scotland the SNP government is doing its best to draw a line under the controversy about Alex Salmond misleading voters about non-existent legal advice.

First, today's figures include a bounce of at least 0.5% due to <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/assets/en/docs/commentary/markit-economics/2012/oct/UK_PMI_all_sector_12_10_03.pdf\">lost output</a> from the Jubilee bank holiday and <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/articles/2011-present/impact-of-the-olympics/measuring-the-impact-of-the-olympics-on-the-national-accounts---download.pdf\">sales of Olympic tickets and TV rights</a> all scoring in the third quarter.</p> <p>Second, 80% of the spending cuts are still to come. As the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/pdf/c1.pdf\">IMF admitted</a> earlier this month, austerity may have had a bigger impact on growth than previously predicted.

GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The largest contribution to the increase came from the services sector. There was also an increase in activity in the production sector. Activity in the construction sector fell. The latest GDP estimate was affected by the changes made to the quarter two Bank Holidays in May and June 2012 as part of the celebrations for the Queens Diamond Jubilee. The end of May bank holiday moved to June and there was an additional day's holiday in June. Over the second quarter, this resulted in one fewer working days. The change to the bank holidays was not a regular event so no adjustment was made to account for it as part of the seasonal adjustment process. This means that any impact of the changes fed directly through to the GDP estimate ...</p> <p>In addition to the impact of the bank holiday changes, the latest GDP estimate was affected by the Olympics and Paralympics events in the third quarter. The Olympics took place from 27 July to 12 August 2012 (with a few events starting on 25 July), and the Paralympics from 29 August to 9 <br>September. The events were likely to have impacted on the economy in a number of ways (note that \u2018Olympic\u2019 or \u2018Olympics\u2019 below refers to both the Olympics and Paralympic events):</p> <p>\u2022 Sports activities, amusement and recreation: tickets for the Olympics were sold in tranches through 2011 and 2012 but, in accordance with national accounts principles, these have been allocated to the third quarter, when the output actually occurred. The impact of the ticket sales <br>on GDP can be clearly seen in the lower level data for sports activities, which is part of the Government and other services aggregate in Table B1. Ticket sales were estimated to have increased GDP in the quarter by about 0.2 percentage points</p> <p>\u2022 Employment activities: employment agencies showed some strength in the quarter and it is possible that some of this strength was related to the Olympics. However, there was no direct evidence from survey respondents to support this</p> <p>\u2022 Creative arts and entertainment activities: the arts and entertainment sector has been showing some strength for some time, with quite strong growth in the most recent quarter. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Office administration: office administration was quite strong in the quarter but the evidence on any Olympic effect was mixed, with some respondents suggesting that it may have had an adverse effect, as opposed to explaining the strength</p> <p>\u2022 Accommodation: hotels showed greater activity in the quarter and this was one area where one might expect to see an Olympic effect, albeit mainly in London. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Food and beverage services: there was some strength in the food and drink sector and some evidence from survey returns that part of this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Land transport: there was some strength in parts of the transport sector and some evidence from survey returns that this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Retail: retail showed some strength in the quarter but there was very little evidence of any significant Olympic effect. Indeed there was some feedback from online retailers that sales were lower as consumers watched the Olympics instead of shopping online</p> <p>\u2022 Motion picture, video and TV programme production: the data here were quite weak for the quarter and there was some evidence from survey respondents to support this weakness - 'people watching the Olympics instead'</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:29:24.787Z\">at 10.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f97695cb4897f0db52d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:33:58.669Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2012/index.html\">Here is the Office for National Statistics news release about the GDP figures.</a></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_284925.pdf\">the ONS statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf).</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:34:38.459Z\">at 9.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f8ae95cb4897f0db52d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:30:38.973Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 Growth was up by 1% in Q3, the ONS says.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:31:03.627Z\">at 9.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f78eb5794584b1c13f2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:25:50.246Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8135554b-a8f9-474d-a431-a250aecc2cd6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351153331500/816a87bc-1412-4ac9-bff5-dfea368189bc-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Sir William Beveridge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir William Beveridge.

At 9.30am we are expected to hear that Britain is out of recession. It\u2019s not really a \u201ccrack-open-the-champagne\u201d moment; the double-dip was never expected to happen in the first place, and when David Cameron came to power, anyone predicting that Britain would spend the first half of 2012 in recession would have been branded an extreme pessimist. But, for a government desperate for every scrap of good news, it\u2019s a bonus.</p> <p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/24/cameron-accused-leaking-gdp-figures\">Patrick Wintour\u2019s Guardian splash about the GDP announcement, and the row over whether Cameron \u201cleaked\u201d the figures in advance.</a> And here\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/25/gdp-figures-relief-osborne\"> an analysis from Larry Elliott about what we should expect. </a><br>He says a rise in output of less than 0.6 or 0.7% would be a disappointment.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Assuming a 0.5 point bounceback from the depressed activity in the second quarter and 0.1 to 0.2 points from the Olympics, anything less than a 0.6% or 0.7% increase in gross domestic product will be seen by the City as a disappointment. A figure of 1% or higher would exceed expectations and put paid to any prospect of further stimulus from the Bank of England.</p> <p>One thing is certain: the figures \u2013 whether good, bad or indifferent \u2013 will not end the political debate about the state of the economy. Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said even if the economy were to grow by 1% in the third quarter, it would only take the level of activity back to where it was a year ago. \u201cThe question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and bank holiday effects,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/25/eurozone-crisis-live-britain-emerges-from-recession\">here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s business live blog, which will be taking the lead in covering the figures.</a> Here I will be focusing on the political reaction.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The GDP figures for the third quarter of 2012 (Q3, in the jargon).

  "<p>When comments such as \"barmy legislation\" and \"opening the door to sub standard accommodation\" are fired from the ranks of the Conservative London Assembly members, you know the government has stirred up a real passion in its own heartland.</p> <p>The proposal to relax planning laws on garden extensions could become a test of local democracy versus central government dictat, as lawyers are consulted and the detail of planning rules are picked over. At mayor's question time on 17 October, Boris Johnson joined in the open revolt, saying he has grave concerns \"about a sprouting riot of conservatories on the back of people's dwellings\".</p> <p>Announced by the prime minister as one of the coalition government's measures to kick-start the economy, the proposal would allow extensions and conservatories of up to eight metres to be built without the need for planning permission \u2013 up from the current four metres for a limited three year period. However, planning minister Nick Boles indicated it may go beyond the original three year period \"if everybody is happy\".</p> <p>The announcement promised to sweep away the rules and bureaucracy (or, as others might describe them, the safeguards) that block shoddy and unwanted extensions and, according to Johnson, \"renewed attempts at garden grabbing\".</p> <p>The policy drew immediate criticism from Richmond and Sutton councils; both made clear that they have every intention of defying the government. In response communities secretary Eric Pickles urged residents to use legal powers against councils and seek damages if they refused to implement these proposals. Meanwhile the Local Government Association has warned that thousands of unsightly and out of character extensions which could invade neighbours' privacy, and had been previously blocked, would go ahead now. Rogue landlords may now have the legal right to develop \"beds in sheds\", which trap vulnerable people in dangerous living conditions.</p> <p>Only two years ago, the government reclassified back gardens from brownfield land in a bid to protect private property from unwanted development. Their decision was based on evidence that showed that the proportion of new houses built on residential land such as back gardens had risen dramatically, from one in 10 to one in four between 1997 and 2008. Then, in 2011, the mayor of London agreed to put a policy into his 'London plan' that would give councils the power to introduce a presumption against development on back gardens or other private gardens.</p> <p>If the government proposal goes ahead, it is very likely to undermine these recent national and regional planning changes that have, on early indication, reduced the granting of planning applications and reduced the scale and rate of garden loss in London.</p> <p>Politics and popularity aside, the proposal ignores another critical factor. With climate change predictions warning us that the extremes of weather are expected to become the norm, back gardens in built up areas are increasingly important for providing cooling during heat waves, limiting flooding and providing vital habitats for wildlife.</p> <p>The scale of garden loss, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gigl.org.uk%2FPortals%2F0%2FDownloads%2FLondonGardenCity.pdf&amp;ei=OR2FUMSYEPSM0wXn-IG4BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuI8aDxy27uyKtUyMdQY_UxHGWBQ\" title=\"\">illustrated in a 2010 report</a>, found an area of vegetated garden land equivalent to 21 times the size of Hyde Park was lost between 1998-99 and 2006-08 in London, a 12% reduction.</p> <p>The government proposal has real potential to lead to neighbour disputes. Any further erosion of gardens, so important to mitigating the extremes of climate change and for wildlife, must be resisted.

He was speaking to our colleague Mona Mahmood via Skype.</p> <p>He confirmed that the Kurdish district was taken over by the FSA under a deal with the Kurdish PKK party.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brigades of the FSA were able to progress from al-Ashrafiyeh district where the Criminal Security branch is. There was also progress in al-Midan and Sulaiman al-Halabi districts. The [government] branch responsible for raids is in al-Midan district. These two branches are the biggest in Aleppo.</p> <p>Till now the clashes which started at 10am today are continuing and many district have been stormed by the FSA to get towards these two branches. Earlier news claimed that these two branches were taken by the FSA but the truth is the FSA fighters are surrounding these branches and they have still not taken them yet. We are working to get inside them.</p> <p>In Khan al-Assal district, there is a police school which was under siege by the FSA for 10 days now. The Syrian army were sending reinfocrements every day to ease the siege on it. Today a convoy was heading towards the school and was faced by fire from the FSA and could not get there.</p> <p>As for al-Ashrafiyeh district, it was controlled by [the Kurdish] PKK party and the Syrian army. The FSA were in Bani Zaid which is at the entrance to al-Ashrafiyeh. The FSA had to take al-Ashrafiyeh district to be able to reach the Criminal branch \u2013 and they did. The advance now is just around the Criminal Security and it is not easy to get control.</p> <p>If we talk about Aleppo and the countryside, the FSA are in control of 90% of the ground but when it comes to Aleppo as a city, the FSA are in control of 60% of the ground to 40% for the Syrian army.</p> <p>There are spots of power for the Syrian army like the Criminal Security in al-Ashrafiyeh, Political Security in al-Azziziyeh and Air Force security and intelligence in New Aleppo, in addition to the \"raids\" branch which is one of the biggest security branches in Aleppo.</p> <p>If the FSA can liberate all these branches, we can say at that time that Aleppo has been liberated entirely.</p> <p>At the beginning of the attack today, the Syrian army tried to stop the advance but they could not sustain it for long and they pulled out. Some of them left their weapons and ran away, others were killed.</p> <p>In Khan al-Assal, the FSA fighters were able to take some Syrian army soldiers as prisoners.</p> <p>For a long time, al-Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud districts were under the control of the PKK which is in alliance with Assad's regime (it helps in detaining members of FSA and hands them over to the Syrian army).</p> <p>At the beginning we did not plan to open a front from this direction \u2013 I mean al-Ashrafiyeh \u2013 to avoid any clashes with the PKK. Our target is the regime.</p> <p>The PKK had agreed not to interfere and not to support any side of the confilct. We did not attack any members of the PKK [today], in fact they pulled out to clear the way for us. It was a deal that they would pull out before the arrival of the FSA. The clashes were with the Syrian army only.</p> <p>The PKK accepted the deal after a lot of pressure from the Kurdish people. Lately, many buses loaded with Kurdish people from Afreen, 70km northwest of Aleppo, were attacked at random by the Syrian army thinking they are coming from Izzaz.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the revolution the regime has been trying to keep the PKK on its side but I think now it is going to lose them.</p> <p>More than 300 fighters from al-Fattah brigade, Tawheed brigade and Ahrar Syria brigades took part in the operation today. Till now the number of the martyrs in Aleppo is eight, as the regime did not use the planes owing to the cloudy weather. All of them are civilians.</p> <p>We also found bodies of two soldiers in Khan al-Assal \u2013 it seems they tried to defect and were executed by the regime. Yesterday we found seven bodies who were tortured and executed.</p> <p>If there is a truce, the FSA will comply and stay in its positions without firing a bullet unless the regime breaks the truce.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089577195cb4897f0db5338\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:14:57.217Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Syria accepts ceasefire, but ...</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Syrian army says it will \"cease military operations\" from Friday until Monday but reserves the right to respond if attacked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261485381843828737\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Syrian Army command says will cease military operations from Friday morning until Monday - state TV</p>&mdash; Reuters Top News (@Reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261485381843828737\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:12:27+00:00\">October 25, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261485442942251008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>More: Syrian Army command says reserves the right to respond to rebel attacks, bombings</p>&mdash; Reuters Top News (@Reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261485442942251008\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:12:42+00:00\">October 25, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Reuters says the military added a further condition:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It said it would also respond to \"terrorist groups trying to reinforce their positions by arming themselves and getting reinforcements\" as well as neighbouring countries facilitating the smuggling of fighters across borders during that period. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261488225711951875\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Free Syrian Army commander says fighters will commit to truce, but demands prisoner release on Friday.</p>&mdash; Reuters Top News (@Reuters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/261488225711951875\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:23:45+00:00\">October 25, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:49:36.322Z\">at 4.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508955d895cb4897f0db5337\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T15:08:08.805Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Revolution at the hajj</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A screen shot from the hajj in Saudi Arabia.

Months ago we predicted that if the FSA proved resourceful enough to weather this obstacle, they would succeed.</p> <p>It's also early. It's possible that the regime has made a strategic move here, and will reposition troops insider the city, or outside of it, for strategic gain.</p> <p>However, the regime has lost a massive amount of territory in Idlib province, many key bases, huge stockpiles of weapons, and some of its most strategically important highways and supply routes.

The road is packed with people trying to get back to Bani Walid but the army is turning them away.</p> <p>While we were there things got very heated. The army started opening fire - the bullets seemed to be going over our heads. People were running, children were screaming. It was pandemonium and I think things are getting worse.

The commanders in the town have obviously decided they don\u2019t want anyone back in. They want to tamp the town down. But the trouble is the Libyan government is giving a very different message, and putting out [messages] on television saying [residents of Bani Walid] can go home.</p> <p>The government has said all along that their target was not the people of Bani Walid, but that the town had become a magnet for all the former Gaddafi regime people elsewhere in Libya, because it was the one area of the country that had no government control. The whole point of the exercise was to hunt these people down. Apparently several dozen have been arrested, including some quite prominent former officials. These people were fighting very hard because they know they face trial and execution if they surrender.</p> <p>It feels as if the army has triggered a second conflict by refusing to let people back in.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>The clashes caught UN humanitarian aid workers en route to the town by surprise, Chris reported. \u201cThey were stunned to hear this is going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The people of Bani Walid were already furious at the assault on the town, and the current confusion over whether they can return will only add to the tension, Chris said.</p> <p>The fight for Bani Walid has been a \u201chuge set back for the Libyan authorities\u201d, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The operation against Bani Walid was supposed to be the new parliament showing that it could be sensible and that it could run the country.

  "<p>Growing up in 1980s Bradford, I always knew I'd take the traditional route to marriage. If I harboured teenage dreams of walking down the aisle to marry a man I loved, then my fantasy was blighted by the insurmountable burden of breaking away from my family. Besides, I'd always known I was lined up to marry a cousin \u2013 my uncle's son.</p> <p>He was as good a suitor as any. I reasoned that an educated, outgoing, well-travelled professional would make the sort of husband who would afford me the freedom to pursue my own career.</p> <p>British Muslim friends who had married before me warned of the importance of considering the environment that I'd be marrying into. For instance, living independently was always preferable since it limited day-to-day interference from the in-laws. The size of household was worth thinking about. I didn't want to have to please too many in-laws or spend too long in the kitchen. I also needed to consider my future mother-in-law's disposition because her backing could make or break the union.</p> <p>My mother had her own criteria. She wanted a son-in-law of good stock, who was respectable and responsible with the sort of traditional career that would always pay the mortgage \u2013 my mum's way of offering me long-term security.</p> <p>The suitor's social class was critical. Rather than a union between two individuals, this was a family merger, so mum needed to ensure the bond was sustainable. While we would never marry beneath us, we also didn't want the pressure of keeping up appearances by forming an alliance with people above our station.</p> <p>Mum has several cousins in her ancestral village in Pakistan who never married because their families couldn't identify men of a suitable social class for them. In a couple of cases, property was the issue. Since the bride takes a share of her father's property to her new family, a daughter's betrothal outside existing kinship networks can create a division of wealth, which is usually unwelcome. The same practice was prevalent among British nobility during Elizabethan times, when marriages were seen as alliances between two families which also helped to preserve prestige and wealth.</p> <p>Marriages like mine were based entirely on practicalities rather than emotions. Perhaps that's why we never talked about love when I was growing up. In fact, love is still the elephant in the room among Pakistani women of my mum's generation. They shun the subject as a weakness or \u2013 worse still \u2013 as a western concept which threatens to destabilise their preferred system of making marriages. This was certainly the case during my ill-fated relationship. I had presumed love would grow naturally; if I complained about its absence, I was told it was patience and staying power I lacked.</p> <p>I wanted to understand this attitude, so I set out to explore the experience of love and marriage among different generations of Muslim women in and around Bradford. The first generation \u2013 the ones that married migrant mill workers like my father during the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 talked about marriage rather than love, viewing the latter as a frivolity rather than a vital ingredient. There was little time for coupledom in their marriages, it seems, and love was something that took place in the dead of night, strictly behind closed doors.</p> <p>Rukeeya (not her real name) is now in her late 60s. She was 17 when her marriage was arranged with a family associate in Karachi, where she spent several years living with in-laws, before her husband secured work in Bradford. Not dwelling on love and happiness, she says, was a survival technique because \"it was out of your hands\". Instead, Rukeeya focused on being an ideal daughter-in-law which involved \"forsaking my own wishes in favour of others\" and \"keeping your tongue in check\".</p> <p>Changing attitudes appear to be driven largely by the British-born daughters of the migrant mill workers. Longstanding models of marriage, which offer security and family approval, are still dominant. What is different though is that British Muslim women like 45-year-old Noreen (not her real name) are now recognising and articulating their emotional needs:</p> <p>\"You know that passionate fantasised love inside a woman? I don't feel that kind of love. It's a different love altogether. It's a caring love. It's kicked in now in my life as we've got older, as I've got used to my husband's way of life.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's because their mothers didn't talk to them about love, that the first generation of British-born Pakistani women are keen to ensure that their daughters prioritise emotional wellbeing when it's their time to choose a life partner.</p> <p>\u2022 Irna Qureshi's latest work, <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\" title=\"\">Cartographies of Love</a>, is a live performance based on intimate conversations with three generations of Muslim women in West Yorkshire.</p>",
  "<p>Governments the world over seek to influence citizen choices by, for example, encouraging them to recycle, stop smoking or read to their children. Traditional policy levers such as taxing or prohibiting \"bad\" choices or subsidising or requiring \"good\" ones, can work, but they are hard to target and costly to enforce.</p> <p>The idea of nudging citizens into making better decisions has been in vogue in the past few years. The Obama administration is known to support the idea and in 2010 <a href=\"http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/behavioural-insights-team\" title=\"\">the UK government launched a behavioural insights team</a> to look at using alternative levers of influence such as more targeted language in tax demands, hard-hitting adverts about the risks of speeding, and food labelling. These levers play on human emotions such as guilt, the desire to conform and the need for better information to influence choices.</p> <p>These methods are cheaper and easier to target, advantageous in the current financial climate, and they can work. The Department for Transport <a href=\"http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/ConCaseStudy.1628\" title=\"\">estimated </a>that every \u00a31 spent on its <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/think-speed/\" title=\"\">THINK! anti-speeding campaign</a> saved the taxpayer \u00a39.36.</p> <p>But implementing behavioural levers can be daunting. The key is to break it down into steps. First, policymakers must identify the groups who make choices that need to be influenced, and their desired outcomes. This seems simple but frequently is not. People are rarely predictable, and dislike the idea of being manipulated by governments.</p> <p>Second, the causal link between choices and outcomes needs exploring, ideally through trials and collecting evidence. This kind of policymaking cannot be done in an ivory tower in Whitehall.</p> <p>Once the evidence and understanding is there, public bodies need to get the message across. In an era of tight budgets this often means digital marketing, PR rather than advertising, and social media.</p> <p>Policymakers and public managers face two key questions: how can they can spot when behavioural approaches might work, and how can they implement them in practice?</p> <p>For this approach to work effectively, we believe managers need to have positive answers to the following questions:</p> <p>1. Is the outcome driven by personal choices that citizens do not consider harmful to others, such as healthy eating or early detection of health issues? Traditional levers here are hard to apply and can be counterproductive.</p> <p>2. Do the choices you wish to influence occur frequently? Regular choices, such as what to eat, how much to save and whether to exercise, mean that behavioural levers can influence many decisions at relatively low cost.</p> <p>3. Do the choices occur regularly over a long period of time? A strength of behavioural levers is that they are more agile and much easier to adjust to changing attitudes than levers enshrined in legislation and backed up by agencies of the state.</p> <p>4. Do you want to influence a large or diverse number of people? Behavioural levers are much easier to refine and target than traditional ones.</p> <p>5. Is the outcome sought in the distant future, but driven by choices that occur now? As climate change campaigners are well aware, people naturally discount future consequences compared to today's costs. Behavioural levers help people make real-time decisions with better information.</p> <p>We believe that if they are backed up by constant re-evaluation, these levers will become valuable tools in the armoury of tomorrow's policymakers.</p> <p><em>Joel Bellman is director in public sector consulting at Deloitte, whose report, </em><a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/government-public-sector/acbc6c27efe3a310VgnVCM2000003356f70aRCRD.htm?utm_source=dcoukredirect&amp;utm_medium=dcoukredirect&amp;utm_campaign=frombottomup\" title=\"\"><em>Influencing citizen behaviours to achieve policy outcomes</em></a><em>, was published this month</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email </em><a href=\"mailto: public.leaders@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>public.leaders</em></a><em>.

More than that, could you break the news to a couple that their son was had been killed in a terrible war?</p> <p>That was the ethical dilemma I faced 20 years ago as a reporter, and which I recounted for followers of my blog and Twitter to see what they would have done in my shoes.</p> <p>As someone who writes about law and media ethics, I have been intrigued to see so many people criticising the ethics of journalists in recent months (if they even believe such things exist) and it occurred to me last week that it would be interesting to recreate such a situation to test people's reactions to the dilemmas I faced.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DBanksy/status/258288911049170946\" title=\"\">I tweeted a challenge</a> \u2013 follow in real time, the scenario and dilemmas I faced \u2013 what would they do in similar circumstances?</p> <p>The scenario was this: 20 years ago I was sent out on a story for the paper I worked for, the Daily Post, in Chester. A British mercenary had been killed in the fighting raging in Bosnia at the time. He had been identified in Bosnia as Fred Smith (not his real name, I didn't want his family to find the exercise in a random Google search). However, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had not been able to find his family. We knew they lived on a large estate near the office where I worked \u2013 my news desk wanted me to find them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/ethics-1-setting-the-scene/\" title=\"\">I posted the first information on my website</a> at 4pm on 17 October, and then events unfolded.</p> <p>The dilemmas came thick and fast \u2013 accept the job or not, given the family had not been officially informed? Once I had found them, should I contact the Foreign Office first, or knock on the door? And if you do go ahead and knock, what on earth do you say to a family in those circumstances?</p> <p>I left readers to offer their opinions first, before I filled them in on what I actually did that day, and the next as the story continued.</p> <p>Some were pretty blunt as to what they thought of journalists and their ethics, or lack of them. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/supremeoutcast/status/258605348699664384\" title=\"\">one suggested</a> the greatest ethical dilemma for a journalist, was the fact they are a journalist. <a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/ethics-conclusion/#comment-110\" title=\"\">Another said</a>: \"I think Journalists are as much reviled as banks these days and justifiably so.\"</p> <p>Others engaged fully with the exercise \u2013 guessing what they would have done on the doorstep, what would they have done when the man's mother invited them in and talked openly about her son's life and why he went to fight in Bosnia.</p> <p>Many left <a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/ethics-conclusion/#comment-98\" title=\"\">thoughtful and detailed responses</a> about how they would have coped, or struggled, with that situation. It caught the eye of a few academic followers and I dare say it might crop up in a few ethics exercises on journalism degrees next semester. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tabloidtroll/status/258651374445813760\" title=\"\">One veteran hack</a> said he found it more gripping than some of the stories he had worked on.</p> <p>Some suggested that they would have backed off and told the FCO once they had found the house, and waited for the family to be informed. But that was not the choice I faced, with the national \"pack\" pursuing this story, it was me or a competitor that would break the news.</p> <p>I am not for one moment saying I did everything right back then, there are some things I would do differently now, <a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/ethics-a-few-final-thoughts/\" title=\"\">as I explained</a>. What I was trying to do was give a little insight into the sort of very complicated jobs journalists sometimes face and the decisions we have to make with deadlines and competitors looming.</p> <p>I have always said that journalism is pretty simple \u2013 find a story, and tell it well. It's doing it that's hard, and that was one of the hardest stories I ever did. If you think you could have done better, <a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/ethics-1-setting-the-scene/\" title=\"\">start here</a>, work your way up, and tell me what you would have done differently.</p> <p><a href=\"http://davidbanksmedialaw.wordpress.com/about/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>David Banks</em></strong></a><strong><em> is a journalist and media law consultant</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>The shooting of schoolgirl <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a> by the Taliban in Pakistan shed renewed attention on the plight of women in this corner of the world. Malala survived, thankfully, and is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/15/pakistani-schoolgirl-taliban-uk-treatment\" title=\"\">now in the UK receiving treatment</a>. But across the border in Afghanistan, many women are beaten, raped and executed.</p> <p>Even a decade after the fall of the Taliban \u2013 during which \u00a330bn has been spent on aid to Afghanistan \u2013 the freedom and rights of Afghan women are under grave threat.</p> <p>UK aid has achieved much in Afghanistan. Millions of children are now in school, markets are bustling, and the government has shown some important improvements in their ability to deliver services. But the UK parliament's international development committee, which I chair, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/25/afghanistan-viable-state-flawed-ambition\" title=\"\">published a report on Thursday</a> identifying the status of women as the key determinant of how much has changed in Afghanistan and what the UK government could and should do to maintain the gains that have been made.</p> <p>Afghanistan remains one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-women-afghanistan-india\" title=\"\">worst places in the world to be a woman</a>. Although great progress has been made in improving the rights of women \u2013 notably bringing down maternal mortality and getting girls into school in the early years \u2013 these gains are under threat.</p> <p>While some have argued that the Taliban have softened their stance on women, recent developments suggest otherwise. The Taliban are a divided force, with some wanting to be part of change while others maintain a hardline stance forcing school closures and worse. Students in Kandahar were forced to watch as their teacher and headteacher were executed for ignoring Taliban orders to stop educating girls.</p> <p>But it's not just the Taliban that are the problem. In March, President Hamid Karzai endorsed a statement from clerics that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/06/hamid-karzai-afghanistan-womens-rights\" title=\"\">allowed husbands to beat their wives</a> under certain circumstances. A shocking <a href=\"http://www.globalrights.org/site/DocServer/final_DVR_JUNE_16.pdf?docID=9803\" title=\"\">87% of Afghan women will suffer domestic abuse in their lifetime</a> (pdf). Those who fight back are often punished for their extraordinary courage. Hundreds of women have been locked in Afghan jails for \"moral\" crimes, such as running away from home after being beaten or raped. Female politicians, doctors, teachers and activists are increasingly under attack. This year, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission warned that there has been a <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/afghanistan-honourkilling-idINDEE8630DN20120704\" title=\"\">sharp rise in so-called \"honour\" killings</a> and violent attacks on women and girls.</p> <p>At the same time women have told us they are determined that the gains in educational and employment opportunities will be defended. We were also given evidence that a growing minority of men recognise the benefits of having educated wives and daughters.</p> <p>These brave women and girls deserve our full and unflagging support. But it is unclear how DfID delivers this. We could only find two projects funded by UK taxpayers \u2013 out of nearly 100 \u2013 that have a direct and explicit focus on women and girls. More must be spent in ways that work to secure their future, such as projects focused on education and economic opportunities as well as domestic violence shelters and support for female police and lawyers to help victims of violence.</p> <p>Elections for the next president in 2014, and for parliament in 2015, will be critical to securing Afghanistan's future. Karzai cannot stand again and it is unclear who will succeed him. Women comprise more than a quarter of elected politicians \u2013 more than in many of the world's most developed democracies \u2013 but how many will be willing to risk their lives to run for office the next time around?</p> <p>Women have been all but excluded from fledgling political talks, and many fear their freedom will be traded away in a deal with the Taliban.</p> <p>Many British soldiers have died or been injured in the attempt to give Afghanistan a better future. The treatment of women after troops pull out in 2014 will be the litmus test of whether we have succeeded in improving the lives of ordinary Afghans. Even after the soldiers leave, we can and must do more to support them. The new DfID secretary, Justine Greening, and David Cameron, the prime minister, have a real opportunity to combat violence and discrimination against women in Afghanistan by making help for women a real focus of UK aid.</p>",

  "<p>Mortgage lenders will be forced to verify would-be borrowers' incomes and check there is a credible repayment plan in place if they apply for an interest-only mortgage under rules the City regulator says will \"hard-wire common sense into the mortgage market\".</p> <p>From April 2014, anyone applying for a new home loan will be expected to prove how much they earn rather than the lender simply asking them to state their salary. At the same time, lenders will be expected to be able to demonstrate that a borrower can afford mortgage repayments after paying tax and their regular household bills, and will only be able to grant interest-only loans if a borrower has a clear repayment plan in place.</p> <p>The rules, outlined by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) following a three-year review of the mortgage market, are designed to stop borrowers taking on loans they cannot afford.</p> <p>As well as rules on lending they also deal with mortgage advice, and state that in future all borrowers who apply for a loan via a branch or phone will be required to take advice on their choice of loan, unless they earn more than \u00a3300,000 or work in the mortgage industry.</p> <p>The changes will sound the death knell for self-certification mortgages, which allowed borrowers to take out loans based on a stated income that went unchecked by lenders. These were popular in the property boom years and although designed to help self-employed borrowers without a complete set of accounts were misused by some who wanted to maximise how much they could borrow.</p> <p>They will also have an impact on older borrowers who will need to be able to prove they can afford repayments after they have finished work, although the regulator did not, as was suggested in some quarters, recommend an age limit on lending.</p> <p>\"Contrary to some reports the over-50s won't be 'banned' from getting a mortgage under the new rules. Consumers will, however, be faced with more detailed questions and the need to demonstrate they can afford a loan \u2013 the application process may also take rather longer than it does today,\" said Paul Broadhead, head of mortgage policy at the Building Societies Association.</p> <p>Broadhead said the rules were \"sensible\" and the FSA had \"been very careful to keep the market open for self-employed borrowers and first-time buyers\". However, he warned that lenders would need to be reassured about how the rules would be implemented to stop them acting too cautiously towards borrowers.</p> <p>Since the FSA announced its first take on the rule changes in December 2011 lenders have started to alter criteria, with some already imposing tight restrictions on interest-only mortgages and others, like Nationwide building society and Co-op Bank, ruling them out altogether.</p> <p>Martin Wheatley, managing director of the FSA and CEO-designate of the Financial Conduct Authority which will replace it, said: \"We recognise many lenders are now using a far more sensible set of lending criteria than before, but it is important these common sense principles are hard-wired into the system to protect borrowers.</p> <p>\"We want borrowers to feel confident that poor practices of the past, which led to hardship and anxiety, are not repeated. At the heart of the new measures is an affordability test to check borrowers can meet the repayments of the mortgage they want.\"</p> <p>The FSA has addressed the issue of so-called mortgage prisoners \u2013 borrowers who are already on deals set-up on an interest-only basis or with other requirements who will not qualify for mortgages under the new rules \u2013 by telling lenders they can make exceptions for customers who need to remortgage, providing there is no increase in the outstanding amount to be repaid.</p> <p>Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith said: \"Proposals for banks to conduct an affordability test will hopefully prevent a return to the irresponsible lending of the past. But it's disgraceful that banks encouraged so many people to borrow more than they could afford without proper checks. The banks have a responsibility to help these people who are now struggling through no fault of their own.</p> <p>\"The housing market is failing not just one but two generations of consumers, with many mortgage prisoners trapped with their current lender and young people excluded from the housing market altogether.\"</p>"
