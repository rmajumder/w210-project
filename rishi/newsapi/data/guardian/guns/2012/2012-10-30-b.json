[
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good evening everyone for what, hopefully, will be an intriguing League Cup encounter. Both sides are trying to defy recent form, but only Reading are seeking to defy history. They've played Arsenal nine times in all competitions ... and lost all nine. Will tonight be any different? The bookies, who make Arsenal strong favourites, suspect not.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>So what can we expect tonight?</strong> Hopefully a decent, open, game between two strong sides. Reading played a close-to-first-XI in their 3-2 victory over QPR in the last round. Arsenal, meanwhile, have often used the early rounds of the League Cup as a debutantes' ball, introducing hot new talent into society, but their 6-1 smashing of Coventry included Olivier Giroud, Andrei Arshavin, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Andrei Santos, and only a couple of unfamiliar names - 18-year-old Swiss defender Martin Angha and 19-year-old midfielder Nico Yennaris.</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how Angha and Yennaris develop. In the past such talent (think Sebastian Larsson, Fabrice Muama, Armand Traore) has blossomed elsewhere, or not at all (think Mark Randall). Sometimes, though, a raw diamond is introduced and shines ever brighter with the passing of time: Jack Wilshere made his first starting appearance against Sheffield United as a 16-year-old back in 2008.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Er, scrub that 'hopefully two strong teams' bit. Arsenal's side is weaker than I expected. They've made 11 changes to the team that sneaked past QPR at the weekend. Heck, even Marouane Chamakh starts. Reading's side is watered-down too, with six changes to the side that drew 3-3 with Fulham.</p> <p><strong>Reading:</strong> Federici; Gunter, Gorkss, Morrison, Shorey; McCleary, Leigertwood, Tabb, Robson-Kanu; Hunt, Roberts. <strong>Subs:</strong> Taylor, Harte, Pearce, McAnuff, Church, Le Fondre, Pogrebnyak.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Martinez; Jenkinson, Djourou, Miquel, Koscielny; Frimpong, Coquelin; Walcott, Arshavin, Gnabry; Chamakh. <strong>Subs:</strong> Shea, Yennaris, Squillaci, Bellerin, Eisfeld, Meade, Giroud.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>We're off!</strong> Just so you know, while I'll be focusing mostly on this game I will be posting scores on the other Capital One matches too. Meanwhile Ryan Dunne writes: \"Must say, I'm surprised to see you in the MBM hot seat tonight; thought there'd be like a reserve squad of MBM officiators, ready to take their chance in the diddy games and show their boss what they can do! It's easy to diss the League Cup (here in Scotland, our League Cup used to have genuine gravitas when the Glorious Glasgow Rangers and the Forces of Darkness were both gunning for feasible trebles) but I don't think Capitol are <a href=\"http://www.capitalonecup.co.uk/competition/history/index.aspx\">helping themselves with this official history</a>. Highlights include 'In 1981, The League Cup had become the first major Cup competition to bear the name of a sponsor - The Milk Cup - following a ground-breaking deal with the Dairy Council'.\" That's a zinger, all right.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Not a great start for the 17-year-old Gnarby, whose first touch is heavier than Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power. Reading then go up the pitch but a corner comes to nothing. They're again on the attack here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> Another corner, and a chance for Reading! Morrison's header clatters the post, bounces off Martinez and Arsenal clear. The home side have started well; Arsenal are strangely woozy.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> No goals anywhere yet. \"Weren't Wolves fined a couple of years ago for fielding a weakened side at Old Trafford in a league match?\" asks Simon McMahon. Indeed they were. \u00a325k if memory serves. \"I take it the same rules don't apply in this competition. It's an old debate, I know, but what is to be done about the League Cup?\" Answers please via email.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min</strong> A wonderful long ball from Frimpong spheres over Reading's central defenders and into Walcott's path. But he's unable to drag it down and Reading clear for a corner, which comes to zip.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Save from Martinez! Roberts tips it to Tabb, who then slaloms into the box before having his shot blocked at close range. The Arsenal keeper then nearly undoes his good work, flapping like a James at a corner, but the referee awards an undeserved free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Arshavin attempts the classic Arsenal near-post corner: chip, flick on, bundle home from 0.25 yards. But Morrison gets ahead of Djourou and Reading clear. We've had six corners already. Six! In 11 minutes!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong> GOAL! Reading 1-0 Arsenal (Roberts 12) </strong> Lovely goal by Jason Roberts gives Reading a deserved lead. Arshavin gives it away to Hunt, who plays it out to Robson-Kanu on the left. His cross is A1 perfect and Roberts volleys it in from very close range.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> It's till 0-0 in all the other League Cup games. \"Since you are allowed to comment on other matches, so will I,\" says Bryan Tisinger. \"Bent can't even get a start in the league cup for Aston Villa. What are the chances he goes to Liverpool in the January transfer window? 98.6%? 99.999%? Can the Premier League just open a special one-minute transfer window to get that deal done now? Or is Bent not a 'Rodgers type' player and I am totally off the mark here?\" Would be surprised if it happened Bryan: Bent is good running onto the ball, or when he is played in, but he is much less effective when he has his back to goal or linking up play.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Reading are still on the attack. They've been very impressive so far and have just won a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> ... which comes to nothing. \"The Milk Cup deal did spawn <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieK7b4KLL4\">this classic</a>, points my colleague Philip Cornwall, quite correctly.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL! 18 min: Reading 2-0 Arsenal (Koscielny 18)</strong> Oh dear oh dear. Gunter crosses from the byline, Koscielny stabs it towards his own goal, and it beats Martinez. What is it about Koscielny and own goals in the League Cup?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 3-0 Arsenal (Leigertwood 20) </strong> Incredible! <em>Another</em> Reading goal! After another corner, Leigertwood shoots from just inside the area but Martinez - instead of palming it clear - punches it into his net. An awful mistake that. At the Arsenal AGM last week, Arsene Wenger made it clear that the League Cup was fifth on his list of priorities. Their performance tonight is making that clear.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Arsenal have been shocking so far. This a young team but they should be doing better than this. Sleeping zombies have shown more life than this.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Arshavin tries to thread in Walcott. He fails. The Arsenal fans are in good voice, mind, they're singing: \"We're love you Arsenal, we do.\" The players aren't giving much back.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Still no goals in the other League Cup games. Speaking of the League Cup, this from William Marzouk, about possible improvements. \"Leave it as is. It's a long, gruelling season and you can't expect a club to put out the same starting 11 in three, much less four different competitions, with no winter break,\" he writes. \"And it's a good chance to give playing time to emerging and out-of-favor players. Plus most clubs, recognising they are not serving up the grade A merchandise, offer cheaper tickets on League Cup night. And with the novel line ups the matches/results can be surprising. So everyone wins.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Arsenal are stroking the ball around the half-way line but Reading, who are lined up with two banks of four, are looking rock-solid.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> \"Come on Arsenal,\" cry the away fans. After more non-threatening possession an overhit pass flies into Federici's arms. \"Isn't this a curious XI that Wenger has sent out tonight?\" asks Lou Roper. \"I suppose Jenkinson and Miquel might count as 'hot new talent', but surely the rest count as never-weres (step forward Djourou, Chamakh and thug-in-chief Frimpong) and loss-leaders in the shop window (Walcott and Arshavin)? May I have your thoughts?\" Think that's harsh on Frimpong, Lou. And Walcott still has plenty of admirers, although I'm not always convinced. The rest, yes.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> Christian Benteke has put Aston Villa 1-0 up at Swindon. Arsenal are still giving every impression of wanting to be on the M4 back to London.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> Tony Adams is watching this from the stands. His look is mod and dandy; his countenance is anything but. Arsene Wenger and Steve Bould also look like they're sucking pickled eggs on the sidelines.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Michael Tonge has put Leeds 1-0 up against Southampton. The Reading fans are now ole'ing their team.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 4-0 Arsenal (Hunt 37)</strong> Oh dear oh dear. This is embarrassing for Arsenal. Chamakh is bundled over, but a foul isn't given, and Reading fast break. The ball goes from centre to right to centre - and Noel Hunt headers it home!</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> McDonald has put Middlesborough 1-0 up away at Sunderland. Meanwhile Dave Briggs writes: \"One thing I don't understand about this Arsenal line-up is why Wenger isn't giving Walcott a run out down the centre. After all, Walcott is always saying he wants to play there, and the manager isn't likely to learn anything new about Chamakh tonight, is he?\" True. But that's a side issue here: Arsenal have been <em>dreadful</em> everywhere.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> Agbonlahor has put Aston Villa 2-0 up at Swindon. \"Arsenal want to be on the M4 back to London?\" asks Robin Hazlehurst. \"But surely they'd prefer to fly? Reading is pretty close to Heathrow isn't it, they could fly to there from one of the London airports. Isn't that how they travel these days?\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> Chamakh, for the first time tonight, shows something that suggests he's not just hoovering up a monthly pay-cheque. He holds off his marker but his shot from a narrow angle is easily saved by Federici.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Some fun and games in the Reading penalty area ends with Frimpong smashing it over the bar. \"Isn't Tony Adams sitting by Lofty from Eastenders?\" asks Steve Waterhouse. Indeed he is Steve. \"Shocking that Gooners are leaving already.\" You'd think they'd give it till 60 minutes at least - getting away from the Madjeski is a bugger but still ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> We'll have two minutes of injury time.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 4-1 Arsenal (Walcott 45+2)</strong> Walcott squeezes in between two defenders, Arshavin slides an excellent pass, and the Arsenal striker dinks it over the onrushing Federici. The first shoots of recovery?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Well, that was interesting. Arsenal have been so poor - shockingly so in fact, like a routed army in battle - but they've just got a sniff here.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> We're off again. \"I just don't get the need for teams to prioritize the way they do,\" says Espen Bommen. \"Back in the 70s and 80s players' pre-match meals were a pint and a Mars bar, and post-match a stop at the local chippy, pitches in January resembled mud baths and you played 42 league games, yet teams seemed to have no problem starting their best 11 every game, league or cup. I know the game is faster these days, but supposedly the players are way fitter too. I might have some slight sympathy for teams involved in Europe, but there's no way that two months into the season players are so tired they need a break.\" Didn't Liverpool once win the league with 14 players? QPR have used 37 in the Premier League this year. And Spurs 36.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> Martinez unconvincingly pushes away Hunt's header before Miguel nearly heads it into his own net. And somewhere in the mix Chamakh barges over Hunt in the box but the referee - strangely - decides it's not a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Just watched the replays of that Chamakh barge. How did the referee not give a penalty there? That would surely have been game over. The ball is in Arsenal's net again but Morrison is judged to have bumped Martinez. Arsenal have not started this half at all. They're all at sea. Awful stuff.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Should have mentioned earlier that Arsenal haven't made any changes at half time. Meanwhile my colleague Leo Benedictus writes: \"Enjoying your summary of Arsenal's thrashing. You asked for League Cup anecdotes, so I have to mention <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUYQRbGEwGY\">Tim Sherwood's volley against Chelsea in the 2002 semi-final,</a> which was - as far as I know - football's first postmodern goal.\"<br>Please explain, Leo. \"You'll see that Darren Anderton appears to be playing the ball to Teddy Sheringham on the edge of the six-yard box, in what was then English football's best known set-piece, 'the Sheringham corner'. Instead, Teddy steps out of the way and Sherwood wallops it in, thus not only scoring a set-piece, but interrogating 'the set-piece' as genre. There may of course be earlier examples I don't know about.\" Incidentally Leo knows a thing or two about post-modernism; his post-modern novel - the Afterparty - is excellent.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Chances at both ends. First Roberts skies over from 15 yards then Walcott, his legs roadrunning clear of Reading's defenders, hits the post. The first signs of life from Arsenal this half.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> I'm not sure if Gnarby knows what he's doing when he jiggles into the box but he keeps his composure and his cross <em>just</em> misses the far post. Meanwhile Chamakh shows more energy than he has in two seasons after appealing a Gunter handball in the box which isn't given. Arsenal should have had a penalty there - and Reading possibly a red card. No wonder Chamakh is enraged and, after ranting at the linesman, is booked for his troubles.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Better this from Arsenal. Jenkinson's cross is met by Walcott, who slides it wide. Looking at the replays of the Chamakh incident, I reckon the Arsenal striker fouled first there.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> How's this for postmodernism? \"I'm an Arsenal fan who actually left before getting to the game,\" says Joe Chapman. \"I was stuck on the M4 so long the game had begun by the time I reached Junction 11. Seeing the massive queue from there to the ground I decided to cut my losses - not much point spending \u00a38 at the car park to go and see a half of a match that only cost \u00a315 - so turned round and came home. Just got in to see the latest score.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Arsenal are having the better of this at the moment, but they don't look like they're going to score three goals in the next 30 minutes. \"I don't mind clubs playing weakened teams but they should announce that intention at the start of the competition and charge reduced (much reduced) prices,\" says Gary Naylor, climbing on his high chair. \"And let the sponsors know too.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Arsenal subs: Frimpong off, Giroud on and Gnarby off, Eisfeld on. \"It was Villa that won the league with 14 players in 1981,\" says Lavinia Bodisco. \"Although I don't expect you to correct this error as most journos still prefer to believe Ipswich won the league that season.\" Consider it corrected.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 4-2 Arsenal (Giroud 65) </strong> What a header from Giroud, who - going backwards - steers a header from Walcott's thunderbolt corner into the top corner from eight yards. This is very interesting now.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> The Arsenal fans have recovered their voices, and their team has found its spirit. They're dominating now. \"Re Espen's point: Spurs did the Double with 16 players,\" points out my colleague Kevin Mitchell. \"And how I am loving this match.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> Possession stats for the last 10 minutes: Reading 39%, Arsenal 61%. \"After careful consideration I've finally come up with a solution about what to do with the League Cup,\" says Simon McMahon. \"It should be rebranded as the 'League League' and played in a league format with 23 groups of four; home and away fixtures, with group winners and the nine best runners up qualifying for the second league phase comprising eight groups of four, home and away, top two from each group qualifying for the knockout phase. The third place teams from the second group stage parachute into the FA Trophy. Just add TV coverage and a theme tune.\" Sounds like the old Champions League format.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Arsenal continue to probe, but while the drive is back the precision is still a bit wonky. Liegertwood picks up a yellow card for sliding down Eisfeld. Arsenal have a free-kick, 25-yards out ...</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Walcott steps up ... and sidefoots it high over the bar. \"This isn't something that hasn't been said before,\" says Kelvin Goodson. \"But Chamakh looks like malnourished, half-drowned rodent has crawled onto his head, seeking solace at height and hoping to dry out in the floodlights.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Giroud nearly scores again! His 20-yard trundler is pushed away from Federici. \"It's a paradox but the fitter the players are, the more rest they need to avoid injury,\" suggests Gary Naylor. \"They're like Frankel now, when they used to be like a carthorse. They should be able to deal with 60-odd matches in a season, but it's plain that they can't.\"</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Reading subs: McAnuff and Pogrebnyak on, Hunt and McCleary off. Reading are hoping to tighten things up here, but Arsenal have a free-kick 25 yards and central. Giroud steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> ... and clatters his shot into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Arsenal, who have been a million times better than they were in the first half, zoom forward again but Eisfeld's shot isn't close. You sense they need a goal in the next five minutes to make this a grandstand finish ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> And it nearly came there! Giroud's diving header is pushed away brilliantly by Federici. Giroud then picks up a yellow for a late challenge.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Swindon have pulled one back against Aston Villa. They're now 1-2 down. Meanwhile a rare foray forward by Reading ends with a header over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Another close-run thing for Giroud! Chamakh flicks on Walcott's corner, but it evades Giroud, who is loitering in the six-yard box, by <em>this</em> much.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Miles Storey, an 18-year-old who made his debut at the weekend, has just scored his second goal in three minutes to make it Swindon 2-2 Villa!</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Reading have looked 13th-century-castle-door solid since they brought on the subs. Are they going to see this out now? \"Tell Simon McMahon that the format he describes is called the Europa t,\" says Anthony O'Connell. \"Imagine if Arsenal had to play in that, they'd play the kids of the kids!\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Another Arsenal corner is headed clear. Cue cheers from Reading fans, who can see the finishing line in sight.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Arsenal are playing with four up front here and when Roberts buzzes clear Koscielny cynically brings him down. Yellow card!</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Shorey's free-kick is saved, unconvincingly, by Martinez at the second attempt. \"So Arsenal fans are now putting their faith in Giroud to save the day?\" says Matt Dony. \"The Capitol One Cup is weird.\" He's been excellent since he came on, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 4-3 Arsenal (Koscielny 89)</strong> The unmarked Koscielny scores from a corner from six yards out! They couldn't, could they?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Koscielny should have got a second yellow card there for bundling over Roberts. We'll have four minutes of extra time. Time for an equaliser?</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> So close! After a twiddling run, this way and that, Walcott misses by inches. It gets a deflection so Arsenal will have a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90+3 min</strong> ... Reading clear it though and they're now on the attack. Meanwhile Villa are now 3-2 up against Swindon.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90+4 min</strong> Reading sub: the excellent Roberts off, Church on. Reading are trying to kill the game here.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>GOAL! UNBELIEVABLE! WALCOTT HAS SCORED AN EQUALISER! </strong> That's Reading 4-4 Arsenal (Jenkinson 90+6). After two minutes of extra injury time - making it six minutes in total - Arsenal equalise! Walcott shot hits Shorey's hand and it goes over the line but the assistant referee isn't giving it ... until Jenkinson makes sure by thumping home. So I suppose that's his goal. Incredible scenes. Giroud throws his shirt into the crowd before realising he still needs it. Extra time it is!</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>Full time</strong> Peep Peep! Well I hoped for a decent and open game in my preamble - and we got that and more. Arsenal fans will wonder why their team didn't show up for the opening 44 minutes; Reading supporters will wonder how they threw that away. Still, there's all to play for.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>ET 1 min</strong> Everyone drawn breath? Good, because we're off again.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>ET 2 min</strong> Great run from McAnuff - and superb save from Martinez. Meanwhile Simon McMahon asks: \"Wonder what mbm reader Joe Chapman, who left the game before he even arrived (34 min), is thinking now?\" Well, Joe?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>ET 4 min</strong> Two good chances for Arsenal; and two hopeless finishes. First Eisfield ends a Brylcreem-slick passing move by fluffing his lines, then Arshavin toe-pokes it into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>ET 5 min</strong> This remains crazily open. Both teams are going for it, and damn the consequences. Arsenal are persisting with 4-2-4. \"Sitting here in Providence RI, USA, and you must have heard me in Reading when Walcott goal went in!\" says Paul Janaway.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>ET 7 min</strong> Morrison heads Shorey's header over the bar. It was a half chance at best, mind. \"A Reading fan in the pub I'm in has just lost his marbles, ranting: 'Five minutes! Big club additional time. Why bother supporting a small club? What's the point, let's all just raffle the names of everyone in the country and get them to support one of the big clubs, and then just have six teams play in a six team league',\" says Owen Cameron. \"It's kind of like Michael Douglas in Falling Down. I hope he doesn't have a gun.\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>ET 9 min</strong> This game is yo-yoing more than an 80s hipster. Walcott's corner evades Djourou at the back post and Reading clear.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>ET 11 min</strong> The gaps are everywhere and Walcott is in his element. He pings over a decent cross but there's nobody in the box to finish it. \"Can someone find that bloke who walked out at 4-0 so we can hear why he thinks getting in his car after 34 minutes was the right decision?\" asks Bassim.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>ET 12 min</strong> A lull. It won't last.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 4-5 Arsenal (Chamakh 103)</strong> Another miracle! Chamahk has scored! And it was a pearler too, through Gorkss legs and into the bottom corner. Incredible. Absolutely incredible.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>ET 15 min</strong> Arsenal fans are singing about them being the greatest team the world has ever seen. Meanwhile Miquel is being treated for cramp. \"I really can't believe that I'm a Reading fan at all,\" says Asher Klein in Chicago. \"Yet here I am, sodden in my own tears. Are there any others? Why?\" Why. Indeed. Isn't that what we are all asking?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>ET 15 min</strong> Arsenal sub: Miquel off, Reade on. Meanwhile Joseph Chapman, who got to the outskirts of Reading before heading home because of the traffic, is back to answer suggestions that he might be gutted to have missed the game. \"Given I'd still be in traffic it's a moot point,\" he says, rather sourly.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> After three minutes of added time, the referee blows his whistle. Reading are on the ropes. Can they somehow find a way of getting back into this?</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>ET 16 min</strong> Here we go again. And, almost immediately, there's nearly another goal for Walcott, who was clean through only for Federici to save! \"My house was 50 feet from flooding along the Jersey shore after Sandy hit,\" says Matt Horder. \"I'm now sitting in my living room, in the dark, generously tipsy, using the last of my phone battery to follow extra time and email you. Please give me some good arsenal news...lie if you have to.\" No need for that at the moment, Matt. And hope you and the rest of our American readers are safe and well.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>ET 17 min</strong> Now Martinez is trying to waste time with a goal kick. A little early for that, surely?</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>ET 18 min</strong> Djourou blunders into the back of Church, and Reading have a free-kick in a decent position right of centre ...</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong> ET 19 min</strong> ... Shorey's free-kick is sent goalwards by Morrison and tipped over by Martinez. Although it transpires that Morrison was offside by a gnat's width.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>ET 21 min</strong> Meade is sent spinning into the air by Sean Morrison, who picks up a yellow card for a lunging hack. That could easily have been red. \"I'm from Australia and on my way to work, thanks for the live update,\" says Ryan Cheung. \"I imagine the atmosphere will be the same for my team's (Brisbane Roar) grand final finish in 10/11 season. Went into extra time with nil all, Central Coast Mariners scored two goals really quickly. Fans started to walk away, the bloke behind me started crying. With five minutes to go, all hopes were lose when we equalised in the last mins of the game. Went into penalty kicks and the rest is history. One of the best moments in my life.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>ET 23 min</strong> The Arsenal fans are singing about Giroud, who has been a lion tonight. But Reading aren't finished yet. \"For those who deny the existence of momentum then this result is like all the other comebacks that end with a deflated team losing everything: momentum is real because players are only human,\" says Ian Copestake, who maybe angling for a place in Pseuds' Corner.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>ET 24 min</strong> Reading chairman John Madjeski loudly applauds as Martinez is booked for timewasting.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Reading 5-5 Arsenal (Pogrebnyak 115) </strong> Unbelievable! Reading are level! Arsenal are appealing for offside - and it might have just been - but Pogrebnyak's header from six yards counts.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>ET 27 min</strong> Yellow card for Eisfield. Meanwhile Arsenal are still attacking, will they be caught on the counterattack? \"This game reminds me that i grew up playing Wembley growing up and Port Vale were always in 5-5 draws,\" says Lee Woodward. \"Always knew it was realistic. You can keep your Championship Manager!\"</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>ET 28 min</strong> Not this time. And so Arsenal attack again. They couldn't, could they? They very nearly did: Giroud's skimmer only just went wide. \"Blimey,\" exhales Andrew Patch. \"I left to do the school run 4-0 down (I'm a Gooner who lives in Brisbane but from Exeter). I'm a bit confused on my return to see MBM? Are you lot having fun at my expense and in reality it is 7-0 to Reading.\" That's a long school run Andrew. Where do your kids live? Melbourne?</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>ET 29 min</strong> Reading. Arsenal. Reading. Arsenal. We'll have two minutes of extra time.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>GOAL! ARSENAL HAVE SURELY WON IT HERE! Reading 5-6 Arsenal (Walcott 120)</strong> A brilliant jinking run down the left by Arshavin, a cross, a scramble and then Walcott smashes it in from three yards.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>ET 30+1</strong> Reading are refusing to quit - a long throw is thumped clear by Arsenal. They are seconds away from an amazing victory here.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>GOAL!!!!!!!!! Reading 5-7 Arsenal (Chamakh 122)</strong> Astonishing. Simply astonishing. A terrible mistake from Gunter, who misses a simple header, gives Chamakh a one-on-one and he coolly lobs it over Federici. \"Are you sure you are not watching a Fifa 13 game on Playstation?\" asks Jeff Woodman, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME</strong> Well, what to say about that? What a game. What a recovery. Reading's players look gutted, and you can't blame them. They ripped Arsenal apart in the first half. And somehow it slowly, horribly, unraveled. On Sky Niall Quinn suggests it's the most amazing game he has ever seen. It's certainly up there. \"Nothing wrong with the League/Carling/Milk/Cap One cup at all, is there?\" suggests Brad Wilson. \"Wish more Premier League games offered such a donnybrook.\" Meanwhile Andrew Patch says: \"Precedent now set: whenever Arsenal are losing, kids are being dressed in their school uniforms and driven around Brisbane. Seeing as most games are on here at 1am the wife will be delighted.\" On Sky, Theo Walcott says: \"That wasn't the real Arsenal in the first half, but we showed our character. Hopefully we can take that into the Premier League now.\" Thanks for all your many emails. Sorry I couldn't use them all. Cheers, Sean.</p>",

That's certainly the spirit of David Cameron and George Osborne's Britain. Five years into the crisis, the British economy has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">just edged out of its third downturn</a>, but construction is still reeling from government cuts and most people's living standards are falling.</p> <p>Those at the sharp end are being hit hardest: from cuts to disability and housing benefits, tax credits and the educational maintenance allowance and now increases in council tax while NHS waiting lists are lengthening, food banks are mushrooming across the country and charities report <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/two-children-in-every-classroom-go-hungry-as-neglect-takes-its-toll-7912679.html\" title=\"\">sharp increases in the number of children going hungry</a>. All this to pay for the collapse in corporate investment and tax revenues triggered by the greatest crash since the 30s.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum though, things are going swimmingly. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/27/not-so-rich-any-more-list\" title=\"\">richest 1,000 people in Britain have seen their wealth increase by \u00a3155bn since the crisis began</a> \u2013 more than enough to pay off the whole government deficit of \u00a3119bn at a stroke. Anyone earning over \u00a31m a year can look forward to a \u00a342,000 tax cut in the spring, while firms have been rewarded with a 2% cut in corporation tax to 24%.</p> <p>Not that many of them pay anything like that, even now. The scale of tax avoidance by high-street brand multinationals has now become clear, <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/press-release-uk-uncut-demand-government-reject-lord-finks-call-for-uk-to-become-a-tax-haven-and-take-urgent-steps-to-prevent-billions-being-lost-through-tax-avoidance\" title=\"\">in no small part thanks to campaigning groups such as UK Uncut</a>.

Apple is estimated to have avoided over \u00a3550m in tax on more than \u00a32bn worth of underlying profits in Britain by channelling business through Ireland, according to a Sunday Times analysis, while Starbucks has paid no corporation tax in Britain for the last three years.</p> <p>The Tory MP and tax lawyer Charlie Elphicke estimates 19 US-owned multinationals are paying an effective tax rate of 3% on British profits, instead of the standard rate of 26%. It's all entirely legal, of course. But taken together with the multiple individual tax scams of the elite, this roll call of corporate infamy has become an intolerable scandal, when taxes are rising and jobs, benefits and pay being cut for the majority.</p> <p>Not only that, but collecting the taxes that these companies have wriggled out of would go a long way to shrinking the deficit for which working- and middle-class Britain's living standards are being sacrificed. The total tax gap between what's owed and collected has been estimated by Richard Murphy of Tax Research UK at \u00a3120bn a year: \u00a325bn in legal tax avoidance, \u00a370bn in fraudulent tax evasion and \u00a325bn in late payments.</p> <p>Revenue and Customs' own last guess of \u00a335bn has been widely recognised as a serious underestimate. But even allowing for the fact that it would never be possible to close the entire gap, those figures give a sense of what resources could be mobilised with a determined crackdown. Set them, for instance, against the \u00a383bn in cuts planned for this parliament (including \u00a318bn in welfare) \u2013 or the \u00a31.2bn estimated annual benefit fraud bill \u2013 and you get a sense of what's at stake.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne wring their hands at the \"moral repugnance\" of \"aggressive avoidance\", but are doing nothing serious about it whatever. They've been toying with a general \"anti-abuse\" principle. But it would only catch a handful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/20/jimmy-carr-tax-david-cameron\" title=\"\">of the kind of personal dodges the comedian Jimmy Carr signed up to</a>, not the massive profit-shuffling corporate giants have been dining off.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ministers are absurdly slashing the tax inspection workforce, and even introducing a new incentive for British multinationals to move their operations inbusiness to overseas tax havens. The scheme would, <a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com/channelislands/en/Documents/Budget-March-2012-commentary.pdf\" title=\"\">accountants KPMG have been advising clients</a>, offer an \"<a href=\"http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/corporation-tax-55-almost-government-approved-avoidance-44591\" title=\"\">effective UK tax rate of 5.5%</a>\" from 2014 (and cut British tax revenues into the bargain).</p> <p>It's not as if there aren't any number of measures that would plug the loopholes and slash tax avoidance and evasion. They include a general anti-avoidance principle (<a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/09/10/available-this-friday-a-genuine-general-anti-tax-avoidance-principle-for-the-uk/\" title=\"\">of the kind the Labour MP Michael Meacher has been pushing in a private member's bill</a>) that would outlaw any transaction whose primary purpose was avoidance rather than economic; minimum tax (backed even by the Conservative Elphicke); and country-by-country financial reporting, and unitary taxation, to expose transfer pricing and limit profit-siphoning.</p> <p>The latter would work better with&#xa0;international agreement. But there is already majority support in the&#xa0;European Union, and it is governments in countries such as Britain \u2013 where the City is itself a tax haven \u2013 that are&#xa0;resisting reform. When you realise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/20/hmrc-tax-avoidance-industry\" title=\"\">how&#xa0;closely the tax avoidance industry is tied up with government and drawing up tax law</a>, that's perhaps not&#xa0;so surprising.</p> <p>But when austerity and cuts are sucking demand out of the economy, fuelling poverty and joblessness and actually widening the deficit, the need to step up the pressure for corporations and the wealthy to pay their share&#xa0;as part of a wider recovery strategy couldn't be more obvious.</p> <p>The target has to shift from \"welfare scroungers\" to tax dodgers, and the campaign go national.

  "<p>Middlesbrough's fifth successive win swept Tony Mowbray's team into the quarter finals on a very bad night for Martin O'Neill and Sunderland. After an underwhelming start to the Premier League campaign, a cup exit to Championship opposition from just down the road was the last thing the Northern Irishman needed.</p> <p>Admittedly it was only Sunderland's second defeat of the season but they have won only once in the league and Saturday's home game with Aston Villa has now assumed added importance for O'Neill's shot-shy, worryingly unimaginative side. The jeers echoing in the late October air at the final whistle emphasised the need for a swift improvement.</p> <p>\"It's really disappointing,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"We didn't play well enough, we didn't deserve to go through. We didn't create enough, we weren't good enough. It's disheartening. The fans are disappointed and rightly so. We have to face up to our responsibilities. We've been deservedly booed and we have to take the criticism and pick ourselves up.\"</p> <p>Mowbray was considerably happier. \"It was a decent performance,\" he said. \"I'm delighted for my players and the supporters. I hope it's cheered people up on Teesside.\"</p> <p>Stung by slightly unscientific jibes about Sunderland supposedly being \"the most boring team in Europe\" \u2013 although, they haven't had too many shots on target so far this season \u2013 O'Neill had refreshed his starting XI.</p> <p>James McClean \u2013 reportedly homesick for Derry \u2013 began on the bench, Phil Bardsley returned at right-back, Louis Saha joined Steven Fletcher up front and St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon switched to the right wing.</p> <p>Although Sess\u00e8gnon, whose duel with Boro's talented attacking left-back George Friend was to form an absorbing sub-plot, reminded everyone of his ability by finally showing some welcome signs of life, Sunderland soon discovered Mowbray's players are no pushovers.</p> <p>Riding high in the Championship Boro arrived on a hot streak and the absence of a handful of key \"rested\" players, including Jonathan Woodgate and Marvin Emnes, did not look to have weakened them as much as might have been anticipated.</p> <p>Jason Steele, Mowbray's goalkeeper, was so well protected by Seb Hines and the formidable Andr\u00e9 Bikey that he did not have to make a significant save until the brink of half-time when he smothered Steven Fletcher's header following Adam Johnson's cross.</p> <p>By then Boro were ahead courtesy of Scott McDonald's angled sidefoot finish from inside the six-yard box after Ishmael Miller dodged Jack Colback and supplied a defence-confounding right wing cross.</p> <p>Slick on the counterattack and fluent in possession Boro had given Keiren Westwood quite a few first-half frights and deserved a lead that left Sunderland loyalists disgruntled.</p> <p>Wearsiders had expected more from their two Boro old boys \u2013 Johnson and Lee Cattermole \u2013 and were becoming quietly frustrated by the failure of Johnson, in particular, to show off the skills that made him an England international.</p> <p>O'Neill knew something needed to change and, after an hour, McClean replaced Saha as Sess\u00e8gnon switched to attack. Almost immediately Cattermole drove forward from midfield before slipping a fine pass to Sess\u00e8gnon only to see the Benin international shoot narrowly wide.</p> <p>Sunderland had begun piling on the pressure but their quest for an equaliser was regularly interrupted by those adroit Boro breaks with Miller especially fazing the home defence.</p> <p>Down in the technical area O'Neill appeared increasingly anxious and, at times, Steve Walford, his assistant, could barely bear to watch. During these interludes Walford paced in tight circles near the mouth of the tunnel with his arms tightly folded.</p> <p>Injury had forced off Hines but Bikey \u2013 now joined by a bloody-nosed Friend at the heart of the visiting backline \u2013 continued to defend in a manner slightly reminiscent of Mowbray in his central defensive pomp on Teesside back in the 1980s. Indeed the intelligent, poised manner in which Boro kept passing and moving provoked memories of the side managed by Bruce Rioch that he captained at Ayresome Park.</p> <p>Watching Westwood saving from both Faris Haroun and McDonald, and Friend shooting narrowly over, they could easily have been mistaken for the Premier League heavyweights here.</p> <p>With Johnson continuing to disappoint, O'Neill replaced him with Fraizer Campbell but it made little difference. Soon O'Neill was heading straight down the tunnel catcalls ringing in his ears, leaving Mowbray to stride towards the away end, arms aloft.</p>",
  "<p>Like the huge crane dangling precipitously above Columbus Circle in a New York City, the 2012 election has been left hanging by Hurricane Sandy, bringing the presidential campaign to a halt and silencing the chorus of polls and forecasts that had dominated the news until a few days ago.</p> <p>But while Sandy has dominated the nation's TV screens, away from the eastern seaboard it has been more like politics as usual. Both the Romney and Obama campaigns have been quietly revising their plans and plotting new strategies as the clock ticks down to polling day on 6 November, while congressional candidates have continued to grapple with their opponents in key Senate and House races around the country.</p> <p>Here's the biggest political news you may have missed while Sandy was doing its worst.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both presidential campaigns largely suspended active campaigning by their candidates</strong>, with Barack Obama staying in the White House and Mitt Romney electing to hold hybrid \"storm relief\" events with supporters instead, offering to collect donations of dry goods for those in the affected areas. But by Tuesday afternoon, as the flood waters receded on the east coast, <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/memo-pennsylvania\">the Romney campaign announced an event</a> by the Republican candidate in Florida, suggesting that it was eager to return to full-throated campaigning as soon as possible.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The biggest political move of the week may be the Romney campaign's decision to throw resources into Pennsylvania</strong>, often seen as a solidly Democratic state but one which has lately shown less enthusiasm for Obama and Bob Casey, the Democratic senator struggling for re-election. After a long silence, the pro-Romney Super Pacs Crossroads and Restore Our Future have committed millions of dollars to the state, while the Romney campaign itself has been buying ad time for the last two days before the election, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/romney-starts-reserving-time-in-pennsylvania-for-last-147690.html\">Politico reports</a>.</p> <p>While Democrats dismissed the Romney move as a head-fake, the Romney campaign points out: \"Over the past few years we have seen Pennsylvania voting for a Republican senator and a Republican governor, and Republicans win control of the state house in addition to the state senate.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Both campaigns suspended some advertising on the east coast but further inland the ad wars continued</strong>. The Romney campaign debuted an controversial attack ad in Ohio, claiming: \"Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.\" With Chrysler's Jeep production line a major employer in Toledo, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121028/POLITICS01/210280314\">fact-checkers leapt on the ad's claim</a>, and Chrysler itself released a statement: \"Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>While Obama stayed near the Rose Garden, his high-profile surrogates Bill Clinton and vice-president Joe Biden made campaign appearances in Florida and Ohio</strong>. The pair made a combined apearance in Youngstown, Ohio on Monday, and both made heavy criticism of Romney's claims about Jeep production being moved to China.<a href=\"http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/30/biden-clinton-team-up-at-ohio-campaign-stop/\"> Clinton offered his own pungent interpretation of Chrysler's response</a>: \"That's the biggest load of bull in the world that they would ever shut down American operations.\"</p> <p>Biden said the Romney claims were bizarre: \"This guy pirouettes more than a ballerina.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Minnesota may join Pennsylvania in being transformed into a battleground state during the last few days of the election campaign</strong>. Both the Obama and Romney teams had been buying advertising in the usually solid blue state but the news that <a href=\" http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/176263801.html\">Bill Clinton would campaign in the state on Tuesday</a> was a sign of Democratic nervousness. The former president attracted a crowd of 1,800 to his event at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, with a later rally planned in Duluth.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.dl-online.com/event/article/id/70854/group/homepage/\">Clinton also campaigned in Fargo, North Dakota</a>, for Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic candidate for the US Senate who is running a surprisingly strong campaign. But despite Clinton's presence, Obama was only mentioned once at the rally in the heavily Republican state.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Opinion pollsters have been hampered by the impact of Sandy</strong>, both in contacting voters in swing states directly affected and because their own call centres \u2013 concentrated in New Jersey in several cases \u2013 have been compromised by the storm. Gallup and Rasmussen both suspended their daily tracking polls for the duration of the storm. But those polls that have been done continue to show exactly what the pre-storm polls revealed: a close race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama.</p> <p>A Pew Research national poll released on Monday had Obama and Romney tied on 47%. Another national poll, for NPR, also found a presidential race tied at 47% apiece, but showed a 50%-46% advantage to Obama in the battleground states of Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Mitt Romney's previous comments about reforming or cutting Fema have been thrust into the spotlight by Sandy</strong>. In a GOP presidential primary debate, Romney appeared to say that Fema should be abolished and its funds provided to individual states or the private sector for disaster relief. Asked repeatedly by journalists to discuss Fema at his storm relief event in Ohio on Tuesday, Romney gave no response.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The closely-fought Senate election between Scott Brown and Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts suffered from Sandy, after the final debate between the two was cancelled</strong>. Two new polls this week show it continues to be a neck-and-neck contest: a Boston Globe poll on Monday had Brown moving into a slender 45%-43% lead among committed voters, while a Suffolk University poll on Tuesday has Warren leading by 53% to Brown's 46%.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Greg Barker, the climate change minister, came under fire as he tried to explain David Cameron's pledge earlier this month to force energy firms to offer customers the lowest tariff available.</p> <p>Barry Gardiner, a former Labour minister, launched an attack on Barker at a commons committee hearing, saying the climate change minister was talking \"bollocks\" when he said Cameron was outlining his \"intent, not the detail\" of plans to introduce lower energy bills.</p> <p>The irritable exchanges took place as Barker was questioned at a hearing of the energy and climate change committee about the prime minister's intervention earlier this month.</p> <p>Cameron surprised Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, when he told MPs on 17 October: \"We have encouraged people to switch, which is one of the best ways to get energy bills down. I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers \u2013 something that Labour did not do in 13 years, even though the leader of the Labour party could have done it because he had the job.\"</p> <p>Barker told the committee that the government would introduce legislation to force through the changes \"if that is required\". Of Cameron's announcement in the commons, Barker said: \"He was announcing the intent, not the detail.\"</p> <p>Andrew Wright, Ofgem's senior partner for markets, told the committee he had the same objective as the prime minister to ensure customers are informed of the lowest deals. But he said: \"We haven't seen the details [of the prime minister's proposal] yet, but hope they complement rather than conflict with ours.\"</p> <p>Barker later clarified his comments. He <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3cd7e140-229b-11e2-8edf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AoSe2HPh\" title=\"\">told the FT</a> that the government would introduce clauses in the forthcoming energy bill to guarantee that consumers are offered better deals. He said that energy companies could be obliged to offer four tariffs along the lines of the four \"core\" tariffs proposed by Ofgem. Customers would be told about the cheapest offer based on how they pay their energy bill.</p> <p>One price comparison website warned that Cameron's plan could undermine competition. Ann Robinson of uSwitch.com, said: \"Consumers will be left with Hobson's choice \u2013 there will be no spur, no choice, no innovation and no reason for consumers to engage any more.\"</p>",
  "<p>Since you have published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/28/worked-for-our-pensions\" title=\"\">letters</a> (29 October) attacking my purported views about pensioners working, perhaps you will allow me a short response. I have never suggested that pensioners should have to work. I asked questions of witnesses at a select committee which have since been widely represented as my own views. They are not, never have been and never will be. Indeed, I would be in the frontline of those defending the right of older people to make their own free choice about how they spend their time.</p> <p>I do believe however that we often undervalue the talents of older people and miss opportunities of encouraging those who wish to continue making a contribution to their communities from doing so. Why, for example, should a pensioner wishing to undertake voluntary work have to pay for their own CRB check? Volunteering helps people maintain independence while providing valuable support for others who need it. That is a world away from workfare, which I could never support.<br><strong>Michael Bichard</strong><br><em>House of Lords</em></p>",

In pointing out the compelling strategic, economic and moral arguments against Britain maintaining (let alone replacing) a nuclear weapons system, the absurdity of committing \u00a3100bn to Trident replacement is laid bare.</p> <p>But there is one further argument which needs to be made here: scrapping Trident is a vote winner \u2013 and this is something Labour and the Lib Dems must understand.</p> <p>The case must be made in no uncertain terms: would the public rather have essential services or a redundant weapons system? Do the military want usable equipment or an outmoded totem? And does the world need another hypocritical nuclear-armed state paying lip service to disarmament while ploughing billions into its nuclear arsenal?</p> <p>Domestically and internationally, Britain should be bold in rejecting nuclear weapons.

Trident's guidance system is controlled by the US, and the notion that Washington is going to allow its erstwhile colonial rulers to choose a target for such a devastating WMD is outside the realms of reality.</p> <p>The origins of this ludicrous situation go back to Trident's predecessor, Polaris, on which Harold Macmillan and his close ally John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Agreement\" title=\"\">made a deal at Nassau in 1962</a> for Britain to have a figleaf arrangement, masquerading as independent control, in order to assuage backbench Tory outrage over the US's unilateral abandonment of the Skybolt missile that was to be used in RAF bombers. Skybolt was flawed, but it would at least have been an independent system. Trident is the opposite.</p> <p>Your leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/29/nick-clegg-attacks-philip-hammond-trident\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's criticisms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/trident-miliband-brave-jump-ship\" title=\"\">Polly Toynbee's Comment piece</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2012/oct/29/philip-hammond-nick-clegg-trident?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Martin Rowson's typically brilliant cartoon</a> all missed the chance to nail the pretence that Trident is independent.<br><strong>John Webster </strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Trident is neither British nor independent, and it isn't much of a deterrent. And hardly a bargain. Evidence to the Commons defence select committee demonstrated that Trident depends crucially for launch and target acquisition data on US military GPS satnav. You can be sure that if we tried to do something the White House didn't approve, the satnav would be switched off. <br><strong>Peter Johnston</strong><br><em>Bolton, Lancashire </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In 1986, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, said: \"The accident at Chernobyl showed again what an abyss will open if nuclear war befalls mankind.\" He later said it was that accident that triggered the end of the cold war. As long as there are nuclear power stations in the world the deterrent value of nuclear weapons is illusory. In a nuclear war the real damage will be caused by uncontrollable emissions of radioactive material from nuclear reactors and their associated storage zones.</p> <p>Britain has plenty of nuclear power stations. As the prevailing winds in Britain are southwesterly, the likely victims of any attack on us will be to our east: Russia and China, the presumed objects of Trident. They have nuclear power stations, too. If Trident were ever to be used, the entire northern hemisphere would become uninhabitable. <br><strong>Craig Sams </strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Philip Hammond's go-ahead for Trident replacement (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/29/tories-lib-dems-trident?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Tories snub Lib Dems over Trident future</a>, 29 October) is just a ploy to scupper Scottish independence. It has nothing to do with being the \"ultimate safeguard for Britain's security\". The US has 14 Trident submarines and none of that killing power prevented the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Billions of pounds of public money are to be spent on a dangerous, destabilising weapon that will only increase the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br><strong>Rae Street </strong><br><em>Littleborough, Lancashire </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The government claims a replacement for Trident is necessary for the creation of high-quality jobs and vital skills. This is profoundly depressing. To believe we have to invest in weapons of destruction is to totally ignore more peaceful and constructive investments, such as securing our energy needs through renewable energy or providing zero-carbon housing, hospitals and schools. We can develop high-quality jobs through ensuring a living wage, decent working hours, protection against unfair dismissal and so many other initiatives that this government considers unnecessary.<br><strong>Jean Lambert MEP</strong><br><em>Green, London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Polly Toynbee and others should be urging Ed Miliband to make a referendum on the future of Trident a matter of Labour policy. This is an issue that concerns the kind of country (and world) we want our grandchildren to inherit; the spending priorities we want our politicians to attend to; and whether the kind of defence we want for our community needs to be quite so apocalyptic.</p> <p>The debate and discussion around such an issue would be a collective airing of both the rational and irrational, and could return democracy back to where it belongs \u2013 our peoples. It might also be a fitting tribute to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis from which, thank God, we all came through.<br><strong>John Hills</strong><br><em>Canterbury, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008When is the Labour party going to stop being frightened of its own shadow on this issue? I fear that they, like the Tories, are seduced by big toys. We deserve better.<br><strong>Alan Healey</strong><br><em>Milson, Shropshire</em></p>",
  "<p>The foundations of a spectacular Anglo-Saxon feasting hall, a place where a king and his warriors would have gathered for days of drinking and eating \u2013 as vividly described in the poem Beowulf \u2013 have been found inches below the village green of Lyminge in Kent.</p> <p>There was one last celebration by the light of flickering flames at the site, 1,300 years after the hall was abandoned, as archaeologists marked the find by picking out the outline of the hall in candles, lighting up the end-of-excavation party. Heaps of animal bones&#xa0;buried in pits around the edge of the hall bore testimony to many epic parties of the past.</p> <p>The unexpected find, by <a href=\"http://blogs.reading.ac.uk/lyminge/about-the-project/\" title=\"\">a team from the University of Reading</a> funded by the <a href=\"http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">Arts and Humanities Research Council</a> and working with local archaeologists and villagers, is exceptionally rare. Digging under the curious gaze of drinkers in the garden of the Coach and Horses pub a few metres away, it is the first great hall from the period to be discovered in more than 30 years.</p> <p>At 21 metres by 8.5 metres, it would have been the most imposing structure for miles, large enough to hold at least 60 people. Beowulf, the most famous of all surviving Anglo-Saxon poems, describes the hero coming to just such a hall, Heorot \u2013 \"the timbered hall / splendid and ornamented with gold. / The building in which that powerful man held court / Was the foremost of halls under heaven; / Its radiance shone over many lands.\"</p> <p>The director of the Lyminge excavations, Gabor Thomas, said: \"This would undoubtedly have been the scene of many Beowulfy type activities, great assemblies for feasts that lasted for days, much drinking and story-telling, rich gifts like arm rings being presented, all of that. There could have been no more visible sign of wealth and status than raising a hall like this.\"</p> <p>The royal family and retinue would have visited sporadically. \"This is before centralised tax collecting and coinage, too early for royal palaces as such,\" Thomas said. \"To keep control you had to keep on the move, stopping at significant places, literally feeding off the land, off the rich food offerings that would be brought everywhere the king arrived.\"</p> <p>Thomas believes the hall marks a crucial transition, the last flicker of the ancient pagan ways before the site was abandoned, after the hall had stood for perhaps no more than a generation.</p> <p>A rare piece of beautifully decorated and gilded horse harness, broken in antiquity, was found in the foundations. It is the first such find from a domestic setting \u2013 similar examples are isolated finds by metal detectors, or from graves \u2013 and helps date the hall to the late sixth or early seventh century.</p> <p>\"The horse harness decoration is very significant,\" Thomas said. \"It's not just a wonderful find, but evidence of the status of the people who used this site \u2013 the ability to own and upkeep a horse was the mark of the warrior aristocracy.\"</p> <p>Other finds include pieces of jewellery, bone combs, and a remarkably well preserved manicure set \u2013 three little bronze rods, probably for cleaning fingernails or ears, strung on to a piece of wire. The site also yielded quantities of glass, some evidently scavenged by the Anglo-Saxons from nearby Roman sites and melted down to make glass bead jewellery.</p> <p>Earlier excavations at various sites in the village, including the graveyard of the village church, which is said to have been founded in AD633 and to be the original burial place of St Ethelburga, uncovered evidence of thousands of years of habitation. The village is only a few miles from the Eurotunnel terminal, but is still surrounded by rich farmland, and remarkably isolated in a tangle of narrow country roads, hills and valleys.</p> <p>Last summer, when the archaeologists moved on to the village green, which has been open land for almost 1,000 years, ground-penetrating radar suggested some structures lay beneath \u2013 but there was no hint of anything as significant as the hall.</p> <p>The timbers are long gone, either rotted away or removed for reuse, but the outline of the huge building was clearly traced by post holes and the slots for planks laid horizontally to form the walls. It had a partitioned space at one end, either a sleeping place or a private chamber for the most aristocratic.</p> <p>There is evidence that the building was at least damaged, if not destroyed, by fire \u2013 a common fate for timber buildings centred around open hearths \u2013 but Gabor believes the hall was deliberately abandoned as the tribe, as with the other Anglo-Saxons in Kent, turned to Christianity. The settlement was soon abandoned, too, and a new village grew higher on the hill around the new church \u2013 another lofty building, grander than any of its neighbours, which Thomas believes took on the role of the old pagan hall as the place for gatherings and celebrations. The archaeologists will return to Lyminge next summer. \"There's more of this story,\" Thomas said.</p>",
  "<p>HBOS executives threatened and swore at colleagues who were investigating the risks being taken by the bank before it collapsed in the financial crisis, it has been claimed.</p> <p>Paul Moore, the former HBOS head of group regulatory risk who was sacked after raising concerns about the bank's management, made the claims during the latest session of the parliamentary commission on banking standards.</p> <p>\"When I tried to resolve the previous difficulties with Jo Dawson [HBOS group risk director 2004-2005 who eventually replaced Moore], she leant over the table \u2013 she stood up \u2013 pointed at me and said 'I'm warning you. Don't you make an effin' enemy out of me',\" he said.</p> <p>\"It demonstrated that if a senior executive thought it was perfectly OK to speak to the head of regulatory risk in that tone you can imagine how the culture spreads through the organisation.</p> <p>\"It didn't matter what you were doing, if your job was to check people out, there was behaviour that was threatening and unpleasant to people doing these [risk assessment] activities\".</p> <p>Moore also said that HBOS was \"worse than other environments [he'd] experienced\", that \"sales targets and bonuses [driven by former chief executive Sir James Crosby] were right at the heart\" of the bank's collapse and that the board appointed Carphone Warehouse founder Charles Dunstone as head of the retail bank's risk control committee when he had \"no technical expertise\".</p> <p>The comments are the latest from Moore on how he saw the collapse of the lender. In 2009 he told MPs he had been sacked for raising concerns about the lender's rapid growth in the years before the credit crunch while he has also submitted detailed reports to the Financial Services Authority on what went wrong. During Tuesday's appearance, he repeated many of his previous criticisms.</p> <p>After his dismissal, a report into Moore's allegations \u2013 commissioned from the bank's auditors, KPMG \u2013 concluded that he lost his job because of personality clashes inside the lender in 2004 and not that Crosby sacked him because of warnings that HBOS was \"going too fast\" and \"was a serious risk to financial stability and consumer protection\".</p> <p>Moore told the committee the accounting firm had concluded exactly what he expected. \"The KPMG report said I was a lunatic and they were right \u2013 in summary,\" he said.</p> <p>The committee also heard from Colin Matthew, the former chief executive of HBOS's international division, as well as Dawson.</p> <p>Members did not ask her about the alleged exchanges with Moore, but she told them of how \"one heard\" rumours that HBOS's corporate bank \u2013 which was largely blamed for the bank's demise \u2013 was less cautious than competitors in giving loans, although she said she had \"no ability to discern if people were jealous\".</p> <p>Dawson added: \"We had an annual management conference every year, the top 500 or so coming. In 2006, I think it would have been, Sir Philip Green came as the guest speaker and \u2026 was very positive about [the HBOS corporate bank's] understanding of business.\"</p> <p>The evidence came as the FSA prepares to kick off its own investigation into the collapse of HBOS.</p> <p>In December, the City regulator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/dec/12/royal-bank-of-scotland-fsa-report\" title=\"\">published its report into the near-collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, but had been delaying commencing its HBOS investigation until it had completed enforcement action against Peter Cummings, the former head of the bank's corporate division. Cummings was fined \u00a3500,000 and given a lifetime ban from the City in September.</p>",
  "<p>Bahrain is facing international censure after announcing a ban on all protest gatherings and threatening to take legal action against opposition groups that organise anti-government demonstrations.</p> <p>The order, announced by the interior ministry in Manama on Tuesday, is the most-far reaching attempt to quell unrest in the Gulf kingdom since martial law was imposed last year. It is a blow to the hopes of western countries trying to balance their own strategic and economic interests while encouraging peaceful reform.</p> <p>Britain swiftly issued a statement expressing \"concern\" at what it called an \"excessive\" blanket ban.</p> <p>Sheikh Rashid al-Khalifa, the interior minister, said that \"repeated abuse\" of the rights to freedom of speech and expression could no longer be tolerated. In future protests would only be permitted once security and stability were sufficient to maintain national unity.</p> <p>Bahrain, where a Sunni minority rules over a Shia majority, is often described as lying on a sectarian fault line of the Arab world and on the frontline of a tense confrontation between Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbours.</p> <p>The interior ministry said that any \"illegal rally or gathering would be tackled through legal actions against those calling for and participating in it\".</p> <p>Bahraini observers said the move appeared to reflect divisions and hesitation within the government and the lack of dialogue between it and the opposition. \"The situation is stagnant and there is no horizon for a political solution,\" said Mansoor al-Jamri, editor of al-Wasat newspaper. \"They are tightening their grip, but this is not a crackdown. That will mean mass arrests and opening the jails and taking senior people into custody.\"</p> <p>Bahrain has permitted limited protests and marches, but much of the violence occurs outside authorised gatherings.</p> <p>Bahrain's brief chapter of the Arab spring \u2013 known to activists as the \"Pearl Revolution\" \u2013 ended last March, when the Saudis and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council intervened to help restore order. But sporadic protests have continued and escalated in recent days.</p> <p>The target of the warning appeared to be the largest Shia political bloc, al-Wefaq, which has organised many marches. Another rally was planned for Friday.</p> <p>Al-Wefaq condemned the interior ministry order as breaching international law and human rights. The authorities had rejected a Wefaq request for a rally on Sunday evening at Akar, a village near the capital Manama where a bomb fatally wounded a policeman on October 18. The opposition movement then organised a licensed demonstration, but when people took to the streets, they chanted \"Down with Hamad,\" a reference to the king.</p> <p>A full crackdown on the opposition would anger the US, Britain and other western allies that have stood by the Bahraini since last year's unrest.</p> <p>The US has important military links with Bahrain, which hosts the US Navy's 5th Fleet, but it has also called for increased efforts at dialogue to ease the tensions.</p> <p>Britain has repeatedly called on Bahrain to implement the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which issued its report last year.</p> <p>\"I am concerned that the government of Bahrain has decided to ban all rallies and public gatherings until further notice,\" said Alistair Burt, the UK foreign office minister. \"We understand the government's concerns about maintaining law and order, especially when faced with increasingly violent protests, but a blanket ban of this nature is excessive. Peaceful protest is a democratic right. I hope the Bahraini government will rescind this measure as quickly as possible. I also call on protesters to desist from violent protest. Violent acts should be condemned publicly by prominent members in society.\"</p> <p>Shias comprise about 70% of Bahrain's 525,000 citizens, who claim they face systematic discrimination and gerrymandering of constituency boundaries.</p> <p>The monarchy has made a series of concessions, including giving more powers to the elected parliament, but opposition groups say the reforms do little to loosen the ruling family's hold on power. More than 50 people have been killed in Bahrain's unrest since February 2011.</p>",
  "<p>How do you win an MLS Cup? Well, first you have to make the playoffs. This is one of those feats that seems easy when you look at the raw numbers \u2013 19 teams set off with hope in their hearts in March and come the end of October, there are 10 left when the playoffs start. </p> <p>These are hardly daunting odds \u2013 yet just as the English Championship is a horrible league to get out of when you find yourself in it, the parity of standards structurally enforced by MLS mean that making the play-offs, and nursing a team along to peak in time for them, is an art in itself. Just ask the DC United team who won the Supporters Shield in 2007 then missed the next four playoffs before their 2012 return. Just ask Dominic Kinnear, whose Houston Dynamo went from almost last in the West in 2010 to edge into the 2011 playoffs and make a run to the final, or the Colorado Rapids side who won the whole thing in 2010 from the unpromising platform of fifth in the West.</p> <p>Clearly, just making the playoffs is not enough \u2013 you also need momentum. Those Colorado and Houston sides had it, so who has it this year? </p> <p>On results, if not form, you could do worse than an outside look at DC United, who have ground their way back from Dwayne De Rosario's season-ending injury to finish second in the East, or of course San Jose Earthquakes, who were Supporters Shield winners having led from the front for most of the year and who have goalscorer Chris Wondolowski concluding a career year on top form. Sporting Kansas City won an Open Cup this year and Peter Vermes and the No1 Eastern seeds feel they know how to win now. </p> <p>Some other teams, with varying degrees of supporting evidence, may feel that it's just their turn \u2013 step forward the Seattle Sounders and New York Red Bulls. And of course there are the defending champions, LA Galaxy, who have a difficult fourth-placed Western seeding to negotiate but put themselves in that position with a fine second half of the season. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B8N7fGwjtOA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B8N7fGwjtOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <p>So just who can win MLS Cup? Here we consider the entrants team by team and ask who the key players will be. </p> <p>Tomorrow we'll have our usual fan previews for the wild-card games. And be sure to join us for live coverage of all the playoff games, starting with the first wild-card match on Wednesday night, as <strong>Chicago Fire take on Houston Dynamo. Our coverage starts around 8.30pm</strong>. </p> <h2>MLS Cup 2012 playoffs guide</h2> <p><em>Overall seedings shown in brackets. When the finalists are determined, the highest-ranking seed will host the match.</em></p> <p><em>Wild-card games are one-off games played at the higher-seeded team's stadium. Conference semi-finals and finals are played over a home-and-road series. In the event of an aggregate tie the second game, played at the higher seed's stadium, will go to extra time and penalties if necessary.</em></p> <h2>Eastern Conference</h2> <p>Wild card (single game): Chicago Fire v Houston Dynamo </p> <p>Semi-final (two legs): Sporting Kansas City v Chicago or Houston; DC United v New York Red Bulls</p> <h2>1. Sporting Kansas City (2)</h2> <p><em>Will play either Chicago Fire or Houston Dynamo in the Eastern Conference semi-final. First leg is on Saturday afternoon.</em></p> <p>For seven games this season it looked as if Sporting KC were going to run away with the Eastern conference, as they made a perfect start. Then a Chance Myers own-goal undid them at Portland and they began to look vulnerable. But when I spoke to Peter Vermes last month, he emphasized that he had built this team around individuals who would \"bend but not break\", and as the season unfolded so it proved. Sporting had setbacks to deal with but remained fundamentally resilient in the face of the surging and waning form of those around them in the East.</p> <p>An Open Cup win got them started on the process of \"painting the wall\" at their new stadium and gave the team belief, but Vermes said that the big game that made this side was not that win so much as last season's Eastern Conference final defeat by Houston. </p> <p>Sporting will be tough for any opponent \u2013 they press and harry from the front, with Kei Kamara and Graham Zusi pressing and swapping sides to give defenders nightmares, and Roger Espinoza dominating midfield. When they impose themselves they are especially adept at bringing the fullbacks Chance Myers and Seth Sinovic forward and flooding the midfield to overwhelm teams, while Jimmy Nielsen had another rock-solid season in goal. If CJ Sapong can get among the goals consistently, they'll take some stopping.</p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> When Sporting have failed to impose themselves early and opponents have pushed them back, Jimmy Nielsen has kept his team in games singlehandedly. Aur\u00e9lien Colin's value at the heart of defense is very apparent when he's not there. Graham Zusi's dead balls are very dangerous, and he's taken another leap in his progress this year. But <strong>Kei Kamara</strong> is unplayable on his day, and it will be great to see him grace the playoffs. </p> <h2>2. DC United (3)</h2> <p><em>Will play New York Red Bulls in Eastern Conference semi-final. First leg is in New York on Saturday night.</em></p> <p>Two seasons ago, DC finished rock bottom of the East. Last season they missed out on the playoffs with a heartbreaking falter on the run-in. So when Dwayne De Rosario, team talisman and creative force, went down with a season-ending injury a few weeks ago, everyone prepared to avert their eyes from the sight of one of the first great MLS teams falling apart, as per recent history. Instead, Ben Olsen's team seemed to relish the task that faced them and in the spirit of their coach got back to basics. It was rather too basic for some purists' tastes but whether winning ugly or not, DC tightened their defense and found a way to get the job done, including last weekend in Chicago when they came from behind to earn the draw that relegated their hosts to the wild-card game.</p> <p>DC's reward is a semi-final against rivals New York, which if previous encounters this season are anything to go by will mean goals. The teams have shared 14 in their three encounters, though the run that has carried DC into the third overall seeding was not built on free-scoring exploits, so it will be interesting to see if United stick or twist. Regardless, it's possible we'll have a treat of a semi-final series that either side will then struggle to match in the following round. </p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> <strong>Bill Hamid</strong>. It would probably have been DeRo and Chris Pontius will be key in the games against New York, since he loves scoring against them; it might also be worth keeping a sly eye out for the supersub Lewis Neal. But Hamid's goalkeeping kept his side in the game against Chicago and if his side are to go deep in the playoffs there's going to be at least one tight game in which DC will need him to come up big.</p> <h2>3. New York Red Bulls (4)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398585744\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/17/1347839168508/3d97e21d-29aa-451b-9732-b481394fc5f6-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Thierry Henry Tim Cahill New York Red Bulls MLS\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thierry Henry and Tim Cahill are central to the playoff hopes of the New York Red Bulls.

First leg is in New York on Saturday night.</em></p> <p>Points-wise, this was New York Red Bulls' best year, exceeding their 2010 Eastern conference-winning total by six. Kenny Cooper's 18 goals were just one shy of Juan Pablo Angel's single-season club record, while Thierry Henry had 15 goals and rather more tellingly, 12 assists \u2013 when the Red Bulls are clicking offensively, everything goes through the Frenchman. </p> <p>When they're clicking defensively \u2013 an aim that has been the subject of much alchemical speculation by the coaching staff this year \u2013 Dax McCarty has been somewhere in the mix. As a defensive midfielder McCarty was a revelation earlier in the season \u2013 so much so that even with the arrival of Tim Cahill and the returns of Teemu Tainio and Rafa Marquez, a place had to be found for their less illustrious colleague. At the moment it's on the wing, which doesn't necessarily play to New York's strengths or address their big weakness \u2013 speed. With Dane Richards gone to Vancouver and his putative replacement, Lloyd Sam, out for the season, on a bad day New York look ponderous.</p> <p>On a good day, though, they have more expensively-assembled skill in their squad than most teams and have been able to pass their way to fourth-place overall. What Hans Backe needs to do is make those good days appear against the league's better sides more consistently. Backe is supposedly living on borrowed time as coach since the departure of sporting director Eric Soler a few weeks ago, though in truth the clock has been ticking throughout his third year in charge, if not since his arrival. When we met in pre-season, Backe said of the upcoming year: \"It's time to win a trophy.\" New York's fans and owners would agree.</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> It would be perverse to go for anyone other than <strong>Thierry Henry</strong>. When he's on form, New York score goals and the side is built around maximizing his contribution. They also may need Kenny Cooper to keep scoring, Tim Cahill to turn finding-his-feet performances into dominant ones and Rafa Marquez to continue with the composed if not speedy performances he's been turning in at the heart of defense recently. (Not getting sent off for instigating a mass brawl in this year's semi-final would also help.) But Henry is the key.</p> <h2>4. Chicago Fire (6)</h2> <p><em>Will host Houston Dynamo in a wild-card game on Wednesday night. Winners will face Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference semi-final, with the first leg on Saturday afternoon.</em></p> <p>If this Eastern season were a 1500m race, Houston would be the side that kicked for home too early on the back straight, while Chicago would be the side that glided past them with 200m to go, only to find, in a panic, that the afterburners weren't there in the home stretch. </p> <p>As summer turned to fall, the Fire roared into contention in the East, after a mid-season overhaul by Frank Klopas that brought back home-town hero Chris Rolfe, introduced Alex and Macdonald and, the disappointing Fernandez aside, saw his attack actually make net gains after Marco Pappa's departure. Then with the end and possibly even an Eastern top seeding in sight, the Fire began to sputter \u2013 the nadir being a loss to a New England side long finished as a competitive concern. A home draw with DC on the last day allowed New York to edge the Fire out of the semi-final places.</p> <p>Despite missing out on a \"medal\" position, Chicago can still knock the other contenders out and over two legs they can cause anyone problems. They've beaten New York home and away and Sporting Kansas City too have been exposed to what this Fire team can do when countering at speed. </p> <p>First, there's the small matter of a Halloween wild-card game against a well-rested Houston side, who should have all the tools to keep the game close, contest the midfield and ask a lot of questions. It's a game in which the Fire can ill-afford to fall behind, as they've done a little too often recently.</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> When <strong>Chris Rolfe</strong> found his feet on his return to the club, he really demonstrated what they'd been missing. Patrick Nyarko and Dominick Oduro's raw speed had plundered goals early in the season, but the Fire sometimes lacked the bite and guile Rolfe brings in the final third. His game had dropped off a little recently, but if he finds his form he could be key. Also keep an eye on <strong>Arne Friedrich</strong> and Austin Berry at the back. The latter has deservedly emerged as rookie of the year frontrunner while the veteran Friedrich gave a master class in shutting down Thierry Henry as Chicago took the points in New York. With Chicago stumbling, the German's composure will be vital.</p> <h2>5. Houston Dynamo (9)</h2> <p><em>Will travel to Chicago Fire in a one-off wild-card game on Wednesday night. Winner will face Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference semi-final, with the first leg taking place on Saturday afternoon.</em></p> <p>In 2010, New York opened a new stadium and rode their home form to top the Eastern conference. In 2011 Sporting Kansas City did the same. In 2012 Houston opened their new stadium and all the omens were there for a repeat. Just as Sporting had done the previous season, the Dynamo front-loaded their schedule with road trips then entered their new home knowing that not only would they play the balance of their remaining games at home, but would do so largely against eastern opposition. </p> <p>That was coupled with Dominic Kinnear's overhaul of the side from a 4-4-2 outfit dependent on the talented but young Will Bruin and the effective but aging Brian Ching into a technically efficient 4-3-3 built around the inventiveness of Boniek Garcia and the heart of the team, Brad Davis. The system gelled quickly as Houston went on a run at the end of summer, only to falter in the fall. They finished the regular season glad to see Columbus Crew's resurgence fall just short.</p> <p>Now they play Chicago ifor the honor of facing Sporting KC. On the negative side the game is at Toyota Park, so Houston must travel \u2013 no easy prospect in a week of national travel disruption. On the plus side, they're well rested. New York's win at Philadelphia on the final Saturday meant Houston had nothing to play for at Colorado, so Kinnear rested several starters. He knows a thing or two about preparing a side to time their run for the play-offs, does Kinnear \u2013 can he work his magic again this year?</p> <p><strong>Key player:</strong> <strong>Brad Davis</strong> is the obvious choice. When he limped out of last year's Eastern Conference final, Houston's MLS Cup hopes went with him. The team is still shaped round the captain and midfielder. The experience of Ricardo Clark and Brian Ching could be crucial too. But <strong>Macoumba Kandji</strong> is also key, in that he may be the most infuriatingly talented player in a Houston shirt. He can and does go on slaloming runs to score wonderful goals, but more often will go past three defenders at speed before shooting wide or failing to make the simple pass. The 4-3-3 should be made for Kandji and it has offered glimpses of what he can do, but it also comes with a caveat that Kandji sometimes ignores \u2013 to make it work you need your front three to defend too. If Kinnear could get the best out of a more disciplined Kandji he could yet play more than a cameo in these playoffs. </p> <h2>Western Conference</h2> <p>Wild card (single game): LA Galaxy vs Vancouver Whitecaps </p> <p>Semi-final (two legs): San Jose Earthquakes v LA or Vancouver; Real Salt Lake v Seattle Sounders</p> <h2>1. San Jose Earthquakes (1)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398585745\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/22/1348342890931/Chris-Wondolowski-of-the--010.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Wondolowski of the San Jose Earthquakes in action against Real Salt Lake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Wondolowski of the San Jose Earthquakes in action. Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><em>Will play LA Galaxy or Vancouver Whitecaps in Western Conference semi-finals, starting Sunday night</em></p> <p>The Earthquakes have been the story of the season. Most of the attention is rightly on the record-equalling 27 goals of Chris Wondolowski, ably backed by the \"Bash Brothers\" duo of Steven Lenhart and Alan Gordon \u2013 enjoying their own career years and filling the very few minor slumps in Wondolowski's goalscoring to take the attacking trio's regular-season goals total to a truly impressive 50. </p> <p>But the supply lines for the attack have been eye-catching too \u2013 Simon Dawkins has been consistently dangerous from midfield and Marvin Chavez has chipped in with 13 assists from the flanks. And looking down the San Jose roster, you see names (Rafael Baca, Steven Beitashour, Justin Morrow) who have had great years in a team exceeding the sum of their parts. </p> <p>San Jose play every game like it's a cup tie. They've scored more stoppage-time goals than any other team this year \u2013 more than a quarter of their games have featured game-changing overtime goals. One more time: \"Goonies never say die...\" </p> <p><strong>Key player:</strong> Who else? <strong>Chris Wondolowski</strong>. Twenty-seven goals, the focal point of the Earthquakes attack \u2013 coming into the playoffs, Wondo has scored five in the last three games.</p> <h2>2. Real Salt Lake (5)</h2> <p><em>Will play Seattle Sounders in Western Conference semi-finals, starting Friday night in Seattle</em></p> <p>For a team that supposedly can't score, is breaking up and is out of form, Real Salt Lake didn't do badly to finish second in the West this year. Playing under perhaps the best young coach in the league, Jason Kreis, RSL started strongly and then pushed through an indifferent summer that included a 5-0 humbling in San Jose, while trying to keep a creaking roster together for one more Concacaf Champions League campaign. </p> <p>That ended in disappointment last week, of course, and it remains to be seen just what that will have done to RSL's confidence \u2013 but for all the questions posed around this team this year, and their drops in form and goalscoring, Kreis has made the 2009 champions find ways to be competitive \u2013 they became the first side to beat LA Galaxy at home twice in one season, took all the points at Seattle and while Alvaro Saborio and Fabian Espindola have been somewhat intermittent in terms of goalscoring consistency, on their day they know how to unlock any defense.</p> <p>First up is a repeat of RSL's epic to-and-fro 2011 semi-final against Seattle. After a 3-0 victory at the Rio Tinto, RSL survived a late Seattle surge in a 2-0 loss in the return, a game memorable for Tony Beltran's wonderful headed clearance. Kreis has stuck to his principles and has been blooding young players this year. There's no doubt that he has a less experienced pool going into this series than he did in 2011, but this time RSL have the nominal advantage of playing the second leg at home... not that it did Seattle much good last year.</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> It's hard to look past Alvaro Saborio's 17 goals, but if Salt Lake are to progress they need the extra dimension of an in-form <strong>Javier Morales</strong> to pull some creative strings in the midfield.</p> <h2>3. Seattle Sounders (7)</h2> <p><em>Will play Real Salt Lake in Western Conference semi-final, starting Friday night in Seattle</em></p> <p>It seems like every year the Sounders come into the MLS playoffs tipped to win it all, and every year they fall short. Will it be different this year? Well, first Santos in the CCL quarter finals and then Sporting KC in the Sounders' beloved Open Cup have narrowed the prospects for a glittering season down to MLS Cup or bust, so Seattle have an incentive to correct the mistakes of the past.</p> <p>Key to that will be an emphatic performance in Friday's first leg semi-final game against Real Salt Lake \u2013 hopefully with Eddie Johnson on the field. The club-record 14-goal man pulled up feeling his hamstring in the final game of the regular season, in LA, and came off the field, supposedly as a precaution. Johnson is a big part of Seattle's offensive armory, alongside perennial favorite Fredy Montero. Behind them, the summer arrival of Christian Tiffert has firmed up the supply lines to the strikers and Mauro Rosales and the returning Steve Zakuani give a multi-dimensional nature to the attack. The question is whether all these moving parts can combine to negotiate their way through the playoffs against more integrated teams.</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> <strong>Michael Gspurning</strong>. Yes the strikers are vital, but the defense may be the key for the Sounders. Replacing Kasey Keller in goal was always going to be a huge ask, but Gspurning has truly looked the part and it's no coincidence that Seattle's worst spell of the year coincided with his absence through injury. If Gspurning and the hard tackling of Osvaldo Alonso can give Seattle a strong defensive platform, the Sounders will fancy their chances of getting the goals they need to progress.</p> <h2>4. Los Angeles Galaxy (8)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398585746\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/7/23/1343018452141/David-Beckham-and-Landon--007.jpg\" alt=\"David Beckham and Landon Donovan, LA Galaxy vs Chivas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham and Landon Donovan will be key men for the LA Galaxy. Photograph: Ric Tapia/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ric Tapia/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><em>Will host Vancouver Whitecaps in a one off wild-card game on Thursday night; winner will play San Jose in the Western Conference semi-final</em></p> <p>It has been a season of two halves for the MLS Cup holders, who at one point looked like very long shots to get the chance to defend their title, after an awful start. The sight of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5rtdzniN8k\">New England Revolution hitting three in an early season game</a> at the former Home Depot Center fortress told you everything you needed to know about how the Galaxy were coping without the injured Omar Gonzalez at the heart of defense. More troubling was the fact that the big names \u2013 Landon Donovan, Robbie Keane, David Beckhams \u2013 looked anonymous, perhaps preoccupied with thoughts of looming international tournaments.</p> <p>It was in the wake of those tournaments, and the return of Gonzalez to stabilize the defense, that the Galaxy snapped back into form. Keane returned from a disappointing Euro 2012 with renewed focus, while Beckham and Donovan missed the Olympics entirely (other than a speedboat cameo for the former) and threw themselves into their club side's cause. Most importantly, senior figures in the locker room re-instituted a culture of accountability and results began to improve dramatically, even before the arrival of the smart Swedish international Christian Wilhelmsson to give the champions some creativity out wide. The Galaxy may be peaking at the right time.</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> It's tempting to say Gonzalez, because of the night-and-day effect of him being in or out of the side, but let's take that as a given. Keane has found his scoring touch and his movement makes a lot of space for smart players around him. The key though is the form (and perhaps mood) of <strong>Landon Donovan</strong>. He played a full 90 minutes on his return from injury at the weekend, but looked way short of match condition. Nonetheless he showed flashes of the invention, vision and at moments drive that will be a key part of a successful LA cup defense. </p> <h2>5. Vancouver Whitecaps (10)</h2> <p><em>Will visit LA Galaxy in a one-off wild-card game on Thursday night; winner will play San Jose in the Western Conference semi-final</em></p> <p>As we said, if you want to win MLS Cup you first have to make the playoffs. Vancouver did that \u2013 just. Martin Rennie arrived after an underwhelming debut MLS season for the Whitecaps and overhauled his side in the offseason to become many peoples' outside tip for MLS Cup. The team started solidly, if perhaps a little stolidly \u2013 building off a firm defense and home form to stay in touch with the leaders.</p> <p>Whether Rennie tried to rush his revolution, or sides figured out the new-look Whitecaps, Vancouver seemed to lose their way as the season went on, as the signings they brought in to give them more attacking sophistication rather unbalanced the side. They did combine for a late-season four-goal salvo against Chivas USA, which combined with the same opponent's subsequent tie with FC Dallas saw Vancouver over the line.</p> <p>The Whitecaps now face a wild-card trip to a Galaxy team that have had their measure since Vancouver entered the league, but if \u2013 and it's a big if \u2013 they can negotiate that, they will find themselves playing San Jose as one of the few sides who've consistently troubled the Earthquakes this year. That has been at least in part because they are unfazed by the physical style of a team like the Earthquakes. The Whitecaps have beaten the Supporters Shield winners twice this year and while they will go to LA hoping regular-season form is no indicator of playoff outcomes, should they prevail at the Home Depot Center you'd forgive their fans for welcoming San Jose thinking, \"Maybe, just maybe...\"</p> <p><strong>Key Player:</strong> <strong>Camilo Sanvezzo</strong>. The Whitecaps will need Jay DeMerit on form to keep the Galaxy attack out. They'll need the designated players, Barry Robson and Kenny Miller, to come good and demonstrate that they truly represent the next stage of the team's evolution \u2013 though if the stories coming out of Vancouver are any indication, they may be doing so from the bench. They may even need Dane Richards or rookie MVP candidate Darren Mattocks to perform speedy wonders off the bench. But the main thing the Whitecaps need is for an in form Camilo to make creative things happen for the offense and keep himself out of trouble while doing so.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Diamond found himself in an awkward position for a chief executive at Sale's Carrington training base on Tuesday afternoon \u2013 explaining why, a few months after recommending that Bryan Redpath should be appointed director of rugby on a four-year contract reported to be worth a seven-figure sum, he had decided to reclaim the job for himself and demote the Scotsman.</p> <p>However Diamond has had plenty of practice. Since returning to Sale, for whom he was a tough and uncompromising hooker then coach, as executive director of sport in February 2011, the 44-year-old has twice before felt obliged to revert to coaching after deciding that his replacements were not up to the job.</p> <p>Tony Hanks, a New Zealander who previously worked at Wasps, was the first to fall short of Diamond's expectations in March, when he was sacked as head coach after less than eight months in charge, and only one month after signing a contract extension. Diamond resumed control for the rest of the season but then moved for Redpath, the former Scotland scrum-half who just happened to have requested a release from his contract with Gloucester.</p> <p>That allowed Diamond to concentrate once more on the commercial side of the club ahead of their move from Stockport to the City of Salford Stadium this season. But then, only four matches into this season after Sale had suffered a fourth consecutive defeat at home to London Welsh, he deemed himself the man to sort out the faltering Sharks forwards after sacking Steve Scott, the former Scotland international who had been an appointment of a previous regime.</p> <p>So Diamond has been combining the positions of chief executive and forwards coach for the past month, a period during which the situation at Sale became even more complicated as the famously abrasive former All Blacks coach John Mitchell was invited back to the club as a consultant - \"to give a helicopter view\", Diamond explained. Less than two weeks ago, Redpath said he had been reassured by Diamond that despite Mitchell's arrival his role as director of rugby \"wouldn't change in any way\". He said he would have \"no issues\" working alongside Mitchell, and that \"our egos have to be put to one side\".</p> <p>Within days, Mitchell told journalists who followed Sale to Montpellier for a Heineken Cup defeat \"teams can only have one leader\". The assumption was that leader would be him. But now Diamond insists he will be in charge for the rest of the season. Mitchell will remain as a consultant until next spring at least, but he flew back to South Africa on Tuesday morning to \"finish some details\", according to Diamond \u2013 a reference to the acrimonious legal battle that followed his suspension by the Golden Lions in June after complaints from the players about his management style.</p> <p>He is not expected back before Friday night's home game against London Irish, a distinctly winnable fixture for Sale in which victory has now become imperative. But Diamond said Redpath could yet be involved in preparing the team for that match, having been offered a new coaching role.</p> <p>\"We've asked Bryan just to take a little bit of time out, a couple of days off to reconsider what we are doing and how we restructure our rugby department,\" Diamond explained.</p> <p>\"We want him to be involved moving forward. He is contracted for a long time after making a big move from Gloucester. We just need to get the balance of that right, and it clearly isn't right, judging by our results.</p> <p>\"I know Bryan Redpath very well personally and through the job, and the decision to have a rethink about the coaching staff hasn't been done overnight. We've been talking about it a few weeks now because of results. Most people would get fired if I'm honest after seven or eight losses. That hasn't been the case here. What we're trying to do is put other plans in place.\"</p> <p>Redpath, who has yet to make any public comment, has been asked to give Sale an answer by Wednesday morning. \"All the talks are very positive at the moment,\" Diamond added. \"I certainly want him involved and John Mitchell thinks he does a good job.\"</p> <p>But it will be Diamond who leads the battle to avoid relegation from the Premiership, which he admits \"would be a disaster\".</p> <p>\"What we need is a bit of stability,\" he added with a straight face, after instigating this third major change in the past nine months. \"It needs a steady hand on the ship. That's why I find myself coming back to the coaching. Our team has got stronger on paper over the summer, we just need to get them playing together better. We won't suffer the indignity of not winning games like we have been \u2013 we've got to make changes. I don't know what people expected me to do. The examples of what happened to Newcastle, to Northampton, to Harlequins in previous years are clear if you leave it too late.</p> <p>\"As chief executive I've got to take full responsibility, and what you do in these positions is bring people in who are capable, with a proven track record of doing a good job. Sometimes it doesn't work and unfortunately it hasn't. We've created a non-blame culture. You can point fingers wherever you want, but the players are very tight and ultimately working through it. We want to be a hard-working, abrasive side, and we've started to show a bit of that of late. I'm sure that will show again on Friday night.\"</p>",

  "<p>A City trader accused of losing UBS \u00a31.4bn through reckless and illicit deals has told a court he was actively encouraged by superiors to \"push the boundaries\" so as to maximise profits.</p> <p>Kweku Adoboli, 32, told Southwark crown court on Tuesday that traders at all investment banks viewed compliance policies as \"aspirational\" rather than fixed and knew they had to bend rules if they were to achieve the goals set out for them by managers.</p> <p>The court was told that Yassine Bouhara, former co-head of equities at UBS, wrote to Adoboli in an email: \"You don't know what your limits are until you push the boundary so far that you receive a slap on the back of the wrist.\"</p> <p>Quizzed on this by the defence barrister, Paul Garlick QC, Adoboli said: \"There were no secrets, there was no hiding, there was no holding back. We were told to go for it, we went for it. We were told to push the boundaries, so we pushed the boundaries.</p> <p>\"We were told you wouldn't know where the limit of the boundary was until you got a slap on the back of the wrist. We found that boundary, we found the edge, we fell off and I got arrested.\"</p> <p>Adoboli is accused of running an illicit, off-book set of trades which were not properly hedged by balancing deals, a banned tactic which boosts potential profit but exposed UBS to greater risk. While Adoboli's \"umbrella\" account, as he termed it, initially generated profits it went disastrously wrong during the summer of 2011, at one point giving UBS potential liabilities of \u00a37.5bn, which the prosecution says could have destroyed the banking giant.</p> <p>The Ghanaian-born, British-educated trader insists his umbrella account was known about throughout the exchange traded funds (ETFs) desk on which he worked, and that his only intention was to make money for UBS.</p> <p>Adoboli told the court that the significant losses began after he was persuaded by superiors, against his own judgement, to switch his trading position to assume an upturn in European markets which never came.</p> <p>\"The real problem was a result of the pressure to flip my position from short to long, this broke my control,\" he said. \"I absolutely lost control, I was no longer in control of the decisions around the trades we were doing.\"</p> <p>He described the effect on his personal life as the losses mounted up, describing an evening in July last year when he was supposed to go for dinner with his girlfriend. He said: \"I went a bit catatonic. I was curled up on my bed. She was asking me what was wrong. I just couldn't explain.\"</p> <p>His girlfriend eventually persuaded him to tell his superiors, Adoboli added: \"In the end she was the strength. She was the person who said to me: 'Look, Kwek, if you can't do this, if you can't fix this, then look within yourself and maybe go and tell someone. This is going to kill you. You can't keep fighting this battle that you are clearly not winning.'\"</p> <p>Adoboli was arrested in September 2011 after walking out of the UBS office and writing an email to senior staff outlining what had happened. Adoboli told the court on Tuesday that after leaving the office he first went to St Mary's Church, near the bank's London headquarters, to pray.</p> <p>Adoboli denies two counts of fraud and four counts of false accounting between October 2008 and last September. The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Essex police were criticised on Tuesday for failings before the murder of a woman by her violent ex-partner. On the day of Jeanette Goodwin's murder police failed to make sufficient links with previous domestic violence incidents and did not fully appreciate how much danger she was in, a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found.</p> <p>Goodwin, a 47-year-old mother of three from Southend, made seven reports to police of harassment and domestic violence from her ex-partner, Martin Bunch, between January 2011 and the day of her murder on 24 July last year.</p> <p>Police were praised by the IPCC for their support for Goodwin before her murder \u2013 they installed a panic alarm in her home and arrested Bunch several times for a variety of offences including battery and harassment. Magistrates released him on bail despite police pleas to have him remanded in custody, the report said.</p> <p>The serious failings identified by the IPCC were on the day she died. Background and intelligence checks were not conducted when Goodwin first called 999 at 2.40pm, saying that Bunch had been at her fence and had been harassing her. She stated five times that she was scared.</p> <p>The next contact was at 7.40pm, when Goodwin activated the panic alarm. When police arrived at her home they found her dying from multiple stab wounds. A communications supervisor in the Force Information Room said that while he didn't feel he could have done much more as he had not been notified about all the background information they had \"failed this woman terribly, we should have had someone there much, much, much sooner\", the report said.</p> <p>IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: \"The system in place then was badly flawed, not utilising intelligence checks to inform decision making when prioritising incidents.\"</p> <p>She added: \"There was a failure to recognise, in the light of the known history of this case, that Mr Bunch's presence close to her home, in breach of his bail conditions, required immediate and urgent action to try to arrest him.\"</p> <p>Other domestic violence deaths in Essex have prompted concerns about a failure to link together separate incidents, including that of Mary Russell, 81, in 2010. She died of head injuries after her husband allegedly hit her. A report by Southend Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults Board last year found police treated Russell's seven claims of domestic violence as standalone incidents rather than as related and the CPS decided there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>In another case, Christine Chambers and her daughter, Shania, were murdered in June 2011 by David Oakes. In August 2012 an IPCC report found that Essex police had failed to recognise any pattern or connection between events and identified a failure to share information between agencies.</p> <p>Between June and September this year there have been four more domestic homicides in Essex. The force has confirmed that at least three of the victims had contact with it before their deaths.</p> <p>Essex police have, however, made significant improvements to domestic violence policy, including an amendment to delineate responsibilities in the force control room. A domestic abuse intelligence team is now based there to ensure that appropriate checks are completed and accurately recorded on the log immediately following the report.</p> <p>Cerfontyne said: \"The police have a tendency not to join the dots on domestic violence, but rather to deal with repeated incidents in isolation. They struggle to understand the coercive and controlling environment in which domestic violence takes place and the impact this may have on a woman trying to escape it, which is when they often face the greatest risk.\"</p> <p>Deputy Chief Constable Derek Benson, of Essex police, has accepted the findings of the IPCC report into Goodwin's murder. \"The initial call should have been treated more seriously, and a unit dispatched,\" he said. \"Too much emphasis was placed on Mrs Goodwin saying she was going out and would not be in until 4.30pm, rather than her stating she was scared of Bunch. There is however no way of knowing if our actions at this time had been different whether Mrs Goodwin would still have been murdered,\" he said.Goodwin's family issued a statement welcoming the findings:</p> <p>\"We are pleased that the IPCC report has highlighted areas of procedures that could have been better on the day of Jeanette's death.</p> <p>\"Although this will not bring back our dearest Jeanette, we are satisfied that these procedures have been improved, ensuring that victims of domestic violence can now be treated as they should, as a priority.\"</p> <p>A system of multi-agency domestic homicide reviews was launched by the government in April 2011 and these reviews are under way into the cases of Chambers and Goodwin. The idea is to learn from previous cases, help spot potential victims earlier and prevent violence from escalating in other cases.</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"More than 130 domestic homicide reviews are underway with a number nearing completion. By making domestic homicide reviews mandatory important lessons are being learned that we hope will prevent future tragedies and tackle domestic violence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Professor Eric Ives, who has died aged 81, was one of the leading Tudor historians of his generation, ranging across the political, religious and legal history of the period and shaping our understanding, in particular, of the murky world of the politics of Henry VIII's court. He was also an energetic, reforming administrator who did much to develop the arts and humanities at Birmingham University.</p> <p>Born in Romford, Essex, Ives was educated at Brentwood school and then Queen Mary College, University of London, where he gained a first-class degree in history. As a postgraduate at London, supervised by the formidable Tudor historian ST Bindoff, he tackled a particularly intractable set of sources on the early Tudor common law and produced the thesis which eventually became <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Common-Lawyers-Pre-Reformation-England/dp/0521072581\" title=\"\">The Common Lawyers of Pre-Reformation England </a>(1983). This broke new ground in weaving together legal and social history to show how the practice of the law led to the rise of a profession which made such a dynamic contribution to Tudor life.</p> <p>Following national service in the Royal Air Force (1955-57), Ives became a researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.histparl.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">History of Parliament</a> (1957), fellow of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University (1958-61) and then a lecturer in history at Liverpool University (1962-69). There he carried out the research that underpinned his best known book, on Anne Boleyn. He became interested in the Cheshire gentleman William Brereton, groom of the stool in Henry VIII's privy chamber and one of the group of leading courtiers executed alongside Anne in 1536, accused of committing adultery with her. Ives could never see the staid, middle-aged Brereton as one of Anne's lovers and this prompted him to delve further into the machinations that brought the queen to the block.</p> <p>What he uncovered was evidence of a factional coup, engineered by Thomas Cromwell, to sweep away Anne and her associates and pave the way for Henry to marry Jane Seymour. His analysis of this episode provided a model of the workings of court faction which has been hugely influential in the study of Tudor politics. He developed his arguments in an important Historical Association pamphlet, Faction in Tudor England (1979), and they became the centrepiece of his biography Anne Boleyn (published in 1986, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/oct/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\" title=\"\">a revised study in 2004</a>, produced to take account of the new evidence about Anne's life in the inventory of Henry VIII's goods).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398579451\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351618037514/The-Life-and-Death-of-Ann-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn by Eric Ives\" width=\"200\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn by Eric Ives</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He displayed an enviable talent for writing popular, scholarly biography, combining vivid and lucid prose, and a sense of what gave Anne her sex appeal in the eyes of the king, with meticulous and innovative research. One of his most important findings was to demonstrate the influential role that the queen played in promoting Protestant Reformation in England, built on her powerful evangelical faith. Typically Ives greatly enjoyed the controversy stirred up by his interpretation and relished sparring with fellow academics in the stream of books and articles about Anne that followed.</p> <p>Religion played a central part in Ives's own life. He and his wife, Ruth, were leading lights in the Castle Hill Baptist church in Warwick after he moved there in 1982. He was a vigorous and energetic lay preacher. His personal faith informed one of his less well known books, God in History (1979), in which he challenged Marxist and materialist interpretations of history and sought to restore the spiritual dimension to our understanding of the historical process.</p> <p>In 1969 Ives moved from Liverpool to Birmingham where he remained, from 1987 as professor of English history, until his retirement in 1997. As an energetic and reforming dean of the faculty of arts (1987-89) and pro-vice-chancellor (1989-93), he ruffled feathers but helped to bring about significant reforms, reinvigorating the <a href=\"http://barber.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Barber Institute of Fine Arts</a> and developing the university's first contacts with the far east. He believed that university politics gave him considerable insight into the workings of the Tudor court. He also revelled in being at the centre of things and, as dean, could be seen bustling across campus, suitors in tow, like a latter-day Cardinal Wolsey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398579452\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351618206302/Lady-Jane-Grey-A-Tudor-My-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery by Eric Ives\" width=\"200\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery by Eric Ives</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is most fondly remembered at Birmingham for his spell as head of modern history (1994-97), showing great kindness and consideration, particularly towards younger colleagues. He always recognised that research and teaching went hand in hand and that creative and innovative work depended on giving colleagues the time and space to develop their ideas. In all this he retained his own enthusiasm for teaching. He was an inventive designer of new courses, including a remarkable seminar on Shakespeare built around solving a series of whodunnits connected with the life of the bard. Generations of Birmingham students recall his booming delivery at lectures and the clarity with which he could make complex issues intelligible.</p> <p>After retiring, he remained very active and productive. He continued to serve as a notably committed and supportive chair of the governors of Warwick School (1985-2003). He reinvented himself as a historian of education to take the lead in an archive-based study of Birmingham University, The First Civic University (2000).</p> <p>And he returned to biography with Lady Jane Grey: A Tudor Mystery (2009). Building on the fragmentary knowledge we have of the \"nine days queen\", he constructed a picture of remarkably accomplished young women and concluded with one of the things he did best: a detailed dissection of the 1553 failed coup by which the Duke of Northumberland brought Jane, his daughter-in-law, to the throne.</p> <p>Ives was appointed OBE in 2001 for his services to history and the University of Birmingham.</p> <p>Ruth died in 2004.

  "<p>Jack Smart, who has died aged 92, changed the course of philosophy of mind. He was a pioneer of physicalism \u2013 the set of theories that hold that consciousness, sensation and thought do not, as they seem to, float free of physicality, but can \u2013 or will eventually \u2013 be located in a scientific material worldview. His article <a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Courses/SMARTJACKphil1.pdf\" title=\"\">Sensations and Brain Processes</a> (1959) put forward his Type Identity theory of mind \u2013 that consciousness and sensations are nothing over and above brain processes. Invariably included in any collection of mind-body problem papers, it is now part of the canon, for, along with UT Place and David Armstrong, Smart converted what was once \"the Australian heresy\" into orthodoxy.</p> <p>While all three were based principally at Australian universities, Place was born in Yorkshire and Smart to Scottish parents in Cambridge, where his father was professor of astronomy. Jack went to the Leys School in the city, studied maths, physics and philosophy at Glasgow University, and during the second world war served mainly in India and Burma. He gained a BPhil at Queen's College, Oxford, in 1948, under the behaviourist Gilbert Ryle, and in 1950 became professor at Adelaide, where he stayed until 1972.</p> <p>Away from the language-centred philosophy of Britain, Smart was freer to draw the implications that science had for philosophy. He began to ask why consciousness alone should remain exempt from physico-chemical explanation. The behaviourist view he had espoused at Oxford got round this question by denying that mental states, like anger, pain or believing, can even qualify as things or events, whether physical or non-physical. Rather, to talk about mental states is, for behaviourism, simply to talk about collections of actual or potential behaviour. But Smart objected that in this case seeing an after-image due to strong light can amount to nothing more than saying \"I have a yellowish-orange after-image\". Such an utterance is surely superfluous to the sensation on which the utterer, who has just experienced it, would be \"reporting\".</p> <p>Smart agreed with old-fashioned mind-body dualism \u2013 against behaviourism \u2013 that many mental states are indeed episodic, inner and potentially private; what he disputed was that this made their essential nature non-physical. \"Why should not sensations just be brain processes of a certain sort?\" he demanded. If regarded as neuro-physiological processes, they too would be potentially explicable by scientific laws.</p> <p>It is no objection that someone reporting their sensations does not know or feel that they are brain processes. Because such reports are \"topic-neutral\" \u2013 uncommitted as to what sort of process, ghostly or material, is going on \u2013 they are open to revision by increasing scientific knowledge.</p> <p>Smart's Type Identity theory unleash ed a torrent of argument that has persisted over the last half century. Characteristic of him in its no-nonsense seizing of the main issue, Sensations and Brain Processes ends on a note of satisfaction at a job well done, having presented eight objections to its thesis, and eight answers. As was soon pointed out, however, to postulate specific neuro/mental identities inadvertentlyrestricts mental states to human brains, ignoring the wide range of sensation processes in other species.</p> <p>But Smart regarded the development of complementary ideas in the field with equanimity, in fact claimed that his \"topic neutral\" approach had anticipated the theory of functionalism whichthat soon became fashionable.</p> <p>But Smart was blithe about the development of complementary theories. He claimed that his own \"topic-neutral\" approach had anticipated the soon-prevailing theory of functionalism, which identifies mental states, like software programs, by what they do rather than how they are physically implemented.</p> <p>He was one of the leading figures to push Anglo-American analytic philosophy into collusion with the sciences. In his earliest article, The River of Time (1949), published while he was a junior research fellow at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he invoked Einstein's special theory of relativity, arguing that our notion of time passing must be an illusion \u2013 a then-unfashionable position, which, largely thanks to him, moved more into the mainstream. He developed \"the tenseless theory of time\", influencing later philosophers of time such as DH Mellor and Huw Price. We should, he said, consider reality \"a four-dimensional space, three of whose dimensions correspond to space in the ordinary sense of this word, and one of whose dimensions is taken to be a time dimension\".</p> <p>Over the years he changed his mind as to his explanation \u2013 respectively linguistic, then psychological \u2013 for why we feel as if time flows, but always remained an eternalist, claiming all points in time to be equally real. A few years ago, meeting an exponent of the opposite view, the presentist philosopher John Bigelow, at a conference, he remarked that he very much hoped that presentism is false, since, if not, this beloved friend would only be a single instantaneous time-slice: much better to regard him as an elongated and eternal space-time worm.</p> <p>In Philosophy and Scientific Realism (1963) and subsequently, Smart acknowledged that what science tells us about the world is often hard to reconcile with how it seems in experience, but he stuck up for a reality that exists independently of our conceptions of it. He fiercely combated anti-realism, and postmodern notions that scientific theories (and the unobservable entities they depend on) are merely helpful, but arbitrary and disposable, human tools.</p> <p>If the theories were not approximately true, and the entities did not more-or-less exist, went his No Miracles argument, the predictive success they have would be miraculous. One reason he gave for liking Australian philosophers was that they were not as liable to talk nonsense as French ones did.</p> <p>After an Episcopalian upbringing \u2013 his brother, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/feb/02/guardianobituaries\" title=\"Ninian Smart obituary\">Ninian Smart</a>, was a theology professor and respected writer on religion \u2013 Smart had become \"a reluctant atheist\". Whether in philosophy of mind, philosophy of science or ethics, he strove to resolve apparently mysterious entities or values as parts of the natural world. His aim throughout was to produce a comprehensive worldview that accommodated both common-sense and scientific stringency. In moral philosophy, he applied his swashbuckling approach to bringing utilitarianism \u2013 the theory that goodness consists of promoting the greatest overall happiness \u2013 back to centre stage after it had been ignored for more than 50 years.</p> <p>In An Outline of a System of Utilitarian Ethics (1961; and published in tandem with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jun/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"Bernard Williams obituary\">Bernard Williams</a>'s A Critique of Utilitarianism in 1973), he embraced its then-unpopular extreme form \u2013 act utilitarianism. Its milder version, rule utilitarianism, was \"superstitious rule worship\", he said, and negated precisely the deft adaptability to the actual situation that was utilitarianism's whole point. He recognised the unpalatable upshot of his ethical arguments \u2013 that they would sanction an innocent man being killed if greater suffering were thereby spared \u2013 but nonetheless stuck to them.</p> <p>The entry for \"OutSMART\" in the jocular Philosophers' Lexicon refers to Smart's readiness, rare in a philosopher, to embrace his opponents' reductio ad absurdum arguments \u2013 take-that-to-its-logical-conclusion rebuffs that are traditionally designed to make the rebuffed one revise his view. For all his geniality and exuberant laughter, he admitted that truth could be unsatisfactory.</p> <p>In addition to his chair at the Australian National University, Canberra (1976-85), at various times Smart had visiting posts in the US at Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Stanford. He was also awarded honorary fellowships by his Oxford colleges.</p> <p>An enthusiastic player of cricket and hockey, Smart won university colours in both. He would sometimes hold a small radio to his ear during philosophy seminars to check on the Test Match score. In others, he sometimes snoozed \u2013 or seemed to. Suddenly he would open his eyes and ask a devastating question. He loved bush-walking, but tended to get lost, and the friends he took with him were dismayed equally by his excellent stamina and poor sense of direction.</p> <p>Smart was that rare phenomenon \u2013 a great and successful philosopher who had no enemies. Brisk and down-to-earth in debate, he was never aggressive. There are endless anecdotes of his spontaneous kindness. \"We've got to find you a bike,\" was his first comment to a lonely visiting student, and the bike which duly turned up next day transformed his stay. Smart himself continued to cycle as an emeritus professor well into his 70s. The child-like, unpretentious openness for which he was so much loved was reflected in the fearless, direct clarity with which he did philosophy.</p> <p>With his first wife, Janet Paine, who died in 1967, he had two children, Helen and Robert. They survive him, as does his second wife, Elizabeth Warner, whom he married in 1968.</p> <p>\u2022 Jack (John Jamieson Carswell) Smart, philosopher, born 16 September 1920; died 6 October 2012</p>",
  "<p>John Browett, who was until Sunday night the Brit in charge of Apple's giant retail chain, can at least afford a good seat on his flight back across the Atlantic: the \u00a336m golden hello that he received on joining six months ago should see to that. But for him and for Scott Forstall, who had been there \u2013 and at NeXT, the company Apple bought in 1996 to bring not just new software but also Steve Jobs \u2013 their departure looks like nothing less than a humiliation.</p> <p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, is taking over the retail stores; Jonathan Ive, the quiet Englishman who has been at the company longer than any of the other senior executives, is now in charge of hardware design and the \"human interface\" of the software. If you like Ive's phone, tablet and computer designs \u2013 and a lot of people seem to \u2013 you might like what he will do to the software too. It can't be worse than having Forstall's pretend \"shredder\" or \"bookstand\" cluttering up your screen.</p> <p>Forstall's corporate death warrant was issued in September when he refused to give his signature to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology\" title=\"\">abject apology over Apple's Maps</a> just days after the launch of its new iPhone software, according to multiple news sources. Instead, the apology bore Cook's name \u2013 showing that he is at least certain where the buck stops. Forstall, it is said, had long been a source of friction within a company that tries to avoid internal politics by operating in small teams; some reports even say that Ive would not sit in meetings with him.</p> <p>Browett, meanwhile, failed to expand the stores as quickly as desired (30 stores in two quarters \u2013 bringing the total to 393 in 14 countries \u2013 is not enough, apparently). He also tried, according to reports, to make staff drive profits, something that is anathema to the stores' aim. They aren't designed as a profit centre (though they <a href=\"http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/charts_graphs.html\" title=\"\">generated</a> $1.1bn profit on $4.2bn sales in the most recent quarter). They are intended to spread the Apple brand.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/26/apple-ipad-sales-slow-down\" title=\"\">Apple's financial results</a> suggest it is falling victim to the law of large numbers: it can't keep growing at the same speed. Yet the onslaught of Google's Android mobile software and Microsoft's PC means it can't afford to slow down either.</p> <p>Cook seems to have brought Monday's announcement forward to catch the markets' close due to Superstorm Sandy. Stock pickers have been quick to mark Apple down, though market commentator Jim Cramer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/263223166887919616\" title=\"\">remarked on Twitter</a> that \"the negativity on [Apple] is so great now that if Cook had promoted those two guys the stock would be hit, too\".</p> <p>Cook has been such a cipher that some are surprised he could act so brutally. But he is a razor-sharp operator. Soon after joining Apple in 1998 he was in a meeting trying to get its dreadful supply chain in shape. \"This is really bad. Someone should be in China driving this,\" he said. Thirty minutes later Cook looked up at the executive in charge of that area and said: \"Why are you still here?\"</p> <p>Cook's unrivalled skill in building a supply chain capable of shipping millions of phones and tablets worldwide within weeks of an announcement has made Apple what it is. But it is his people skills that show what the company will become. The firings will shock his employees but one thing Cook will not stand for is complacency. Everyone is certain of that now.</p>",
  "<p>It has been reported that around 4,000 women a year&#xa0;will undergo treatment for a cancer that would have done&#xa0;them no harm. So should you go for screening, or not? A&#xa0;doctor writes \u2026</p> <p>It's good news that the leaflet inviting women for screening is to be rewritten. It's too bossy, and doesn't spell out the issues clearly enough.</p> <p>A woman who turns up for screening has a 93.2%&#xa0;chance of being told all is well. That's a lot of reassured women. Admittedly, a few cancers will be missed and some women will be made anxious by having especially uncomfortable tests like a biopsy, but most will walk away with peace of mind. Of course, the screening only tells you that you don't have cancer now; it doesn't give you a guarantee about the future. But as 89/100,000 UK women will get breast cancer in a given year, it's good to know you're ok for the time being.</p> <p>But what of the 6.8% of women (681 out of every 10,000) who turn up for screening and are told they have breast cancer? Of those, most (552 out of 10,000) should be pleased at the early diagnosis, which may save 43 lives (per 10,000 screened women) a year. The evidence in favour of early treatment is convincing, especially in younger women. But between one in five and one in six of those diagnosed have such a slow-growing cancer that it will never cause them harm.</p> <p>So you have a 93.2% chance of walking away from screening with peace of mind, versus a 1.3% chance of being told you have a breast cancer that needs treatment when it probably doesn't.</p> <p>As a GP, I don't volunteer an opinion, though lifestyle advice may help to lessen your risk (exercise, avoid alcohol, don't get too fat). It's not like vaccination of children, which is more cut and&#xa0;dried to my mind. There is no right or wrong answer. If asked, I say: \"Do what gives you more peace of mind.\"</p> <p>If you're not particularly worried about breast cancer, are happy to check your own breasts and see a doctor if you find a lump, and can live with not having had a screening if you do get cancer, then ignore the screening invitation when it arrives.</p> <p>If you are worried about breast cancer, have seen people around you develop it and die and can live with the fact that screening may unearth a small cancer that was never going to cause you harm, then accept the invitation.</p> <p>The difficulty, of course, lies in deciding which of those types you are. For we will all recognise ourselves in both, and however rational we think we are being, will probably act on a gut instinct. My friend and I were having this very conversation earlier. We furiously agreed about the pros and cons. One of us is going to our screening and one of us isn't.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2012 because the original said: \"A 50-year-old woman who turns up for screening has a 93.2% chance of being told all is well.\" This and other statistics referred to in the article relate to all women in the NHS breast screening programme, under which women in the 50-70 age group are called for screening every three years.</p>",

In the Day After Tomorrow, a cruise liner sails by the New York Public Library, while the Statue of Liberty stands largely submerged. In Artificial Intelligence, Jude Law helicopters into an office on the high floors of Rockefeller Center, the rest of the city long buried under sloshing waves for eternity.</p> <p>Those scenes carry cinematic weight for obvious reasons: New York has an aura of invincibility, the kind of bustling, tough, sharp-elbowed place that stops for nothing.</p> <p>Part of this has to do with New York's geography. The city has natural advantages \u2013 billion-year-old Manhattan bedrock <a href=\"http://www.elegran.com/edge/2012/02/economists-explain-manhattans-skyline-for-the-first-time\">that can hold miles of heavy skyscrapers</a>, a harbor and shipping ports and airports that <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:osKiBFlKQdkJ:usmayors.org/metroeconomies/0712/KeyFindings.pdf+gross+metropolitan+product+new+york&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShEPlZNKnkYNQChoPUxNIwgtIZUliCfkFuu7-eChG6iWWA6f1EN_uHi8XeQ6LLNgwsMDl6CpHwKpCYHcesw_1ru8T0S3cWDQJU-TBMLBr0_0H9xeNA5vhFti68TAzXJse4vguSc&amp;sig=AHIEtbTWyZ6e3hJ7j9YB_a1jD7e8Br9KHQ\">allowed $85bn of exports from the New York region in 2010</a>: that's over <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html\">three times the exports of the entire country of Greece</a>. New York is the largest regional economy in the United States, generating a gross metropolitan product of $1.28tn in 2010. New York's economic output \u2013 like those of Los Angeles and Chicago \u2013 is greater than that of 45 of the 50 states in the union.</p> <p>So, it is startling, as jarring as it is in disaster movies, to see that Hurricane Sandy caused large swaths of New York to be underwater, without power, and, largely, not doing much business. In a city so bright at all times that the stars are hard to see, the streets and skies were suddenly nearly black for miles. New York has had blackouts before: as recently as 2003, a city-wide blackout shut down operations, albeit without flooding. As SIFMA, a financial-industry group, pointed out:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is the first time weather has closed markets in New York for two consecutive days since a blizzard in 1888.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>SIFMA is an organization made up of every major financial firm in New York, so it has some power when it recommended that they suspend trading in bonds on Tuesday. It's still up to those firms to decide if they want to; they'll be making a decision between the potential loss of profits and the tremendous inconvenience to employees, many of whom live in areas where power is iffy and transportation sketchy.</p> <p>It is currently impossible to estimate how the damage from Hurricane Sandy will affect New York. As far as the financial markets go, the NYSE Euronext said that it was on track to re-open on Wednesday, as did the Nasdaq exchange. The exchange's contingency plan calls for a shift to electronic trading \u2013 still a difficult proposition, as far as the markets go, because even for electronic trading, the traders currently need access to their desks and computers.</p> <p>At a minimum, it is impossible for most people to get to work in the city, which affects the locus of several industries, including finance, advertising, healthcare and the arts. The city's transportation lines, bridges, and tunnels were shut down for nearly two days, and at the latest report, the subways may be down well into next week. Footage from the news on Monday night showed water flowing freely, carrying the smell of fuel and burning electricity, into subway tunnels and through the Midtown Tunnel, which carries 80,000 a cars a day into Manhattan from Long Island.</p> <p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested that Wall Street should be \"online\" again by Wednesday. But that is of little comfort if the workers can't get there, and the majority of the 168,700 financial industry employees in New York still take public transportation of some kind.</p> <p>The stock exchanges were also closed, and the bond markets were largely frozen, though still partially open. JFK airport, a hub for international business travelers, may re-open on Wednesday, but LaGuardia airport, which mostly carries domestic flights in the US, is likely to stay closed as it deals with the aftermath of flooded runways. Barclays Capital analysts called the situation \"the Hurricane Sandy standstill\".</p> <p>Goldman Sachs, whose building downtown was one of the few to retain power because of its powerful backup generator, told employees that its downtown headquarters would be closed on Tuesday. The firm still planned to do business with clients, however \u2013 depending on staff in London, Salt Lake City, Utah and \"other offices around the world\"</p> <p>\"Unless otherwise instructed by divisional management, you should plan to stay home,\" the firm's chief operating officer advised employees who considered coming into the office on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley, likewise, reminded employees that it would move some functions to other offices outside New York, and that many employees could work from home.</p> <p>\"We also expect to be open for business and functioning when the&#xa0;US&#xa0;markets open,\" the firm said in a statement. HSBC said its branches were closed in in New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Washington, DC, and Virginia, with updates on its website. The bank encouraged employees to stay home. Barclays kept all of its New York offices open, with the exception of an office across the river in Jersey City, which was flooded. \"All staff with non-essential roles are currently being asked to work from home,\" a spokesman said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last year, when Hurricane Irene hit, banks like Goldman offered vouchers to employees that they could use with private car services, to get to work even when the subways were out. But this time, with so many roads flooded, it will take time for even car services to get back on the roads.</p> <p>All of this is likely to hit revenues, at least noticeably, in an industry that can already ill afford it. The financial sector has been shedding jobs \u2013 and shrinking salaries \u2013 for several years. <a href=\"http://www.osc.state.ny.us/press/releases/oct12/100912.htm\">New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli noted</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]n the first half of 2012, the [financial] industry [in New York] earned $10.5bn and is on pace to earn more than $15bn by year's end, unless adverse developments erode profitability like last year.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Last year, those \"adverse developments\" were the European debt crisis. It seems unimaginable for Hurricane Sandy to be able to cause the financial industry losses on that scale \u2013 but the business interruption certainly does not help. Anthony Peters, a London-based strategist for SwissInvest, confessed that New York's future was the locus of most financial concern, telling clients:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Monday trading in Europe was totally anticlimactic and I, for one, knocked off early only to go home and watch microphone-bearing news reporters in wet weather gear standing in the open air in New York City telling us that it was getting wetter and windier.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For native New Yorkers, or those who had lived in the city for decades, the damage was unprecedented. New York always keeps going \u2013 except this week, when it has largely stopped. Governor Cuomo told New Yorkers that the city needs to update its systems. \"We seem to have a 100-year storm every two years,\" he said in a press conference.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine the city \u2013 and its business centers \u2013 going through this that often.</p>",

Their graceful slim trunks, the colour of an elephant's skin, are mottled with sinister stains.</p> <p>Last Friday, DNA tests confirmed that its ash trees were the among the first in an ancient woodland to succumb to <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara\" title=\"\"><em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, or ash dieback, a virulent fungal disease that has swept across Europe and entered Britain</a>, most probably via imported saplings, earlier this year. On Monday, the government slapped an import ban on ash trees and pledged to do all it could to contain this \"devastating\" disease. Critics say this action is far too little, too late. The answers to the obvious questions \u2013 What has caused its spread? Can anything stop it? \u2013 remain frighteningly uncertain. There are growing fears the disease will kill millions of ashes, which makes up around a third of our woods and hedges. This fungus is likely to transform our countryside more dramatically than <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/HCOU-4U4JCL\" title=\"\">Dutch elm disease</a>, another fatal killer accidentally spread around the world by the timber trade, which has destroyed more than 25 million trees in Britain since the late 1960s.</p> <p>\"They shiver in the wind and throw out boughs with a calculated aim, which is to be beautiful,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/oct/21/ronald-blythe-yeomans-house-bottengoms\" title=\"\">Ronald Blythe</a> of a pair of young ashes near his home in Essex. Gerard Manley Hopkins admired the \"contradictory supple curvings\" of an ash's boughs. \"The ash grove how graceful / how plainly 'tis speaking\" goes the Welsh folk song the Ash Grove. Poets and writers have long hailed the aesthetic qualities of the ash, whose Latin name, <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em>, celebrates its heavenly height, but it is even more admired for its utilitarian qualities. Fast-growing, strong and flexible, ash is the prince of all timbers. Every handle of every tool was once made from ash (until hickory was imported from the US), and ash was widely used in gates and cartwheels. These days, the wood's attractive grain and light hue makes fashionable furniture. Foresters love ash because it quickly grows tall and true. And as anyone with a wood-burning stove knows, ash is the king of logs: <a href=\"http://www.stovesonline.co.uk/wood_for_burning.html\" title=\"\">\"Ash-wood wet and ash-wood dry / a King may warm his slippers by.\"</a></p> <p>Brendan Joyce, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Norfolk Wildlife Trust</a>, does not just admire ash because its wood made his beloved Fender Stratocaster guitar. Ash is a particularly convivial tree. Because it does not cast heavy shade, it allows plenty of other plants to grow alongside it. \"Ash woods tend to be rich and diverse places unlike beech woods, which tend to be rather monotonous,\" says woodland ecologist George Peterken. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil was an enormous ash tree that harboured all the life in the universe. Beneath the ashes of Ashwellthorpe are carpets of bluebells and early purple orchids in spring and white admiral butterflies in July. Ash's key-like seeds feed woodmice and its bark is particularly conducive to mosses and lichens. Some 80 common insects and 60 of the rarest beetles and flies have an association with ash trees, according to Chris Panter at the University of East Anglia.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HqBOT5iBucM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HqBOT5iBucM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><em>Chalara fraxinea</em> first emerged in Poland in 1992. A fungus attacks ash leaves, moving inside young shoots into the heart of the tree, effectively strangling it by preventing it from taking both nutrients from the earth and sugars from photosynthesis. Infected leaves fall in October and the fungus spores spread from these the following July. These spores can be blown in the air: researchers in Norway, where the human movement of ash was quickly banned, discovered the disease travelled 30km each year by itself. In Denmark, 90% of ash trees are now showing symptoms of the disease and will eventually die. In 2010, the disease was confirmed in the Netherlands and Belgium. In February this year, it was discovered in young trees imported from Holland to a nursery in Buckinghamshire. Outbreaks have since been identified in newly planted trees at more than 30 locations, including Scotland, Yorkshire, Leicestershire and Cambridgeshire, and in a Woodland Trust wood in Suffolk.</p> <p>The outbreak at Ashwellthorpe, however, is a game-changer. The Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve has had no new trees imported from anywhere into it. The disease was spotted five weeks ago by Steve Collin of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. When he reported it, Forestry Commission officials were not overly concerned at first, according to Collin, because it had only been found in new plantations. An inspection and DNA tests, however, showed the disease had somehow found its way into this ancient woodland. Dozens of other possible outbreaks in East Anglia and Kent are now being investigated.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jiWp07e5Q8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jiWp07e5Q8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The apparently sluggish response to the disease by the government is another stick with which to beat the hapless Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair (Defra) after the furore over the forests sell-off and badger cull. \"If they wanted to stop the disease coming in they should have reacted before this year rather than sitting around waiting for it to come in,\" says Peterken. Why was an import ban not slapped on ash immediately the disease was discovered in February? Or why not years ago, with the disease marching across Europe? The <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/page.php?pageid=1000\" title=\"\">Horticultural Trades Association</a> (HTA) warned Defra of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> three years ago and asked it to ban imported ash trees. According to Tim Briercliffe of the HTA, fatalistic-sounding civil servants told him that as the disease was already endemic on the continent it was likely to come to the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398680377\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/30/1351618874145/An-ash-tree-showing-signs-010.jpg\" alt=\"An ash tree showing signs of ash dieback\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leaves of this ash tree show signs of ash dieback. Photograph: The Food and Environment Research Agency</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Food and Environment Research Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Environment minister David Heath has denied that the HTA warned Defra about the disease in 2009. At that time, the Forestry Commission believed it could not ban ash imports under EU law because the organism that causes ash dieback was erroneously believed to be already present in Britain.</p> <p>But calls for decisive action also worry conservationists. When the new environment secretary Owen Paterson last week spoke of \"bearing down\" on wildlife to tackle bovine TB, a chill ran through Joyce. He fears the criticisms levelled at Paterson could lead to a \"gung-ho\" desperation to be seen to be doing something \u2013 and the government could order the destruction of every ash tree in infected areas. In a wood such as Ashwellthorpe, this would remove 40% of the wood's trees. This messy job could irreparably damage the forest floor. Burning dead trees (100,000 infected nursery saplings have been burned) would remove rotting timber that provides habitat for beetles and other invertebrates. It would also be frighteningly expensive. Even if the government helped pay for ash extermination, Norfolk Wildlife Trust would then lose other grants and funding because it would be destroying trees.</p> <p>Removing all ash trees in infected sites would also wipe out individual trees that are resistant to it. \"Yes, we need action but not knee-jerk,\" says Joyce. \"We don't want to advocate more dithering, but scientists need to be allowed to study how to control it. Chopping down so many ash trees in a woodland like this would not only be futile in preventing the spread but also highly disruptive and unnecessary.\"</p> <p>The outbreaks in ancient woodlands may provide succour for the beleaguered Defra. Is it possible the spores were not actually brought into Britain by careless trade but were borne by wind across the North Sea? \"It's possible, but the chance of that is absolutely minuscule,\" says <a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/biologicalsci/staff/details/s.woodward#research_interests\" title=\"\">Dr Stephen Woodward</a> of the University of Aberdeen, who has been studying forest pathology for 30 years. \"Some people at the top in Defra are trying to claim that's the way it got here \u2013 it's very, very unlikely.\"</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://icp-forests.net/profile/IbenMargreteThomsen\" title=\"\">Iben Margrete Thomsen</a>, a forest pathologist from the University of Copenhagen, the disease would have eventually reached Britain naturally, probably across the English Channel from Belgium and northern France. But scientists agree the most likely cause of the current outbreak is the extraordinary international trade in trees.</p> <p>Peterken reacts with \"incredulity that people will import ash to plant rather than use local stock\". Ash is \"like a weed. I'm constantly rooting it out of my borders and gutters,\" he says. \"The idea of people going off to Holland or Hungary and buying the things and planting them seems plain crazy.\"</p> <p>The reality is even crazier. The Woodland Trust has been busy with its largest ever tree-planting campaign to create the 460-acre Jubilee Forest in Leicestershire. Like other foresters, the charity asks nurseries for ash from native seeds. Its suppliers comply but some send seeds to the Netherlands to be grown before saplings are returned for planting. Austin Brady, the trust's head of conservation, admits that the charity may have unknowingly bought trees from nurseries that grew British seeds abroad. \"There is a potential we may have been unsighted on that,\" he says. \"We need to get together with other key players and understand the processes in play. We've got a bit of homework to do.\" He hopes the charity's involvement in the round-table summit on tree trade announced by Defra will help it \"get a better understanding of the risks associated with this [importation of saplings from British seed grown overseas],\" he says.</p> <p>What do ecologists think of a tree-planting charity with a commitment to \"supporting, nurturing and encouraging native woodland and making them more robust in the fact of climate change and disease\" in the words of Brady that unknowingly buys saplings grown abroad? \"It's rather unfortunate,\" says Peterken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398680378\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/30/1351619031180/Young-ash-tree-showing-sy-010.jpg\" alt=\"Young ash tree showing symptoms of Chalara fraxinea infection.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young ash tree showing symptoms of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> infection. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew Bronwin, a private-sector forest manager who has planted hundreds of thousands of ash trees for landowners in recent years, likens the exposure of these \"dysfunctional\" aspects of the forestry supply chain to the scandal over foot-and-mouth disease at the turn of the century, when people had no idea of the extent to which farm animals were being transported around the country. \"When you buy something, if it says it's UK provenance you have no idea where it comes from,\" says Bronwin of purchasing young trees. \"We never asked the question [about whether a 'British' tree was actually grown abroad] and we didn't know that was a question that needed to be asked.\" As Bronwin and forest scientists point out, the struggling British nursery industry does not grow enough saplings to meet demand, unlike the Dutch, the great gardeners of Europe, who have invested in infrastructure to grow trees more cheaply than elsewhere.</p> <p>The Woodland Trust is calling for a wider debate about the huge quantities of plants that are traded around the world, all carrying soil and unknown diseases. One study has found that 1.5 billion individual plants were imported into the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy in a year. Tree pathologists such as Woodward want to see Britain introduce a tougher customs regime, like New Zealand, which better weeds out plants known to carry risks of disease. \"I'm not against trade per se, but I'm against things coming in that lead to the collapse of the environment,\" says Woodward. \"It's an immense tangled web of commerce and money that could take years to unravel.\"</p> <p>Can anything be done to stop <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>? Thomsen has bleak news. Movement restrictions of traded trees might slow the disease but destroying all ash trees in infected areas \"is just a waste of money\", she says. \"There is no way you can deal with a fungus that can move by 30km just by spores. You just have to wait. I'm afraid you've had it.\"</p> <p>Like many people, Thomsen did not realise how much of the greenery on the countryside was ash until it began to die in Denmark. \"You can't imagine how awful it looks on these trees. When I travel to Britain, it's so wonderful to see how ash trees are meant to look. It's very sad,\" she says.</p> <p>Ecologists know that the natural world is resilient. Between 1% and 2% of ash trees in Denmark are showing signs of immunity from the disease. Resistant trees can be grown from such stock. Peterken is optimistic that ash will recover more quickly than elm. There are now more individual wych elms around Peterken's home in the Wye Valley than there were before Dutch elm disease. The disease was \"a huge setback as a prominent feature in the landscape and in biomass terms in the woods but elm is still there and it's adapted. My guess is that something like that would happen to ash, only more quickly.\"</p> <p>Change is also a constant in the natural world. As long as the bulldozers are not sent into Ashwellthorpe in a futile gesture against the disease, its beauty will endure even though its doomed ashes won't. \"I come from a school of thought that feels that wildlife is part of the natural world and has a right to exist, but we seem to live in a world where unless we can put a value on it, we think it is not worth anything to us,\" says Joyce in Ashwellthorpe. \"But, actually, places like this are very&#xa0;valuable to people. I come here frequently on my own and every time, whether it's in the spring, summer, autumn or winter, it's always got something special about it and I always&#xa0;go away from here feeling so much better in myself. How can you put a value on that? It's priceless.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was modified on 1 November 2012. The original version incorrectly described a Woodland Trust wood in Suffolk as new. This has been amended. Another sentence was amended to clarify that it is nurseries sending ash seeds to the Netherlands not the Woodland Trust.</p>",
  "<p>This is part of a recording of a meeting held on 25 January, 2011 of residents of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates in Hammersmith and Fulham council (H&amp;F) and a steering group of fellow residents set up and funded by the council to liaise with and represent the interests of the estates' tenants, freeholders and leaseholders whose homes the council wants to sell for demolition as part of the ambitious and controversial Earls Court redevelopment project. The quality is not ideal, but I think its content is pretty clearly audible. </p> <p>Also present at the meeting were: Harry Audley, chair of the White City neighbourhood forum, who was brought in to chair this meeting too; Richard Powell of EC Properties, the wholly owned subsidiary of H&amp;F's developer partner Capco; two council officers; and Nick Johnson, a housing and regeneration consultant whose <a href=\"http://shepherds-bush.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/retired-consultant-gets-710-per-day-for.html\">rather expensive</a> services have been purchased by H&amp;F for a number of housing-related functions in recent years. </p> <p>Johnson's is the second voice that you will hear, ushered in by Harry Audley as \"Nick.\" Johnson's contribution is interesting for a number of reasons. He set out most of the promises the council has continued to make to residents about replacement homes being provided for them within the redevelopment area, strongly backed the work of the steering group, and assured the assembled that the then council leader Stephen Greenhalgh - who earlier this year became the head of Boris Johnson's policing and crime office - had asked him \"to emphasise that he wants you to be very much in control of this process.\" </p> <p>Johnson also referred to the context in which the steering group was set up - the establishment of a passionate and well-organised campaign against the demolition of the estates, and the council's complaints - which continue to this day - that it has been spreading false information and scaremongering.</p> <p>But of particular current relevance is Johnson's exchange three minutes and 50 seconds in with a woman from the Desborough block of the West Kensington estate. This woman is secure council tenant Elsie Webb, 65, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2012/oct/09/earls-court-project-residents-replacement-homes\">who I visited</a> a few weeks ago. Elsie recalled the meeting and asking a man she believed to be a council officer if, in the event of her present flat being demolished, it would be possible for her and her grown up son who lives with her, to be given a flat each.</p> <p>Johnson was not and is not a member of the council's officer staff. However, his role at the meeting makes Elsie's small error understandable and unimportant. He is plainly there to champion the council's point of view. And his reply to Elsie's question is immediate and clear: \"Yes.\" And he eagerly confirms it: \"Yes, it certainly would\"; \"Absolutely. It absolutely would.\"</p> <p>I sent H&amp;F a transcript of the relevant section of the recording and asked if it was appropriate for Johnson to have given such a reply to Elsie. After all, the redevelopment plans subsequently approved by the council make provision for the 760 homes of the two estates to be replaced, but not for additional social rented homes to be supplied, which is what Elsie's son will have to be given if Johnson's encouraging response to her question is to be translated into the action she desires. </p> <p>I also asked H&amp;F if Nick Johnson has given other residents in similar positions to Elsie the same sort of cause for optimism about the future for their adult children wishing for homes of their own. However, it declined to comment on what it termed specific claims and allegations. </p> <p>The council has recently <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/22/hammersmith-and-fulham-earls-court-project-u-turn\">commissioned an investigation</a> into claims that council officers have promised priority allocation of new replacement homes to residents of the two estates in return for their supporting the demolition scheme, following a dossier purporting to contain evidence of such activity being handed to the police.</p> <p><strong>Update, 31 October 2012</strong>. Nick Johnson has written to me to say that he recalls the meeting covered here and making some points about it and what he said that I've reported. With his permission, I quote below the bulk of what he wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>At the time I was the Interim Director of Housing and Regeneration, and was there to lead the Project Team. I remember the answer from this tenant and giving her advice. I recall that this was an older resident who, currently living in a two bedroomed flat, wanted to see if it would have been possible to be rehoused with her adult son, but separately in single flats. </p> <p>Our purpose in arranging the meeting was to provide accurate information to people about their housing options. I was pleased to be able to confirm that we would be able to do that, and indeed the Council had sought to be responsive to this sort of request in the past, where tenants were being asked to move as a result of regeneration proposals in similar schemes.</p> <p>You will appreciate that, at the time of this meeting, many local people were troubled by the most misleading and untrue statements that were being promoted on the estate. People were quite fearful about their housing rights and needed assurance that the Council's proposals would be just and fair.</p> </blockquote> <p>I replied to Johnson asking if he meant that, in effect, what he said to Elsie at the meeting should be understood in a wider context than the Earls Court project, even though this seemed to be the subject under discussion at the meeting. In other words, was he saying that his intention was to assure her that it would be possible for the council to allocate her and her son separate flats in the future, but not necessarily within the Earls Court project redevelopment area? In his reply he wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>We were very keen to reassure people that they would be rehoused properly and be able to stay in the area. In Elsie's case she had said she wanted to stay with her older neighbours - in more suitable accommodation - and was worried about her adult son, who had lived with her for many years. We had agreed to 'split tenancies' like this in the past to enable people to move to the right accommodation to meet their needs, and she wanted to give up her two bedroom home to move to somewhere more suitable for them both. This was fine, and we would have been happy to agree it for her or anyone in a similar situation.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will try to keep in touch with Elsie to see what happens to her and her son.</p>",
  "<p>What will become of Dennis Nilsen's cooker if New Scotland Yard is sold? The pot in which the serial killer from Muswell Hill boiled the heads, hands and feet of his victims in order to remove their flesh and simplify the disposal of their bodies has a home on top of his old cooker in the Yard's Crime Museum. It is part of a display, dating back as far as the 19th century, of articles used in the most sensational of the capital's crimes.</p> <p>The image of New Scotland Yard with which most people are familiar is of the revolving triangular sign outside the unremarkable 20-storey stainless steel-clad office block in Victoria. The sign apparently revolves 14,000 times a day, only slightly faster than the speed with which Metropolitan police commissioners have been replaced during Boris Johnson's mayorship. It is familiar because it is beside this sign that television reporters are required to stand when covering developments within the Metropolitan police (and while trying to ignore the smart alecs making offensive gestures behind them).</p> <p>But it is the <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/history/crime_museum.htm\" title=\"\">Crime Museum</a> inside that remains the most famous part of the building. The original version was the brainchild of an Inspector Neame, who took advantage of the Prisoners' Property Act of 1869, which allowed for the confiscation of criminals' possessions, to put together a museum that maintains its ghoulish allure to this day, not least because it is not open to the public.</p> <p>It was originally called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Museum\" title=\"\">Black Museum</a> by a miffed Observer journalist whose request to visit it in 1877 was refused; its name was later changed, for obvious reasons. Over the years and in different locations the museum has entertained invited guests from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Laurel and Hardy. Apart from Nilsen's cooker, there are mementoes of such cases as those of Ruth Ellis, Neville Heath and John Haigh, who disposed of his victims in acid baths rather than stout pots.</p> <p>The current New Scotland Yard building carries none of the grandeur of fellow symbols of law enforcement such as the Old Bailey, with its gilt-bronze statue of Lady Justice and its magnificent Grand Hall, or the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand. Its gothic predecessor on the Victoria Embankment was designed in the late 1880s by the Scottish architect Norman Shaw specifically as a police headquarters and, as such, had all the imperial pomp one would expect. That building now houses politicians, augmenting the space in the Palace of Westminster, thus maintaining at least a modest link with crime.</p> <p>The current, rather anonymous building, to which the Met moved in 1967, has never commanded the area in the way one might expect of such an establishment. The eternal flame inside the entrance has flickered for decades beside the names of the police officers who have died on duty and its hallway has witnessed the arrival of 11 commissioners and the departures of 10 of them, all with knighthoods to their name.</p> <p>If the building is finally sold off it will be intriguing to see who is in the market for it. Maybe those Americans who bought London Bridge back in 1967 and reconstructed it brick by brick in Arizona will feel like taking down New Scotland Yard floor by floor and item by item, complete with a replica copy of Dennis Nilsen's cooker, and placing it alongside the bridge. Or maybe not.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2012 because the original incorrectly said New Scotland Yard's predecessor on the Victoria Embankment was designed in 1877.</p>",
  "<p>More adults want councils to protect spending on green spaces, including parks and playgrounds, than spending on libraries, youth clubs and helping people find work.

Green spaces near our homes give us valuable places to get to know our neighbours, and build the social glue that reduces crime, says a <a href=\"http://www.groundwork.org.uk/news--events/news/2012/90-of-adults-say-green-spaces.aspx\" title=\"\">report</a> on the benefits of green space. \"High-quality, well-maintained parks and green spaces make a significant contribution to the establishment and retention of stable and law-abiding communities,\" it says. It also states that if everyone had easy access to green spaces, obesity costs to the NHS could be reduced by up to \u00a32bn, and that the calming effect of green spaces has been shown to reduce hospital admissions for mental illness in deprived urban areas in the US.</p> <p>Far-fetched claims? Not if we remember the <a href=\"http://www.towerhamlets.gov.uk/lgsl/451-500/461_parks/victoria_park/history.aspx\" title=\"\">origins</a> of public parks. The first official acknowledgment of the need for my local park in east London came in the 1839 annual report of the registrar general of births, deaths and marriages. Recording a mortality rate far higher than the rest of London, brought about by overcrowding, insanitary conditions and polluted air, he wrote: \"A park in the East End of London would probably diminish the annual deaths by several thousands \u2026 and add several years to the lives of the entire population.\"</p> <p>This was followed by a petition to Queen Victoria urging the formation \"within the Tower Hamlets, of a Royal Park\". The Act of Parliament passed in 1841 made Victoria Park the first in the world specifically intended to meet the needs of the surrounding communities.</p> <p>Today in the UK we don't need parks to prevent diseases spreading, but they still provide a range of vital benefits. So&#xa0;how can we pay for them? The majority of those polled want councils to pay for their upkeep. But 40% said money from sponsorship by local companies should foot the bill. In Manchester, MPs worked closely with major industrialists to bring parks to cities. Is that the way forward 150 years on?</p>",
  "<p>One hundred years to the day after Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring caused a near riot in Paris, the British choreographer Akram Khan will present his interpretation of what was a seminal moment for the arts, <a href=\"http://www.sadlerswells.com/\" title=\"\">Sadler's Wells</a> has announced.</p> <p>Khan, fresh from the Olympic opening ceremony where he devised the piece paying tribute to the victims of the 7 July bombings, has been commissioned to create a new full-length work to mark the centenary of Stravinsky's work that was first performed by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes with choreography by Vaslav Nijinsky.</p> <p>Khan stressed it would be his own interpretation, using his own music and choreography. \"I won't be paying any homage to the existing choreography,\" he said. \"It is a great privilege \u2026 terrifying at the same time.\"</p> <p>The Khan work will be one of a number of Rite of Spring centenary celebrations next year including a festival at the Bolshoi, opening with a new choreography by Wayne McGregor, and 14 different performances of the work at the theatre where the original hoo-hah took place \u2013 Paris's Theatre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es where, in 1913, the unfamiliar sounds prompted audience apoplexy.</p> <p>Khan will zone in on Stravinsky himself \u2013 the work will be called iTMOi (in the mind of Igor) \u2013 and will use 12 performers, but \"not the usual kind of dancers I would take. I'm drawing on different backgrounds, a different experience and expertise.\" They include the French actor Catherine Schaub-Abkarian, a set of twins and a couple of break dancers. There will be an original score by three composers \u2013 Nitin Sawhney, Jocelyn Pook and Ben Frost.</p> <p>The commission was the idea of the Sadler's Wells artistic director, Alistair Spalding, who also announced a programme in what will be the 15th year of the organisation in its current north London home.</p> <p>It will see the late Pina Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal returning after the enormously successful World Cities retrospective jointly staged this summer by Sadler's Wells and the Barbican. The company will perform two works \u2013 Two Cigarettes in the Dark (1985) and Full Moon (2006) in what will become an annual visit.</p> <p>The announcement was made at the launch of the Sadler's Wells annual report, which showed an organisation in good health with an increased number of performances and healthy ticket sales. The report showed that 90% of its \u00a322.8m turnover was generated from earned income and 71% came through ticket sales.</p> <p>All that is in the context of dance's booming popularity in the UK, which prompted Spalding to deliver a note of concern over the government's plans to exclude arts subjects, including dance, from the proposed English baccalaureate. \"This is a great pity as we are currently reaping the rewards that the investment in dance education has brought us \u2026 The route to a career in dance is now under threat. This is against a background in which the artform is thriving. Dance is now second only to football as the most popular activity amongst schoolchildren, and ranks first among girls.\"</p>",
  "<p>Polish investigators conducting the inquiry into the plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others in 2010 have detected \"chemical structures similar to those in high-energy materials such as, for example, explosive materials\" in the wreckage. However these materials could have come from many sources, including pesticides, according to prosecutors.</p> <p>Ireneusz Szelag, head of the military prosecutor's office in Warsaw, said only further tests could determine the source of the structures.</p> <p>The announcement follows a report in Poland's Rzeczpospolita newspaper which claimed traces of explosives including nitroglycerine and TNT had been discovered amid the wreckage of the TU-154 plane. Traces of the chemicals were found on the wings and in the cabin, including on 30 seats, during analysis in Russia, the paper reported.</p> <p>The article triggered outrage in Poland, where suspicion is mounting over the circumstances surrounding Kaczynski's death. More than a quarter of the Poles surveyed \u2013 26% \u2013 believe the president was assassinated, according to a poll published this week.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, the twin brother of the late president and leader of Poland's largest opposition party, Law and Justice, said the prosecutor's statement \"looked like a big lie\".</p> <p>He said the fallout from the crash had caused the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to lose the \"moral authority\" to rule the country and called for his resignation. Kaczynski has previously claimed Tusk botched the investigation into the crash.</p> <p>In a further twist, it was revealed on Monday that a key witness to the investigation had been found hanged. Remigiusz Mus, a flight engineer who had landed a plane in Smolensk airport minutes before the disaster, claimed to have heard two explosions before the president's plane went down.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Justice Leveson's report on the regulation of newspapers following his inquiry into the culture and practices of the press has been delayed until the end of November.</p> <p>Leveson's conclusions and recommendations on the future of press regulation had been expected initially in October but got pushed back to November and now sources say it will be published at the end rather of the month.</p> <p>The exact timetable to which Leveson is working has been a closely guarded secret. He has always said he would report \"in the autumn\", leaving newspaper editors and proprietors on tenterhooks for the past two months.</p> <p>Speculation has been rife that the report could be put back to December but sources say Leveson wants to get it out before George Osborne's autumn statement on the economy on 5 December.</p> <p>There has been intense lobbying in the past few weeks by those in both sides of the debate on stricter press regulation. Some newspapers, notably the Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, as well as politicians including Boris Johnson, have warned of dire consequences if statutory regulation were to be recommended by Leveson and taken up by David Cameron.</p> <p>The two papers are among those backing a new lobby group, <a href=\"http://www.freespeechnetwork.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Speech Network</a>, which launched last week warning that an \"officially regulated press is the glib, easy, dangerous solution\".</p> <p>A Free Speech Network pamphlet said: \"It would spell the slow, painful death of a raucous, audacious and impertinent press able to speak truth to power on behalf of its readers and entertaining enough to secure their loyalty. We would all be the losers.\"</p> <p>The Free Speech Network is opposing the Hacked Off campaign for tougher press regulation being fronted by Hugh Grant.</p> <p>Former BBC chairman Michael Grade told the Daily Mail on Tuesday that press curbs would not have stopped the publication of topless photographs of Kate Middleton.</p> <p>Referrring to Ireland where the pictures were published, Grade said: \"I doubt it has escaped Lord Justice Leveson's attention that the photographs of the duchess were published in countries with regulatory regimes offered as possible solutions for the UK.</p> <p>\"On this evidence, his menu of available options seems to be shrinking,\" said Grade.</p> <p>Tory politicians also appear to be sharpening their knives for a battle over Leveson. On Sunday, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/28/leveson-inquiry-laws-eric-pickles?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">said the government should be reluctant to bring in new laws</a> to regulate newspapers following the publication of Leveson's report.</p> <p>Pickles said the press was working towards a way of offering proper recourse for those with legitimate complaints, adding that the right of newspapers to expose corruption must be protected.</p> <p>He said that ministers must be very careful about introducing statutory regulation if Lord Justice Leveson recommends a new independent watchdog to monitor the press.</p> <p>The Labour party, which helped pressure David Cameron into launching the Leveson inquiry in July last year in the aftermath of revelations that Milly Dowler's phone had been hacked, is likely to back his recommendations \"as long as they are reasonable\", said one source.</p> <p>This source argued that statues governing issues such as defamation and data protection already apply to the press and there is nothing to be feared from a law that gives legal standing to bodies such as the libel resolutions arm of a watchdog.</p> <p>Lord Black, executive director of Telegraph Media Group and chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, which funds the Press Complaints Commission, has also been lobbying against any form of statutory-based system, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/26/lord-black-press-self-regulation?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">warning it could take three years to establish</a>, and possibly longer because of the threat of a legal challenge.</p> <p>During prime minister's questions last week, Cameron said what mattered was an independent regulator that could impose fines and investigate wrongdoing by newspapers.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>For years, Electronic Arts' Need For Speed franchise reminded one of the musical output of Simon Cowell: utterly lacking in merit and derided by critics, yet incredibly popular as a result of assiduously inescapable marketing.</p> <p>Then EA purchased Guildford-based developer Criterion, developer of the much-loved Burnout games, which turned its irresistible talents to 2010's Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, which finally brought some genuine classiness to proceedings, with the result that Hot Pursuit is still played today.</p> <p>Criterion's second bite of the Need For Speed cherry takes the name and vague format from 2005's Most Wanted but, as any gamer would hope, has more in common with Burnout. So to describe it as much-anticipated would be to understate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398577101\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351611804295/Need-for-Speed2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Need for Speed2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Everything in Most Wanted is geared towards encouraging you to explore Fairhaven, which is fine, since it looks drop-dead gorgeous \u2013 even the grotty bits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Luckily, Criterion has honed the art of making arcade-racers to such a rarefied level over the years that Most Wanted justifies the hype with almost contemptuous ease. It takes place in one of Criterion's famed American cities, Fairhaven, which is bigger and richer than any of its previous ones, with jumps galore, elevated freeway sections, docks that are basically sandboxes for hooligans and so on.</p> <p>Your overarching mission is to join the ranks of the 10 most-wanted street-racers in Fairhaven, then work your way up to being a four-wheeled public enemy number one. This is achieved by amassing speed points by winning races, achieving challenges and driving like a nutcase \u2013 pulling off drifts, slipstreaming, escaping the cops' attentions, smashing billboards, passing speed-cameras at unfeasibly high speeds, to name but a few.</p> <p>Unusually, the game's array of incredibly desirable machinery, old and new, is unlocked from the moment you start the game, but there's a twist: you have to find it. Cars you can acquire are located at \"Jacking Points\" throughout Fairhaven, and when you come across them, you can simply jump into them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398577102\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351611737519/Need-for-Speed1-008.jpg\" alt=\"Need for Speed1\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Each car has its own set of races, and if you win them or come second, you don't just get speed points, but car upgrades.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each car has its own set of races, and if you win them or come second, you don't just get speed points, but car upgrades like nitrous (always the prize for winning the easiest race on offer), off-road and racing tyres, lightweight and strengthened bodies, aero kits and much more. You can swap in upgrades according to the type of race.</p> <p>To race, you select one from a menu and the mini-map displays your route to its start \u2013 everything in Most Wanted is geared towards encouraging you to explore Fairhaven, which is fine, since it looks drop-dead gorgeous. It's grimy in places, picturesque in others, and will have you marvelling at how developers have got to grips with milking every ounce of graphics-processing power at this late stage of the console cycle.</p> <p>Stock races are point-to-point affairs with checkpoints delineated by white poles (the circuit-defining chevrons from Burnout are mostly absent). There are ambush races, in which you must escape from the cops as quickly as possible and circuit races that take place both on and off-road. Speed runs pit you against yourself, forcing you to achieve an average-speed target over each course (so you must avoid crashing or being taken down by the cops).</p> <p>Burnout's ability to perform take-downs (or be taken down yourself) is present and correct, and crashes are shown in spectacular glory, although unlike Burnout, you aren't rewarded for crashing spectacularly. Car handling gives you loads of feel, and there is a sense of realism in the handling, yet you would still describe it as arcade-style: braking into corners without lifting the throttle triggers massive (and unrealistic) drifts.</p> <p>The best races, though, are those in which you take on the Most Wanted drivers. They're satisfyingly long, and you're up against skilled drivers in very exotic machinery. And the police are on your case from the start, setting up roadblocks, calling in battering-ram SUVs and dropping tyre-shredders (luckily, you can drive through garages, instantly fixing your car and changing its colour).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398577103\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615499234/Need-for-Speed3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Need for Speed3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Say hello to Fairhaven\u2019s traffic police, the most cowboyish, persistent bunch you're ever likely to come across in a racing game.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fairhaven's traffic police are the most persistent, not to mention cowboyish, on Earth, and they will gang up on you for the slightest driving-law violation, even if you're just indulging in some open-world cruising.</p> <p>Most Wanted is also gloriously meaty. It boasts an even more clever version of Autolog, the system which sets you challenges according to what your online friends have been doing (and more random ones even if you have no online friends).</p> <p>The multiplayer is great: setting up races against friends is a breeze, and it's incredibly easy to jump into sets of races with and against strangers: the game shepherds you to meeting points and has you doing imaginative things like surpassing a collective distance-target for jumps off the roof of a building.</p> <p>Criterion has done it again, setting a new standard for arcade-style racing games which won't be surpassed until the next generation of consoles has been on sale for a while. It actually leaves one feeling a bit sorry for Forza Horizon, which is a very good game, and infinitely superior to its predecessors. But Need For Speed: Most Wanted is, by whatever criteria you may see fit to apply, a great game.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Need For Speed: Most Wanted was reviewed on the Xbox 360</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Dublin.</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Stevie Appleby (vocals, guitar), Faye O'Rourke (vocals, guitar), Donagh Seaver O'Leary (bass, vocals), Adam O'Regan (guitar, vocals), Dylan Lynch (drums, vocals).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Little Green Cars are an Irish country-rock band, but they're better than that sounds, less in hock to cliche, mired in sentimentality and easy tropes. They released their debut single, The John Wayne, in July on the <a href=\"http://www.youngandlostclub.com\" title=\"\">Young and Lost Club</a> label, but are reissuing it this month now that they have a deal with Island in the UK and <a href=\"http://glassnotemusic.com/page/about-us\" title=\"\">Glassnote</a>, the US home of Mumford &amp; Sons and Two Door Cinema Club. They could be really successful, but success of what kind we're not sure. Listening to their debut album Absolute Zero \u2013 produced (at his request, apparently) by Markus Dravs, who has worked with Bj\u00f6rk, Arcade Fire and, most recently, with Mumford &amp; Sons on their latest album Babel \u2013 we can't tell if they're being primed as a mainstream UK version of the Dixie Chicks or as an alt-country thing: there are tracks on Absolute Zero that have more in common with Band of Horses, that are more Brooklyn than Nashville or Texas.</p> <p>The boy-girl harmonies work, and the rousing melodies are in constant supply. Harper Lee, the opening track on the album, due next year, posits the band, still only teenagers, as a latterday Mamas and the Papas (or a more accomplished <a href=\"http://heavenlyrecordings.com/artists/the-magic-numbers/\" title=\"\">Magic Numbers</a>), with a lyric (\"Like a crash I wait for the impact\") that is probably about love but could easily apply to their imminent breakthrough. Angel Owl begins unimpressively before erupting, a cloudburst of harmonies enveloping Stevie Appleby's voice. On his own, on Consequences, Appleby can sound as much like Neil Young as he does <a href=\"http://www.monkeyheaven.com/lookalike_s_neil.jpg\" title=\"\">Neil</a> from the Young Ones, like a dippy cipher. But full marks to Dravs for bolstering the singer and turning it into a lush drama. River Song is a showcase for Faye O'Rourke and suddenly the band come over all Florence, only with an a cappella flourish for the coda before things get too bombastic.</p> <p>They're not afraid to stretch out and mess with the formula. Red and Blue is strikingly different: with its Auto-Tuned male voice intoning mournfully over a churchy organ motif, it's actually closer to the Weeknd than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCElUItrLZc\" title=\"\">Neil's Out on the Weekend</a>. Some of the tracks offer a more reined-in version of that Mercury Rev/Band of Horses brand of cosmic country. Kitchen Floor makes a virtue of its traditional, old-fashioned elements \u2013 notably, the unison male-female vocals and plaintive folk-ish melody \u2013 and by the time the single The John Wayne kicks in with its handclaps, chugging rhythm and story about a boy failing to charm an American teen by being refused entry to a nightclub (so specific it had to be true \u2013 it happened to Appleby), you're sold by the idea of Little Green Cars. Now they've just got to do something about their gauche (lack of) image, but then, don't we all?</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"This superb debut from Ireland's finest new band has put them on the map as ones to watch for 2013\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.recordoftheday.com/record-of-the-day/track.php?trackID=6367\" title=\"\">Record of the Day</a></p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're a Cranberries for <a href=\"http://www.brooklynvegan.com\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Veganites</a>.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Drive their way into the American heartland.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Drive a <a href=\"http://www.toyota.co.uk/cgi-bin/toyota/bv/frame_start.jsp?id=CC2-Prius-landing&amp;gclid=CKXkgZnRqLMCFWbKtAodyUQAoA\" title=\"\">Prius</a>.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut single The John Wayne is released on 26 November by Glassnote/Island.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Band of Horses, Magic Numbers, Lumineers, Mercury Rev.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/littlegreencars\" title=\"\">facebook.com/littlegreencars</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Milo Greene.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Thompson, the former BBC director general, has been accused of \"appearing wilfully ignorant\" about the Jimmy Savile scandal <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/opinion/nocera-the-times-gets-a-new-ceo.html\" title=\"\">by a New York Times columnist</a>, just weeks before he takes over as chief executive of the paper.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/opinion/nocera-the-times-gets-a-new-ceo.html\" title=\"\">Joe Nocera pulled no punches in his piece on the incoming boss on Tuesday</a>, headlined The Right Man for the Job?, which questioned whether the family that controls the paper, the Sulzbergers, had made the right choice in appointing Thompson.</p> <p>In analysing the BBC's decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile's alleged abuse, Nocera asked whether there was a cover-up. \"Plainly, the answer is yes. What is far less certain is how high the cover-up went,\" he said.</p> <p>He noted that Thompson, who was still director general when Newsnight's Savile report was dropped in late 2011, had not asked for details about the content of the investigation when he was told about it last year.</p> <p>\"Given the seriousness of sexual abuse allegations \u2013 look at what it did to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_child_sex_abuse_scandal\" title=\"Penn State sex abuse scandal\">Penn State</a> \u2013 you would think that Thompson and his underlings would immediately want to get to the bottom of it,\" Nocera said.</p> <p>\"But, again, they did nothing. Thompson winds up appearing wilfully ignorant, and it makes you wonder what kind of an organisation the BBC was when Thompson was running it \u2013 and what kind of leader he was. It also makes you wonder what kind of chief executive he'd be at the Times.\"</p> <p>Nocera is a highly respected journalist with a background in business. Before joining the New York Times in 2005, he spent 10 years at Fortune magazine, where he held a variety of positions, including contributing writer, editor-at-large and executive editor. His last position at Fortune was editorial director.</p> <p>Thompson is due to start his new job as chief executive of the New York Times Company on 12 November, but has already been in the building getting to know staff and his name is already on his office door, according to Nocera.</p> <p>Nocera also questioned why Thompson did not act in February 2012, when several British newspapers reported that the Newsnight investigation had been shelved, with claims that this was to protect the BBC's reputation.</p> <p>\"[New York Times Company chairman] Arthur Sulzberger is in a difficult spot. He believes strongly that he's got the executive he needs to lead the Times to the promised land of healthy profits again,\" Nocera said in conclusion.</p> <p>\"Although he declined to be interviewed for this column, he appears to have accepted Thompson's insistence that he knew nothing about the explosive allegations that became public literally 50 days after he accepted the Times job. Sulzberger is backing his man unreservedly.</p> <p>\"For the sake of Times employees \u2013 not to mention the readers who want to see a vibrant New York Times Company \u2013 let's hope his faith in Thompson is warranted. Otherwise, the BBC won't be the only organisation being asked tough questions about its judgment.\"</p> <p>Nocera is the second writer at the New York Times to question whether Thompson is fit to be the paper's new boss in the wake of the Savile scandal.</p> <p>Last week, Margaret Sullivan, the public editor who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\" title=\"\">said in a blog posting</a>: \"[Thompson's] integrity and decision-making are bound to affect the Times and its journalism \u2013 profoundly.

Much like Peter Kay, once he left the ordinary working-class lifestyle it has become much harder to write about that kind of life. He's much funnier these days when riffing off of others, as anyone who watches A League of Their Own will tell you \u2013 he's faster and wittier than in his standup, which is way too measured and slow-paced at times. <br>I think Bishop's standup career is struggling, but because of his ability to think quickly around others he will always have a top-notch TV career \u2026 The best comedians, and the most long-lasting ones, are the ones that don't talk about their own lives in their comedy, or at least don't make it the primary focus. I prefer comedians like Bill Bailey or Ross Noble \u2013 their inherent ability to find comedy in just about anything sets them apart from those that talk about their lives in their comedy shows. </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/23/frankie-boyle-racist-change-of-routine\" title=\"\">Bruce Dessau wrote about Frankie Boyle's victory in court</a>, where he won libel damages in a suit against the Daily Mirror, which had called him racist. The article triggered a(nother) spirited debate about the Glasgow comic's virtues and vices. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19028250\" title=\"\">Kathwg</a> writes:</p> <blockquote> Used to find Frankie Boyle deliciously, wickedly, maliciously hilarious. Then I watched Tramadol Nights and realised it was the same tripe trotted out over and over again, picking on sitting targets and acting rebellious. No one has told [Boyle] that a 40-year-old rich white man picking on handicapped children makes him part of the establishment and a distasteful bully, not a rebel. </blockquote> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19029062\" title=\"\">Markster</a>'s feelings about Boyle has undergone the diametrically opposite journey:</p> <blockquote> I use to hate him because he played on my woefully underchallenged liberal sensibilities, but now I like him; a lot. His slap-in-the-face comedy reminds us that you can't challenge injustice in the world merely by rearranging the dictionary. In a world which thinks buying Fairtrade coffee absolves you of any further responsibility for the shit that gets done, good taste should be the first enemy of the outspoken. </blockquote>",
  "<p>The Financial Times has imposed a recruitment freeze and a ban on all but the most essential travel, to control costs in a tough advertising market.</p> <p>John Ridding, the Financial Times chief executive, outlined the measures in an internal email on Tuesday to the newspaper's senior management group titled \"Cost control/profit protection\", seen by MediaGuardian.</p> <p>The measures, which apply to all staff, include a freeze on recruitment and stricter rules on travel expenses.</p> <p>\"Unless there is a clear commercial opportunity that will deliver this year, or an essential editorial trip, we should let our global network do the work (that is what it is there for),\" said Ridding. \"Only the most vital of journeys will be approved.\"</p> <p>He said that board members will also be focused on finding revenues and saving costs so staff should not take up their time with non-essential and non-urgent requests.</p> <p>The measures will run until Christmas and have been implemented following a marked downturn in the advertising climate, including weak third-quarter performances by Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP and Maurice L\u00e9vy's Publicis Groupe.</p> <p>\"As you'll probably have noticed from recent results publications and statements from advertising agencies and news media groups, the advertising market has taken another turn for the worse,\" Ridding said. \"And while we continue to take market share, it is clear that conditions have become tougher and that the overall advertising 'pie' is under pressure.

  "<p>What did you use your mobile device for this morning? Read the news, write a few e-mails, or catch up on the scores of your favourite team? If you were Oliver Bussmann, CIO of SAP, chances are you approved a 1.7 million euro purchase approval from your iPad. At least, that is what he did the morning I caught up with him in Las Vegas for SAP Tech Ed. The vibrant Bussmann simply stated, \"It's cool, no?\" That kind of mobile cool is just the beginning.</p> <p>Bussmann, the internally focused half of the mobile executive dream team, along with Sanjay Poonen, head of SAP's mobile division, is helping lead the charge to transform the culture and perception of SAP. \"My goal is to have SAP perceived as a cool innovative company, a place you'd want to work,\" Bussmann said. Bussmann understands the importance of perception as it affects brand, trust, and culture. He believes that SAP is on track today. \"We have moved into mobility and other topics that are easy for the public to understand.\" When it comes to the cool factor, Bussmann, borrowing Poonen's phrase, said he wants SAP to become \"the Apple of the enterprise.\"</p> <p>Bussman is just the man to pull it off, too. He has accomplished more over the last twelve months at SAP than most CIOs accomplish in their career in an organisation. Bussmann has won the 2012 European CIO award, 2012 #1 Social CIO, 2012 IT Strategy, WSJ Top 25 Technology Executives, 2012 European IT Workplace, and 2012 Enterprise Architecture. What do all these awards say about SAP? \"It's not all about me, it's about my team,\" Bussmann modestly proposed. \"In 2009 we identified six important strategic areas. These areas included innovation, investing in people and the workplace, and communications internal and external.\" Bussmann noted that \"This is reflected in the awards.\"</p> <p>The lifestyle of an executive of Bussmann's caliber aligns perfectly with mobility and he leverages it to its fullest. Part of being CIO of an organisation with global presence means you are infrequently in the same place for very long \u2013 and rarely in your office. In the past this might have meant there was an impact on productivity or a need to find workarounds to common tasks. Bussmann, however, doesn't seem to miss a beat with the two primary go-to apps on his iPad; SAP Box and e-mail.</p> <p>SAP Box is an internal corporate app that allows users the functionality of a Box or Dropbox, but in a private, secure cloud. For Bussmann, SAP Box offers a central location to store and organise sensitive content. \"I place my day-to-day documents in SAP Box. I have all documents in the order of my day, notes, presentation, et cetera. I have everything with me,\" Bussmann said. He also enthusiastically told me that because of SAP Box he got rid of not one, but two printers he had in his office. \"We have been talking about the paperless office for years and now it is coming true.\"</p> <p>Consuming e-mail is another area where Bussmann gains a huge advantage through working mobile. With all his travel and meetings, e-mail on his mobile devices isn't a convenience \u2013 it's essential. Bussmann gets two to three hundred e-mails per day. As he explained, \"Writing, reading, and organising e-mails is usually faster on my mobile device than on a laptop. On the iPad I can move e-mails back and forth into topics and categories quicker, especially now with iOS 6's VIP folders. This is a better e-mail client; it's easier to organise by subject.\"</p> <p>As a CIO, I was also very curious to hear his take on mobility at a corporate level, outside of his personal use. Bussmann sees mobility reaching the point where redundancies can be eliminated. Bussmann has begun to identify groups that carry both an iPad and a laptop. \"We have to spend more time thinking about certain user groups who don't need laptops anymore. Our first target is the sales personnel,\" he stated.</p> <p>Bussmann views moving business groups to a mobile-only approach as not only a cost-savings measure, through the elimination of multiple devices, but also a productivity move. He does, however, recognise the very real challenges of a mobile-only sales force. As he pointed out, \"Content creation is a challenge. If they have to create a PowerPoint presentation or modify twenty pages, it will be difficult. We are used to using a mouse for that. It will be the same kind of learning curve as moving away from BlackBerry to touch-screen phones. The bottom line is it's a question of how to adapt.\"</p> <p>Adaption is proving to be a real strength at SAP under the guidance of Bussmann. He imagines the future of mobile, when combined with in-memory technology like SAP Hana, will bring about the next leap in business transformation. \"I preach that if you have the ability to look at your business data in real time it will evolve like e-mail consumption; it's always up-to-date and you look at them multiple times an hour. That's the change I predict. You will not only check your e-mail, you will also see how your numbers are doing.\"</p> <p>Bussmann believes that the ability to deliver an individual employee's relevant statistics down to the mobile device will provide an unprecedented business advantage. He predicts that the \"ability to combine mobile and data will define new business value; that you'll always be on top of your business.\" This value will extend from the C-level executives all the way down to interns.</p> <p>Bussmann observed that \"Today, in certain markets, if there is a change, you have to know it immediately and you have to respond immediately because you have an obligation.\" Bussmann is the embodiment of an organisation responding to the changing marketing and technology landscape. With Bussmann at the internal technical helm, SAP will not only succeed in responding to that obligation, but also continue to demonstrate what it means to lead by example.</p> <p>Stay tuned for more mobile insights from the head of SAP's mobile division, Sanjay Poonen.

  "<p>Returning home from a weekend with Agatha Christie in 1934, <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/aboutpenguin_allenlane.html\" title=\"\">Allen Lane</a> stood on a platform at Exeter station looking for a good read for the journey. There were none, and it was from this frustration that he founded Penguin Books. His driving idea was that his paperbacks should be sold at the same price as a packet of cigarettes \u2013 and have just as much appeal.</p> <p>\"Good design is no more expensive than bad,\" Lane declared, a mantra that has guided the publisher ever since. Considering illustrations to be trashy, he set a simple thee-part grid, with colour coded bands \u2013 orange for fiction, green for crime, blue for biographies and pink for travel and adventure \u2013 while text was set in crisp Gill Sans and strictly marshalled into the centre.</p> <p>This rigorous application of colour and geometry, as well as that wonky penguin, hastily drawn from life at London Zoo by the office junior, put design right at the centre of the brand from the very beginning.</p> <p>\"Penguin stood for a democratisation of design,\" says Phil Baines, professor of typography at Central Saint Martins and author of <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780713998399,00.html\" title=\"\">Penguin by Design</a>. \"It marked a change in perception, that design wasn't just for monied people any more. And they were always ahead of the game, always hiring the best people.\"</p> <p>The arrival of German typographer Jan Tschichold in the 1950s and Italian art director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/12/art\" title=\"\">Germano Facetti</a> in the 1960s defined the innovations of these decades. Tschichold introduced a set of <a href=\"http://www.olivertomas.com/books/jan-tschichold-penguin-composition-rules-1947/\" title=\"\">Composition Rules</a> and strict guidelines for the brand identity, designing covers for Kenneth Clark's Modern Painters and the Shakespeare&#xa0;Series.</p> <p>Facetti, who had worked for Domus magazine and Olivetti, sought out a new wave of emerging British talent in the 60s, including <a href=\"http://www.alanfletcherdesign.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Alan Fletcher</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Forbes_%28graphic_designer%29\" title=\"\">Colin Forbes</a> and <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/design/derek-birdsall\" title=\"\">Derek Birdsall</a>, producing <a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/pictures/0,,1752252,00.html\" title=\"\">a series of covers</a> that came to define London's fledgling graphic design scene. He dismissed the approach of commissioning designs on a title-by-title basis as \"the arty-crafty approach of the single beautiful achievement\". For him, the consistency of Penguin's corporate identity was paramount.</p> <p>\"There was an almost paranoid obsession with the brand,\" says Baines, who attributes its iconic success to Lane's controlling fixation with Penguin's image. <a href=\"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2009/september/romek-marber\" title=\"\">Designer Romek Marber</a> developed perhaps the most enduring grid of all, beginning with the crime series in the 60s, which gave illustrators absolute freedom, but retained a certain order at the top of the page.</p> <p>\"The grid was important as the rational element of control,\" recalled Marber in a lecture in 2007. \"The consistency of the pictures contributed, as much as the grid, to the unity of the covers, and the dark shadowy photography gave the covers a feel of&#xa0;crime.\"</p> <p>His crime series stuck to a strict palette of green, overlaid with powerful black photographs, manipulated in various ways.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/images/uploads/2009/09/case_of_the_caretakers_cat_0.jpg\" title=\"\">For The Case of the Caretaker's Cat</a> by Erle Stanley Gardner, the black photos of cats and the hand with a dribble of black ink give the image an ominous, rather creepy feeling,\" says Marber. \"You wouldn't say: 'What lovely two pussies.'\"</p>",
  "<p>I arrive at the London Rent Assessment Panel near Goodge Street for a 9:30am hearing. The building is shiny and new-looking, with light created by the glass-walled offices and hearing rooms. On the wall of the waiting room is an old ward boundary map of the area around the City of London, a reminder that many more people used to live in central London until the end of the 19th century. One of five Rent Assessment Panels in England, the quasi-judicial body aims to settle disputes between private landlords and tenants in London. The hearing room itself is intimate setting with two panellists and the involved parties sitting at tables.</p> <p>The first case is from a tenant contesting a rise in her current rent, which is just over \u00a3600 per month for a two-bed flat near Goodge Street. Like much of the property in the area, the lower floors have been shops and workshops, with the top floor remaining as a flat for some exhausted Victorian or Edwardian shopkeeper to retire to.</p> <p>The landlord, a large property company, gives some background. They purchased the whole building a few years ago and with it came the tenant who was entitled to stay under the law. The landlord wants to upgrade the flat - the rest of the building has been refurbished and they claim the the flat is \"very dated\". The somewhat unknown condition of the flat's interior is the key to deciding how much the rent can be raised.</p> <p>The tenant, an articulate woman in her early 40s, gives her own version of the recent history. The flat goes back to her uncle, a man who became the tenant there in 1965 when there was still a small factory downstairs. She moved in with him and, when he passed away, took on the tenancy herself. According to her, the flat has no central heating or fitted kitchen, and the windows and gutters are also in a poor condition.</p> <p>She repaired the bathroom herself a couple of years ago, as her uncle had done before \u2013 although it has since been clarified that all the repairs should be carried out by the landlord. She takes issue with the comparable flats listed as, \"no one lets flats in this condition\". When asked by the chair, the tenant says the rent should be between \u00a3600-800 (max). The last rent officer estimate was \u00a3678. Overall the hearing was amicable with little disagreement over what would constitute a fair rent, only what the condition of the flat was.</p> <p>The second case is between two self-described \"veterans\" of rent hearings. The basement-flat tenant is contesting a rise in rent from \u00a3280 to \u00a3325 a week. The landlord hands the committee a rent valuation from a valuer, causing the chair to adjourn while everyone reads the new material. The tenant claims he didn't know the valuer was doing a rent valuation and had assumed that it was a valuation for insurance. He then adds a written statement of his own to be read during the recess.</p> <p>The resumed hearing is more standoffish. The landlord says the rent valuation came out as \u00a3450-550 per week. The contents of the valuation seems to cause some amount of confusion among all present. Once the report language and content has been clarified, we move onto the tenant's case. He talks about how longer-term tenancies command lower rent than the six-month contracts which most renters live on. The size of the flat is another bone of contention, as is the restricted light. He concludes by making clear to the committee that when they visit later on that day they're visiting his home. He says he's lived there his whole life: \"It's not just a place where I live. It's a home\".</p> <p>The last hearing is a rare sighting for housing geeks like me. It's one of a dying breed, a historical aberration. The one bed flat is still protected by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/42\" title=\"\">1977 Rent Act</a>, one of maybe 100,000 in the UK that operate the rent controls subsequently abolished in 1988. Under this Act, rents can only rise by an amount liked to the retail price index, what's termed \"Fair Rent\".</p> <p>Unfortunately, the tenant hasn't turned up, so the panel proceeds with the landlord's case. The one-bed flat is in St John's Wood, where a comparable flat would be rented out for \u00a324,000 a year. Just nearby on Abbey Road, a similar flat was being advertised at \u00a323,900.</p> <p>Unlike the previous hearings, it is said to be in a good condition with landlord and tenant both pitching in to maintain the flat. The landlord states that a fair rent under the 1977 Act would be \u00a318,000 a year, a figure close to the \u00a317,000 set by Rent Officer. Without the tenant present the hearing is brief, and the committee arrange to attempt to visit the flat.</p> <p>A recent report for Rightmove said that 30% of renters in London and the south east were paying more than 50% of their take-home pay on rent. In practice this means that renting is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and changes to housing benefit coming in next year are likely to make this work. Despite often being blamed for the decline of private renting in the 1980s, we're seeing a <a href=\"http://england.shelter.org.uk/news/september_2012/Shelter_calls_for_stable_rental_contracts\" title=\"\">clamouring for rent controls again</a>.</p> <p>The tenants and landlords will receive a decision notice within 28 days. The hearings are over by lunchtime, which means the committee can carry out their visits in the afternoon, and decide what the rent should be.</p>",

  "<p>Nobody quite knows what to make of the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/26/italy-5-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star movement</a>\" in Italy which is emerging as the surprise winner of this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/sicily-gay-governor-rosario-crocetta\" title=\"\">Sicilian elections</a>. But one thing is for sure: all the traditional parties are terrified of what might happen in the general elections, which will probably be held in spring 2013. This political movement, led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/10/italy-grillo-swimming-straits-messina-video\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a> \u2013 a volcanic comedian with a huge mop of shaggy greying hair \u2013 is threatening to tear Italy's political establishment apart.</p> <p>The rise of the movement has been sudden. In local elections in May 2012, a Five Star representative was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/21/parma-mayor-pizzarotti-beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">elected mayor of Parma</a>, one of Italy's richest cities, which until the late 1990s was a centre-left stronghold, and was then governed (badly and dishonestly) by Silvio Berlusconi's party for more than a decade. And in Sicily, the Five Star movement this weekend gained more votes than any other party and had 15 regional councillors elected. In typical exuberant fashion, Grillo had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/beppe-grillo-sicily-election-campaign\" title=\"\">swum across the Straits of Messina</a> (3km) to launch his campaign.</p> <p>So, who is Grillo and what is the Five Star movement? The first part is easier to answer. Grillo is 64 years old and from Genoa. He was a popular and clever comedian who starred on Italian TV in the 1970s and 1980s. Then he did something unthinkable: he called Bettino Craxi's Socialist party \"thieves\" on national television. This led to his banishment for a number of years, and in the meantime Grillo built up a huge audience with a series of ferocious shows across Italy.</p> <p>For a long time, Grillo was anti-technology: his show would end with him smashing up a computer. But then he embraced the internet. He understood, before almost anyone else in Italy, the political potential of the web and its ability to undercut the country's stifling and boring media monopolies and party-controlled news outlets. Thus, via his incredibly popular blog, and latterly through Twitter, he began to spread a potent anti-political message. This linked up with both a long-running hatred and distrust of politicians among many Italian voters, and the exacerbation of these deeply rooted tendencies during the Berlusconian era (1994-12), a time of almost obscene levels of corruption, patronage, clientelism and cronyism at all levels.</p> <p>Grillo railed against all this, and he did his homework. He documented absurd levels of state contributions for nonexistent political newspapers, for example, and drew on widespread disgust concerning parliamentary pension rights and payoffs. He attacked both left and right, almost equally. Berlusconi was \"a psycho-dwarf\", Pierluigi Bersani (the leader of the centre-left Democratic party) was a \"zombie\" and \"Gargamella\" (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargamel\" title=\"\">character</a> from the Smurfs cartoons).</p> <p>His language was violent and straightforward, and he organised a number of \"fuck-off days\" of protest against the governing parties (and in fact against all parties). He also attacked big business and called for more shareholder democracy.</p> <p>When the Five Star movement was formed in 2009, Italy was falling apart: still governed by a moribund Berlusconi government, the country was paralysed by corruption scandals on an almost daily basis, while sliding into a deep recession and financial crisis. Not surprisingly, people stopped voting altogether, or began to abandon the major parties. A bestselling book detailed the grotesque waste perpetuated by a robber class of politicians. Its title was eloquent: La Casta, The Caste.</p> <p>Grillo's followers, as far as we know, tend to be young and idealistic. Most of his candidates have no political experience. Many, if not all, have grown up with the internet and use it almost exclusively to communicate and obtain information and news. Grillo's party is both postmodern and post-political. But the Five Star movement combines these new elements with old-style, anti-political populism.</p> <p>Anti-politics has a long history in Italy, going back to fascism itself, and moving through short-lived movements like the Ordinary Man (L'Uomo Qualunque) which briefly emerged in the 1940s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord\" title=\"\">Lega Nord</a> used a highly successful brand of regionalist populism and gained access to power structures at a national and local level as a result.</p> <p>What does Grillo's success mean for Italy? It is interesting to look at the Five Star \"programme\", which is almost entirely negative. The manifesto consists largely of a series of existing laws that will be abrogated on taking power, plus a bit of ecology (Grillo is almost messianic about the environment) and a good dose of euroscepticism. It is not a programme for government. Grillo has nothing at all to say to Italy's 5 million immigrants, and very little to say to Europe. His message is for Italians only, and his violent and anti-institutional language has attracted occasional accusations that he is a \"web fascist\". Others have seen him as an internet-based version of Berlusconi. There are also questions about his control over the \"movement\", which appears to be absolute, and perhaps somewhat similar to the power structures that he is so quick to criticise in others.</p> <p>It may be that the movement will fade and die like so many other populist movements have done. But it could also be true that they are here to stay. Elections are coming up, and the major parties are as unpopular, weak and corrupt as they have ever been. Whatever happens, the Five Star movement can no longer be ignored, and the violent reaction from the political (and intellectual) elite to the rise of Grillo is a clear indication that we need to take this comedian very seriously indeed.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Was it really a hurricane? </strong>No, by the time it made landfall in the US&#xa0;it had been reclassified to a post-tropical storm.</p> <p><strong>Why was it called </strong><a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/Storm-naming.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Sandy</strong></a><strong>? That seems a very fey 1920s name for a hurricane/tropical storm.</strong> There are six lists of names for tropical cyclones in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic, with names chosen mainly for their pithiness. Sandy was on the 2012 list. But once a storm causes destruction on this scale, it is delisted. Like Katrina and Mitch, we have heard the last of Sandy.</p> <p><strong>How great was the death toll? </strong>In the US the number is put at 18 (though that may rise) \u2013 about the same number that died in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-great-storm-of-1987-25-years-on\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a> in the UK. Sandy has killed several times that number in Cuba and Haiti. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, led to more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p><strong>How will Sandy affect the presidential election? </strong>Obama hopes that by flying back to Washington ahead of a rally in Florida and declaring a disaster, he will look presidential. Pundits reckon the storm has blown away&#xa0;any momentum his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, might have had. But it is also likely to deter early voters from turning out, and they tend to be disproportionately Democrat supporters.</p> <p><strong>Might the election have to </strong><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2012/10/could_hurricane_sandy_delay_th.html\" title=\"\"><strong>be delayed</strong></a><strong>? </strong>According to constitutional experts, this is a \"legal black hole\". It has never happened, and law-makers are eager to avoid a postponement, but some experts suggest states do have the right to delay if holding the election on the designated day (6 November) is problematic. If any did so, however, they could open themselves up to challenges by Congress. Given that there is still a week to go and the level of destruction appears to be containable, the odds are that no state will opt out.</p> <p><strong>Why did the lights in the </strong><a href=\"http://thewall.com/topics/51127-while-almost-everyone-else-is-dark-the-lights-are\" title=\"\"><strong>Goldman Sachs building</strong></a><strong> stay on while New York City hospital had to be evacuated when its back-up power system failed? </strong>Because Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm, and a hospital is \u2013 in the last analysis \u2013 just a hospital.</p> <p><strong>What's happening to </strong><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/how_sandy_hits_the_homeless/\" title=\"\"><strong>the homeless</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The New York City Department of Homeless Services relocated nine homeless centres, evacuated more than 1,000 people and made strenuous efforts to encourage the use of shelters, but some of New York's 50,000-plus homeless population preferred to take their chance on the streets, perhaps relying on reflected light from Goldman Sachs Tower.</p> <p><strong>Did the </strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-storm-sandy-crane-idUKBRE89S13X20121030\" title=\"\"><strong>dangling crane</strong></a><strong> next to the luxury apartment building near Central Park ever collapse? </strong>When last seen, it was still dangling. </p> <p><strong>Did no one think that a 50-metre-high crane might pose a risk? </strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane had been inspected and deemed not to be a risk, but that God moved in mysterious ways. \"Just because it was inspected, that doesn't mean God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail.\"</p> <p><strong>What will the disaster cost? </strong>Storm damage is put at about $20bn, of which $8bn will be insured losses. Hefty sums, but only about a quarter of the cost of the damage wrought by Katrina.</p> <p><strong>How will the US economy cope? </strong>Rather well, bizarrely. Destruction is ultimately thought to be good for business, producing investment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.680news.com/business/article/416736--sandy-may-slow-us-economy-in-short-term-but-areas-like-construction-will-benefit-in-long-run\" title=\"\">especially in reconstruction</a> \u2013 that more than offsets what has been lost. Analysts say that in the long term Sandy will give a $40bn boost to the economy. At a macroeconomic level, God does indeed move in mysterious ways.</p> <p><strong>How will the economy of Haiti, which was also battered by Sandy, cope? </strong>The absence of tweeters, bloggers and corporate analysts in Port-au-Prince makes that difficult to answer.</p>",
  "<p>Despite its suburban ideals and cultural dreams of white picket fences, America is a dangerous place. Earthquakes are a part of life for citizens of Californian mega-cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the south-west, gigantic wildfires tear across the landscapes each summer. The midwestern heartland, often held up as the quintessential symbol of small-town American values, is in fact prone to lethal tornadoes. The south \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">now, it seems, New York City, too</a> \u2013 is regularly visited by devastating hurricanes.</p> <p>All of these various forms of natural disaster produce in extremis events for those impacted and give us a glimpse into the true character of the nation and its millions of citizens. The result seems to be that Americans often brush themselves off, put their shoulders to the wheel and quickly start to rebuild. They reach out, help each other, and triumph.</p> <p>Whether it's a town devastated by a tornado or a community burnt to the ground by wildfire, there seems a display of pioneer spirit that has the clean-up underway even before the disaster is over. In the US, unlike many other parts of the world, there is often a focus on creating something new out of the wreckage. The country is notoriously forward-looking and, in the US, rebuilding does not always mean restoring.</p> <p>Just look at the town of Greensburg in Kansas. It was basically <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2007_tornado_outbreak\">wiped out by a tornado in 2007</a> that destroyed 95% of its buildings. Five years later, Greensburg has rebuilt itself as one of the most environmentally sensitive \"green\" communities in the country. Each new city building is built to <a href=\"https://new.usgbc.org/leed/rating-systems\">LEED platinum standards</a>: the first city in America to do so. Out of the disaster, Greensburg was built as something entirely new. How very American.</p> <p>Indeed, in disaster America tends to harmonise two themes, which, in its day-to-day politics, always seem so separate: the role of the individual and the role of government. During an election, those two seem locked in mortal combat, destined to forever fight via their proxies of the Democratic and Republican parties. In disaster, however, they often go hand in hand.</p> <p>No wonder the late great writer Kurt Vonnegut, often held up as America's conscience, praised volunteer firefighters in so many of his books. After all, the small-town firefighting department is an expression of the community as a whole, as it needs to respond to catastrophe. But it's also made up of individual volunteers.</p> <p>\"I can think of no more stirring symbol of man's humanity to man than a fire engine,\" Vonnegut wrote in his classic Sirens of Titan.</p> <p>That is playing out now in New Jersey right now in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. Governor Chris Christie \u2013 usually no friend of big government \u2013 is deploying all the many powers at his disposal to help his fellow citizens. Always so conservative when it comes to respecting individual liberty, Christie has issued mandatory evacuations and welcomed the proffered hand of Washington federal aid.</p> <p>\"I have to say, the administration, the president, himself and Fema Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\" he told a TV interviewer Tuesday morning. </p> <p>There is a Ronald Reagan gag trotted out all the time by Republican politicians. \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help,'\" he quipped. It always gets a laugh. Except when disaster actually strikes. Trying telling that joke to anyone in trouble right now in New Jersey, New York, Virginia or Maryland. They won't be laughing with you. Not even the Republicans among them.</p> <p>Indeed, the main recent catastrophe where America failed to step up to the plate \u2013 the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \u2013 was seen mostly as a failure of too little government help. President George W Bush and his reviled Fema boss Michael Brown were lambasted for not doing enough: for government <em>inaction</em>. The hero of the hour became the National Guard, which swept into the disaster zone to take action: again, a bunch of reservist volunteers who make up a part of government.</p> <p>To see this synthesis of the American individual and American government, you don't always have to look at outright disasters. New York City regularly deals with the sort of blizzard that brings weeks of havoc to countries like Britain. Yet, in New York, the streets are rapidly swept clean and the city shrugs off the storm and gets back to work remarkably quickly.</p> <p>One thing a foreigner always notices is how each shopkeeper or homeowner rapidly comes out and sweeps away the snow outside their building. They are required to do so by law and it does an amazing job of dealing with any blizzard. Each person salts and clears just the patch in front of their building. No more and no less. It's an act of individualism. Yet, it is mandated by government (you can get a ticket for not doing it), and the result is that each individual acts together, as a community, and the whole city leaps back to life.</p> <p>It seems that disaster and crisis provides an opportunity for Americans to blend together their individualism and their communal instincts into something that really works. But if you look at the headlines of the warring political campaigns of the 2012 election, it remains a distant dream for more normal times.</p>",
  "<p>Haiti's government has learned important lessons about responding to natural disasters, say leading charities in the country, but there is still concern about how the Caribbean nation will cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>Haiti has been hardest hit by the disaster so far, with at least 52 people killed and more than 200,000 left homeless as the storm passed by the country at the end of last week before it went on to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">hit the north-eastern United States</a> last night.</p> <p>There are fears of severe food shortages due to rotting crops, as well as infrastructure problems after roads were flooded and homes destroyed.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the [threat level]; it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations would not be able to provide, \"and to provide what is missing\". They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government's response, Raymond said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what the government could do differently, he focused on altering the environment to allow nature to better combat extreme weather events.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It's really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don't think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1032333-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-lisa-laumann-of-save-the-children-talks-to-guardian-s-paul-owen\">Lisa Laumann, Save the Children's country director for Haiti </a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398576430\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351608895921/Lisa-Laumann-Save-the-Chi-004.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Laumann, Save the Children\u2019s country director for Haiti\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Laumann, Save the Children\u2019s country director for Haiti</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laumann explained what happened when the storm arrived last week.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eye of the storm didn't even hit the country. It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain; that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I've hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There's been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diarrhoea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>But she was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \"played a role in preparation and response\", but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \"I don't want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it's important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\"</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \"There certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\"</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \"it's different\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It's hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that's going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond.

With tropical storm Isaac and now Sandy a lot of the crops have been destroyed. There are numerous crops that were ready for harvesting that have now been destroyed. Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \"food insecurity\", with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \"but in the coming months we're going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\".</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Laumann that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they're stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There'll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>",

On the same blog, Philosophy Professor and feminist Falguni Sheth <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/emily-hausers-disgusting-indifference-to-women-of-color/\">looks at Obama's record vis-a-vis women</a>.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> Oliver Stone is releasing <a href=\"http://books.simonandschuster.com/Untold-History-of-the-United-States/Peter-Kuznick/9781451613513?intcmp=l_pl&amp;cp_type=l_pl_books_hub_coming_soon&amp;prefd=l_pl_9781451613513\">a new book</a>, entitled \"The Untold History of the United States\", which highlights key facts in US history over the last century that have been largely ignored or affirmatively distorted. I've read parts of the book and recommend it highly (a summary of his chapter on the Obama presidency <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=F58D791C-7FFF-42B2-9A65-C4E932194C31\">is here</a>). Beginning 12 November, Showtime is broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/sho/oliver-stones-untold-history-of-the-united-states/home\">a 10-part documentary to accompany the book</a>; I've seen the first four installments and cannot recommend it highly enough.</p> <p><strong>(4)</strong> On Saturday, Salon <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/27/the_progressive_case_against_obama/\">published \"The Progressive Case Against Obama\" by Matt Stoller</a> - the former Democratic Congressional staffer and MSNBC producer, currently on Russell Brand's FX show - which offered a scathing indictment of Obama's domestic record and explained why Stoller believes that a vote for a third-party is the optimal course of action. Stoller's piece predictably generated intense reaction: it has been recommended on Facebook more than 13,000 times and has been <a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/10/third-party-nihilism-the-arguments-can-always-get-worse\">viciously attacked</a> in many precincts. That's all perfectly legitimate: he's making a provocative argument that is threatening to Obama's re-election and so it's perfectly understandable that it has been aggressively critiqued.</p> <p>But the well-read pro-Obama blog Balloon-Juice went far beyond legitimate, aggressive critique. Based on that article, the blog <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days\">publicly smeared Stoller as a racist without the slightest basis</a>. The entirety of its smear, contained in a playful \"ps\", is here:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"ps: <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/they-just-never-stop/\">John was spot on</a> about Stoller. We are plagued with self-important white males pretending to speak for progressives even as they work overtime to block and damage any liberal progress. It is hard for me to read Stoller and not wonder if his real problem with Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.charter.net/news/read.php?rip_id=%3CDA25OTHO0%40news.ap.org%3E&amp;ps=1018\">is this</a> and not any policy. Assholes like him make the GOTV effort even more important.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The link over the phrase \"is this\" is to a recently released poll from AP finding that a majority of Americans \"harbor prejudice against blacks\" and that this biogtry could impede Obama's re-election. In other words, claimed this Balloon-Juice writer, Stoller's decision not to vote for Obama is based not on any genuine policy objections (as he claims), but rather on the fact that Obama is black and Stoller is a racist.</p> <p>Amazingly, when numerous readers objected to this smear, the Balloon-Juice writer - deep in the comment section - <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days/#comment-3890199\">repeatedly confessed</a> that he <a href=\"http://www.balloon-juice.com/2012/10/27/10-days/#comment-3890312\">had no basis whatsoever</a> for making that accusation: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"You have a point. It could just be that Stoller is a complete idiot and he comes to his destructive dribble on the basis of his ego and ignorance alone. I do not deny that possibility. It was snark to link to the AP poll on the growing racist attitudes of a majority of white Americans. . . . </p> <p>\"Is Stoller one of them? I really do not know, but it is pretty clear that he has a visceral hatred of President Obama that would make a Teabagger blush. Perhaps his anger is all based on policy. It is possible, but it is not unreasonable to think that some other factors are also influencing his opinions.</p> <p>\"Still, I'll give you the point and accept that fact that it is possible that Matt Stoller is simply a self-absorbed asshole who is too busy thinking about his own 'brilliance' to consider race in his thinking. . . . </p> <p>\"It is also a fact that a decent number of white folks who call themselves progressives have racist attitudes. I suggested that that could be an alternative explanation for Stoller's idiocy. It was snark and troll bait. I do not know the truth of Stoller's attitudes about race and neither do do you.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite those confessions, the public smearing of Stoller as a racist remains on that blog, completely unretracted and uncorrected (the fact that Stoller echoed and/or relied heavily in making his arguments on non-white and non-male writers like <a href=\"http://translationexercises.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/emily-hausers-disgusting-indifference-to-women-of-color/\">Sheth</a> and <a href=\"http://blackagendareport.com/content/freedom-rider-not-voting-obama\">Margaret Kimberley of the Black Agenda Report</a> is revealingly ignored).</p> <p>There are few things more reckless and disgusting than publicly smearing someone as a racist - easily one of the worst things you can say about someone in America, for very good reason - purely for partisan gain. That's especially true when you are well aware that you have no basis for the accusation.</p> <p>For years, neocons did the same thing with \"anti-semitism\" charges. They seized on a real and serious problem - anti-semitism - and converted it into an exploitative, opportunistic weapon to punish those who deviated from their political views, particularly on Israel. The worst part of that behavior - aside from ruining people's reputations by casting them as bigots without any cause - is that it dilutes the power of that term and makes it no longer effective to use when it actually appears. </p> <p>That is precisely what spouting <strong>knowingly baseless </strong> accusations of racism achieves. Obviously, racism plays a substantial role in motivating <em>some </em>of the hostility toward the first African-American president, just as anti-semitism plays a role in <em>some</em> hostility toward Israel. That's precisely why it's so vital to avoid casually exploiting those terms for gross partisan opportunism: because people will stop taking the terms seriously when they genuinely arise. </p> <p>This happens often, but this case is particularly egregious given the accuser's admissions of baselessness in the comment section, combined with the total lack of retraction or correction by that blog.</p> <p><strong>(5)</strong> The New Republic's Jeffrey Rosen, the consummate establishment-revering centrist, <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/109359/the-supreme-court-exposes-the-obama-administrations-circular-logic-wiretapping#\">reviews the Supreme Court's oral argument yesterday</a> in the constitutional challenge brought by the ACLU against the FISA Amendments Act, the 2008 statute enacted by a large bipartisan majority that, in essence, legalized many of the Bush/Cheney warrantless eavesdropping powers. In particular, Rosen reviews the warped tactic of the Obama DOJ to simultaneously (1) keep the list of eavesdropping targets secret and (2) argue that an individual unable to prove that they've been targeted by the eavesdropping is barred from challenging its constitutionality: an obvious Catch-22 that removes secret executive branch actions from judicial review - i.e., from the rule of law - and has been used repeatedly by the Bush and Obama DOJs to shield its conduct from scrutiny.</p> <p><strong>(6)</strong> An <a href=\"http://www.tinyrevolution.com/mt/archives/000742.html\">old post</a> of Jonathan Schwarz's, from 2006, documents how frequently - really, reflexively - western invaders claim that their invasions are for the good of the invaded populations and are even called for by those populations. Related to that, and based in part on Schwarz's work, I gave a 30-minute speech a few months ago at the University of Chicago on the fraudulent concept called \"humanitarian war\":</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MMirTxSlhBA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MMirTxSlhBA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>(7)</strong> I have a few speaking events coming up this month.

  "<p>The chief executive of Manchester city council, Sir Howard Berstein, has warned councils that localism is \"meaningless\" because central government departments still do not recognise the role of local government in generating economic growth.</p> <p>Speaking at the Guardian's third Local Government Leaders Quarterly event in Manchester last week, Sir Howard told senior staff that, while councils are willing to adapt to save money, Whitehall remains closed to working with local government \u2013 undermining the localism agenda.</p> <p>\"These are fundamentally the same problems that we've had with successive governments over the last 20 years,\" he said. \"This current government is probably a little bit smarter because it has managed to develop a headline or narrative around localism, which is meaningless in the context of what it's trying to do.</p> <p>\"I think the real issue is culture, the cultural barriers effectively within Westminster and the civil service who don't get local government. They are opposed to it because many of the departments of state do not recognise local government as having a substantive role in shaping policy. That needs to change.\"</p> <p>Sean Harriss, chief executive Bolton council, one of 10 councils that make up the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/15/greater-manchester-combined-authority-regional\" title=\"\">Greater Manchester Combined Authority</a>, highlighted the need to reduce dependency on public services if councils are to reduce spending. He said rising welfare bills illustrated how local government spending was ploughed into meeting the \"cost of failure\", but there were few incentives today for councils to tackle entrenched local problems.</p> <p>\"If local government chooses to invest heavily and brings huge changes to bear to the exchequer, none of the benefit flows back [to the council] through the system.\"</p> <p>This could be a particular problem for the troubled families programme. Harriss called instead for a new investment agreement or earn back schemes that would see savings filtered back to local government.</p> <p>\"There are,\" he added, \"a whole series of perverse incentives in the system, so, unless you can transfer the ability to spend and work things through on a place-based basis, then there will always be a perverse incentive to not allow you to manage the amount of resource better than in the past.\"</p> <p>Michael Mousdale, partner at Trowers &amp; Hamlins, highlighted the importance of the combined authority in Manchester but warned that shared services elsewhere had not been a success for local government because too little was left to the will of each council. He said: \"If there was more compulsion from central government, like there is in Wales, then we might have a different story.\"</p> <p>The select audience of senior local government professionals also heard from Geoff Muirhead, chair of the Northern Economic Futures Commission, who emphasised that growing local skills to create wealth is the only way to fill the local government economic black hole. He also called for some continuity from government.</p> <p>\"We can't keep changing the way we deliver economic growth like we have in the past. What we've got we should stick with and give it a chance to work.\"</p> <p>After a panel debate, the audience took part in one of four roundtable discussions to share ideas on the following issues. These discussions took place under the Chatham House rule.</p> <h2><strong>Innovative funding models and the local economy</strong></h2> <p>The discussion focused on the implications of charging residents for some services, although it was agreed that it would be difficult to decide which services could fall into this model. There is a need to move towards making this idea palatable to staff working in the sector as well as users of public services.</p> <p>It was agreed that local government must remain an advocate for the most vulnerable people in society but that there is a need to remove perverse incentives to early prevention that exist in current systems, and to become less risk-averse when it comes to investment opportunities.</p> <h2><strong>Localism: rhetoric or reality?</strong></h2> <p>Delegates were in agreement that localism must be defined by each area individually, as it might mean something very different in a city to a small village community. The need for good local decision-making was raised because, when more control is given to local authorities, political infighting might hamper this process.</p> <p>Though there is some scepticism around the concept, it is essential that all elements of local government work together in order to deliver better services and that localism can help that process. Parish councils could offer a way to involve more local people in decisions made on their behalf, and there was broad agreement that localism has always existed in some form.</p> <h2><strong>The cost of adult care</strong></h2> <p>Adult social care is one of the major challenges facing councils in the years to come, and this was the main point of discussion for the group. The possibility of a two-tier local government system where authorities provide care only to those who are vulnerable was debated at length.</p> <p>The idea that councils do not properly consult service users about their care, instead \"doing to\" rather than \"with\" clients raised concerns. Personal budgets could provide an answer, but local government must see people as assets, not subjects of policy. There must be a dramatic change in the way councils think about and deliver adult social care while managing the expectations of the public.</p> <h2><strong>Digital innovation and economic development</strong></h2> <p>There must be a long-term investment in digital skills in order to innovate and make the most out of technology. The role of education and skills was raised as a good way to help small businesses, by placing young IT apprentices with companies in order to help them make the most of emerging markets overseas and online.</p> <p>The benefits to young people would also include a cut in unemployment in local communities and more opportunity for people to get ahead in a strong industry. Delegates also discussed ways to encourage residents back into local town centres, including shops maintaining an online presence but selling most goods in store.</p> <p><em>This quarterly event was designed and produced by the Guardian to a brief agreed with event sponsors BT, Serco, Solace and Trowers &amp; Hamlins</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> to sign up first for our future events in London and across the country</strong></p>",
  "<p>They're calling you \"the Scorsese of Lagos\" \u2013 no pressure then. That's what the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/magazine/nollywood-movies.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) on Nigerian director Kunle Afolayan (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1875051/\" title=\"\">New York Times</a> recently headlined its piece, and Kunle Afolayan's ambitions to shake up the industry now known (more great expectations) as Nollywood. With three films under his belt since he started directing in 2005 \u2013 which, by frantic west-African standards, makes him more the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/stanleykubrick\" title=\"\">Kubrick</a> of Lagos \u2013 the 38-year-old has become a byword for elevated quality: shooting on 35mm, releasing in cinemas, trying to improve on horribly stilted Nollywood formulas that seem to place more emphasis on gaudy soft furnishings than on dialogue and camerawork.</p> <p>Actually, Afolayan would prefer it if you called him the Mel Gibson of Lagos. \"I always show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jan/05/actionandadventure.drama\" title=\"\">Apocalypto</a> to my crew, because of the language thing. I say to them: 'You don't necessarily have to shoot your film in English for it to be good. You can do Swahili, you can do any language, you can even do no language at all.'\" Gibson's not an obvious renaissance-man idol \u2013 but crossing boundaries, having international aspirations, is the path forward for Afolayan and what is becoming known as the New Nollywood. The old Nollywood had no time for film festivals. When I speak to the director, he's just touched down in Amsterdam for the <a href=\"http://africainthepicture.nl/en/en-1\" title=\"\">Africa in the Picture</a> jamboree, where he is shopping his comedy drama <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC_un9NgnG0\" title=\"\">Phone Swap</a>. Next up is London, for the <a href=\"http://www.filmafrica.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Film Africa festival</a>.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying it's the perfect film. I'm not saying it's the best thing that's ever happened to Nollywood. But it's totally different to what everyone else has done,\" Afolayan says of Phone Swap. It goes without saying that it's shot on film \u2013 a must for any hope of international distribution. And it has what sounds like the sort of sparky commercial premise that will give it high-concept traction beyond Nigerian borders: a country girl and a Lagos businessman fall in love in absentia after they pick up each other's BlackBerrys at the airport. Afolayan says he tried to steer clear of the overripe visual humour and slapstick that has dogged traditional Nollywood comedy.</p> <p>Phone Swap is a departure for Afolayan, as well as the industry. His first two movies, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB9iol0G2sM\" title=\"\">Irapada</a> (Redemption) and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPa9aRwdzKs\" title=\"\">Araromire</a> (The Figurine), were self-originated stories rooted in juju, the supernatural folklore tales Naija audiences never tire of. But he had to pitch for Phone Swap at an advertising agency, who were taking proposals on behalf of Samsung, who saw a branded Nigerian feature as a piece of potentially hot marketing in the last half of the noughties, when Nollywood was really hitting the global consciousness. Samsung later dropped out, but Afolayan, who won the pitch, went ahead with other corporate sponsors, most importantly BlackBerry. His various \"partners\" provided about 40% of the $500,000 budget; the rest came from his bank loans and his own pocket.</p> <p>Afolayan has few of the artistic hangups about taking corporate money that exist in the west \u2013 which isn't surprising when money is so difficult to raise and to recoup. New Nollywood budgets, driven by well-to-do production values, are beginning to creep beyond $500,000, but the lack of cinema screens in Nigeria (there are currently 10 mainstream cinemas) makes good returns far from certain. The Figurine only took about two-thirds of its budget back. Mahmood Ali-Balogun's recent marital drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/aug/21/why-nigeria-film-cant-square-up-hollywood\" title=\"\">Tango with Me</a>, also earmarked as a possible international breakout, failed to break even too. In fact, it's rare for any local film to take more than $200,000, according a <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/sydneylevine/the_myth_of_nollywood_and_the_rise_of_nigerian_cinema\" title=\"\">report compiled for Unesco by Nollywood expert Rob Aft</a>.</p> <p>There's an ingrained perception in Nigeria that anything other than the traditional Nollywood model \u2013 no-frills budgets between $15,000 and $75,000, and a smash-and-grab 14-day distribution window on VCD \u2013 is doomed to failure. That conservatism, most entrenched in the producing guilds who form Nollywood's power base, is what Afolayan is aiming to overcome. Ten more cinemas are on the way, and he thinks that will be enough to make New Nollywood-level budgets viable. \"I'd say we are pretty close. Even if your budget is $1m, you should be able to recoup it in the country. Because we have a huge market, and they know what they want, and when they see it, they go for it.\"</p> <p>He reckons The Figurine \u2013 which has some bursts of cinematic flair that suggest its director may indeed have been scrutinising Mel of the Jungle \u2013 made other producers take notice. Evidence suggests that Nollywood's turnover has dropped by at least 50% over the last couple of years \u2013 perhaps a sign that the days of profligate output are ending. Phone Swap, released in Nigeria in March, has made 80% of its costs back, with DVD and foreign releases still to come; another message to Nollywood that quality pays.</p> <p>Afolayan's reforms are motivated by childhood memories of a golden age: he is the seventh of the 25 children of Adeyemi \"Love\" Afolayan, a postwar theatre and cinema impresario who had 10 wives and died in 1996. Afolayan Jr grew up accompanying his father on \"carnivalesque\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8t8Ap5L0e8\" title=\"\">1970s film shoots</a> that often featured thousands of extras and lasted two or three months. \"I grew up seeing how film was properly done,\" he says. \"I had no idea what film-making was all about, but I saw the commitment from actors, I saw the commitment from crew.\" But the infant Nigerian film industry collapsed due to the lack of a feasible economic model, and didn't recover until the mid-1990s, when cheap video technology gave rise to Nollywood.</p> <p>The director trained as a banker, but got into the film business in 2005, initially as an actor. Amid the Nollywood mania, resisting the urge to direct wasn't easy. \"I wanted to stop complaining about what people did: let me see what I can make out of it. What you can do to start out is to capitalise on what people are not doing right. No matter how little it is, even it's just one step ahead.\"</p> <p>Nollywood could be about to take a giant step ahead, thanks to that recollection of the glory days. Afolayan is aiming to shoot October 1st, a serial killer movie set in 1960 against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.punchng.com/news/independence-day-speech-1960-nigeria-stands-upon-firm-foundations-balewa/\" title=\"\">Nigerian independence</a>, in February, but he is trying to secure a foreign co-producer outside the country first, to better his international chances. \"It is difficult to get a mainstream distribution deal, no matter how fantastic your film is, because it's a cartel, it's a clique,\" he says, \"If you don't belong, it's tough.\"</p> <p>His battle to set an economic precedent for Nollywood phase II could be as important as anything he puts up on the screen itself \u2013 and with his background in finance, he's well placed to achieve his goal. Werner Herzog once said that the <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/arion/on-the-absolute-the-sublime-and-ecstatic-truth/\" title=\"\">ecstatic truth</a> \u2013 the poet's kind \u2013 trumps the accountant's truth.

  "<p>Why does it seem the 2012-13 NBA Season has begun ridiculously early? Oh that's right, there was that lockout last year that almost sabotaged the entire season and ensured that games didn't begin until Christmas. This year, the NBA is operating right on schedule, with the regular season beginning Tuesday 30 October. With no labor strife, we have a full slate of basketball goodness ahead.</p> <p>We've already had a full month of preseason. Everybody has been watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjf2phkUQZc\">Nate Robinson hitting game-winners</a> and other such deeply meaningful heroics, right? That's way more exciting than things like the MLB playoffs, the NFL and college football... </p> <p>Okay, maybe this NBA preseason hasn't quite gotten your attention, especially when compared to the entertaining run the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics-2012-basketball\">USA Men's basketball team pulled off at the London Olympics</a>.</p> <p>For those who have had better things to do than focus on offseason drama and \"imaginary basketball\" (as I call the preseason), we present our NBA preview. We'll break down some of the main storylines for each team, a guide to what has happened since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/22/miami-heat-oklahoma-city-thunder-live-game-5\">the Miami Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals</a>. For instance, did you know that LeBron James and Kevin Durant are good at basketball? It's true! Where else will you get cutting-edge analysis like that? </p> <p>(Next up: An in-depth analysis of how the NBA's <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/10/17/3517348/nba-basketball-pregame-handshake-hugs\">crackdown on lengthy handshakes</a> will alter the potential playoff landscape.)</p> <h2><strong>Eastern Conference</strong></h2> <h2>Atlantic</h2> <p><strong>1 Boston Celtics</strong>: </p> <p>The New Big Three era in Boston is officially over. Ray Allen, upset over being replaced by Avery Bradley (aka <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/mar/29/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-donald-sterling\">\"My Guy\"</a>), accepted a bench role with the rival Miami Heat despite the fact that the Celtics offered him more money in the offseason. This makes for potentially great drama, especially now that <a href=\"http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2012/10/ray-allen-says-beef-with-rajon-rondo-began-in-2009/\">he and his former teammates are already jawing</a>, but it distracts from the very real possibility that this Celtics team could be just as good as they were last year, even if only Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett remain of the championship-winning trio.</p> <p>That seems a bit strange, of course, considering that they are down a Hall-of-Famer and an already almost ancient team has gotten a full season older, but stick with us. Once Avery Bradley is healthy he could have a good shot at replacing Ray Allen's production. Jeff Green, a year removed from heart surgery, should be nearly as healthy as his new contract. Jason Terry and Courtney Lee should be solid contributors and the absence of the back-to-back games of last year's condensed schedule might allow the older players to save their legs a bit. This was a team that needed just one more win \u2013 if against a Heat team featuring LeBron James in Berserker Mode \u2013 to advance to the finals.</p> <p>If the Celtics are one win better it will be because Rajon Rondo has finally taken that next step and become the elite player he has shown flashes of being. It seems every year that the take on the C's is \"they need Rondo to step up\", but this year it's not just a thing experts say, it's an absolute imperative for an aging team without the best three-point shooter of all time. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/nba/story/_/id/8510892/rajon-rondo-steps-shadows-boston-celtics-leader\">Rondo is going to need to be a leader</a>, he's going to have to be a more offensive threat and he's going to have to cut down on his on-court mental lapses. With the New Big Three era over, it's officially Rajon Rondo's team and its fortunes rest with him.</p> <p><strong>2 Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p> <p>The dust settled on the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8256377/dwight-howard-traded-los-angeles-lakers\">Dwight Howard Trade</a>, and somehow the Philadelphia 76ers ended up with Andrew Bynum. It sounds like a deal to get one of the last true centers in the game until you realize that they also lost Andre Iguodala in the transaction \u2013 he's gone to the Denver Nuggets. The downside to Bynum is that he is injury prone, has a reputation of having motivation problems and is known to make dumb comments. The good news is that Philadelphia fans are known to be incredibly patient with such players. </p> <p>The 76ers were good enough last year to make it to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they played the Celtics in what may have been <a href=\"http://nbagrapevine.com/teams/east/atlantic/boston/boston-celtics-vs-the-philadelphia-76ers-bring-the-ugly/\">one of the most plodding seven-game series in modern NBA postseason history</a>. (This is coming from a writer who had rooting interest in the whole thing, mind you.) Are they a better team now, considering they basically swapped Iguodala with Bynum, amnestied Elton Brand and added Kwame Brown? Well they just needed one more postseason win to make it to the Eastern Conference Finals, so the answer is a solid \"maybe\".</p> <p>It depends on whether or not Bynum flourishes. He did have the best season of his career last year (including a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vh_mVeG7WA\">playoff triple-double </a>over the Nuggets) despite conflicts with Lakers coach Mike Brown and his premature statement that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z729HvMq9AU\">\"closeout games are easy\"</a>. If he remains healthy and keeps his head straight then sure, but does anyone want to take bets on Bynum remaining healthy? If he isn't, Michael Vick will have some company as the biggest target on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeWIPCaller\">Philadelphia sports radio</a>.</p> <p><strong>3 New York Knicks</strong></p> <p>Status: officially sane again. Yes, Linsanity no longer reigns in New York, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/02/jeremy-lin-linsanity-houston-rockets-new-york-knicks\">Jeremy Lin has gone to the Houston Rockets</a> \u2013 the Knicks management* did not bother to match Houston's offer. Don't worry Knicks fans, New York has made some great signings to make up for the loss of what was the best thing to happen to the franchise in years. For instance, they signed the now-ironically named Jason Kidd and <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/knicks/index.ssf/2012/10/knicks_links_rasheed_wallaces.html\">Rasheed Wallace</a>. Hey wait, don't turn your attention to Brooklyn just yet.</p> <p>We know that doesn't really sound very promising. Don't worry, all it will take for the Knicks to pass the first round of the playoffs for the first time in years is for Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire to learn how to play with each other. That seems simple enough, right? The catch is that the growing consensus is that Stoudemire had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/03/amare-stoudemire-fire-extinguisher-paul-pierce-tebows\">more chemistry with the fire extinguisher that broke his hand</a> last postseason than 'Melo. Not that it will matter in the beginning of the year, as Stoudemire will be out with a knee cyst.</p> <p>More worrisome might be the health of Tyson Chandler, the reigning defensive player of the year (which somehow translates to only <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/19852/tyson-named-to-nbas-all-defensive-second-team\">second-team defensive all-star</a> in NBA math), who was last seen <a href=\"http://lindyssports.com/nba/new-york-knicks/article/headline/knicks-tyson-chandler-injures-knee-leaves-arena-on-crutches/48533\">leaving a preseason game on crutches</a>. If Chandler is healthy, that gives New York a chance: even if Anthony and Stoudemire don't mesh, they're still going to score a bunch of points. As long as they get something out of the point guard position, the Knicks should get into the postseason and might have a chance to take it to the next level. Mind you: that next level might just mean getting bounced in the second round of the playoffs.</p> <p><em>* Note: There is a a school of thought that \"Knicks management\" is, in fact, an oxymoron. Also: Rasheed Wallace, Kwame Brown and <a href=\"http://freedarko.blogspot.com/\">Darko Milicic</a> (currently with Boston) are now all in the same division, which is a score for people whose jobs involve making basketball jokes.</em></p> <p><strong>4 Brooklyn Nets</strong></p> <p>Forget Dwight Howard \u2013 the biggest trade of the offseason occurred when the New Jersey Nets traded states. Yes, the Nets said goodbye New Jersey and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hellobrooklyn\">#helloBrooklyn</a>, and that was just the start of their identity change. Owner Mikhail Prokhorov's team bears only a little resemblance to the old New Jersey team. After bowing out of the Dwight Howard sweepstakes by re-signing oft-hurt center Brook Lopez \u2013 and aren't they all oft-hurt these days \u2013 the Nets decided to build around a resigned Deron Williams and to trade for Joe Johnson and his ridiculous contract. Like that movie in which Ryan Reynolds played Green Lantern, Johnson was ill-suited for the savior role with the Atlanta Hawks. Although vastly overpaid as Williams's sidekick, he still makes the perfect second option for the new-look Nets.</p> <p>The Nets aren't really worried about money right now \u2013 they're more concerned about gaining buzz. On that front, they have not only moved to a hip new location, they even have pop-culture icons! Not only is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_-VaTHpc8\">Jay-Z </a>a part-owner (Okay, he owns like a millionth of the team, but that's something), but the team also features former \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" cast member Kris Humphries. Okay, he's not as popular as Jay-Z \u2013 in fact he's the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/nba-player-kris-humphries-booed-nets-game-divorce/story?id=15214316\">Most Hated Man In the NBA</a> \u2013 but there's almost no such thing as bad publicity for a team trying to position itself as the new, big deal in Brooklyn.</p> <p>Ultimately, the Nets have enough novelty, talent and name recognition to make their debut season a hit as far as getting attention goes. What they don't have is a roster constructed to make them a serious threat to reach the NBA Finals or<a href=\"http://www.hoopsworld.com/brooklyn-nets-team-salary/\"> the cap space</a> to ensure that they will have such a team in the near future. In other words, the Nets are no longer in New Jersey but, well, they're still the Nets.</p> <p><strong>5 Toronto Raptors</strong></p> <p>The good news for the Raptors is that they're still the best basketball team in Canada and the best sports franchise whose name was inspired by Jurassic Park. The other good news is that they should be a little bit better this season, especially with the addition of Kyle Lowry, formerly of the Houston Rockets. The young point guard's presence promises that the Raptors will be a more interesting team to watch than you might expect and they could even flirt with the eighth seed in the East, but he's not enough to make locals less depressed about the hockey lockout.</p> <p>The most Raptors thing in Raptors history happened during this offseason, by the way, when they signed shooting guard Landry Fields to a $20m, three-year deal as part of <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/raptors-offer-landry-fields-three-20-million-deal-043335409--nba.html\">a complicated gambit </a>to woo point guard Steve Nash. You can't blame the Raptors for wanting to have the best Canadian basketball player ever on their team, but Nash ended up with the Lakers. So now one of their highest-paid players is somebody they didn't even really want. They are almost lovable, these Raptors.</p> <h2><strong>Central </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Indiana Pacers</strong></p> <p>The Indiana Pacers had a lot of success last year, but there's some thought that they could come back to Earth. Last season's team, who were something of a surprise, featured such medium names as Danny Granger, Paul George and David West. In fact, the Pacers might be second only to the Oakland A's in baseball as far as contending pro-teams featuring anonymous-sounding players. One big key to their success was Roy Hibbert, who continues to quietly be one of the few true centers left in the game (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c4hY8mQM6Y\">and the only worthwhile Gangnam Style parodist out there</a>).</p> <p>With all this success, the one obstacle that could prevent the Pacers from building on last year's success would be their health. To quote Beckley Mason in ESPN: The Magazine (so named as not to be confused with ESPN: The Towel Holder or ESPN: The Gluten-Free Candy Bar): \"Paul George, David West, Granger, Darren Collison and Roy Hibbert played 1,000 minutes together \u2013 or 253 more than any other NBA teammates spent as a unit\". That's a great thing to happen, but it's not something Indiana can realistically expect to happen in back to back seasons.</p> <p>A nice story for the Pacers might be the addition of Gerald Green, the second-biggest story about a D-League washout becoming a solid contributor. Green didn't have a Jeremy Lin sized impact \u2013 who else could \u2013 but he proved to be a solid pro-level contributor for the New Jersey Nets and he was responsible for the No1 non-Blake Griffin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LipvtaK41mw&amp;feature=fvst\">Dunk of the Year</a>. So, if the Pacers' luck turns and they start suffering a lot more injuries, there's a feelgood story to follow. A feelgood story with dunks.</p> <p><strong>2 Chicago Bulls<br></strong><br>When will Derrick Rose return? Okay, there are other questions to ask about the Chicago Bulls, but that's the key one, isn't it? The other key questions are: When he returns this season (<em>if</em> he returns this season) what will the Bulls be playing for? Will he be anything approximating the Derrick Rose of old? Will he ever be as good as he was before he tore his ACL? For most of the season, Rose will be the post-structuralist critic's dream, the presence notable for its absence.</p> <p>You know, like Charlie in Charlie's Angels. <a href=\"http://chicagoist.com/2012/09/13/derrick_rose_unveils_new_shoes_gets.php\">Except with really cool shoes</a>.</p> <p>So, assuming that Rose is out for most of the season, and won't fully be himself when he does return, head coach Tom Thibodeau will have an opportunity to live up to his budding reputation as a basketball genius. Luckily, the Bulls are gifted with a few pretty great players, most notably Luol Deng and Joakim Noah. Still, the Bulls are going to be much farther from the championship this year than they were last year before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/29/derrick-rose-injury-chicago-bulls-acl\">the ACL Injury That Changed Everything</a>. Chicago could have been the team to knock off LeBron James and the Miami Heat? Now, now it's a team whose championship hopes are resting on Rose's uncertain legs.</p> <p><strong>3 Milwaukee Bucks</strong></p> <p>The Bucks finally decided that the Andrew Bogut roller coaster had to come to an end, mostly because that ride was always shut down for repairs. So Milwaukee traded their oft-injured center (along with Stephen Jackson) to the Golden State Warriors for the talented but beyond erratic Monta Ellis. Ellis will be a lock to bring a bit of Warriors basketball to the Bucks: lots of offense, little defense and a lot of on-court ridiculousness, both good and bad, that will ensure his name is continually trending on Twitter (<a href=\"http://bayarea.sbnation.com/golden-state-warriors/2011/1/12/1932331/monte-ellis-not-monta-ellis-twitter-trend\">albeit misspelled as Monte</a>).</p> <p>Ellis joins Brandon Jennings as the core of the Bucks, which is a fairly underwhelming duo by any standard. This is probably why the folks at the indispensable basketball blog \"<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/ball-don-t-lie-2012-13-nba-season-135759750--nba.html\">Ball Don't Lie</a>\" have noted that the Bucks are getting just <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/bucks/schedule/\">one nationally televised game</a> this season. That's the kind of television schedule that a .500 team without any name players gets and, well, that's who these Bucks are. </p> <p><strong>4 Cleveland Cavaliers</strong></p> <p>On the heels of The Decision, spurned Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert wrote a message (<a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/dan-gilbert-comic-sans/\">in Comic Sans, no less,</a>) that the Cavs would win a title before departed forward LeBron James did. This prediction, to say the least, seems rather unlikely to come to pass without some sort of loophole involving either time travel or the multiple-worlds theory of the universe. The Heat won it all a few months ago, the Cavaliers are still years away from the postseason.</p> <p>The Cavaliers are again all about one player \u2013 this time around it's sophomore guard Kyrie Irving who isn't LeBron but did almost single-handedly revive Cleveland's interest in hoops last season. Kyrie Irving, absolutely the best basketball player to have a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHXgHjDOxUM\">Mister Mister song named after him</a>, was an absolute beast last year and if he's able to make a second-year jump the Cavs could be at least a spoiler in the East. The Cavs got some help for Irving, drafting Dion Waiters to be his wingman. Waiters was drafted too high, probably, but the Cavs obviously think that Irving and Waiters will work together well. They won't work well enough to make the Comic Sans Guarantee look any less ridiculous, but well enough to get them knocking on the doors of respectability.</p> <p><strong>5 Detroit Pistons</strong></p> <p>It's a good thing the Detroit Tigers are in the World Series, because my stars is Detroit not going to have much fun watching its basketball team this season. Well Okay, big man Greg Monroe's development should be fun to watch, not to mention watching Andre Drummond (who fell to No8 in the draft) play his rookie year. Of course, there's the concert that the Pistons have not committed themselves to playing Drummond significant minutes and would rather play also-rans and never-will-be's instead. </p> <p>The other thing that Detroit has is that, well... um, this is awkward. There's no way to spin this one, folks: the era of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZcqM294c7E\">Detroit Bad Boys</a> is as over as the era of saying \"bad as in good\". This season, Detroit will just be bad.</p> <h2><strong>Southeast </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Miami Heat</strong></p> <p>So, did the Heat do anything interesting last year?</p> <p>The strangest thing happened to the Heat on their way to their first post-Decision championship: they almost became, if not likable, at least difficult to hate too too much. LeBron James's \"inability to come through in the clutch\" was dissected to the point where former haters were rooting for him to finally win a ring, just to quiet the Skip Baylesses of the world. Dwyane Wade was clearly playing so injured that it seemed legitimate to speculate that years of playing the game hard were catching up with him for good. Chris Bosh was trying to return, probably too early, from an abdominal injury and dealing with nonstop ridicule that painted him as an effeminate third wheel. Head coach Erik Spoelstra seemed to be just holding a clipboard until the inevitable return of Pat Riley, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqpjlYCS85g\">Mario Chalmers was a Saturday Night Live punchline</a> and the bench was mostly bargain-basement scrubs and completely broken three-point shooters.</p> <p>Luckily, the Miami Heat are now NBA champions, so we can all go back to hating them. Despite getting some key plays from some of their bench guys during the Finals, most notably when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq8JClcZAFM\">Mike Miller went three-pointer crazy</a> in the season-clinching Game 5, Miami upgraded the bench by bringing in Boston's Ray Allen and New Orleans's Rashard Lewis. Everybody knows their roles now, mainly because the last few months have established that this is very much LeBron James's team. </p> <p>King James, and we can call him that now, is the reigning regular-season MVP, was the Finals MVP and just got through leading Team USA through the London Olympics. Having won an MVP trophy, a championship ring and a gold medal, James has enough hardware now to open a Home Depot. He's pretty much the best basketball player in the known universe, a dominant force even in the fourth quarters of games and seems as unstoppable as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZChSzoYy8D8\">Mike Tyson in the old Nintendo Punch Out game</a>. He is scary good right now, and so is his team.</p> <p>The question isn't whether or not the Heat are the Goliath of the Eastern Conference. No, the question is whether or not there are any Davids that could prevent them from reaching the Finals for the third straight year. Don't bet on it.</p> <p><strong>2 Atlanta Hawks</strong></p> <p>The best news for the Atlanta Hawks is that they got rid of Joe Johnson and his absolutely ridiculous contract, pawning it off on the mad-with-cash Brooklyn Nets. It says something about how finance-savvy modern sports fans are that a perennial playoff team could trade away its best and most high-profile player and that the fan response would be almost universal praise. Or maybe the Joe Johnson contract was just so bad that it was impossible to defend.</p> <p>Beyond that addition by subtraction, and the wise acquisition of Lou Williams (formerly of the 76ers) as a cheap Johnson replacement, the best thing to happen for the Hawks is that they could get (knock on wood) a full season of a healthy Al Horford. Horford returned to the lineup last postseason and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/horford-hawks-stay-alive-beat-celtics-87-86-091215888.html\">immediately made an impact in their series against the Celtics</a>. The big-man duo of Horford and Josh Smith will make the Hawks a dangerous team during the regular season.</p> <p>That's the regular season though \u2013 could this Atlanta Hawks team get deep in the playoffs? The one thing not in their favor is that they're a pro sports team in Atlanta \u2013 just ask Bobby Cox or Matt Ryan how difficult that is in that city. No wonder <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/20526465/report-tracy-mcgrady-signs-one-year-contract-with-qingdao-in-china\">they exiled first-round elimination magnet Tracy McGrady to China</a>. There's enough bad juju working against them.</p> <p><strong>3 Washington Wizards</strong></p> <p>There was a brief spell of happiness in the Washington DC era, a possibility of rebirth highlighted by both Sports Illustrated and ESPN - The Magazine publishing articles focusing on the area. (Okay, SI made them share time with Baltimore, but still.) What happened then? Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III got injured, the Washington Nationals suffered a 9th-inning collapse in the fifth game of the National League Division Series and, most notably for our purposes, Washington Wizards guard John Wall <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wizards-insider/wp/2012/09/29/john-walls-injury-forces-wizards-to-regroup/\">suffered a knee injury</a> that ensured he wouldn't be returning until November.</p> <p>Many recent Wizards moves have just been about dumping the malcontent and the mistake-prone (Gilbert Arenas, JaVale McGee, Nick Young), in the hopes of building around the developing Wall. Washington's initial dilemma was figuring out what kind of team can you build around Wall, but that concern has morphed into whether or not Wall is the kind of player you <em>can</em> build around. In any case, Wall's absence gives the Wizards no choice but to play players like Nene, Trevor Ariza and third-round draft pick Bradley Beal and see what else they have. Who knows, maybe some currently unknown player will step up like Jeremy Lin did last year and make fans almost dread Wall's return to the lineup. It's far more likely, however, that Washington fans will do everything short of sacrificing small animals in a desperate attempt to hasten his return.</p> <p><strong>4 Orlando Magic</strong></p> <p>Okay, the most important things you need to know about the Orlando Magic are that they no longer have center Dwight Howard and that they're going to be terrible this year and for a very long time to come. In a desperate attempt to keep their star player, his bags already packed, the Magic fired head coach Stan Van Gundy and even made overtures to hire <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/could-shaquille-o-neal-orlando-gm-story-come-140847691.html\">Shaquille O'Neal as GM</a>. These last-minute gestures failed to sway Basketball Hamlet, so the Magic sent him to the Lakers in a trade that also involved the Nuggets and the 76ers.</p> <p>What was the haul of goodies that the Magic got for trading away the best center in the league? The Magic got Arron Affalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga and five protected draft picks (three first-rounders and two second-rounders) from the other three teams. What does that mean for Orlando? Who knows. Every other team received proven commodities; the Magic got the basketball talent equivalent of \"what's behind door No3\". They traded their unhappy franchise player, the center who made their team relevant again, for a handful of... well... magic beans. Somewhere Shaq is laughing, and by somewhere I mean \"inexplicably on television still\".</p> <p><strong>5 Charlotte Bobcats</strong></p> <p>The Charlotte Bobcats had the worst season in NBA history last year, and for their efforts they didn't get even get the first pick in the NBA Draft (ie, they missed out on Anthony Davis). So, chances are that this season has to be a little bit better. Owner Michael Jordan has promised to be less hands-off \u2013 I guess his highly competitive nature has realized that a <a href=\"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/26/is-the-best-player-ever-michael-jordan-also-the-worst-gm-ever/\">Worst Owner In NBA History award</a> clashed with his status as Greatest Basketball Player Ever.</p> <p>Well, the Bobcats did get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the second pick and they did pick up a veteran free agent in the offseason. Since I don't know what Ben Gordon will provide, I'll say what teams say whenever they pick up older players for no reason. Gordon will provide \"veteran leadership\". Listen, the Bobcats won't have the worst season in basketball history again. Maybe they will catch a break and won't even be the worst team in the league. Dream big, Charlotte. Dream big.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>Eastern Conference Finals: Miami Heat OVER Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p> <p>I'm not entirely sold on the 76ers but I just don't see the Celtics returning to the conference finals. Philadelphia seems like the team most likely to jump past them. Keep in mind I could have picked the Celtics, the Pacers, the Hawks or a revived, Derrick Rose-led Bulls team here and it would have made no difference. The Heat are going to win the Eastern Conference.</p> <h2><strong>Western Conference</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Northwest</strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Oklahoma City Thunder</strong></p> <p>Their last few games they played didn't turn out as they planned, but the former Seattle Supersonics had their best year ever. The scary part? They could be even better this year. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent their summer playing together on Team USA at the London Olympics. Plus, Serge Ibaka played for Spain and hey, with Dwight Howard in the Western Conference, Kendrick Perkins is now actually useful, considering his history of neutralizing the most dominant center in the game. (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jun/16/miami-heat-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-fashion\">Oh yes, this does mean a return of Nick Collison, Undercover Baller</a>.)</p> <p>My draft summary of the Thunder's offseason discussed whether or not the Thunder could be a potential new dynasty if they managed to keep hold of James Harden. Well that changed on Saturday, after contract extension talks broke down, the Oklahoma City Thunder <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8562868/oklahoma-city-thunder-trade-james-harden-houston-rockets\">traded James Harden, their third best player and Sixth Man of the Year to the Houston Rockets</a>. The Thunder sent Harden, along with Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward, to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two first-round draft picks and a second rounder. The Thunder, as any major Trail Blazers fan would tell you, have done well with their draft picks in the past, and considering that Harden was likely to get paid more than he was worth (although not in comparison with, say, a Kendrick Perkins) the payroll flexibility may help them in the long run. Still, it's curious considering that this was a team that was just in the NBA Finals. It could be argued that, for this season at least, the Lakers were a bigger beneficiary of this trade than any of the teams involved</p> <p><strong>2 Denver Nuggets</strong></p> <p>The Dwight Howard Trade made the Lakers the favorites to win the West, but it also helped out a team that could be standing in their way. It didn't get as much press, but Andre Iguodala might have more impact on his new team than Howard on his. He's not a Proven Center, that near-mythical beast, like Howard or Andrew Bynum, but Iguodala is a great all-around player, someone who managed to be an underrated Olympic champion. He's the exact right guy to lead a Nuggets team that many experts think is just behind the Thunder and the Lakers in the West.</p> <p>The Nuggets, and head coach the Venerable George Karl, hope that Iguodala helps out with another one more of their more recent acquisitions, JaVale McGee. Even without Iguodala, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgSYA3Gb7oI\">the Human Lowlight Reel</a> had an incredible postseason run where he almost single-handedly brought down the Lakers. If the Nuggets can get the most out of the talented seven-footer, meaning less saluting and fewer bone-headed plays, then they might have the core of an amazing team here, even a team that could reach the finals, with a little luck.</p> <p><strong>3 Utah Jazz</strong></p> <p>The Utah Jazz, believe it or not, went to the playoffs last year. You can look it up on the internet, although I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to check <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com\">Snopes</a> first. The Jazz were the last team to get in the playoffs and the first team to get bounced. That result seems believable; the Jazz repeating those results this season also seems believable.</p> <p>What else is going on for this team? Well, Al Jefferson is an interesting player to watch \u2013 he's better than you think he is and he will be a solid rotation player on a major franchise sooner rather than later. The Jazz reacquired Mo Williams, pretty much exactly the platonic ideal of a Jazz player, as well as Randy Foye. It should be another decent season, but keep in mind that \"another decent season\" is the ceiling for this franchise as currently constituted. Maybe they could try to increase their future playoff chances, or at least public visibility, by finally dumping the Jazz monicker and getting a more appropriate name.</p> <p><strong>4 Minnesota Timberwolves</strong></p> <p>The Timberwolves were supposed to be the Most Fun Team In Basketball this year, but instead an injury to Kevin Love has put a damper on their potential postseason success. Love is expected to be gone for six to eight weeks after he broke his hand <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5952947/kevin-love-broke-his-hand-while-doing-knuckle-pushups\">doing knuckle pushups</a>. No seriously, that's how he broke it.</p> <p>This wouldn't be such bad news if Minnesota's second best-player, Ricky Rubio, and his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es8dtZW4FnA\">reality-bending passing ability</a>, wasn't out with an ACL injury for good portion of the season. Together, they would have made the Timberwolves a serious playoff threat, especially with an improved supporting cast that includes a suddenly unretired Brandon Roy and Andrei Kirilenko. Now, <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/40102/what-kevin-loves-injury-means-for-the-timberwolves\">they're just another mediocre Western Conference team</a>.</p> <p>Oh, they do have Greg Stiemsma now, and Tommy Heinsohn said that <a href=\"http://www.rantsports.com/nba/2012/01/02/tommy-heinsohn-compares-greg-stiemsma-to-bill-russell/\">he was like Bill Russell</a>. Maybe not all is lost in Minnesota after all what with the... oops, sorry, my Stiemsma paragraph has just fouled out of the preview.</p> <p><strong>5 Portland Trail Blazers</strong></p> <p>The Trail Blazers had a good first half of the 2011-12 season before their season collapsed and they basically packed it in around the trade deadline. Don't expect Portland to make a huge jump this year, which seems set to be a water treading one of mere existence. There is maybe a sign or two that the franchise is about to change: the team officially parted ways with <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7908766/a-rare-interview-former-no-1-overall-pick-greg-oden-injury-plagued-career\">oft-broken, near-tragic figure</a> Greg Oden, who not only has played very little but has acted as something of a symbol of Portland's missed opportunities.</p> <p>Now that the Trail Blazers are officially without Oden, as well as the un-retired Brandon Roy, they can try to find a new identity, theoretically with LaMarcus Aldrirdge at its core. Unfortunately, searching for a new identity makes a really great 1990s independent movie \u2013 not a thrilling basketball season.</p> <h2><strong>Pacific </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p> <p>The Lakers decided to stand pat this offseason, confident that their roster as currently assembled was good enough to challenge for a title. Then they remembered that they were the Lakers and made trades for Dwight Howard and Steve Nash while somehow managing to keep Pau Gasol. It felt like the Lakers won the Western Conference in the offseason.</p> <p>That's not where championships are won, however. The problem with the Lakers is that they have the kind of team that could collapse at any time. Kobe Bryant, as you may have heard, can be a bit of a ballhog and he's not getting any younger: some nights he's going to look like vintage Kobe and others nights he's going to look more like his dad Jellybean. Second-year head coach Mike Brown's control of the team is also in question. Kobe is basically in charge of the offense; Brown sometimes seems like merely the defensive coordinator. Brown had trouble dealing with the young Andrew Bynum last year, a detail that seems minor now but could be a prelude to trouble with the mercurial Howard. Nash should help team chemistry, that's what the (Formerly) Floppy Haired Canadian does, but his influence will be lessened if his bad back sidelines him. In what may be the most troubling news for team chemistry, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/the-5-craziest-things-metta-world-peace-said-on-nb\">Metta World Peace still exists</a>. </p> <p>The fun part? Dwight Howard is a free agent after the end of this season, which means next year there's a chance that we might go through all of this again with Basketball Hamlet. If there's one surefire motivation, beyond winning a ring of course, for these Lakers to find their chemistry and find it fast, it's to ensure that Howard doesn't have any reason to pull his \"to be a Laker or not to be a Laker\" stunt. </p> <p>If the Lakers do all get along, and Howard plays the role of good soldier, they are going to be a very, very difficult team to defeat. This collection of All-Stars is unlikely to last very long, this is as \"win now\" a team as you could possibly build, but no one in purple and gold will care if they can grab another ring this year. Their biggest enemy may be themselves.</p> <p><strong>2 Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p> <p>The Clippers made a few moves that could provide dividends, moves that could help make them a true rival to their Staples Center roommates. With <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/10/18/3524556/chauncey-billups-injury-los-angeles-clippers\">Chauncey Billups out with an Achilles injury</a>, the Clippers have brought in 90s icon and former Sprite pitchman Grant Hill as their Designated Veteran Injury Risk. Also entering the fold? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1156027/\">Lamar Odom-Kardashian</a>, back in Hollywood, the only city where he's ever really played to his ability level, after a disastrous Texan exile. </p> <p>But ultimately? Just like last year, it's going to be all about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMzJBSXfECE\">Lob City</a>, now that point guard Chris Paul and forward Blake Griffin have played a lockout-shortened season's worth of games together, the floor show might just get even more fun to watch. Paul-to-Griffin for the dunk is maybe the most fun combo play by two athletes since Tom Brady to Randy Moss for the touchdown. Assuming you're not on the opposite end of it.</p> <p>There are two major issues with the Clippers. First of all, Vinny del Negro managed to keep his job as head coach <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/20385003/clippers-vinny-del-negro-is-working-without-a-net\">(for now at least)</a>. The other issue is a tad longer-term, like Howard with the Lakers, Chris Paul is also free agent after the end of the year. If the Clippers start to lag behind in the West, will Paul want to remain as an afterthought in LA? Will his contract situation loom over the season? If so, that could be a disaster for Clippers owner Donald Sterling, not that many will shed tears for him.</p> <p><strong>3 Golden State Warriors</strong></p> <p>Last season, once again, the Golden State Warriors were the most fun bad team in basketball. The Warriors played their heavy-offense/little-defense/erratic-fundamentals game for most of the season, although they were less fun when they traded away the endearingly frustrating Monta Ellis towards the end of the season. In return for Ellis, the Warriors received Andrew Bogut, who may or may not be healed in time for the Mayan Apocalypse, and they still have Stephen Curry likewise. In a best-case scenario health-wise, they will just barely miss the playoffs, but they will miss them in a really fun manner. Like always.</p> <p>They also have Klay Thompson, who recently was the first-place vote getter in a GM survey about <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/news/2012-13-gm-survey/index.html?rss=true\">which player was most likely to have a breakout season</a>. I sorta think those dudes know what they're talking about. It's obvious by now that these previews are a tad bit \"glass half-full\" aren't they?</p> <p><strong>4 Phoenix Suns</strong></p> <p>The Suns just missed out on the playoffs last year, losing their spot to the Jazz who were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in less time than it took you to read this sentence. Considering that Utah never really had a chance, it would have been better for basketball had there been one last Steven Nash-era Suns/Spurs series, but it just wasn't to be. Nash, as expected, wanted to spend his last few years in the NBA with a contender, so Phoenix <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8130840/sources-steve-nash-headed-los-angeles-lakers-sign-trade-deal\">worked out a sign-a-trade with the Lakers</a>, sending the Canadian superstar to Los Angeles in exchange for draft picks. </p> <p>The Suns did acquire Michael Beasley \u2013 the former second-round draft pick best known for <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5818665/michael-beasley-has-not-yet-kicked-that-demon-weed\">his marijuana issues</a> \u2013 from the Timberwolves, and he might now be the Suns' marquee player. Obviously we're working on a very broad interpretation of the word \"marquee\", but I suppose somebody had to be. Beyond Beasley and the draft picks, the Suns' other major offsesason acquisition has been Jermaine O'Neal, a walking Walking Dead joke still going two or three years after his career was pronounced legally dead. Looking at this roster, can you really blame Nash for wanting to be on another team, even if that team ended up being the Lakers?</p> <p><strong>5 Sacramento Kings</strong></p> <p>Well, they're the Sacramento Kings for now at least. The Kings' owners, the Maloof family, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/sacramento-kings-set-for-another-uncertain-season-on-off-the-court/2012/10/24/8a45f04c-1df1-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html\">have been having a tug-of-war with the city of Sacramento</a>, alternating between threatening to move the franchise and getting preliminary deals to stay in town for what seems like eternity. It all makes the relationship Dwight Howard had with the Orlando Magic look downright healthy. Be prepared for at least a half-dozen \"Kings close to deal to stay in Sacramento\" stories, followed by the exact same number of reports that they are heading somewhere else, presumably Anaheim or Seattle.</p> <p>Even beyond the owners, the Kings are a difficult franchise to root for as they are currently constituted, particularly because their best player, DeMarcus Cousins, continues to be rather immature and there isn't really a support system in place to ensure that he is necessarily going to grow up any time soon. It's the subject of easy jokes that the Maloofs' selling of the naming rights to their stadium has led to it being rebranded as <a href=\"http://www.theclassical.org/theclog/all-aboard-in-defense-of-sleep-train-arena-and-sleep-train-and-some-other-things\">Sleep Train Arena</a> but when was the last time a basketball arena's name ever doubled as a perfect description for the on-court product?</p> <h2><strong>Southwest </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 San Antonio Spurs</strong></p> <p>It feels like the San Antonio Spurs' playoff run, in which they won 20 straight games starting in the regular season and running through the postseason before the Thunder defeated them in the Western Conference Finals, was their last big hurrah. After all, the Spurs are all a year older now and it seems unlikely that they will get that deep into the playoffs again \u2013 certainly that undefeated span seems difficult to duplicate. But do you want to bet against the Spurs?</p> <p>For the Spurs to have a shot against the Lakers or the Thunder, point guard Tony Parker is going to have to have a repeat of last year's MVP-caliber season. It's strange to think of a Spurs team where Tim Duncan, the ageless wonder, isn't the team's key player, but the younger Parker (in Spurs terms) might be the most important player. Parker, after all, is just back from the London Olympics where he helped lead the French National team, so he's certain capable of taking more of a leadership role. </p> <p>At the very least, the expanded role of Parker is one of the reason that last year's San Antonio team was... actually fun to watch? Or at the very least not boring. The other reasons would be the other long time Spurs on the team: Manu Ginobili (the Best Sixth Man In NBA History) and Gregg Popovich (Hall of Fame coach). Wait, this season will be interesting? Wow, different times for this franchise right?</p> <p><strong>2 Memphis Grizzlies</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Basketball blogging nation, I've hit the Memphis Grizzlies.<br>Help me find some way to talk about this team and please.<br>What's to say about Zach Randolph or his teammate Marc Gasol?<br>Will they remain a playoff team or just collapse in the fall?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, no one heeded my call. I guess bloggers don't respond to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADCz4pXYoVo\">Chuck Berry parodies</a> like I thought they would. Oh well. The Grizzlies are a solid team, the NBA's oatmeal really, and they should be able to make a playoff run while still being ignored by just about everyone outside Memphis. Marc Gasol, fresh from co-running the silver-medal Spanish team with more famous brother Pau, is one of the more underrated big men in the league. Then, of course, there's Tony Allen to contribute his crazy good defense and his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aa000G9\">just plain crazy Twitter account</a>. Still, for many basketball fans, they are like that indie movie or cable-TV show that your friends keep telling that you <em>have</em> to watch. The more they hard-sell, the less interested you become. </p> <p><strong>3 Dallas Mavericks</strong></p> <p>Before I could even start writing this, reports came in saying that Dirk Nowitzki had gotten injured and would be out for six weeks. That's a pretty brutal loss considering that very few teams' playoff chances revolve around one player as much those of the Mavericks. It didn't have to be like this, as Mark Cuban made no secret in the fact that he wanted in on Dwight Howard and, failing that, the chance to lure Deron Williams away from the Nets \u2013 losing out to his Russian counterpart in what I hope ends up being the start of a blood feud.</p> <p>Even with Nowitzki, this Dallas Mavericks team is full of questions: Does Mark Cuban have some secret plan to push the Mavs into serious contention this season? Will the troubled Delonte West last the season (<a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/10/17/mavs-lift-delonte-wests-suspension-he-can-play-wednesday/\">when he has already been suspended once</a>)? Do any of the once-perennial All-Stars Vince Carter, Elton Brand and Chris Kaman have enough left to add significant value to this team? Will Lamar Odom's defection back to Los Angeles be addition by subtraction? All of these questions will be up in the air. With the exception of the last one, they really should be better without Odom, the Real Househusband.</p> <p><strong>4 Houston Rockets</strong></p> <p>For most of the offseason it seemed as if the main story of the Houston Rockets is going to be \"Linsanity II\" as point guard Jeremy Lin left New York and went south to Texas, where he instantly became the face of the franchise. This may have been less because of Lin's above-average skills at the point and more because he was bringing his name recognition to a team that pretty much lacked everything. The Rockets, who were not expected to contend for anything this year other than avoiding the worst record in the West, seemed more interested in Lin because of the international fanbase they built up during the Yao Ming years than anything else. Still, we've seen Lin perform unexpected miracles on the court. (<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/famous-jeremy-lin-couch-now-lost-history-190054458--nba.html\">Lin's famous couch, however, will not be making the trip.</a>)</p> <p>It seemed as if Lin were going to have to keep the team afloat by himself, but on Saturday the Thunder added James Harden to the mix, which seems like something of a desperation move on Houston's part. James Harden is a great player, a perennial All-Star, but he's not the number one option on a true contender. It seems like the Houston Rockets should be in something close to rebuilding mode, so giving up on some of these draft picks makes very little sense, they likely gave up more for Harden than the Orlando Magic received for superstar center Dwight Howard. Unless this is just one step of a larger process, it's hard not to see the decision to get Harden, like the move to bring in Lin, as at least as much of a marketing strategy as a basketball one. Fear the Linbeardity, Texas..</p> <p><strong>5 New Orleans Hornets</strong></p> <p>The last time we were talking about the New Orleans Hornets we were discussing the <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/blogs/nba-point-forward/2012/05/31/an-nba-draft-lottery-conspiracy-it-didnt-seem-that-way/index.html\">NBA Draft Conspiracy</a>. After the second Chris Paul trade - the league vetoed the first - the NBA-owned Hornets tumbled far enough down the standings to become a serious lottery team, and to other teams' suspicions, the team owned by the league ended up with the No1 pick in the draft. The Hornets, not being dumb, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10312378\">picked Anthony Davis of the University of Kentucky</a>, who has the most upside of any draft pick since Kevin Durant.</p> <p>The basketball conspiracy theorists, of which there are many, were suspicious: this could not have been a coincidence. Clearly, David Stern and company were pulling the strings, why else would the lottery itself take place in private if a shadowy cabal didn't want the Hornets to get the first pick of the draft? These conspiracies seem unlikely but if I were a Hornets fan, I would just run with it. It's nice to pretend that the commissioner was in your pocket.</p> <p>However, the Hornets got <a href=\"http://www.sportspickle.com/pictures/gallery/12080/the-10-greatest-example-of-anthony-davis-unibrow-tributes\">the Unibrow</a> and it seems likely that the acquisition will provide immediate dividends. Davis spent his summer vacation playing the role of the Human Victory Cigar for Team USA at London Olympics. In the first few games of the tournament, his first quasi-pro experience, he made some plays late against the \"just happy to be there\" countries which showed it will at least be fun to watch the kid play. </p> <p>For good measure, the Hornets snatched up Duke guard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kb2ZDv8lBc\">Austin Rivers</a> (son of Celtics coach Doc) with the 10th pick. Rivers, with his \"shoot first and then shoot again and then ask questions later if there's time\" style could just as easily make a huge impact as flame out \u2013 either way he's bound to be interesting. Make no mistake, the Hornets are going to play some really bad basketball for a while and this season will all be growing pains, but they won't be terrible for very long. Thank the shadowy cabal, Hornets fans.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>Western Conference Finals: Los Angeles Lakers OVER Oklahoma City Thunder</strong></p> <p>Unlike the Eastern Conference Finals, this series seems more in the air. The Thunder, assuming Durant and Westbrook are healthy, should be a well-oiled machine while the Lakers could be still working out their chemistry like the Miami Heat did in the first year of the LeBron era. I still like the Lakers' chances of advancing here. </p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>NBA Finals: Miami Heat OVER Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p> <p>The NBA equivalent of a meteor game for 90% of basketball fans (ie, most of them will be rooting for a meteor to hit the arena), these Finals will still get the highest ratings in NBA history. In the aftermath, David Stern will buy a gold-plated mansion shaped like himself, LeBron James will receive notice from the US government that he is officially \"above the law\" and, lost in the excitement and hype, the Toronto Raptors will cease to exist and nobody will notice. Enjoy the 2012-13 season, everybody!</p>",
  "<p>A renowed poet, musician and radio dramatist who used comedy as a weapon against Islamist militants has become the 18th media worker killed this year in Somalia \u2013 the second highest death toll in the world after Syria.</p> <p>Warsame Shire Awale, who was in his 60s, wrote and acted in comedy plays critical of al-Shabaab, the extremist group linked to al-Qaida, which he accused of twisting Islam to mislead people.</p> <p>His death follows the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/somali-comic-marshale-death-threat\" title=\"\">murder of another comic</a>, Abdi Jeylani Malaq, better known as Marshale, in August. Both men worked at <a href=\"http://www.kulmiyenews.com\" title=\"\">Radio Kulmiye</a> in Mogadishu.</p> <p>Warsame was shot several times by unidentified men near his house in the Waberi district of Mogadishu on Monday night, the <a href=\"http://www.nusoj.org\" title=\"\">National Union of Somali Journalists </a> said. He was taken to hospital where he was declared dead.</p> <p>Warsame had received threats recently after making comments about gunmen who targeted civilians, the union said.</p> <p>Omar Faruk Osman, the secretary general of the union, said: \"We urge the federal authorities of Somalia to conduct a full and impartial investigation into Warsame's death and the sustained killings of journalists to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice, because justice delayed is a justice denied.\"</p> <p>Warsame was a stalwart of the Somali cultural community for more than three decades. He had been a member of the police band, held in high esteem before the civil war, and sang songs encouraging people to join the force. He recently gained popularity among young Somalis for his radio comedy dramas urging them to reject violence and support the government.</p> <p>Bashir Yusuf of the Ifiso Independent Vetting Coalition, a civil society group, said: \"Many Somali people affirm that he was one of the few Somali songwriters and poets who stayed in Somalia during the whole period of the civil strife.</p> <p>\"I don't think the killing of Warsame Shire Awale will discourage and stop others from following his footpath. It is tragic that insecurity has been in Mogadishu for more than two decades and that the outlook that it will disappear seems distant. Traumatic experiences will unfortunately linger for the near future.\"</p> <p>One of Warsame's colleagues, Sharmarke Abukar Amin, said journalists in Somalia were being targeted solely because of their profession. Last week Mohamed Mohamud Turyare, a 25-year-old reporter at Shabelle radio, was shot as he walked home. He subsequently died of his injuries.</p> <p>No arrests have been made in any of the 18 killings of journalists this year. \"That's the second highest toll in the world after Syria,\" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN high commissioner for human rights. \"We are extremely alarmed by the continuing assault on Somalia's media workers and journalists by al-Shabaab and other elements.\"</p> <p>Colville called on the Somali government \"to take urgent steps to protect journalists and other media workers and to end the complete impunity that has been enjoyed by their killers. The role of the media is crucial as Somalia tries to get back on its feet, and the continued slaughter of the country's journalists risks stifling the media's ability to contribute to an improvement in law and order and good governance.\"</p> <p>Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for killing more than 10 media employees, one of whom was beheaded in Mogadishu. Some of the murders are also believed to be linked to clan and factional struggles or to have been ordered by business and political leaders unhappy with the coverage they receive.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab was forced out of the capital more than a year ago by African Union peacekeepers and the Somali army, but its fighters still stage frequent attacks in the city. The press rights watchdog <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/somalia.html\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> has described 2012 as the deadliest year on record for journalists in Somalia, outstripping 2009 when nine died.</p>",
  "<p>\"The more laws a country has, the more corrupt it is,\" the Roman historian Tacitus used to say. Greece has quite a few laws. So many, in fact, that corruption can feel quite safe. An exclusive club of powerful people engages in illegal practices, then pushes through necessary laws to legalise these practices, granting itself an amnesty, and in the end, there are no media to uncover what really happened.</p> <p>As I write, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/28/greek-editor-court-tax-evaders\" title=\"\">adventures of an independent magazine</a> in Greece, Hot Doc, which I edit, are being discussed worldwide. Our publication of a list of alleged Swiss bank account holders, and my subsequent arrest, has provoked a storm. But not in the Greek media. A few months ago, Reuters and the British press uncovered scandals involving Greek banks. The Greek media didn't write anything then either. The space that should have been granted to reports about these scandals was occupied by paid advertisements sponsored by the very people who caused the Greek banks to go under.</p> <p>The \"Lagarde\" case in Greece is merely an extreme expression of this situation. In 2010, Lagarde handed to the then minister of finance, George Papaconstantinou, a list of Greeks who held bank accounts abroad. Some of this was \"black money\" \u2013 money that may not have been taxed or needed to be laundered. In a convuloted train of events, Papaconstantinou admitted to losing the original data, but was able to pass another copy to his successor Evangelos Venizelos, who eventually admitted to having held it but has failed to produce it so far. The list has still never been properly investigated.<strong> </strong></p> <p>For the past two years, the issue of naming people who are assumed to hold bank accounts in Switzerland has poisoned political life in Greece, with political and financial blackmail taking place in the dark rooms of corrupt power. It's in this context that Hot Doc published 2,059 names of Greeks alleged to have Swiss bank accounts, without specifying the amount of their deposits or any other personal information.</p> <p>And then, with utmost hypocrisy the powers that be remembered what they were about. The Athens prosecutor made a move ex officio and ordered my immediate arrest. The law on personal data was invoked as a basis for indictment. In reality, though, there was no personal data involved \u2013 only the fact that certain individuals held an account in a certain bank. We did not even allege that these individuals were guilty, only called for an investigation.</p> <p>Dealings with banks are carried out in public, not in secrecy. The existence of a bank account is therefore not personal data. Personal data would be the amount and type of transactions. In Greece, banks send envelopes with their logos, in which they enclose transaction details; in other words, they declare their relationship with customers. Nevertheless, the publication of a plain list of names and a demand to investigate was defined as exposing personal data.</p> <p>In Ancient Greek mythology, justice is presented as blind. In modern Greece, it is merely winking and nodding. A study of the Lagarde list is highly revealing. Publishers, businessmen, shipowners, the entire system of power is shown to have transferred money abroad. And this is information from only one bank. Meanwhile in Greece, people are going through dumpsters for food.</p> <p>The crisis in Greece wasn't caused by everyone. And not everyone is paying for the crisis. The exclusive, corrupt club of power tries to save itself by pretending to make efforts to save Greece. In reality, it is exacerbating Greece's contradictions, while Greece is teetering on the edge of a cliff.</p> <p>If in the Bible, sinners \"strain out the gnat and swallow the camel\", in Greece the sinful powers that be strain out pensions and swallow lists \u2013 in order, of course, to make them disappear. These are the lists of their friends, acquaintances, favourites and mess mates.</p> <p>In the country that, as we like to remind ourselves, gave birth to democracy, democracy has become a strange new breed. Those in charge make sure that the right to vote come across as democracy, while negating democracy in the way they abuse the rights voters give them. And justice remains in thrall to politics.</p>",
  "<p>It is 11.30 on a Thursday morning and junior health minister Dan Poulter is watching six inspectors give ward 32 at Darlington Memorial hospital a good going over. The three patient representatives and three NHS staff check hygiene levels, ask patients whether they are happy with their care and sample the hospital's tasty lunches. This is one of the first of the new patient-led inspections that David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/06/nhs-hospitals-radical-shakeup-cameron\" title=\"\">announced</a> in January as a way of driving out poor nursing and, together with the \"friends and family test\" starting in April, of improving the quality of NHS care.</p> <p>Poulter displays no obvious feelings of deja vu; his easy rapport with every patient and interest in their views are evident. But then the health minister, who has just turned 34, is well qualified for that role. He was a hospital doctor before becoming an MP in 2010, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology. His work on Stephen Dorrell's health select committee marked him out as a knowledgable and constructive voice in the health debate. Downing Street was impressed with his gusto in criticising the British Medical Association's ill-fated day of industrial action over doctors' pensions in June, a move that prompted <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-18278939\" title=\"\">Poulter to quit the BMA</a>.</p> <p>In his first in-depth interview since becoming a health minister last month under Jeremy Hunt, he reveals he intends to continue working as a doctor.</p> <p><strong>Backing from No 10</strong></p> <p>\"I got a call to go to Downing Street and [on the day of the reshuffle] went to see the prime minister. He was supportive of me continuing to practise as a doctor. He knew I'd continued to work on the wards during my time as a&#xa0;backbench MP. I really enjoy the time I&#xa0;spend with my patients and he's really supportive of that,\" says Poulter.</p> <p>From December, he will be working one day a week at a London hospital, following in the footsteps of Lord Darzi, the surgeon who was a Labour health minister in 2007-09. \"I'm a great admirer of him, actually,\" says Poulter. \"Obviously I wouldn't expect to be paid for working for the NHS. I regard it as part of my role as a minister.\"</p> <p>Poulter's ministerial brief includes key NHS areas such as nursing, maternity services, pay and pensions, and patient experience. What are his priorities? \"Firstly, how we put patients at the centre of the NHS. We'll be rolling out the sort of inspections we've seen here in Darlington, and the friends and family test. There used to be a question in medical exams: who's the most important member of a multidisciplinary team \u2013 the doctor, nurse, social worker and so on? Actually it's always the patient,\" he says.</p> <p>He pledges to extend the helping hand of family nurse partnerships \u2013 intensive home visits for teenage mothers from specially trained family nurses \u2013 to \"even more mums who find themselves in difficult or vulnerable circumstances; for example, mums with substance abuse problems or offenders\". And he mentions the coalition's commitment to increase health visitor numbers. Yet Unite, the union that represents many health visitors, says this is not happening and just last week official figures showed there are 6,588 fewer nurses, midwives and health visitors in the English NHS than at the time of the 2010 election.</p> <p>\"The staff in the NHS are one of our strongest assets. It doesn't matter if you're a nurse, midwife, occupational therapist or a porter, everyone in the NHS is there to care about patients. It's very much a vocational calling,\" says Poulter. But, he adds, briefly referencing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/dec/01/stafford-hospital-inquiry-nhs-failings\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire scandal</a>: \"One weakness I picked up on working full-time in the NHS before I was elected is that we occasionally lose sight of the most important thing, looking after patients, because of the process measures and other measurements you have to do on a day to day basis \u2013 the collecting data, which is crudely called a tickbox exercise of healthcare. To continue to do better in the NHS we need to remove that tickbox mentality and focus on patients,\" he says.</p> <p>Asked what the new Department of Health ministerial team's collective challenge is, Poulter indicates that the plan is to try to make the NHS more of a prevention than a treatment service, to treat more patients out of hospital, reduce avoidable admissions and seek to integrate health and social care. \"We&#xa0;need to gear up the NHS to ensure that we deliver more care in a way that is going to be able to provide dignity for and meet the needs of the growing number of older people, some of whom are living longer with multiple conditions such as diabetes, dementia and heart disease,\" he says. \"Part of addressing that is about making sure we deliver more services in more preventative, more community-focused ways, and that we're not always picking up the pieces for things that have gone wrong, but that we're keeping people well in their own communities, in their homes; preventing people from getting broken rather than fixing them afterwards.\"</p> <p>In March, Poulter, then still a backbencher, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/20/nhs-prevention-cure-older-people\" title=\"\">wrote</a> in the Guardian: \"Redesigning health and social care services to&#xa0;provide dignity in care for older people is the biggest human and financial challenge facing our NHS.\" The minister stands by every word. \"Integration is like the holy grail,\" he says with real passion. So how will that be made a&#xa0;reality?</p> <p>Poulter mentions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/08/social-care-torbay-older-people\" title=\"\">Torbay</a> in Devon, where the two services have been successfully connected for years \u2013 a&#xa0;source of much interest. \"Jeremy Hunt and [care minister] Norman Lamb are going to visit Torbay,\" he says. \"It's a really good example of where organisations have put aside their own view of how their finances work, said 'the most important thing here is the patient we're looking after' and put their money into the same place.\"</p> <p>Lamb and Poulter will steer through parliament the forthcoming care and support bill \u2013 which, he says, has a \"very strong focus on integrated and joined-up care\". Budget pooling by different organisations such as the new GP-led clinical commissioning groups (CCGs)and local councils, which are responsible for social care, \"is a very desirable end\", says Poulter.</p> <p>One idea thought to be under consideration is to force CCGs to share some of their budgets with town halls to improve care for people with long-term conditions. Poulter hints that ministers want to make progress while avoiding another overhaul of NHS structures. If&#xa0;so, the bill is likely to be more enabling than prescriptive.</p> <p>But won't the coalition's policy of greater competition in the provision of NHS care make integration harder to achieve? \"Increasing the choice of people who provide healthcare is not mutually exclusive to people co-operating and having a more joined-up and seamless system. What matters is providing high-quality care,\" he replies. The voluntary sector and charities, not just private firms, are welcome to do so, for example, in elderly care, Poulter says. The new NHS commissioning board will ensure profit-driven organisations cannot simply cherrypick easy-to-deliver services, he adds.</p> <p>\"We know that where the private sector has been involved in the past, it can really benefit patients, such as the previous government using it to cut waiting times for heart operations,\" says Poulter. \"What really matters is that the NHS is always going to be a free service, free at the point of need, and is also a service that has a genuine compassion and will continue to look after the most vulnerable patient groups.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 34.</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Partner, no children.</p> <p><strong>Home</strong> Suffolk and London.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Bristol University, law; King's&#xa0;College London, medicine.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> September 2012-present: junior health minister; May 2010-present: MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich; 2008-10: deputy leader, Reigate and Banstead borough council; junior doctor in obstetrics and gynaecology at hospitals in London and the Kent, Surrey and Sussex deanery area.</p> <p><strong>Public life</strong> Supporter of Help for Heroes; helps raise money for St Elizabeth hospice in Ipswich.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Playing rugby, cricket and golf.</p>",

  "<p>The Department for Education (DfE) in association with care leavers, charities and local authorities has this week <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/news/media_centre/Barnardo8217s-launches-Charter-for-Care-Leavers-/press_releases.htm\" title=\"\">launched</a> a council charter for care leavers. The charter is based on six principles of support: identity and aspiration, listening to care leavers' views, support when needed, information, finding care leavers a home and working together.</p> <p>As a care leaver, I support the pledge to stand by young people as they adjust to independence. However, an opportunity has been missed to campaign for our most at risk youth to receive the security they deserve. In society, adolescence has become extended, with parental support continuing much longer than in the past. But our care system forces too many young people into adulthood prematurely.</p> <p>I was in care, permanently excluded from education at 14, and written off by the care system. My journey has been long and far from smooth, but, now aged 36 and completing my PhD, I&#xa0;am a clear example of why care leaver support must be extended. Policymakers fail to \"think stage not age\" when deciding when a care leaver no longer needs support. The whole system is obsessed with outcomes at 16 or 19.</p> <p>I have spent four years reviewing what is known about leaving care and, carrying out <a href=\"http://www.outcomesofcare.com\" title=\"\">empirical research</a> across England, I have met amazing care leavers, some excelling in higher education and apprenticeships, as well as inspirational single parents. But I&#xa0;have also met many who are homeless, unemployed, stuck in the criminal justice system and at risk of exploitation. Will the charter help them? It promises \"to prepare you for your move into independent living only when you are ready\". For many care leavers this would mean staying in care beyond 18, 21 or even 25. But how many local authorities will commit to this when they cannot afford those care leavers they already have? As budgets are cut, and the number of children coming into care rises, the number of care leavers is increasing by around 5% a year.</p> <p>There are three main concerns about the charter: the only signatory is the DfE, the corporate parent; most of what is pledged is already covered in legislation and should be standard practice; and where does a care leaver go&#xa0;if they feel they are not being treated as the charter requires? There is no ombudsman for looked-after children.</p> <p>I hoped the charter would make some tangible promises such as \"We will not let you become homeless\", \"We will financially support those who choose alternative education routes in the same way as those who go to university\", but it falls short.</p> <p>The then Labour health secretary Frank Dobson offered the most comprehensive, yet succinct, <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4007153\" title=\"\">charter</a> in 1998, stating: \"Your council has a legal and moral duty to provide the kind of loyal support any good parents would their own children.\" Many local authorities and professionals aspire to this. But good parenting for care leavers means continued support by their corporate parents and the charter fails to&#xa0;guarantee this.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Kerr is a researcher from the Outcomes of Care study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council at the University of Kent</p> <p>\u2022 <em>If you are a care leaver (of any age) or you work with care leavers, you can participate in the Outcomes of Care research at the University of Kent at </em><a href=\"http://outcomesofcare.com\" title=\"\"><em>outcomesofcare.com</em></a></p>",

Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One week ago I attended a conference at Olympia called <a href=\"http://placewestlondon.co.uk/conference/programme-draft/\">Place West London</a>, where politicians, regeneration sages and the property trade gathered to talk money, land and homes. I first listened to Councillor Andrew Johnson, Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council's <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Council_and_Democracy/Councillors_and_MPs/Councillors/Councillor_Andrew_Johnson.asp\">cabinet member for housing</a>, who addressed the implications for local authorities of new powers and responsibilities devolved to them. </p> <p>He said that for the first time, \"we have meaningful control of our housing assets,\" which meant taking, \"meaningful, long term financial decisions.\" A 30-year business plan was required, allowing for future investment. There was \"more local political accountability,\" which he described as \"a mixed blessing at times.\" He was disappointed that, \"Local authorities do not have the freedom to manage housing stock,\" to the same degree as housing associations have. \"Crucially, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said, \"We are still unable to set market rates or to share equity in council house property.\"</p> <p>Johnson's brief peroration was directly about the borough he was representing: \"Hammersmith and Fulham is a borough of opportunity,\" he said, repeating a core slogan of the Conservative administration. \"We are an ambitious borough, but we are also a borough that sees a failure in the current housing market within London.\" He said that H&amp;F has the fourth highest property property prices in the UK, 34% social housing and only 3% of housing in the \"intermediate\" category - the more expensive end of the \"affordable\" range, where aspiring home owners look to get a toe hold on the property ladder. This dearth of intermediate homes was Johnson's evidence for the market failure he identified and wished to correct. \"Hammersmith and Fulham is determined to look to build for the middle market,\" he said.</p> <p>This was not a new statement of intent. It has been a public cry of H&amp;F ever since the Conservatives won control of the borough under Stephen Greenhalgh, now Boris Johnson's policing office chief, in 2006. When famously declaring the borough open for business\" in September 2007, Greenhalgh told a <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Business/Business_support_and_Advice/Economic_development/83998_Developers_Summit.asp\">summit of property developers</a> that his administration wanted to \"build a housing ladder of opportunity for all.\" Three months earlier H&amp;F's <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Images/Core%20Strategy%20FINAL%20w%20cover%20translations_tcm21-81569.pdf\">preferred \"core strategy\" options document (pdf)</a> included addressing \"the demand for housing and the lack of housing for households with incomes of between about \u00a319,000 and \u00a360,000.\" The document continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>The council will seek 40% affordable housing in new developments. Of the affordable housing, 10-15% will be social rented housing and 25-30% intermediate housing. The council will also expect a proportion of the market housing to be low cost market housing and affordable to households on moderate incomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>After Johnson's session was complete I moved rooms to listen to an update on the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/the-future/project_area/\">Earls Court project</a>, one of London's largest redevelopment schemes and a subject of great interest to me as it seems to crystalise key regeneration issues of this \"localist\" age. Most of the land in question falls within H&amp;F's borders. Stephen Greenhalgh remains a keen supporter of the project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">describing it to the Guardian</a> earlier this year as \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London.\" </p> <p>The update was provided by Richard Powell, who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">director of planning and development of EC Properties</a>, the wholly-owned subsidiary of H&amp;F's developer partner <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/our_people/senior_mgmt_team/\">Capco</a> that is responsible for the Earls Court project.</p> <p>Before Powell addressed a gathering of maybe 30 people, I asked him a couple of questions. He was good enough to answer them on the record. Was he confident that the Earls Court project would actually go ahead in the end? \"Yes,\" he replied. I pointed out that critics variously say that it's too big and complicated, that Capco won't be able to raise the money it needs and that the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/us-hongkong-sunhungkai-idUSBRE89B0CA20121012\">pending corruption trial</a> of two members of the Kwok family from Hong Kong, one of whose property businesses has <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/press_releases/?id=65846\">joined forces with Capco</a> to fund the development of a part of the project area, does not bode well. Wasn't it all getting rather messy? </p> <p>Powell said he thought such a concern was valid - there are, for example, a lot of different interested parties, including Transport for London, Kensington and Chelsea and the Greater London Authority - and acknowledged that the Earls Court project is \"a grand plan.\" But he pointed out that Capco and EC had been setting out their stall for months and years and, \"We are just very keen to deliver on our promises.\" </p> <p>I asked Powell about the allegations that a so-called \"VIP list\" or \"Early Movers List\" has been compiled of residents of the Gibbs Green and West Kensington estates who've been promised preferential treatment in the allocation of replacement homes for their existing ones, which are threatened with demolition as part of the Earls Court project, in return for expressing support for the project. </p> <p>The council has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/22/hammersmith-and-fulham-earls-court-project-u-turn\">commissioned an investigation</a> into these <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2012/oct/26/earls-court-project-vip-list-allegations-richard-osband\">allegations</a> following the delivery of a dossier to the police, which claims to contain evidence that council officers were involved in making such promises and argues that, if so, this would be illegal. I've heard an assortment of stories of promises of one type of another of new homes being made to residents by people favouring the project. Did Powell think any of them were true? He said that in view of the police receiving the dossier and the council's investigation it wouldn't be appropriate to comment.</p> <p>I also asked him about responses to the council's consultation of residents who'd be affected by the project, primarily those of the occupants of the 760 homes that the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates comprise. Powell said that Capco had responded to an earlier consultation by trying to, \"get into the community and make sure people really understood what was happening.\" </p> <p>He also pointed out that responses to the consultation I was referring to, which was about the council's plan to sell the land the estates stand on to Capco, had been \"broadly supportive\" from residents in the wider area, though he acknowledged that from the estates themselves - where the response rate was very high, compared with what I pointed out was a very low one among residents in the surrounding area - \"the numbers were the other way round.\" He said he'd looked at the feedback earlier in the year. \"It was interesting,\" he said, but added that, \"ultimately, that's the council's decision - it wasn't our decision to include the estates in the plans.\"</p> <p>Powell then delivered his update, in which he described the Earls Court project as, \"Trying to deliver what's great about London,\" in a part of the city that had been by-passed by previous phases of development. He made light of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/12/earsl-court-project-legal-challenge-go-ahead\">forthcoming judicial review</a> of a key planning document relating to the scheme, saying in effect that such things were to be expected. He envisaged a new \"district of squares,\" preferring the term to \"villages.\" The guiding mantra, he said, is \"London-plus.\" And he reprised the project's main selling points of job creation, imaginative place-making, the provision of green space, a new high street, exterior improvements to Underground stations and the building of 7,500 new homes in all.</p> <p>A key question for me is the amount of these 7,500 homes that will be genuinely affordable to the very \"middle market\" people Andrew Johnson had said during the previous hour that his borough is determined to help; the same people, in fact, that Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9593203/London-has-turned-its-back-on-the-very-people-it-needs-most.html\">spoke up for</a> earlier this month in his Telegraph column. Powell relayed to his audience that 1,500 of the 7,500 will be categorised \"affordable,\" with 760 of these being the replacement homes promised to residents of West Kensington and Gibbs Green, leaving \"an additional\" figure of 740, all in the \"intermediate\" affordable category. </p> <p>I put it to Powell that this was a very low percentage - about 11% once you stripped out the 760 replacements, which is far from what has H&amp;F publicly aspired to. He replied that hitting affordable targets of up to 50% was proving difficult all over London, and that the \"joint financial model\" on which the Earls Court project is based, \"went through an independent test by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_Office_Agency\">Valuation Office</a>, which he said was \"pretty similar to most other projects,\" and that the affordable housing element had emerged from this. </p> <p>The wider context was the scheme's overall viability. In other words, as Powell put it, \"Making sure this scheme can happen. These sorts of projects, [when they] are fairly dogmatic about policy, often never get off the ground. The one thing that I'm very very keen on, is that this bloody thing happens and that we don't just talk about it as some interesting design exercise. So from the viability point of view I think we now are on the right side of the line to give ourselves a fighting chance.\"</p> <p>I asked if the inclusion of the two estates in the development area had, perhaps, made things more difficult for EC Properties/Capco. I had in mind that, as Powell had earlier reminded me, it was H&amp;F that had wanted them included, and also that opposition among their residents was so strong. </p> <p>Powell, replied: \"I think - and I guess I would wouldn't I? - that, actually, the inclusion of all of this land in a comprehensive development is a good solution, and it will enhance the lives of all of the neighbourhoods that live in the broader area. I think they will all be able to benefit through the employment and training budgets, and everything that can flow from this. But I fully accept that living on the estates at the moment there is a level of uncertainty - hang on a second, what is going on here and what's going to happen? [But] we have done a pretty unprecedented level of planning consultation...I do think, though, that overall the benefits of the system justify the inclusion of this whole area - this phased development over time.\"</p> <p>Finally, I pressed him further on the opposition of the two estates' residents. Was there a concern that Capco and EC Properties would be seen as the archetypal, big, nasty property developer trampling over the little people? Could such a perception be damaging? </p> <p>In his reply Powell said that, \"We want to see what's best for London, what's best for the borough, and what's best for the residents of the estates,\" and that, \"Hammersmith and Fulham are quite clear that on the basis of all their information and all the other benefits which can flow from very substantial investment in this part of town, that it is worth moving forward on that basis.\"</p> <p>He stressed that, \"From our point of view, we just want to be shoulder to shoulder with Hammersmith and Fulham. We want to make sure there is no misalignment of interests, and we're able to move forward together. As I say, I think the overall benefits of the scheme, in the long term, are worthwhile, and we'll be pursuing it with vigour.\"</p> <p>I was later told that that by the end of Powell's talk, Andrew Johnson had joined the gathering, sitting near the back of the room. Had I known, I might have asked him about the low percentage of homes envisaged by the Earls Court project that might be affordable to those struggling middle market Londoners for whom he and Mayor Johnson have expressed concern, and if he truly believes that no more could have been provided. </p> <p>I might also have put it to him that apart from Capco and Tory politicians such as himself and the London mayor, very few people are speaking up for the Earls Court project as it stands. And, who knows, maybe even some of them are having doubts.</p>",
  "<p>In 2004, Observer Sports Monthly published its list of the <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,1182710,00.html\" title=\"\">\"50 sporting things you must do before you die\"</a>. At number one was attending a \"supercl\u00e1sico\", the passionate encounter between Argentina's bitter rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate.</p> <p>The standard of the Argentinian league was declining even then \u2013 it has got a lot worse since \u2013 but the supercl\u00e1sico remains special. Sunday's was ninth against fifth between two teams who, in all honesty, aren't very good and yet el Monumental was packed, seething with noise and colour and passion.</p> <p>Argentinian football often gives the impression that the league is a tiresome irrelevance. There may be 190 games in each half-season but only one really matters. This, presumably, is why it persists with the ludicrous, short-season structure that produces two champions each season \u2013 and, as of this season, a superchampion, the winner of a play-off between the winners of each half of the season (a lengthy review process ended up doing nothing but adding the play-off and changing the names of each half of the season from apertura and clausura to inicial and final).</p> <p>That's why River's relegation in June 2011 came as such a blow. It wasn't just that the promedio system, that sees relegation calculated on a coefficient determined over three years and was supposed to ensure one of the grandees never went down, had been outwitted (Independiente and San Lorenzo could easily follow River this season); it was that there would be no supercl\u00e1sicos for at least a year.</p> <p>River were \u2013 not entirely convincingly \u2013 promoted at the first attempt, but that still meant an unprecedented, 17-month gap between supercl\u00e1sicos.</p> <p>The build-up to Sunday's game felt like the unleashing of an awful lot of pent-up emotion. In terms of atmosphere, it didn't disappoint. For half an hour before kick-off, the stadium rang with noise. It was awash with red-and-white (and, in a small section, blue-and-yellow) balloons and thundersticks and ticker-tape. It's usual to criticise running tracks at stadiums, saying they kill atmosphere; at el Monumental, the track and the moat \u2013 quite aside from being necessary as a security measure \u2013 serve to distance the pitch from the stands, not just physically but metaphorically, enhancing the sense of theatre, of the game as something remote and otherworldly.</p> <p>El Monumental also gives a wonderful sense of stepping back in time.</p> <p>Perhaps it's the ticker-tape, perhaps the aesthetic, perhaps the vague sense of dilapidation, but it does feel as though you could come back a week later and see not Leandro Somoza against Ezequiel Cirigliano, but Johan Neeskens against Mario Kempes. It presumably has been painted since the 1978 World Cup final, but it does a good job of hiding it.</p> <p>And it's the fans, of course, who make it. It's said 70% of Argentina support either Boca or River, and those who go to the stadium are devoutly noisy. Chanting isn't restricted to those in their teens and twenties \u2014 as it tended to be even in the seventies and eighties in Britain. It's not unusual to see men in their sixties clambering on railings to find a better spot to taunt their rivals. At half-time, River fans floated an enormous inflatable pig in a Boca shirt in front of the away fans \u2013 a reference to the \"porqueros\" (pigs) insult supposedly derived from the smell of the riverfront home of Boca's Bombonera stadium. Boca fans responded by alternately raising right then left hands to suggest River, after their one season in National B are somehow a yoyo club. Some Boca fans had even come dressed as ghosts to remind River they'll always be haunted by that relegation.</p> <p>The flip side of the colour and the passion is the violence. When I arrived at the ground about two-and-a-half hours before kick-off, the atmosphere was calm, if tense. Knots of police, armed with batons around five feet long and two or three inches in diameter clustered on street corners and there were occasional volleys of what you hoped were firecrackers, but essentially the mood seemed of apprehensive good humour.</p> <p>I'd come down Figueroa Alcorta and it seems I was lucky. Others who approached on Libertador, which runs parallel but in the opposite direction, reported seeing eight buses that had carried Boca fans with their windows smashed. Elsewhere fans threw stones at police while there were scuffles in the streets after the game that left 25 people injured, an 18-year-old seriously so.</p> <p>But the worst incident came shortly after River had gone 2-0 up, when a section of the Boca fans, high in the upper tier of the stand behind the goal in which Rodrigo Mora had scored, turned their frustrations on stewards. A few were flung down the stairs in the stands and kicked and punched as they lay stricken. At least one appeared to have been beaten into unconsciousness. Television pictures, which eye-witness accounts suggested missed the worst of the violence, seemed to show other fans intervening. Fortunately for the stewards, who were employed by a private security company, Boca were soon awarded a penalty. With Santiago Silva providing a distraction by collapsing under minimal contact from Germ\u00e1n Pezzella, Lautaro Acosta was tripped by Leandro Gonz\u00e1lez Pirez. Silva converted with a powerful strike.</p> <p>That goal unexpectedly awakened a game that had seemed settled. River, having gone ahead after 90 seconds when Leandro Ponzio's free-kick eluded Agust\u00edn Ori\u00f3n, looked in control \u2013 if more because of Boca's shortcomings than their own prowess. Boca had gone four games without a win before the supercl\u00e1sico and it was easy to see why.</p> <p>With a bona fide playmaker to do their conjuring for them, perhaps the industrious but unimaginative front pairing of Silva and Lucas Viatri could work. With Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme in stasis \u2013 not formally retired and still on Boca's books but refusing to play, leading to hints he may return if, as expected, Julio C\u00e9sar Falcioni's contract as coach is not renewed and he is replaced by Carlos Bianchi at the end of the year \u2013 Boca are desperately short of flair and quality. Christian Ch\u00e1vez disappointed again, Walter Erviti looks better playing a little deeper and making late runs and Leandro Paredes, who has been linked with Arsenal but looks more likely to move to Juventus, is 18 and inconsistent.</p> <p>With Ori\u00f3n, confidence shot, flapping despairingly at every cross, it seemed only a matter of time before River extended their lead, even if they weren't exactly applying sustained pressure. Sure enough, the second goal arrived after 71 minutes, Rodrigo Mora rounding Ori\u00f3n and finishing smartly from a narrow angle after a deliciously weighted through-ball from Carlos S\u00e1nchez.</p> <p>Even at 2-1 it didn't seem as though River were under much pressure.</p> <p>Acosta's liveliness had given Boca a threat they hadn't had previously, but River still seemed comfortable, retaining possession calmly. But then, in injury time, David Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, who looked far from fully fit, attempted an optimistic volley. His shot was blocked, Paredes came away with it and initiated a rare move of quality in a largely patchy game. He advanced into the River half, waited for support and spread the ball right to Chavez, whose cross was flicked on by Silva for Erviti to run on and poke past Barovero.</p> <p>The silence round the bulk of the stadium was startling, while Boca at last \u2013 and surely even to their surprise \u2013 had something to celebrate.</p> <p>A number of fans managed to clamber over the barbed-wire fence at the front of their section to dance on the concrete roof that prevented them lobbing missiles at the River fans beneath. It took almost an hour for them to be cleared, to the intense irritation of the home fans who, according to Argentinian regulations, can't leave the ground until the away fans are safely out of the way.</p> <p>As they left, Boca's fans left a trail of minor destruction.

The mine, not far from the Red Sea coast near Marsa Alam, is joint-owned with the Egyptian government.</p> <p>The company attempted to allay fears, saying the mine remains operational.</p> <p>It said</p> <blockquote> Comments reportedly made by an Egyptian administrative court this morning have given rise to speculation that parts of the Concession Agreement may have, in fact, been suspended. However at this time, no details of a final decision are available and no written judgement has been given. <br> Centamin confirms that it is not a party to this case, repeats its view that the concession as law 222 of 1994 remains valid and that the court does not have jurisdiction to cancel it.  The Company will inform the market further as soon as more information is available.

The CEO of ConEd, Kevin Burke, said it was the \"worst storm in ConEd's history\" and that it would take three to four days to fix up the substation at 14th Street and FDR Drive, which failed so catastrophically late on Monday. Better news for Staten Island: three substations there are back online. At 11am today,&#xa0;780,000 customers were without electrical service.</p> <p>It's clear that New York City will remain paralysed for days to come: seven East River railway tunnels are flooded; the Holland, Queens, Midtown and Brooklyn-Battery tunnels are also inundated.

People are without power, and a few trees are down, but they have homes.</p> <p>In Loch Arbour, a tiny community neighbouring Asbury Park, it's a different story. A row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic has been decimated by the storm.</p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled building painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. On one side the front wall has been swept away. Inside furniture is entirely missing too, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall is also gone, with the surge having swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sand.</p> <p>\"The water just washed right through,\" Gleeson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bill Gleeson's house in Loch Arbour suffered severe damage. 3ft of sand left inside. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy\">#sandy</a> cc @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewwells\">matthewwells</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/4nJdinLt\" title=\"http://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425/photo/1\">twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:16:04+00:00\">October 30, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In Loch Arbour, West Rekeda, 47, manager of Kassin Beach club, also said the ocean \u201ccame right through the building\u201d.</p> <p>The club is closer to the beach than the houses.

Bloomberg said the city was working with staff to move patients out.</p> <p>Television reporters at the scene described a race against time on Monday night as doctors and nurses carried newborns wrapped in blankets, their breathing tubes still attached, from the intensive care unit down multiple flights of stairs in the dark and into waiting lines of ambulances.&#xa0;</p> <p>Problems with telephone service meant that the families of patients were not being called to inform them that their relatives had been moved, the hospital said. It was left to the receiving hospitals, among them Mount Sinai and Sloan Kettering, to inform them, according to the hospital.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the hospital said the facility, which has eight different generators, including one on a higher floor, was still trying to assess what went wrong.</p> <p>The spokesman told Stacey Sager from WABC that they do not think all eight went out but if in fact some are still working, it is not enough to power the whole hospital.</p> <p>NYU didn't anticipate such heavy flooding from Sandy, the massive storm that hit the coast on Monday. They decided not to evacuate all patients before the storm, in contrast to the procedure carried out by Irene as it did with a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/30/health/sandy-hospital/index.html.\">according to CNN.</a></p> <p>Dr Andrew Brotman, senior vice president and vice dean for clinical affairs and strategy at the hospital told CNN that, between 7 and 7.45pm on Monday the hospital's basement, lower floors, and elevator shafts filled with 10 to 12 feet of water and the hospital lost its power.</p> <p>\"Things went downhill very, very rapidly and very unexpectedly,\" Brotman said. \"The flooding was just unprecedented.\"</p> <p>Emergency generators began, he said, but two hours later, about 90% of that power went out, and the hospital decided to evacuate patients, beginning with those critically ill.</p> <p>One report, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57542362/inside-nyc-hospitals-near-disaster-during-sandy/?tag=socsh\">from CBS News</a>, said that the second backup device, on a low floor, was disabled by the water, while the primary backup, on the roof, was disabled when a fuel pump on a lower floor was flooded.</p> <p>Four of the newborn babies were on respirators which were breathing for them and when the power went out, each baby was carried down nine flights of stairs while a nurse manually squeezed a bag to deliver air to the baby's lungs.</p> <p>The hospital usually has about 800 patients, but hundreds of patients were discharged over the weekend in anticipation of the storm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7ebb0fc0-d76e-49ed-a3bf-8bcbbd019b91\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615586962/2e28f91d-f01d-4f7c-8796-c512dd8822a8-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hospital workers evacuate patient Deborah Dadlani from NYU Langone Medical Center during Hurricane Sandy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hospital workers evacuate patient Deborah Dadlani from NYU Langone Medical Center during Hurricane Sandy.

He had been planning to hold events in Ohio but will remain at White House.</p> <p>In some ways \u2013 a big way \u2013 the storm is the biggest campaign event of all, an unexpected bonus for Obama. It allows him to appear presidential and casts Mitt Romney in a bit part .</p> <p>The praise from New Jersey governor Chris Christie for Obama over his handling of Sandy has been a big boost. The Romney campaign must be wondering what on earth Christie was thinking. It is one thing to acknowledge help from the White House but did he really have to go far as to describe this as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>Romney is the one on the defensive, reporters watching for whether he appearance at relief event in Ohio veers into campaigning.</p> <p>I spent an hour this morning speaking to Obama campaign workers on the ground in Iowa and other swing states in the Mid-West and West and they are unaffected by Sandy. They are going ahead as normal with campaign plans, stepping up, as scheduled, getting out the votes. This effort will intensify over the weekend, with volunteers working three-hour shifts from 8.00 am on Saturday through to 9pm and from noon to 9pm on Sunday.&#xa0;Predictions among some Obama campaign workers on the ground that Romney has North Carolina in bag, and will take Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Obama, they hope, will take Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p> <p>Mitt Romney is to take a gamble by resuming campaigning on Wednesday. He has scheduled several campaign events in Florida: in Tampa, Coral Gables and Jacksonville. The danger for him is that people might not yet be ready by then to make the switch from focus on the storm to politics, and his speeches on the campaign trail may look petty compared with Obama still dealing with the storm aftermath from the White House.</p> <p><em>Ewen MacAskill in Washington DC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9c90e3-e0fb-455a-b23b-6a335342091f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615172227/2cbffcf6-7e87-4a88-8e37-9f09b6e4dd8f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.

Four runners looked around surreptitiously as they squeezed around the metal barrier blocking the road that runs through the park at 79th street.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots, some people just don\u2019t realise they are taking their lives in their own hands,\u201d said a park worker shortly after escorting a sheepish looking jogger over a low wall and onto the pavement of Fifth Avenue. \u201cThere is a lot of damage, a lot of limbs of trees down, and there could still be a lot that come down as the day goes on.

Water and debris has choked the entrance right up to the tunnel's roof, with flotsam bobbing just beneath a sign warning drivers that the clearance height is 12 ft 7ins.</p> <p>A maintenance truck lies almost entirely submerged on the sliproad down to the tunnel. There was no sign of the water receding in the 20 minutes I spent there.</p> <p>Many buildings in this southernmost part of Manhattan were inundated by the storm surge. Along Water Street, which runs parallel to the East River waterfront, a fire crew surveyed the damage to their station. Windows were smashed and sandbags proved useless against the flow of water. Inside, uniforms were strewn about the floor, which was still damp.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were in place in this part of the city, one of the most vulnerable places to a storms surge.</p> <p>The water poured into the entrance to the Whitehall ferry terminal, which provides a connection to Staten Island.</p> <p>An MTA employee told the Guardian that at 7.30am water was \u201cup to the platform\u201d in the terminal. He said some of the tunnels running under the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn were entirely full of water, from roof to floor. The MTA was unable to pump out water quick enough because equipment was affected by power outages.</p> <p>Most people had heeded the extensive warnings and these streets were largely clear before the storm hit on Monday. But some people were caught out by the severity of the flooding. A new-looking white BMW 3 series car had been carried down a street close to the ferry terminal and dumped askew, partly on the road and partly on the sidewalk. A door had apparently been forced open by the storm, and pools of dank-smelling water had accumulated in the passenger footwells.</p> <p>Most of lower Manhattan below 24th Street was without power Tuesday morning. In Midtown, the damage was less from flooding and more from high winds, with branches and other foliage lining the roads. In some places there had been minor scaffolding collapses and tiles had smashed to the ground.</p> <p>There is a large police presence: squad cars with flashing lights were crawling around Manhattan, although the clean-up operation did not seem to have kicked in by 11am and the police seemed mostly to be reporting damage and acting as reassurance.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff0efab7-a541-4d26-beb3-e07281a88354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351612279741/95325abd-cb27-487d-9737-475f82845650-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hurricane Sandy floods reach the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water reaches the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.

Riverside Park had a few downed trees, but the inconvenience was more caused by the downed branches, that numerous joggers jumped over as they went for their morning runs.</p> <p>Doormen and supers were hard at work hosing leaves from the sidewalks and curbs in front of their buildings. Some even had the time to put up Halloween decorations in their buildings lobbies.</p> <p>On Broadway, some stores lost their signs, which blew off in the wind.

This morning the man once seen as a likely Republican vice presidential pick has called president Barack Obama \u201coutstanding\u201d and blasted suggestions that his state would make a great photo op for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>New Jersey has been hit hard, three people have lost their lives so far to the storm, 2.4m people are out of power and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. And Christie has no time for politics.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, the administration, the president, himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cWe have a great partnership with them.\u201d</p> <p>Obama called on Christie Monday night, the governor said, and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\u201d said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News host Steve Doocy made a pitch for a Christie/Romney photo op in some disaster-stricken New Jersey&#xa0;\u201cOver the last couple of months, you have appeared throughout the country, governor, on behalf of Mitt Romney,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWe hear that perhaps Mr Romney may do some storm-related events. Is there any possibility that governor Romney may go to New Jersey to tour some of the damage with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that\u2019s much bigger than presidential politics and I could care less about any of that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got 2.4 million people out of power, I\u2019ve got devastation on the shore, I\u2019ve got floods in the northern part of my state.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the vigilance, it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations were not able to provide, \u201cand to provide what is missing\u201d. They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government\u2019s response, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could the government do differently?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It\u2019s really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don\u2019t think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032480&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Prospery+Raymond+of+Christian+Aid+talks+to+the+Guardian%27s+Paul+Owen&amp;amp;mp3Time=02.11pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032480&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508fe1d2b5792d0b94e6eaac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T14:18:58.992Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A video posted to YouTube captures the collapse last night of the <strong>facade of a building</strong> on 8th Ave in NYC.

We had tremendous amounts of water, tremendous amounts of flooding, severe winds, and we\u2019re seeing those effects across the country, with damaged homes, flooded homes, people displaced, crops and gardens destroyed and lives lost: 52 lives were lost, and it\u2019s extremely heartbreaking.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said she had just got off the phone to a friend whose colleague lost his entire family in a landslide that destroyed their home with his family inside.</p> <p>Van de Wetering explained how Tearfund was helping to respond to the disaster: since the earthquake of 2010 and Hurricane Isaac last year the charity had been helping repair homes and \u201cto address some of the agriculture and livelihood issues\u201d, especially in the rural mountains. \u201cNow Hurricane Sandy has created even more need and to be sure this response will also be addressing the needs of some of those people who now find themselves in a very difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>I asked her to explain how Sandy had caused problems in terms of food shortages.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We can look at the context prior to both tropical storm Isaac and Hurricane Sandy with increasing food prices and food insecurity throughout the last several months. With tropical storm Isaac and now Sandy a lot of the crops have been destroyed. There are numerous crops that were ready for harvesting that have now been destroyed. Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d, with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \u201cbut in the coming months we\u2019re going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\u201d.</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Lisa Laumann of Save the Children (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts#block-508fce92b5792d0b94e6eaa0%20\">see earlier</a>) that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they\u2019re stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There\u2019ll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032437&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Kristie+van+de+Wetering+of+Tearfund+talks+to+Paul+Owen+of+the+Guardian&amp;amp;mp3Time=01.35pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032437&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4be088ea-7c66-4ebc-90d8-310c0259fef9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351605351867/5892f225-892b-46fa-822f-1e35d257ffdf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A resident of Leogane, Haiti makes her way to her home as the water level continues to rise on 26 October 2012.

It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain, that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I\u2019ve hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There\u2019s been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diaorrhea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \u201cplayed a role in preparation and response\u201d, but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it\u2019s important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\u201d</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \u201cThere certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\u201d</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It\u2019s hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that\u2019s going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there\u2019s some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b049e51c-f6ba-45c2-bc8b-89eac47f229b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351602063625/42cd89c9-da9f-4fd0-a7d3-6298969cdbe3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The interior of a home is flooded after the passing of Hurricane Sandy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Saturday 27 October 2012.

Sandy has taken on the structure of a wintertime low-pressure area, so is no longer a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The NHC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary difference between a tropical cyclone and a wintertime cyclone is the energy source. Tropical cyclones extract heat from the ocean and grow by releasing that heat in the atmosphere near the storm center. Wintertime cyclones (also called extratropical or frontal <br>lows), on the other hand, get most of their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere, and this energy usually gets distributed over larger areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because of these differences, tropical cyclones tend to have more compact wind fields, tend to be more symmetric, and have a well-defined inner core of strong winds. Wintertime lows have strong temperature contrasts or fronts attached to them, have a broader wind field, and more complex distributions of rain or snow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f94a795cb55519dae8b43\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T08:49:43.874Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fire in Queens, New York</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fire department spokesman has told AP more than 190 firefighters are battling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts?commentpage=all#block-508f8bc5b5792d0b94e6ea81\">the blaze in Breezy Point</a>.

  "<p>Disability and abortion are two words not without a creeping discomfort. More so, when put together. The&#xa0;latter recently reared its head; casual calls to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">draw back</a> a woman's right to choose are now familiar in their cyclicality. The Tory minister for women <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/03/abortion-limit-reduction-maria-miller\" title=\"\">Maria Miller</a>, for her part, would like to reduce the abortion time limit to 20 weeks. Despite the fact that this is the point when many foetal abnormalities are detected, Miller, the former minister for disabled people, made no mention of what it would mean for women whose 20-week scan showed their child would have a disability. She either hadn't thought it through or didn't much care.</p> <p>Some people seem to care, often more than they should. Last month, an alliance of \"pro-life\" campaigners and religious groups <a href=\"http://www.cmfblog.org.uk/2012/09/19/current-law-supports-eugenic-abortion-for-disabled-people-our-letter-in-todays-daily-telegraph/\" title=\"\">launched</a> a campaign to ban the termination of pregnancies on the grounds of disability. The Paralympics \u2013 with its \"astonishing examples of courage and triumphs over disability\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9551305/Call-for-ban-on-disability-abortions-after-Paralympics.html\" title=\"\">they said</a>, highlighted the \"contradiction\" in the current abortion law.</p> <p>The contradiction they refer to is that while the Abortion Act 1967 sets a&#xa0;24-week limit on having an abortion, when there is \"substantial risk that if the child were born, she or he would have physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped\", there is no limit. There are good reasons for that \u2013 medicine, practicality and basic human empathy.</p> <p>Last year, out of the almost 190,000 abortions in England and Wales, 146 of them were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/perils-playing-politics-with-abortion\" title=\"\">after the 24-week point</a>. However, the percentage of couples who choose an abortion after discovering their baby will have Down's syndrome is routinely 90%. For some, being told their child will have a severe disability is reason enough not to go ahead with the pregnancy. Worse (if certain moral judgments are to be applied), this is sometimes the case for pregnancies resulting from IVF that, before the word \"disabled\" was uttered, were much wanted.</p> <p>Those trying to ban abortions on disability grounds claim that this is \"eugenics\", a form of \"disability discrimination\". And they think a&#xa0;sporting event that displays the most physically able disabled people tells us all we need to know about disability and, while we're at it, a woman's decision-making process. These are campaigners who reduce the nuances of disability to an insulting level, yet speak as if they are saving us from being wiped out, and we should be grateful.</p> <p>There are times when abortion is the humane choice. In reality, there are times when people feel they simply cannot cope. It's OK to say that out loud. The thought doesn't suggest a disabled life is worth less, but acknowledges the extra time, energy and money a severely disabled life needs. Right now, there are parents of disabled children who are having to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/24/families-disabled-children-loans-basics\" title=\"\">skip meals</a> to pay the gas bill. There are disabled children who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/disability-charities-families-gaps-care\" title=\"\">aren't getting</a> the childcare, schools, therapies or even healthcare they need. If aborting a disabled foetus makes you uncomfortable, perhaps that should too.</p> <p>It's convenient to judge the individual choosing the abortion. Truth is, many make their choice based on the conditions of society. To care about disability means working to make these changes, not using it as a smokescreen to take women's rights.</p>",

Nothing is too low.</p> <p>\"Congratulations on your first confirmed kill,\" he chillingly writes on a card to a junior who ill in hospital goes along with his plot to unseat the leader of the opposition. Out of the box drifts a helium balloon with a picture of the deposed leader sellotaped to it. A perfect blend of malice and slapstick.</p> <p>Watching the programme is also a secret vice of comms people to talk of the programme in hushed tones.</p> <p>A few years ago the subject of The Thick Of It came up in a conversation I had with someone who had worked at the heart of government in the civil service. \"On a good day it was nothing like it,\" the individual said. \"On a bad day it was actually a toned down documentary.\"</p> <p>Yet, part of me thinks people will look back in years to come and find that Malcolm Tucker is a bygone relic. Obsessed with newspaper headlines and able to cajole the priesthood of journalists with bribes and threats.</p> <p>Or maybe the government comms people of the future will be just as frenetic and just as twitchy about public opinion. It's just that it'll be the bloggers and the digital journalists they'll be obsessed about.</p> <p>The fourth series ended with Tucker disgraced, chased by a press pack from a police station after handing himself in to be arrested after he perjured himself at a public enquiry.</p> <p>And Malcolm Tucker, to use a very Malcom Tucker word, 'is damaging'.</p> <p>Why damaging?</p> <p>Because he forms people's warped idea of what a public sector comms person looks like. Which is why he needs to be brought down from grace. It's why he needs to die. Under a bus. Outside parliament. With a single bunch of flowers from his ma in Scotland. Leaving a stack of cracking YouTube clips as his legacy.</p> <p>Comms, like journalism, is a broad church and across it finds all sorts of characters and practices. Yet there is nothing I find in what he does remotely similar to what I do working in an environment that encourages open access to social media and open data. Central government people may disagree.</p> <p>But as Alastair Campbell, the man who did most to create the late 20th century idea of a spin doctor, said recently the landscape has changed: \"You can't dominate the news agenda now. The agenda is more chaotic but that's a good thing.\"</p> <p><em>Dan Slee is senior press and PR officer at Walsall council.

  "<p>A new wave of so-called 'City Deals' <a href=\"http://www.dpm.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/news/bold-deals-set-more-cities-free-growth\">has just been announced</a> by the Government in which 20 cities and their wider areas will be given the opportunity to bid for radical new powers to boost local growth. </p> <p>This involves the Government devolving powers in exchange for responsibility for delivering growth locally and includes the ability to 'earn back' tax from the Treasury as well as devolved transport budgets and control of the skills budget for each city. </p> <p>This new wave includes several cities in the north of England: Hull and the Humber; Preston and Lancashire; Sunderland; and the Tees Valley \u2013 adding to existing City Deals in Leeds, Liverpool, Newcastle and Sheffield and the first of them all in Greater Manchester which set the benchmark for those announced today.</p> <p>A key theme of City Deals is the need to have economic growth. Whilst this remains a driver for national and local government, solely concentrating on economic outputs severely limits potential to invest in communities and effectively tackle some of the long-term and structural inequalities that people face. For instance, such an approach can potentially exclude areas that form a critical portion of the non-market economy. </p> <p>There must be a balance between the two. Successive investment and regeneration have changed the physical structures of place, yet entrenched social policy problems remain for some sections of the communities that live there. In order to address this, we need to involve all those that live in communities to best support the potential capabilities in a way that can drive social regeneration within some of our most consistently deprived communities.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.the-sarf.org.uk/\">Social Action &amp; Research Foundation</a>, a new think-tank based in Salford which co-produces policies to eradicate poverty (of which I am a co-Director alongside Amina Lone), proposes the idea of <strong>Hot-Housing Public Policy</strong>; this is a new way of evidencing, shaping and delivering public policy that draws upon the range of expertise and knowledge of those that live and work in communities. In turn this will lead to more co-produced public services, which are effective and efficient and that deepen democratic accountability. </p> <p>The City Deals provide a unique opportunity to be able to deliver this, but it requires some creative thinking. Successful innovation in one area will not be directly transferable to others, and will require local reinterpretation. Therefore, the City Deals should put in place commissioning and performance frameworks that enable local innovation to flourish, whilst maintaining the necessary monitoring that is required in order to assess effectiveness. </p> <p>It is important to provide the necessary space whereby policy ideas can be nurtured within the local communities that they are rooted. In order to achieve this, City Deals could provide a skeleton framework as well as a support function that will allow the strategic and coordinated measures that are necessary. Alongside this, it is important to ensure adequate safety mechanisms and a level of quality assurance and standards across the board. However within this framework, communities must be given greater voice within local decision-making processes to be able to implement interventions and deliver co-produced services at a local level that are more in tune to local needs.</p> <p>A coordinated approach will then be necessary to propagate the more successful innovations by supporting their replication to each locality, while allowing for a flexibility that can meet the specific needs and challenges of the area. This allows a basic framework with a universal policy approach to provide equitable delivery of services, whilst ensuring the flexibility for each co-produced project to be cross-fertilised with local expertise. </p> <p>The development of innovations in public policy and its implementation in each City Deal area will then grow organically. This builds upon the successful and creative interventions that have already occurred, whilst providing more space, ownership and empowerment for such innovations to flourish, while providing the necessary frameworks to ensure the needs of all our diverse guarantees are met. Through such an approach, City Deals can help to contribute to increased localism within our communities in a way that creates efficient, effective and equitable public services.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398561112\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351595195025/silver.jpg\" alt=\"city deals\" width=\"130\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Dan Silver </strong>is director of the <a href=\"Dan Silver is director of the Social Action and Research Foundation based in Salford.

  "<p>If you want to be a successful teacher and conquer behaviour management I've heard you shouldn't smile before Christmas. Last week my PGCE course was compared to turkey rearing in as much as my fear of an unruly class was compared to that of a turkey's fear of 25 December as neither of us will be prepared for the full horror of what we will face. However, I am hoping I will still have a smile and at least a few feathers intact by the time Santa arrives.</p> <p>Training to be a teacher is confusing. We are supposed to plan all our lessons, but ensure we are flexible and above all have other ideas. We are supposed to be friendly with the students, but not too friendly and not too strict either. We are supposed to teach them our expertise, but not spoon-feed too much and teach them life skills, not just teach for exams, but of course, while we're not teaching for exams, they have to get a C or above. Also what is it with education and shortening words? I got my CRB check, in order for me to start my PGCE and not the GTP, ITT or SCITT. I am learning about KS3, GCSE, AS and A2, with other supportive people such as the SMT, TAs, ASTs, EWOs, and SENCOs in order for me to achieve QTS and be an NQT in which case I will most likely try and avoid Ofsted and any other acronyms I may come across.</p> <p>I have realised during the last few days that unfortunately my future career is also in the hands of the media. Students love stereotypical teachers. I have already been asked if my water bottle is filled with vodka, not water, due to Waterloo Road. I observed a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3cayRMnVb8\">Kes style PE lesson</a> and everyone knows the supply teacher who thinks she is Professor McGonagall from Hogwarts. Personally, I'm sure I would prefer to work in a school similar to Rydell High, Grease style, where the students sing down the stairs instead of race and a leather jacket is much cooler than a blazer, right?</p> <p>So far it has been intense, but exciting. I have spent a few days at my first placement school, which was lovely, despite the fact I was mistaken for a new sixth form student. Trust me, I have my power heels ready and have considered sticking my staff badge to my forehead. I have been warned in a kind of nice-ish Trinny and Susannah way, what not to wear. No socks with sandals (as if I would anyway), no cartoon ties (oh please), no blue hair (or any other artificial colour for that matter) and no visible undergarments. Enough said. My poor friend has already been labelled The Birdwatcher by her students, due to owning two items of clothing with a form of bird print on them.</p> <p>I am aware stress is on the horizon and have been told at least 30 times that this is going to be the hardest year of my life. But, I am armed with my Kalms and have a stack of Cadbury's at the ready. On Thursday a rather self-assured, year 9 girl asked me: \"Why on earth did you want to be a teacher miss?\" I told her, because I enjoyed school and I want my students to enjoy it too. She smiled and said: \"Ahhhhh miss, that's nice, no teacher ever says that. Are you a fun teacher, or do you just think you're a fun teacher?\" \"I'm a really fun teacher,\" I insisted with a fresh-faced trainee teacher look. \"What do you teach miss?\" she asked. \"French and German,\" I proudly said. What I then received was a look of pure horror and confusion. It appears that according to year 9 the words \"French\" and \"fun\" do not often occur in the same sentence. Challenge set. Some may say I'm naive, I guess I'll soon find out.</p> <p><em>Charlotte Derrett graduated in French, German and media and is studying for her PGCE at <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/\">Newcastle University</a>.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<h2>What's the first thing you do when you're marketing a production?</h2> <p><strong>Paula Rabbit, head of press:</strong> When we begin to work on a press campaign one of the very first things we do, other than read the script, is talk to the director \u2013 find out what their vision for the show is because they are a mine of information about the play's background. If it's a new play, talk to the writer and find out what inspired them; very often their inspiration can make a great media pitch. Find out as much as you can from the actors too. What is particularly important in regional theatre is any sort of regional connection \u2013 local papers love a local angle.</p> <p>Once we have all this information we write a press strategy, which can be incredibly specific: it details what the media pitch might be; what newspapers or websites it would be a good fit for; who we should approach and when we should do it. Photos are also really important so working into our plan when we'll have those is vital. Things change all the time so it's important the strategy is a working document.</p> <p><strong>Nick Boaden, head of marketing: </strong>Read the script, talk to the director and the writer (where possible \u2013 research the writer when not) to fully understand the production. We will often chat about our existing audiences and find \"ways in\" so that the director's creative vision will make sense to those audiences. We're not in the business of \"persuading\" people to see something they're going to get nothing out of \u2013 that helps absolutely no one.</p> <p>If it's an existing and well known script (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/series/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-at-west-yorkshire-playhouse\" title=\"\">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a> for example) then we'll be sharing research sources and spending time on Google. A great part of being such a busy theatre is that we tend to become really hot on one subject for the planning period, and into production, and then move on to something new. So in the space of a month, \"all you need to know about Beckett\" becomes \"James Bourne \u2013 who is he?\"</p> <h2>How can theatres outside of London attract national press to their performances?</h2> <p><strong>Paula: </strong>I honestly don't think there are any standard do's and don'ts. What I think is important is to build a relationship with as many journalists as you can \u2013 not every conversation or visit or email needs to be about gaining column inches or securing a review. Begin to build up the trust between you and your key contacts so that when you send in your pitch, they'll be more likely to take a look.</p> <p>Don't do 'trawler fishing' pitches \u2013 by that I mean don't pitch everything to everyone. Be very selective and trust your instincts as some ideas will be a better fit for certain journalists. You also need to know when you have chased a pitch enough; I suspect there is nothing more frustrating than having five phone calls a day from a very persistent press office when you're on deadline.</p> <p>What we in the regions don't have is the luxury of being geographically close to some of the UK's key arts journalists, but don't be afraid to invite them to your theatre. If you know they're attending a press night, suggest they get an earlier train and come and have dinner with you first, or a quick backstage tour or tea with your artistic director.</p> <p>I guess another tip would be to call when your press night is fast approaching \u2013 a quick personal reminder for them to add your show into their list is good. If there are other shows opening in your region then be willing to be a bit flexible with dates so that critics can hit more than one production on a single trip. That said, it's also really handy to keep up with your colleagues in other theatres in the area.</p> <h2>What's the key to keeping a well-known show like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof fresh and interesting to audiences?</h2> <p><strong>Su Matthewman, director of communications:</strong> Ensuring that one of the reasons we're producing it in the first place is that it's relevant for audiences today, and that there are issues and themes within it that are pertinent to the society we live in. And then drawing on these for external messages to audiences, so that the reasons for doing the show in the first place are absolutely clear and understandable.</p> <p><strong>Paula: </strong>I think it's about reminding people that the show's themes are as relevant today as they were when the play was first produced. Interestingly I think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/10/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-review\" title=\"\">Michael Billington in his historical piece</a> references the fact that even though Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is thought of as Williams' greatest play, it isn't actually performed that often.</p> <p>Getting people to chat about the show also really makes a difference \u2013 Twitter responses for our production of Cat have been great and sparked some really interesting conversations.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A mother who has admitted killing her two babies at her home in Wandsworth, south London, has told a court that she is \"truly sorry\" and thought she was a \"good mum\".</p> <p>Felicia Boots, 35, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 10-week-old Mason and his 14-month-old sister, Lily, on 9 May on the grounds of diminished responsibilty. Boots had faced murder charges but the plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted by the prosecution.</p> <p>Boots, who lived with her investment banker husband in a salubrious area of London \u2013 referred to as \"nappy valley\" because of the number of couples with infants there \u2013 at the time of the children's deaths, has been unable to attend two previous hearings after being detained in a psychiatric unit.</p> <p>Wearing a black suit and white blouse at the Old Bailey, she began crying as she was asked to stand and enter pleas on the two murder charges.</p> <p>She pleaded not guilty to murder, but guilty to manslaughter because of diminished responsibility, on both counts.</p> <p>She sent a note to the court which was read by her counsel, Kate Bex, which read: \"9 May 2012 is a day I will be eternally sorry for. It should never have happened. It troubles me more than anyone will ever know. Part of me will always be missing. I am a good person. I am a good mum and I never meant any of this to happen. I am truly sorry.\"</p> <p>Edward Brown QC, prosecuting, told the court that it was not dealing with a murder, but a tragedy. \"This plainly is a tragic case,\" he said.</p> <p>The Crown had closely examined the medical evidence and spoken to Boots's husband, Jeff, who was in court, he added. \"The authors of the reports are clear and agreed in their conclusions as to Boots's condition as at 9 May and the reasons for her actions on that day. As a result the Crown has taken the firm view that it is not in the public interest to pursue the counts of murder but to accept the pleas as entered.\"</p> <p>Boots was ordered to be detained at a psychiatric unit and the court was told she would be given full support and care if she became pregnant again.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Fulford, said: \"A prison sentence would be wholly inappropriate in this case.\" He added: \"This is an almost indescribably sad case.</p> <p>\"Although the results of Mrs Boots's actions were profoundly tragic given the loss of two young lives, what occurred was not criminal activity in the sense that expression is normally understood.</p> <p>\"I unreservedly accept that what she did to the two children, that she and her husband loved and nurtured, were the results of physical and biological factors beyond her control.\"</p> <p>There was no doubt of the strength of the relationship between the couple. \"This has always been a happy family,\" he said. \"This is someone who delighted in being a mother and she was good at it.\"</p> <p>He said Boots may have hidden the extent of her mental anguish from her husband and family. The judge did not impose any restriction on the time Boots would be detained. Her husband and his family said they did not wish to make any further comments about the case.</p> <p>It is believed Boots was suffering from severe postnatal depression when she killed her two children at the family's home. Her husband came home from work to find the two children lying side by side on the floor of a walk-in wardrobe. He called emergency services but the children could not be revived.</p> <p>Unconfirmed reports suggest that Boots attempted to take her own life, but did not need medical attention. The formal cause of the children's death has not been confirmed but it is thought they were suffocated.</p>",
  "<p>Judi Dench started life as M, the fictional head of MI6, by calling James Bond a \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqS9jxruy-A\" title=\"\">sexist, misogynist dinosaur</a>\". Oh how we cheered, us feminists sick of a long-running multibillion-pound franchise that left a series of beautiful women as little more than roadkill in the path of the spy we never loved. Seventeen years later, the great Dame seems to have left us with a film, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144416/skyfall\" title=\"\">Skyfall</a>, we can all cheer. Or at least a proper female hero.</p> <p>This statement may cause offence both to other feminists and die-hard fans who have long maintained that us laydeez can just go and talk on the phone while they enjoy the ultimate in male fantasy. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7694801.stm\" title=\"\">Feminist author Bidisha</a> once said: \"Ian Fleming hates women and I don't buy into anything to do with that. The Bond films are generally sexist. I don't like anything that descends from a sewer of misogyny.\" And writer and broadcaster Fay Weldon said: \"These characters were male fantasy figures. These films were attempts by men to keep women in their place and to ensure they still ironed their shirts.\"</p> <p>The procession of women with ludicrous names (Pussy Galore: arf arf) and the patronising use of \"girl\", dreadful dialogue (some of which you can enjoy <a href=\"http://movies.uk.msn.com/features/james-bond-sexist-misogynist-dinosaur\" title=\"\">here</a>) and ridiculous storylines have made me hate the whole idea of Bond. Until now.</p> <p>The main cause for celebration is Judi Dench as M, the real hero of the film. Not only is she in charge but she shows both emotional power over her subordinates and human failure. She is no longer the joke older woman, there to act as the only foil to Bond's charms, but a real character with heroic traits.</p> <p>When she first took the role in 1995 for Pierce Brosnan's Bond debut, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/60213/goldeneye\" title=\"\">GoldenEye</a>, Dench's appointment was inspired by the rise to prominence of real-life MI5 boss <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Rimington\" title=\"\">Stella Rimington</a>, who had recently become the organisation's first female director-general. Rimington retired in 1996, aged 61, after just four years in the top job. In Skyfall, Dench, who has had far longer in the fictional post, is judged to be past her best as the Whitehall mandarins try to edge her out. (I didn't miss the fact that the most hostile questioning from an ensuing committee-roasting comes from a female politician \u2013 as if the film's creators can't resist a bit of girl-on-girl action.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0110483/\" title=\"\">Barbara Broccoli</a>, one of the two co-producers, previously elicited derision when she called the Bond girls of the 60s \"feminist role models\" career women who were \"sexual predators\" giving as good as they got. With Judi Dench's M she has finally provided a role model. Without the sex. (I'm largely ignoring the oedipal overtones of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2012/oct/28/profile-javier-bardem\" title=\"\">Javier Bardem's villain</a>.)</p> <p>There are moments when the old Bond comes back in Skyfall. The film opens with a vehicle chase in which Bond laughs at Naomie Harris's driving skills (gasp, she knocks a couple of wing mirrors off while swerving at supersonic speed through rush-hour Istanbul) and then shows her less-than-sure aim with a gun. And, as Peter Bradshaw points out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review\" title=\"\">in his review</a>, \"the scene in which 007 steps suavely into the shower with delectable S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe) could have happened at any time in the last half-century.\"</p> <p>The backstory for S\u00e9v\u00e9rine (spoiler alert), that of trafficking and abuse, also seems a bit of a turning point for Bond, although I'm no aficionado so forgive me if I'm wrong. Maybe the Bond women have all been victims of violence and I just wasn't listening while I shouted at the screen.</p> <p>I can't help thinking that this shift in the position of women in the film (well, one film really) is part of the reason why Skyfall has had the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/29/skyfall-uk-box-office-records-james-bond\" title=\"\">biggest ever Bond opening</a> and is on course to outpace 2006's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103963/casino.royale\" title=\"\">Casino Royale</a> (with $586m) as the most successful Bond film of all time at the box office.</p> <p>Yet I'm sure many of the die-hard fans of the franchise will disagree. Even the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/13/skyfall-james-bond-first-look-review?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Guardian's own Xan Brooks</a> dissed the \"touchy-feely indulgence\" in Bond's childhood trauma and his relationship with a woman old enough to be (of course) his mother. \"Don't they realise that 007 has always been at his most convincing when he's at his crudest and least adorned; when he's serving as a blank canvas for macho fantasy; the dark angel of our disreputable natures?\"</p> <p>I don't agree. I don't think it's good for boys or men to grow up thinking that misogyny and xenophobia are sexy (not to mention the idea that all baddies have a disability).</p> <p>Perhaps my head was turned not on Saturday night when I saw Skyfall but 19 months ago when Dench and Craig teamed up to create the Equals video calling for equality. If you haven't seen it, watch it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkp4t5NYzVM\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, says the disembodied voice of Dench, a man is still likely to earn more for doing the same job and less likely to be judged for promiscuous behaviour. Hardly a ringing endorsement for a spy with money to burn and a string of lovers was it?</p> <p>Some will argue that Bond is still awful for presenting a consumerist utopia where only the people with the money (to buy cars, computers, helicopters) can win. But that's a whole other piece. For now, will you join me in celebrating a sexy Bond with just a bit of the sexist left out?</p>",
  "<p>The ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, has been urged by a human rights organisation not to approve a media law that will compromise press freedom.</p> <p>The New York-based <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) argues that the draft law contains penalties for those who criticise Qatar and its neighbouring governments. </p> <p>It would create a double standard on free expression that is inconsistent with Qatar's claims to be a centre for media freedom in the region.</p> <p>In 1996, Sheikh Hamad was responsible for setting up Al-Jazeera, the news network that has been so prominent in reporting popular uprisings in the Middle East. </p> <p>But the draft law, which Qatar's legislative body approved in June 2012, would undermine press freedom, according to HRW.</p> <p>Its deputy Middle East director, Joe Stork, says: \"Instead of supporting press freedom, this draft media law is a commitment to censorship.\"</p> <p>Even before the sheikh makes up his mind on whether to ratify the law, freedom of expression is already under pressure.</p> <p>HRW points to the case of Qatari poet Muhammad Ibn al-Dheeb al-Ajami, who has been in prison for a year after five postponements to his trial on charges of \"inciting the overthrow of the ruling regime,\" which carries the death penalty.</p> <p>It appears that the charges relate to the fact that al-Dheeb recited a poem that appeared on the internet in August 2010 and included passages that insulted the emir. </p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a></p>",
  "<p>As more business is conducted online, the ability to pitch \u2013 to present your product or service to a potential buyer \u2013 has become increasingly important. While your competitors are relying on their email marketing and websites, the person who gets out there and makes a real connection with the client is the one who sets the pace and captures the market. The same principles of pitching underpin both face-to-face sales and more traditional selling, and you can easily apply the tricks of multi-million pound marketing campaigns to increase your success rate.</p> <p><strong>Setting expectations</strong></p> <p>A pitch can be regarded as part of the product itself, much like the trailer for a movie is part of the emotional experience that the director wants to create. The pitch builds the expectations that the product itself then lives up to. An advert or a pitch no longer simply tells the customer the facts of the product; it influences how the customer feels about the product. The queues for the first iPads or iPhones formed long before anyone had actually held one, such was the strength of feeling generated by Apple's marketing campaign. When your pitch works as it should, your customers will experience something similar, already knowing how to feel about your product long before they take delivery of it.</p> <p>Pitching for new business, therefore, isn't just a way to tell customers about your product, it's an integral part of it.</p> <p>Your customers will begin to form their expectations long before you walk into their office to deliver the pitch. From their very first point of contact with you, they are making judgments and assumptions that all affect their perception of your pitch. The solution is to make that very first point of contact part of your pitch. This might be your first phone call to the customer, or it might be the moment that you shake their hand in the reception area. Don't bother with small talk or icebreakers, take every opportunity to influence the outcome of your pitch before your customer even realises you've started.</p> <p><strong>Setting the right goals</strong></p> <p>While pitching is arguably the most important business skill, it may also be the most dreaded. Not only is a fear of public speaking often part of the problem, there is a huge risk of failure associated with pitching.</p> <p>Ask your colleagues about their goals for pitching and they'll likely say things like, \"to win the deal\". This is a completely unrealistic goal, because you can't control the client's decision, and you can't control your competitors. Instead, refocus on a goal that is totally under your control, such as \"get my message across and check that the audience understands it\". Whether that message is right for them is something you can't predict, but they will always respect someone who stands by their principles over someone who tries to hedge their bets.</p> <p><strong>Following up</strong></p> <p>It's very common for people to deliver an excellent pitch, only to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory through their behaviour afterwards. Hearing a \"yes\" at the end of the pitch isn't a cause for instant celebration; it's just one step in the overall business relationship. Let your customer know that they have made the right decision by keeping a professional and business-oriented attitude, and, as soon as you get back to your office, write a follow-up letter that reinforces the key points and reminds the customer of anything that you agreed. If the customer is yet to make a decision, reinforce your enthusiasm to work with them and ask for their business. After all, the customer knows that's why you pitched to them, so don't be afraid to say it.</p> <p>The more that business is conducted online, the more customers value genuine, personal relationships. In a world of increasing choice, we turn to people we trust to help us to make decisions. When your competitors are content to wait for their websites to do the work, you'll find yourself streets ahead by getting out there, making real connections and pitching for new business.</p> <p><em>Paul Boross is a communications expert who runs the online service </em><a href=\"http://www.thepitchdoctor.tv/\" title=\"\"><em>The Pitch Doctor</em></a><em>.

We therefore took a risky but innovative approach to this year's AGM in an effort to capture the imagination of our patients and communities.</p> <p>Adopting the theme of \"Amazing Feats\", the AGM highlighted the real-life amazing feats achieved by the trust, our services and staff. Visually, we interpreted this as a 1920s-style circus. The event involved our services creating circus-themed stalls to showcase their work, a life-size model elephant, and ringmasters entertaining guests. The annual report did not escape the circus theme either: we felt it was important to encourage as many people as possible to read about the trust's journey and showcase the staff's amazing work.</p> <p>A bold stance, perhaps, but it was certainly a head-turner in our drive to ensure that every member of the Merseyside community is encouraged to get involved as we move towards foundation trust (FT) status.</p> </blockquote> <p>As usual you can get in touch with the team throughout the day by tweeting us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnhealthcare\">@GdnHealthcare</a> or emailing us at healthcare@guardian.co.uk. </p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Have you ever hidden under your duvet as you read that Count Olaf is creeping towards the Baudelaire children? Or jumped at the slightest creak or noise as Voldemort draws his wand against Harry? Or even had to check that your bedroom door is firmly shut as the White Witch cackles as she turns people into stone?</p> <p>It's coming up to that spooky time of year again; when witches fly, zombies rise and Dracula asks to be invited in. While some fictional characters may make us jump out of our skin, we do love them (kind of). Let's face it, Red Riding Hood venturing into a deep, dark forest where NOTHING happens to her would would make for a very boring read. She may as well have just popped down out to the cornershop to buy a pint of milk. We need suspense, excitement, shock and fear!</p> <p>The first time I remember being scared stiff was as I was reading Roald Dahl's The Witches. I hid under my cover with a lamp and read and read as the Grand High Witch declared her plan to the world's witches. What was I going to do? And who could I trust? Was anyone I knew a witch? Since then I have both loved and hated scary books - the feeling that my heart is racing and that every noise could be some terrible being creeping around my house makes me feel both petrified and exhilarated!</p> <p>While there may be a lot of frightening female characters - Cruella de Ville, Mrs Coulter, the White Witch, Bellatrix Lestrange, to name just a few - I think that at least you know you could defend yourself if you bumped into one. The same goes for vampires (stake through the heart), or werewolves (silver bullets - they may be hard to come by, but goodness me are they worth it!), and zombies (just cut the head off). But I think the scariest thing of all is not being able to protect yourself, which is why I think that the death eaters are perhaps one of the scariest race of creatures. The float about, swooping down to feast on innocent victims' souls. Unless you're friends with Harry Potter there is nothing you can do. Just think, you could never hang out with your friends anymore, go for a swim or even read another book. You'd just be an empty body - eek!</p> <p>While there are a lot of hair-raising characters out there, Halloween wouldn't be Halloween without getting a bit out of breath, breaking into a cold sweat and screaming as someone opens the door after reading some spooky stories told by torch light! This Halloween, why not read Edgar Allen Poe's tale, The Black Cat, a gruesome and eerie tale about a man who goes mad. Or try Bram Stoker's Dracula, the original vampire story. Reading it makes you feel like a (very unnerved) detective, as you sort through the diary entries, letters and ships logs, trying to make sense of the dark mystery. Or even try Shiver, by Maggie Stiefvater, a tale of forest creatures and human-werewolf love. But watch out for some of the scariest characters hidden in their pages!</p> <p>Each creature is so different and terrifying in it's own way. So, we want to know which scary character is your favourite despite making your blood run cold? Email your suggestions to childrens.books@guardian.co.uk or tweet us @GdnChildrensBks and we'll publish your comments below.</p> <h2>Your scary favourites: </h2> <p><strong>HorseLover3000:</strong><br>I think The Hound of the Baskervilles is especially scary because it is not set in the present day, and they don't have torches or anything. It is written really well and makes me shiver so I don't like to read it on a dark night. It is about Sherlock Holmes, when he is called away to a manor on a deserted moor to investigate the death of someone and strange sightings of a \"Hell hound\".</p>",

  "<p>Apple was in crisis on Monday as it revealed that the architect of its iPhone software, Scott Forstall, once tipped as a future chief executive, is leaving the company next year. John Browett, the retail chief poached from British chain Dixons only six months ago, is also going.</p> <p>For those who have watched Forstall's ascent \u2013 pushed out, without doubt, by a ruthless Tim Cook as sure as if he were a misfiring supplier \u2013 it means one thing: no more \"skeuomorphism\".</p> <p>Forstall had become infamous as the person within Apple who drove the use of computer interfaces that appeared like real-life objects, so that the iPad's calendar had a faux-leather appearance and deleting a ticket in the new Passbook app invoked a virtual shredder \u2013 which Forstall showed off with clear glee when launching the iPhone 5 in September. Now, it's his pass that's in the shredder.</p> <p>Instead, Jonathan Ive (who has been at Apple longer even than Cook having joined in 1998) will be in charge of the \"human interface\" elements of the business \u2013 the first time that he has been put in charge of software as well as hardware.</p> <p>There had been rumours that Forstall was in bad favour after he did not appear on stage at the launch of the iPad mini in San Jose last week \u2013 although he was present at the location on the day and was seen outside a nearby hotel after the launch.</p> <p>The departure of retail chief John Browett will come as a relief to many in Apple's stores: staff disliked the measures he tried to put in place (until reversed by Cook) of making them profit-driven \u2013 something that they disliked in a culture which for 10 years had thrived on simply offering good customer service.</p> <p>Cook had to step in earlier this year as dissatisfaction among retail staff grew over Browett's initiatives \u2013 which went against the practices that had been instilled since the first store was opened in 2001. The stores will be managed directly by Cook while the search for a new retail chief goes on.</p> <p>Carolina Milanesi, smartphones analyst for Gartner, said: \"I did question if Browett coming from Dixon was the right pick. Apple needs to learn how to deal with more customers in the stores but the need to retain the high level of care is something that a chain like Dixons does not do very well.</p> <p>\"Having Jonny [Ive] focus on human interface as well as design makes perfect sense to me. Design and user interaction need to be tightly integrated in order to deliver a richer experience. Bringing together the iPhone/iPad software, iOS and Mac OS makes perfect sense too, as devices like iPad, iPhones and Mac need to deliver similar experiences but not force users in behaviours that do not make sense.\"</p> <p>There are two ways to view Monday's events: either Apple is in a downward spiral, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/26/apple-ipad-sales-slow-down\" title=\"\">having disappointed Wall Street last week</a> for the second quarter in a row when it announced revenues and profits that grew less than had been predicted, notably due to a slowdown in iPad sales. Or Cook has decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch, and he is now bringing in a reliable team to focus on the future \u2013 beyond the iPhone and iPad.</p> <p>Forstall is thought to have been blamed for the maps fiasco that followed the launch of the iOS 6 software in September, where Apple's own product replaced Google's. Many customers complained at lack of accuracy in the data, forcing Cook to issue an apology and point users to other services from rivals including Nokia and Microsoft. Forstall was also responsible for the Siri \"voice control\" interface, which has had mixed success.</p> <p>Apple <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/10/29Apple-Announces-Changes-to-Increase-Collaboration-Across-Hardware-Software-Services.html\" title=\"\">said in a press release</a> that the changes would \"encourage even more collaboration between the company's world-class hardware, software and services teams\". The lack of any thanks towards either Forstall or Browett suggests that Cook has acted ruthlessly as the company has seen slackening improvements.</p> <p>The company is notoriously secretive, yet discourages internal politics in favour of working in small teams who focus on solving problems collaboratively. Browett's brief tenure is not the shortest of an incoming Apple executive, but it is embarrassing for someone who had won what had looked like one of the biggest jobs in retail.</p> <p>The changes will see a four-way split in responsibilities. Eddy Cue, who for years built up Apple's presence in the music business as its iPod business grew, and who has been in charge of the iCloud services, will now take over responsibility for the Maps and Siri services.</p> <p>He was praised by Cook for an \"excellent track record\" in \"building and strengthening Apple's online services to meet and exceed the high expectations of our customers\", possibly hinting that Forstall failed in the latter regard.</p> <p>The desktop, smartphone and tablet software will be united under Craig Federighi \u2013 possibly hinting at longer-term integration between the two. And Bob Mansfield, who had been expected to retire earlier this year but was brought back by Cook, will lead a new \"Technologies\" group combining the teams working on wireless technologies with aims at high-level innovation.</p> <p>Forstall was key in the development of the original iPhone software, leading a team which raced against another in-house group to try to produce the prototype code. Forstall's team was trying to \"shrink\" the code used on the Macintosh desktop system; the rival team was trying to \"scale up\" that used on the iPod, then the best-selling Apple product. Forstall's team won and he was seen as a potential heir to Steve Jobs \u2013 although others inside the company accused him of playing company politics.</p> <p>He also worked on the original Mac OS X desktop software, having worked at the NeXT company that Steve Jobs created and which was bought by Apple in 1997 letting Jobs back in, where he led a revival of the business from near-bankruptcy.</p> <p>Cook has shown a ruthless side in firing Browett. It is a move that reflects the way that senior managers at Apple are told they bear ultimate responsibility for what happens in their division.</p>",
  "<p>Outcome-based commissioning has been an important feature of the adult social care landscape for some time. But to what extent are services really being commissioned on the basis of outcomes for the service user?</p> <p>A new LGiU report, supported by social care provider Mears, examines the theory and practice of outcome-based commissioning in domiciliary care services.</p> <p>LGiU research shows that nine out of 10 local government officers and elected members in social care regard commissioning for outcomes, rather than activities, as central to the future of the service. However, true outcome-based commissioning involves paying providers according to the outcomes they deliver for the service user, and progress on this front has been fraught with difficulty. Our initial survey found:</p> <p>\u2022 While most respondents reported the regular use of outcome-based commissioning, just over a third said that it was only used \"to a limited degree\" in their authority.</p> <p>\u2022 Three quarters of respondents said their current systems and processes would be insufficient to manage adult social care provision in future and said they regarded \"a culture of running services on a time-task basis\" as an important barrier to better commissioning.</p> <p>\u2022 However, over 90% still pay providers according to the time they spend with a service user, rather than outcomes.</p> <p>Further research highlighted a range of illuminating case studies. Among them, Wiltshire county council's \"Help to Live at Home\" scheme rewards and penalises providers on the basis of their performance against outcomes; Trafford's Quality Checkers show how successfully service users can be involved in improving service performance; while Essex county council demonstrates a useful model of market management and use of payment by results in reablement.</p> <p>From these case studies we have developed a five-point checklist for raising our game in commissioning.</p> <h2>Are you contracting for outcomes? </h2> <p>Explicitly linking the payment of providers to the outcomes, rather than the outputs that they deliver, is a powerful tool. When providers are paid on an hourly rate, they are offered no incentive to reduce dependency on services or respond flexibly to individual changes in circumstance. Giving them the right target will help to improve the efficiency of the service and result in better outcomes for the individual.</p> <h2>Have you considered the local drivers for need? </h2> <p>Service user need can be manufactured by badly designed services. If we are to deal with the current pressures on adult social care, domiciliary care services should be based on the premise of reducing or stabilising dependence on service provision, wherever possible in line with service users' own expressed preferences.</p> <h2>How well aligned is your commissioning for housing, health and social care commissioning? </h2> <p>Housing, health and social care are the three pillars of independent living. Identifying shared outcomes between these three areas and commissioning together will offer more efficient and integrated services.</p> <h2>Do you empower providers? </h2> <p>The focus on a time-task method of commissioning, along with tight budgetary constraints and several high profile safeguarding scandals, have tended towards a command and control approach to dealing with providers. Commissioning for outcomes puts the onus on the provider to solve the problem, alongside the service user. Market management should be about increasing the range of care products available, rather than simply increasing the volume of providers in the market.</p> <h2>How engaged are elected members? </h2> <p>Councillors have a crucial role to play in connecting council processes to the outcomes they see through their case work in the community.

  "<p>The UK government's transparency<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/15/live-discussion-open-government-partnership\" title=\"\"> commitments</a> and its leadership of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) are commendable. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/17/open-government-data-pdfs?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Steps to improve</a> transparency and public services delivery are always welcome.</p> <p>However, some transparency commitments are more politically difficult than others. And it's the difficult ones that, so far, are still not appearing in the government's agenda for the OGP.</p> <p>Take, for example, transparency around the beneficial ownership of companies. One reason why treasuries around the world are continually deprived of billions in taxes is the rampant hiding of who really benefits from owning companies, particularly holding companies.</p> <p>It's a problem that the inter-governmental <a href=\"http://www.fatf-gafi.org/\" title=\"\">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> has long been trying to solve. The task force recommends that countries should require financial institutions to know the identity of beneficial owners, before or during the course of establishing a business relationship with corporate customers.</p> <p>Country-by-country reporting is another key transparency reform that the government is still not championing. It would require companies engaged in cross-border business \u2013 everything from oil and gas, mining and forestry to banking \u2013 to report their finances separately for each country in which they operate. By knowing more about multinationals' sales, purchasing, hiring and other activities within their borders, governments in poor but resource-rich countries could significantly improve their tax revenues. They could also move out of dependence on aid.</p> <p>The government should also prioritise open contracting. Financial transparency is of limited use if people are unable to assess the deals that governments cut with companies, such as public procurement from G4S and the tenders involving Virgin and FirstGroup. MPs should at least be able to assess the deals their government is cutting with international companies.</p> <p>Transparency reforms such as these are politically difficult, but in the longer term they may unlock the cash needed to improve public services across the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy\" title=\"\">The Tax Justice Network has pointed out that </a> \u00a313trillion-\u00a321trillion in untaxed private wealth is sloshing around the global financial system, hidden in tax havens. The sums are staggering: \u00a320tn deposited in banks earn about 5% interest a year, or \u00a31tn.</p> <p>If governments could tax just this interest income at 25%, it would raise revenues of \u00a3250bn each year \u2013 enough to pay for the millennium development goals, stabilise food prices, create jobs, resolve the global financial crisis \u2013 and so on. <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/february2009/ChristianAid-tax-justice-campaign.aspx\" title=\"\">Christian Aid's own calculations show</a> that developing countries lose about \u00a3100bn a year to tax dodging by multinational corporations alone.</p> <p>The bottom line is that there are vast resources within governments' reach. The means of grasping them are already known \u2013 but politically difficult.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office may very well take the lead in finally pushing through these transparency reforms. It could support the introduction of legislation to require the collection of information on the beneficial ownership of companies, as well as country-by-country reporting in the OGP countries. It could also call on British overseas territories and Crown dependencies to publish their company registers. And it could include language on open contracting in its OGP action plans.</p> <p>It will be a mistake if a major transparency initiative such as the OGP does not address politically difficult transparency commitments, especially since it could obscure the larger picture on the challenges to public services delivery.</p> <p><em>Eric Gutierrez is the senior governance adviser at Christian Aid</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

I said in my last post that OSM data is complimentary to OS data, not a replacement for it and three cases at Surrey Heath are proving this. Our workflow internally now involves digitising new developments into OpenStreetMap, including the roads, building outlines, land parcels and house numbers, as we're doing the street naming work. Using a MapProxy based web service provided by Astun Technology (which caches OSMGB tiles provided by the project at Nottingham) we've been able to plug all this new mapping data back into our intranet mapping system for users consumption along with all our other usual internal vector data.

Those cards might contain local restaurants, the traffic on your commute home, or when your flight is about to take off. They appear automatically as Google tries to guess the information you'll need at any given moment.</p> <p> While it seems like a relatively simple service, it's only really possible because of the massive amount of computational power Google can leverage alongside the massive amount of data Google knows about you thanks to your searches.</p> </blockquote> <p> Which is the tradeoff.

No, it succeeded because it was a better, more usable phone than almost anything else on the market. It just worked. It had voicemails we could see before listening, contacts we could easily edit on the phone, and a Web browser that was better than any mobile browser we'd ever seen before.</p> <p> But the OS is showing its age. Little nuances like the somewhat functional search screen, Favorites in Contacts, and VIPs in Mail show that iOS is under structural pressure to deal with the volume of data it tries to display in a viable way.

One point worth noting is on electoral fraud - made out by some to be a big problem. Trouble is the data don't agree: </p> <blockquote> <p>Of course, where there are 86 convictions (14 per year), there may be many more uncaught crimes. For the sake of argument, let's say that for each conviction there are 100 cases of fraud that go undetected. If that were the case, fraud would amount to about 0.003% of the vote, which would not be enough to affect even the close 2000 presidential election. Fox News looked into the problem and concluded \"One doesn't have to look far to find instances of fraudulent ballots cast in actual elections.\" But readers of that article have commented that Fox did have to look pretty far: all the way back to 1984, when a study found \"thousands\" of fraudulent votes between 1968 and 1982 in state races. Again, this comes out to somewhere in the range of 0.001% of votes. While every fraudulent vote is a felony that should be taken seriously, there is no way this level of activity could affect a national race.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://trollemipsum.appspot.com/\">Having trouble finding the right words? &gt;&gt; Trollem Ipsum</a></h2> <p>Haha. </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/10/22/nokias-price-for-exclusivity/\">Nokia's price for exclusivity &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2> <p>Remember the $1bn Nokia has received from Microsoft for Windows Phone, after killing Symbian? </p> <blockquote> <p>The foregone revenues from Symbian (assuming they had been able to maintain the decline to the level of 150m units that they had originally forecast) would be about $9bn. This means that had Nokia not knifed Symbian and had sold the shortfall units at an average price of $200 they would have received an additional $9bn in sales. Furthermore, assuming a margin of 33% for those units, Nokia received from Microsoft one third from of what she gave up for exclusivity.</p> <p> In other words, the net cost of the Microsoft exclusive relationship is at least $2bn in operating profit.</p> <p> This turns out to be the difference between being profitable and being distressed.</p> </blockquote> <p> Utterly stunning.

  "<p>New York is the city I love best, and I'm trying to imagine it from a distance tonight. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\">lurid, flash-lit instagram images of floating cars in Alphabet City or water pouring out of the East River into Dumbo</a>, the reports of bridges to the Howard Beach submerging and facades falling off apartment houses \u2013 it all stings. It's as horrible in its very different way as watching 9/11.</p> <p>But it's the subways I keep coming back to, trying to see in my mind's eye what must be a dark, scary struggle to keep them from <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/RYuVQVG6mq/\">filling with water</a>. The tide at the Battery has surged feet beyond the old record; water must be pouring into every entrance and vent \u2013 I hope some brave reporter is chronicling this fight, and will someday name its heroes. </p> <p>For me, the subways <em>are</em> New York, or at least they're the most crucial element of that magnificent ecosystem. When I was a young <a href=\"http://www.billmckibben.com/bio.html\">Talk of the Town reporter at the New Yorker</a>, I spent five years exploring the city, always by subway. This was in the 1980s, at the city's nadir \u2013 the graffiti-covered trains would pause for half an hour in mid-flight; the tinny speakers would reduce the explanation of the trouble to gibberish. </p> <p>It was how I traveled, though \u2013 I didn't even know how to hail a cab. For a dollar, you could go anywhere. And my boast was that I'd gotten out at every station in the system for some story or another. It may not have been quite true: the Bronx is a big and forgotten place, and Queens stretches out forever \u2013 but it was my aspiration.</p> <p>The subways were kind of dangerous, but also deeply democratic. Writing about homelessness, I slept with hundreds of other men on the endless A train to the Rockaways. I convinced motormen to let me ride as they turned trains around through the City Hall station abandoned decades earlier. I hung out in the control room under Grand Central with its Hollywood array of levers and lights.</p> <p>Imagining all that filled with cold salt water is too much. </p> <p>I'm an environmentalist: New York is as beautiful and diverse and glorious as an old-growth forest. It's as grand, in its unplanned tumble, as anything ever devised by man or nature. And now, I fear its roots are being severed.</p>",
  "<p>The government's flagship welfare policy could leave working people with less cash and increase the complexity of the benefits system, despite ministers' promises that it would be a simpler alternative with no losers, <a href=\"http://www.cesi.org.uk/node/1226\" title=\"\">a report by an influential charity has said</a>.</p> <p>From next year new claimants will get a single payment instead of a series of different ones. The coalition's big idea is to put out-of-work benefits, tax credits and housing benefit into a single benefit for working-age people called the \"universal credit\".</p> <p>This single credit, the biggest shake-up in benefits for a decade, will consist of a basic personal amount \u2013 with additional elements for disability, caring responsibilities, children and housing costs.</p> <p>But the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says \"while the new system does incentivise more people to take 'mini-jobs' \u2013 those less than 16 hours per week \u2013 it does not encourage the crucial next step into full-time work\". Many families could also lose benefits such as free school meals and free prescriptions as their earnings rise.</p> <p>In its report the foundation says many poor people will be \"left to deal with a more complex benefits system than before\". It warns that a simple shift from fortnightly to monthly payment in arrears has already raised concerns that low-income families will run out of money before the end of each month.</p> <p>\"Recipients may have to borrow money to bridge the gap, leaving them to start their universal credit claim in debt \u2026 it may create an unfair bias against women, with child-related support not necessarily reaching the children it is intended for.\"</p> <p>Chris Goulden, head of poverty at JRF, said: \"It is self-defeating to encourage more people into part-time work, only for them to see their earnings wiped out when they progress into full-time jobs. If universal credit is to be successful in helping people out of poverty, it needs to ensure work is truly worthwhile and does not punish people who try boost their hours and income.\"</p> <p>One the main concerns is that the computer systems needed to link millions of payment records, held by tax officials, with benefits, held by benefits agencies, will be too complicated to work in time. The report says: \"The DWP is confident that the systems will be ready in time for implementation, despite concerns among IT experts that the timetable is unrealistic\".</p> <p>Tony Wilson, policy director at the welfare thinktank Inclusion, added: \"Successive governments have had chequered histories in delivering major benefit reforms. In less than a year, we will start the biggest yet \u2013 affecting more than 10 million families nationwide. This report shows it is not too late to get it right.\"</p> <p>Labour said the government \"must stop pretending there isn't a problem and actually start listening, otherwise universal credit is going to end as a policy that is dead on arrival\".</p> <p>Liam Byrne MP, Labour's work and pensions secretary, said: \"Universal credit is becoming a multiple pile-up of problems to which David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith appear completely incapable of bringing any sense.</p> <p>\"This was supposed to be the silver bullet that was going to end welfare dependency, but now the policy is spinning out of control and world respected organisations like JRF are joining the chorus warning universal credit simply won't be fit for purpose.</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions said 2.8 million people would be better off under the new scheme. \"Universal credit will help millions of people by making them better off in work than on benefits. People will have their level of benefit protected when they move onto universal credit, and the \u00a3300m spent on extra childcare support will allow more families to move into work.</p> <p>\"We know that people on low incomes manage their money well, but we have always said we would be flexible with people who might struggle and will ensure they get the support they need.\"</p>",
  "<p>The European Union imports around 15 times more produce from Israeli settlements in the West Bank than Palestinian products, despite its consistent condemnation of Israel's settlement policy as illegal under international law, according to a report.</p> <p>Based on figures supplied by Israel to the World Bank, the estimated value of settlement imports to the EU is $300m (\u00a3187m) a year. The comparative figure for Palestinian produce is less than $20m. \"With more than 4 million Palestinians and over 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the occupied territory, this means the EU imports over 100 times more per settler than per Palestinian,\" says Trading Away Peace: How Europe Helps Sustain Illegal Israeli Settlements, published by a consortium of 22 organisations across Europe.</p> <p>Imports include agricultural produce, such as dates, grapes, avocados, herbs, and citrus fruit; cosmetics using Dead Sea minerals marketed under the Ahava brand; and SodaStream domestic carbonation devices.</p> <p>Many settlement goods are misleadingly labelled \"Made in Israel\". The report calls on retailers to provide clear and accurate labelling to allow consumers to make informed choices.</p> <p>\"Europe says settlements are illegal under international law and yet continues to trade with them,\" said William Bell of Christian Aid UK and Ireland, one of the consortium partners. \"Consumers are unwittingly contributing to the injustice by buying products that are inaccurately labelled as coming from Israel when in fact they are from settlements in the West Bank.\"</p> <p>Other UK organisations behind the report include the Methodist church, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Quaker Peace and Social Witness, and the Council for Arab-British Understanding.</p> <p>The report draws attention to a \"discriminatory two-tier system\" in the West Bank, under which settler businesses have the advantage of free movement unhindered by checkpoints and the security barrier, and greater access to land and water resources. In the Jordan Valley, where huge Israeli agricultural businesses are geared towards export, the settler population of fewer than 10,000 uses a quarter of the total amount of water consumed by 2.5m Palestinians living in the West Bank, it says.</p> <p>It points out that the EU is the Palestinian Authority's biggest donor, allocating $677m last year. It cites a World Bank estimate that if Israel lifted its restrictions on Palestinian agriculture, the Palestinian economy would no longer need to depend on foreign aid.</p> <p>\"The EU spends hundreds of millions of euros in aid each year to support Palestinian state building but then undermines this assistance by trading with illegal settlements, thus contributing to their viability and expansion,\" said Phyllis Starkey, a trustee for Medical Aid for Palestinians.</p> <p>Settlement growth has accelerated in the past two years, since the end of the temporary construction freeze brokered by the US. According to the report, \"the settler population is growing at a much faster rate (an average of 5.3% annually over the last decade) than the Israeli population as a whole (1.8%)\".</p> <p>It cites the EU's position that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory are \"illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible\". Yet in practice, says the report, the EU is sustaining the settlement project.</p> <p>It recommends that the EU, as a minimum measure, adopts the UK and Danish policy of encouraging correct consumer labelling of settlement produce. In 2009, the UK issued voluntary guidelines advising retailers that produce from the West Bank should be clearly marked \"Israeli settlement produce\" or \"Palestinian produce\". According to the report, \"the guidelines \u2026 appear to be observed by major supermarkets\" and most \"have decided to stop sourcing own-branded food products from the settlements\".</p> <p>The EU should also discourage businesses from economic, commercial and investment links with settlements, the report concludes.</p> <p>It also suggests the EU could, as a more comprehensive measure, ban the import of settlement goods. This, it adds, \"is not a ban or boycott on trade with Israel, which the signatories to this report do not advocate\".</p> <p>It points out that the EU, as Israel's leading trading partner, receives 20% of total Israel exports. Settlement exports represent approximately 2% of total exports.</p> <h2>Imports from Israeli settlements</h2> <p>Agricultural products include dates, grapes, peppers, fresh herbs, cut flowers, avocados, citrus fruits, tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers and potatoes. The main companies exporting fruit and vegetables from West Bank settlements are Mehadrin, Arava Export Growers and Hadiklaim (dates).</p> <p>Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories, which manufactures and markets beauty products based on Dead Sea minerals and mud, is located within the Israeli settlement of Mitzpe Shalem in the West Bank. Its products, which are exported to about 20 European countries, are labelled \"Made in Israel\".</p> <p>SodaStream home carbonation devices are mainly manufactured in the industrial zone of Mishor Adumim, part of Maale Adumim, one of the biggest settlements across the green line. Sixty eight per cent of sales are in Europe.</p> <p>Keter Plastic manufactures garden furniture, storage and other household products. It has two factories based in an Israeli settlement.</p>"
