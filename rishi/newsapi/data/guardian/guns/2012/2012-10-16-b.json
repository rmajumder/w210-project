  "<p>Ministers have been urged to take quick decisions to toughen up lobbying rules in the wake of the so-called jobs for generals scandal, with Labour demanding fines for defence companies and lengthy bans for military personnel who flout them.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence is considering new measures that would prevent serving officers and civil servants being compromised by formal and informal meetings with lobbyists. Labour said the government must enshrine this in a new code of conduct.</p> <p>Bernard Jenkin, the Tory chair of the public administration select committee, has written to Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, urging him to accept proposals to establish in law a conflicts of interest commissioner. Jenkin said he had warned ministers that scandals were inevitable, and demanded a change in government policy.</p> <p>The furore began at the weekend when six senior former members of the armed forces were <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/insight/article1147765.ece\" title=\"\">caught in a sting</a> by the Sunday Times. Reporters posed as representatives of a South Korean defence firm seeking help to lobby the MoD. Two of those who offered to help, Admiral Sir Trevor Soar and Lieutenant General Richard Applegate, appeared to be doing so in breach of rules set out by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba).</p> <p>The rules state that former officers should respect a two-year purdah between leaving office and starting to work as lobbyists. Two others duped by the newspaper, Lord Dannatt, the former head of the army, and Lord Stirrup, the former chief of the defence staff, will be investigated by the House of Lords independent commissioner of standards. All six of the officers secretly filmed by the Sunday Times have denied any impropriety.</p> <p>On Monday Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/royal-british-legion-president-quits\" title=\"\">resigned as president of the Royal British Legion</a>, after he described the remembrance festival as a tremendous networking opportunity.</p> <p>The revelations threw a spotlight on Acoba, an independent body that can give advice but has no powers to punish former officers, ministers or civil servants if they decide to ignore it.</p> <p>This has prompted Labour to draft its own code of conduct and urge the government to adopt its key principles. They include banning personnel from public appointments if they ignore Acoba's advice, extending the period of purdah to up to five years in certain cases, and fining defence companies that employ lobbyists who break the rules.</p> <p>Defence companies could have contracts cancelled or reviewed if they are caught defying Acoba. The MoD would be required to publish a list of all personnel who have left service and would need to abide by Acoba rules, so that nobody could be in any doubt about who can and cannot work as lobbyists.</p> <p>Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said: \"The government should consider a tough new code of conduct for the defence industry and lobbyists. There must be sanctions for wrongdoers and deterrents for others. Advocacy is important but it must be totally transparent, which is why we are arguing that companies must disclose their lobbyists and military figures must be open about their meetings. Important rules are in place, but they must be enforceable and strengthened.\"</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said it was still considering the proposals from the select committee, which were published in July.</p> <p>In his letter to Maude, Jenkins said the recent coverage had been \"deeply corrosive to public trust in politics and the public service. It is exactly the kind of scenario that our rep warned against, and it demands a change of government policy.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This case reinforces the need for a statutory conflicts of interest commissioner, backed by statutory rules, which will establish a culture in which people respect both the rules and also respect the spirit which should underlie the rules.\"</p> <p>An MoD spokesperson said: \"As the defence secretary made clear on Sunday, equipment is procured in the interests of our armed forces and not in the interests of retired senior personnel. The defence secretary and the MoD's permanent secretary have been discussing the issues raised on Sunday and want the department to be as open as possible to ensure access is not abused for commercial purposes. Defence ministers, the permanent secretary and the chief of defence material already all publish their external meetings quarterly and the MoD is looking at what further measures can be taken.\"</p>",

There was more drama in the ninth inning than there was for the first eight innings combined, but the Detroit Tigers managed to hang on to a 2-1 lead, thanks mostly to a strong eight plus inning from Justin Verlander. The Detroit Tigers now have a commanding 3-0 ALCS lead over the New York Yankees.</p> <p>It feels like all signs point to the New York Yankees getting swept tomorrow for the ALCS Game 4, but they will have C.C. Sabbathia going for them, second only to Justin Verlander in guys you want on the mound in an potential elimination game. We'll be liveblogging that game here at 8:00pm EST, not to mention Game 3 of the NLCS between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at 4:00pm EST. Hope you'll be there. That will be all from us tonight, however, so thanks to everyone who followed along with us and especially those who chose to contribute.

This is starting to bring up bad memories of the 9th inning of ALCS Game 1.</p> <p>Raul Ibanez is up in the ninth inning with a chance to tie or win the game. This is a frightening situation for Detroit considering recent events. The first pitch? Just outside, ball one.</p> <p>Think these hitters are glad to not be facing Verlander anymore? Nick Swisher is on-deck, he will pinch-hit for Russell Martin if it gets to that. Ibanez takes ball two. I wouldn't give him anything to drive either, Mr. Coke. Ibanez takes a mighty hack at 2-0, everybody knows what he wants to do. 2-1. Coke throws him a fastball out of the zone to see if Ibanez will chase, but it's too far outside. 3-1. Hitter's count on the 9th Inning Home Run Specialist.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls it off. 3-2. The Yankees are down to their last strike for their third straight batter. If they had put together at-bats like this for most of the series they would be the ones about to take a 3-0 series lead.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls off another one. Still 3-2. He swings and misses at a breaking ball and it's all over! The Tigers have won!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e26a6c0e361310bc6d07e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:31:50.942Z\">4.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jayson Nix is in to run for Teixeira, representing the tying run. Robinson Cano is in to face Phil Coke. Cano takes the first pitch for ball one. Cano just doesn't want to make the last out of the game here, forget ending any hitless streak.</p> <p>Cano takes the next pitch for a ball. Raul Ibanez is on deck, remember. The Tigers do NOT want to see him. Coke throws Cano a strike. 2-1. Cano fouls the next one to play, the rain is falling and the Yankees are again down to their finally strike. Holy crap is it LOOOOOOUD in Comerica.</p> <p>Coke gets the sign. 2-2, Cano slaps in a base hit to end a 0-29 hitless streak. There are runners on first and second for the Yankees! We have... DRAMA!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e25c5c0e361310bc6d07d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:28:05.844Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mark Teixeira is out next. He's still representing the tying run remember. Coke starts him off with a strike as well. Teixeira takes the next pitch for a ball, and then fouls one off to fall behind 1-2. The Tigers are just a strike away, and, thankfully, are not facing the St. Louis Cardinals in this situation.</p> <p>Teixeira takes the next pitch. It's a ball. 2-2. The crowd is LOUD. The set and the pitch... and it's just outside. 3-2. The crowd is loud AND mad now. Full count, the struggling Cano on deck. Teixeira hits the next one foul. Pitcher and hitter do this again. Coke takes a sign form Avila.</p> <p>Teixeira hits a base hit to keep the Yankees alive!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e24ed58f91d7bbadac75e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:24:29.290Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ichiro takes a strike. 0-1.

He's here to face Ichiro.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e2432c0e361310bc6d07b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:21:23.122Z\">4.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Leyland comes out to talk with Verlander and he... leaves him in?</p> <p>Did I mention that it's the ninth anniversary of the game where Grady Little left Pedro Martinez in to face the Yankees in the ALCS? I'm just going to bring up that factoid.</p> <p>The first pitch to Brett Gardner? A strike. The crowd, buoyed by Leyland's decision, cheers this one loudly. Gardner takes a ball, 1-1, and then fouls one off, 1-2. </p> <p>Gardner is following Nunez's lead, fouling off pitches and either waiting for a mistake or trying to get him out of this game. Gardner takes the next pitch. 2-2. Verlander's at 129. Nobody is out, nobody is on. Gardner fouls off yet another pitch. He's still throwing gas at 98 mph. Gardner hits another one foul. Gardner might be ending Verlander's complete game chances in this at-bat.</p> <p>Gardner finally hits a grounder back to Verlander, who finishes the play, and that will be it for Verlander who receives the loudest ovation of the night. What a job from Verlander. I say that every start it seems, but it's true.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e232058f91d7bbadac75a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:16:49.126Z\">4.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>HOME RUN!</strong> Eduardo Nunez is out, and he falls behind 0-2 before I can even figure out who is hitting. The crowd is noisy-as-heck, like exactly how loud New Yankee Stadium wasn't (except for the booing). Verlander's 0-2 pitch is in the dirt. 1-2. Nunez laces the next one foul into the seats, oof hope that didn't hit anybody.</p> <p>Still a 1-2 count, Nunez fouls off another one. Just keep making him throw pitches, he's at 120. Leyland can't let him pitch into infinity. Nunez hits another screaming liner that just goes foul. Verladner throws another ball, I wonder if those line drives are a sign that he's fading a bit here. Nunez swings at 2-2, fouling off another one, a 99 mph fastball. Just a great, great at-bat from Nunez here. The Yankees want to see the bullpen right here.</p> <p>Nunez hammers a hanging breaking ball that Dirks can't catch it The crowd is stunned!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e21ebc0e361310bc6d078\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:11:40.115Z\">4.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 0 - Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bad news for the Yankees?

Why? I have no clue. We are on full midges alert here in Michigan. Omar Infante hits a flyball off him, but like most flyballs this evening that one's not going out. It's just an out.</p> <p>Leyland has his bullpen up just in case, I imagine he doesn't want to wait too long for going to it after the decision not to bring in Octavio Dotel in Game 1.

Gardner then makes another catch on an Avila liner and that will do it for Logan.

I\"m going Yankees 4 - Tigers 3, with most of the damage coming against Detroit's bullpen in the eighth and ninth. Of course if Verlander's still pitching the eighth and ninth innings, well New York's done.</p> <p>What are your thoughts?

The New York Yankees enter tonight's Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park in a tough spot. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-derek-jeter\">The New York Yankees have already dropped the first two games of the series</a> and now go on the road to face Justin Verlander, arguably the best pitcher in the game.</p> <p>The Yankees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-1-live\">lost their first game against the Tigers </a>despite tying it up in the ninth inning off of now-reassigned Detroit closer Jose Valverde. In the loss, first ballot Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter suffered a season-ending injury, leaving the team without a captain and a flailing New York offense without one of its key contributors. His loss felt even more devastating than the Yankees dropping the series opener. The next game, thanks to a non-existent offense and one <a href=\"http://mlb.si.com/2012/10/14/joe-girardi-yankees-instant-replay-game-2-alcs/\">particularly bad blown call</a>, t<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-2-live\">he Yankees lost 3-0</a>, blowing an outstanding outing by starter Hiroki Kuroda pitching on three day's rest for the first time in his U.S. career.</p> <p>The Yankees offense, so potent in the regular season, has sputtered so badly in the postseason that the focus isn't on how the Tigers have been managing to keep New York at bay. The turning point came in the extra innings of Game 1 after Valverde blew a 4 run lead in the most horrifically comic way possible. Detroit could have collapsed then and there, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-5-live\">the Washington Nationals coming unglued in NLDS Game 5</a> against the St. Louis Cardinals comes to mind, but they held on. In Game 2, even when Kuroda was holding them off the basepaths, Detroit's hitters never seemed to worry. The Detroit Tigers are playing with a lot of confidence and tonight they have Justin Verlander, who is good for a complete game shutout every time he's on the mound, while the Yankees have to rely on the still inconsistent Phil Hughes.</p> <p>As far as New York fans go, they won't have Alex Rodriguez or Nick Swisher to kick around anymore, at least not to start the game. The third baseman and the outfielder (if you want to be generous here) are out of Girardi's starting lineup against Verlander. It's a move that would seem absolutely absurd at the start of the MLB Playoffs but now is almost unsurprising. At the very least, with A-Rod and Swisher out this is the most likable Yankees lineup they've put out in eons. (And at least Nick Swisher <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5951809/yankee-fans-are-really-harshing-nick-swishers-buzz-bro\">won't get his feelings hurt </a>today.)</p> <p>Is this a Yankees lineup that is good enough to defeat the Tigers on the road, against the best pitcher alive, and avoid falling into a 0-3 hole in the ALCS?

  "<p>The private sector should be asked to take over the running of chronically failing academies, James O'Shaughnessy, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thinktankcentral/2012/01/camerons-former-head-of-policy-james-oshaughnessy-joins-policy_exchange-to-work-develop-school-feder.html\" title=\"\">the former director of policy at No 10</a>, proposes in his first piece of major research since quitting Downing Street.</p> <p>Michael Gove's centralised system for overseeing 18,000 semi-independent schools, including failing schools, is \"simply not viable\", he writes.</p> <p>The government's plans to allow the 25-strong <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/schoolperformance/schools%20commissioner/a0077832/role-of-the-office-of-the-schools-commissioner-osc\" title=\"\">Office of the Schools Commissioner</a> to broker school improvement are \"entirely unrealistic given the huge number of schools that the new Ofsted inspection regime are going to classify as failing\", he says in a new pamphlet published by the <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>.</p> <p>He also reveals that academy leaders have revealed \"a shocking level of disillusionment\" with the quality of governing bodies, and proposes that governors in some areas should be paid.</p> <p>O'Shaughnessy warns Gove to shake up the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Education</a> so that a majority of its 2,000 staff are dedicated to the success of the academy programme. A further \u00a3450m should be set aside over the next three years to help sponsors take over failing schools, he said.</p> <p>His proposals, including strengthening academy chains as a way of boosting the performance of coasting schools, are certain to be closely examined both by the education secretary, Michael Gove, and the schools minister, David Laws. Both men are eager to find ways to increase the accountability of failing schools, whether or not they are academies. The coalition faces increasing criticism that the huge expansion of academies, freed from local authority control, is leading to growing centralisation of education.</p> <p>O'Shaughnessy's proposal to introduce profit-making academy chains is bound to be controversial as Gove, until recently, has opposed any question of profit making in schools. O'Shaughnessy writes: \"It is absurd, as well as counter-productive, to prevent for purely ideological reasons successful school improvement businesses from turning around these schools which have proved resistant to other interventions.\"</p> <p>His plan, if picked up by the coalition, might give political space to Labour as it would take Gove beyond following a broadly Blairite approach to improving schools. O'Shaughnessy argues that Labour's academy programme was aimed at the 5% of failed schools, but \"the new task is to cope with a much bigger and more publicly contested seam of chronic failure in which mediocrity is the norm\". He argues \"a structure that worked well for a few hundred schools cannot cope with the demands of improving the performance of several thousand\".</p> <p>Cameron's former policy chief suggests that 40% of schools \"are providing an unacceptably mediocre education\". He sets out a new framework whereby, if a failing school that has been turned into an academy has still not improved, it would then be required to join a chain of academies. If joining the chain does not lead to the necessary improvement, the private sector, both for profit and not for profit, should be brought in to run schools on performance-based contracts.</p> <p>O'Shaughnessy's plan for education is likely to be seen as more than a piece of radical kite flying, partly because of his past proximity to David Cameron, but also because Gove himself is becoming more open to the idea of profit-making chains operating in the UK \u2013 as they do in the US and Sweden.</p> <p>O'Shaughnessy insists that international studies show chains of schools \u2013 with as many as 20 schools in a chain \u2013 are the best way to raise standards and spread good practice. To encourage such chains, he proposes the Department for Education creates a new fund to help it set up a new collaborative schools network. He also recommends:</p> <p>\u2022 Allowing academies to jettison existing governing bodies and form smaller paid bodies that mirror the boards of private companies.</p> <p>\u2022 The Office of the Schools Commissioner should be given greatly enhanced powers, including oversight of every aspect of the academy programme.</p> <p>\u2022 New local commissioners should be set up to apply a failure regime for all weak schools that are not in chains of three or more schools.</p> <p>But in his most controversial proposal he suggests the private sector is given a foot in the door by allowing profit-making \"education management organisations\" to run the worst schools.</p> <p>He writes: \"Any ethical and political objections to the private sector attempting to succeed where the state and voluntary sectors have failed should be dismissed for what they are \u2013 ideological prejudice.\"</p> <p>O'Shaughnessy adds: \"There is no reason whatsoever in my view for local politicians to have anything to do with what goes on in schools. Indeed, all the evidence of history suggests that politicians of any sort should be kept out of well-run, effective schools.\"</p>",

The first instalment, Wolf Hall, won three years ago.</p> <p>The chairman of the Booker judges, Sir Peter Stothard, called Mantel \"the greatest modern English prose writer\" working today, and said she had \"rewritten the book on writing historical fiction\".</p> <p>\"We are very proud to be reading English at the time she is writing. I don't think I've read any English novelist in recent years who has such complete control over the way she uses prose to do what she wants to do, like a singer or a pianist,\" Stothard said.</p> <p>Mantel, 60, joins the Australian Peter Carey and the South African JM Coetzee as a double Booker winner. She triumphed from a shortlist that was striking in its contrast to last year, when judges emphasised readability. This year it was about the power of prose and re-readability.</p> <p>\"There is no point in having a text for this prize that is dead as soon as it is read,\" Stothard said. \"There are many perfectly good books for which that is true \u2013 they are a good read, but you wouldn't want to read them again. This prize is for books that will be read in decades to come and each time you read them they reveal something different.\"</p> <p>The 2012 shortlist included challenging books, not least the hotly tipped Umbrella, by Will Self, written in a high modernist stream of consciousness with barely a paragraph break, let alone chapters. The others were The Garden of Evening Mists, the second novel from the Malaysian writer Tan Twan Eng; Deborah Levy's Swimming Home; and two first novels \u2013 Alison Moore's The Lighthouse and Jeet Thayil's Narcopolis.</p> <p>Mantel, who has embarked on writing the third instalment, said the award was a \"vote of confidence\" and \"act of faith\". But is it not also enormous pressure? She told journalists: \"When I start writing it I'll forget all of this because every day has its new problems \u2026 it's you struggling with your subject matter and a blank screen.\"</p> <p>She said Bring Up the Bodies was \"a more fully achieved book than Wolf Hall. Formally, it probably has the edge.\"</p> <p>Three years ago, she said she would be spending the prize money on \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". On Tuesday night, she said it would be spent on rehab, before adding a more pragmatic answer \u2013 \"my pension, probably\".</p> <p>The judges' decision, reached in two hours and 16 minutes, came after \"a rigorous process of literary criticism\", said Stothard, who edits the Times Literary Supplement. There was no vote, which he said would have been an act of desperation.</p> <p>\"We didn't allow anybody to say 'I like this', 'I really enjoyed it', 'this is the one for me'. By the very nature of that, each book was analysed and argued over and the ones for which arguments were weaker than others fell away.\"</p> <p>Stothard said he thought Bring Up the Bodies \"utterly surpassed\" the achievement of Wolf Hall, although he stressed the judges did not discuss that first novel. \"It is an extraordinary book in its own right but it is tighter. I think she has learned lessons from Wolf Hall in the way that the prose is written.\"</p> <p>Bring Up the Bodies is more condensed than Wolf Hall in that it charts the nine months of events in 1535 that lead to the execution of Anne Boleyn. It is one of the greatest, best-known stories in English history, yet Mantel \"is able to bring it to life as though for the first time\", Stothard said.</p> <p>\"It is a bloody story, but Hilary Mantel is a writer who thinks through the blood and uses her art and power of prose to create moral ambiguities and the real uncertainty of political life then and a pale imitation of a political life now.\"</p> <p>Stothard said he saw \"as much Don Corleone in this book as DH Lawrence\", in that the moral ambiguities of Cromwell that Mantel explores could be from The Godfather, and the \"description of the English landscape and the characters in this book could be out of The Rainbow\".</p> <p>Wolf Hall became a huge bestseller, a prospect that now awaits Bring Up the Bodies. Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles bookshops, said: \"This rare double Man Booker win confirms her output as essential reading Mantel has been writing superb fiction for much longer than she has been winning major awards, so many readers will soon discover that she is their new favourite author. There's every possibility she might pull off a unique treble when she completes the trilogy.\"</p> <p>The third book is to be called The Mirror and the Light, and the works will get a wider audience as the BBC has bought the rights. A six-hour adaptation of the first two books, by Peter Straughan, is planned for late 2013.</p> <p>The \u00a350,000 prize was handed out at London's Guildhall after a judging panel consisting of the Downton actor Dan Stevens, the academic and critic Dinah Birch, the historian Amanda Foreman and the academic and writer Bharat Tandon debated who should win on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>It was not a unanimous decision in the sense that everyone would have picked it if put to a vote, but Stothard said: \"There was absolute consensus that the most powerful arguments were those deployed for Bring Up the Bodies.\"</p>",
  "<p>Olivier Giroud scored a dramatic late equaliser to hand France a vital advantage in the race to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. Spain, who had won 24 consecutive qualifying games before Tuesday night, will travel to the Stade de France in March 2013 knowing that they may have to win if they are to qualify from the top of Group I. If not, a play-off awaits. When Giroud headed in, the Vicente Calder\u00f3n had long been nervous, the whistles ringing out as the fans implored the German referee to bring this game to a close. As the ball hit the net, the clock showed 93 minutes; there was barely time for Spain to take the kick-off.</p> <p>Spain had been so close to taking a huge step towards qualification but it was France who finished the more satisfied and few could doubt that they deserved it. \"It would have been unfair if we had lost this game,\" Didier Deschamps, the France coach, said.</p> <p>Spain, who had led through Sergio Ramos and had a Cesc F\u00e1bregas penalty saved, began losing control of the game. A mistake from Juanfran was seized upon in the dying seconds by Moussa Sissoko and Franck Rib\u00e9ry. Rib\u00e9ry's clipped cross found Giroud, who became the first player in seven competitive games to score against Iker Casillas. The Arsenal striker had been on the pitch only for a matter of minutes after replacing the injured Karim Benzema. Benzema had appeared to take France's chance with him. Not so.</p> <p>Although Georgia, Finland and Belarus make up Group I, first place was always likely to be between Spain and France and only first place guarantees qualification for Brazil 2014. These two teams have seven points each. It is likely to be all about Paris in the spring. The Spain coach, Vicente del Bosque, had described this game as like the first leg of a cup tie. A 1-1 home draw is rarely a good result.</p> <p>Spain had taken the lead after 25 minutes. A simple corner from the right taken by Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez found Sergio Ramos unmarked seven yards out and he leapt, unobstructed, to head against a post. As he stood, head in hands, lamenting the one that got away, it came back again. Pedro was quickly on to the rebound and he turned the ball back into the six-yard box. Hugo Lloris dived to cut it out but could push it only into the path of Sergio Ramos, who smashed it high into the net and somersaulted in celebration.</p> <p>Spain had dominated possession until that point but had created few clear chances. And then, with the most basic of boots up the pitch, France almost had the equaliser when Rib\u00e9ry played in Benzema and his shot was pushed wide by Casillas.</p> <p>Deschamps' side thought they had the equaliser soon after when J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez had the ball in the net, only for the referee, Felix Brych, to rule it out. M\u00e9nez had failed to reach a curling free-kick from the right but Benzema, at the far post, did and his header went back across the face of goal for M\u00e9nez to nod in at the near post. The linesman's flag was raised swiftly. Replays suggested that it should not have been \u2013 Sergio Ramos's lunge looked to have played M\u00e9nez onside.</p> <p>Spain failed to double their lead two minutes later when Laurent Koscielny scythed down Pedro. F\u00e1bregas struck the penalty hard but he also struck it within reaching distance of Lloris.</p> <p>The Spurs goalkeeper then made a double save on the stroke of half-time, first denying Pedro after Xavi's delightful flicked pass and then reacting quickly to push away F\u00e1bregas's follow up.</p> <p>Those final minutes set the tone for an open, exciting second half. France took the game to Spain. The game got stretched. A huge gap appeared in the middle of midfield \u2026 a consequence perhaps of Sergio Busquets not patrolling his usual territory having been pressed into service as a centre-back instead. To his right, Alvaro Arbeloa went off injured and, as if smelling blood, Rib\u00e9ry ran at his replacement Juanfran time and again.</p> <p>Chances came and went and, although not all of them were clear opportunities, the sense of danger was heightened at both ends. Rib\u00e9ry hit the side-netting. He slotted one lovely pass to Benzema who had strayed fractionally offside and hit another one across the face of the goal that the striker could not quite reach. Yohan Cabaye's shot was blocked by Pedro and M\u00e9nez just failed to reach Benzema's ball.</p> <p>Spain had their moments too: Sergio Ramos headed over and F\u00e1bregas had a shot blocked. The game had a very different feel now. France were threatening with the introduction of Mathieu Valbuena giving them more edge. Sissoko volleyed over, then scuffed a shot. A moment later the ball dropped fractionally behind Giroud. Spain, it seemed, had survived. But in the last minute, when Rib\u00e9ry advanced on the left on the umpteenth occasion, this time the ball dropped right on Giroud's head.</p>",
  "<p>The newly adopted players' code of conduct places special emphasis on the \"privileged position\" of the office of national captain and formally grants the Club England board power of veto to strip any individual of the honour.</p> <p>The Football Association's 16-page A5 booklet, six pages of which deal specifically with the code, was drawn up over a 10-month period and has been presented to the senior England squad.</p> <p>The wide-reaching document lists 33 dos and don'ts for players whether they are on international duty or not, \"covering everything from interaction on social media, reminders upon issues such as drug use and discrimination, to recommendations not to spend too much time playing video games in the team hotel\", with a page dedicated specifically to the national captaincy.</p> <p>\"The position of England captain is a privileged position which carries with it additional expectations and responsibilities (both on and off the field),\" it reads. \"The captain of each team is therefore under increased scrutiny and is expected to be a role model to the rest of the squad in his/her compliance of the code. The captaincy may be removed from a player by the Club England Management Board in the event his/her conduct does not meet the standards required for this role.\"</p> <p>That scenario was effectively played out in February when John Terry was sacked ahead of a court appearance in the summer to answer charges of a racially aggravated public order offence, the dismissal prompting Fabio Capello's resignation in protest. Terry was cleared at Westminster magistrates court, though he was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and faces a four-match ban and \u00a3220,000 fine.</p> <p>The new code of conduct serves as formal clarification that Club England's powers supersede those of the national manager on the issue. The code, as confirmed by Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney over the past week, is a statement of common sense principles and essentially serves as a reminder of responsibilities.</p> <p>On the inside front cover is a note written in white lettering on a red background: \"Players representing England are ambassadors for their country and role models for younger players. The highest standards of conduct and behaviour are therefore expected at all times, including when players are not on international duty.\"</p> <p>There are details of standards expected of players at all time, with warnings against violence, abuse or discrimination, the use of drugs without a doctor's permission, or comments on Twitter or Facebook about the opposition, management or other individuals that might lead to disciplinary action.</p> <p>That issue was recently highlighted when Ashley Cole recently described the FA as a \"bunch of twats\", with the Chelsea full-back currently awaiting details of his punishment.</p> <p>There are reminders to be respectful on international duty to everyone from hotel staff to drug-testing officers and opponents, and a section entitled \"professionalism\" summarising what is expected of players while with England.</p> <p>That includes warnings that the squad should not use room service at the team hotel, that the drinking of alcohol, and use of mobile telephones at meal times, in the dressing room or team bus, is at the head coach's discretion, and that players should \"only use a sensible amount of time playing video or computer games\". There should be no comments on Twitter or Facebook on the eve or day of a game \"unless authorised\" by the FA's media department, and reminders that texts and picture messages \"can become public\".</p> <p>Details are also outlined of the disciplinary procedure if offences are committed, with the Club England board \u2013 comprising the FA chairman, David Bernstein, the general secretary, Alex Horne, the Club England managing director, Adrian Bevington, and the director of football development, Sir Trevor Brooking \u2013 overseeing any investigation.</p> <p>A range of sanctions are available, from oral or written warnings to exclusion from selection for \"a fixed or indefinite period\", with Club England maintaining the right to suspend players at its discretion pending the conclusion of any outside investigation, such as a criminal proceedings.</p> <p>Incidents will be treated on a case by case basis, with a list of examples of serious misconduct \u2013 from theft and dishonesty, to assault, deliberate damage to FA property, being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs and any form of discrimination \u2013 included in the booklet.</p> <p>There is no right to appeal given that representing England is considered an honour rather than a contractual employer-employee arrangement. The section ends with a warning, written in bold: \"Players are to advise either their national team coach, team administrator or a Club England official when they are guilty or have been accused of any criminal offence.\"</p> <p>The document will be given to all 24 England representative teams, with Ray Clemence having delivered a presentation to the Under-17s on Tuesday.

  "<p>A few months after the UK supinely followed the US into the Iraq disaster, Hugh Grant brought a needed smile to a dispirited nation by playing a prime minister who stood up to a bullying American president. The joy in Britain's cinemas was palpable when the PM in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/quotes\" title=\"\">Love Actually</a> publicly stated that the old myth of a special relationship had covered \"all manner of sins\". Although there are as yet no plans for Theresa May: The Movie, the home secretary on Tuesday whipped up a remarkably similar atmosphere in the Commons. By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-extradition-decision-live\" title=\"\">refusing to put the computer hacker Gary McKinnon</a> on to a plane to face a trial the Americans are desperate to stage, she won cheers all round in the house, and warm words from Tory backwoodsmen and Dennis Skinner alike.</p> <p>There is no doubt it is gratifying to see the British authorities stand up to American might for once, and anyone of humanitarian sensibilities who is familiar with the harsh culture of \"corrections\" across the Atlantic will feel relief at a vulnerable individual's escape. But campaigners pronouncing a \"landmark\" decision are wrong to imagine that this will entrench a new compassion at Britain's borders, still less reset UK/US relations. Indeed, if you factor in this government's wider agenda, the McKinnon saga turns from feelgood flick into mystery story.</p> <p>In almost the same breath that the home secretary made her decision, she announced that she was to abandon her power to make any similar decision again. In future it will be for a judge, and not the home secretary, to decide whether an extradition risks \"inhuman or degrading treatment\", and thereby breaches article 3 of the European convention, the technical criterion on which Tuesday's decision turned. Over many years, the executive has ceded powers over pardoning, sentencing, and more, to the judiciary on the principle \u2013 supported by this newspaper \u2013 that the courtroom is better placed than Whitehall to step back from the fray, and respond to the contours of the individual case. But in this particular case it is important to note that judicial authority might have been the opposite of helpful to Mr McKinnon. After all, in 2009, <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/2021.html\" title=\"\">Lord Justice Burnton</a> considered expert evidence on his Asperger's syndrome, and ruled that his vulnerability and potentially developing depression did \"not approach\" the traditionally stiff requirements for a breach of article 3.</p> <p>As well as ceding the chance to make another such decision, the home secretary has set herself against the basis for her own reasoning. Only this month, she stood before her party and proclaimed \"we should scrap the Human Rights Act altogether\", the very piece of legislation which wrote article 3 on to the statute book and made Mrs May's decision possible. The Home Office has argued, often successfully, for the deportation of sick people back to places where they will be denied life-saving drugs for conditions like HIV; Mrs May has personally fought tooth and nail against every attempt to secure an expansive interpretation of article 3 from others facing extradition. These include <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/abu-hamza-summary-05102012.pdf\" title=\"\">Babar Ahmad and Talha Ahsan,</a> who were recently put on the plane to face American justice for computer-related offences, even though the latter also has Asperger's. There are, of course, differences between these cases and that of Mr McKinnon. They stand accused of involvement with terror networks, different to the more freewheeling threat to security that Mr McKinnon's hacking may have posed.</p> <p>But being accused is not the same as being guilty, as Mrs May should know. By lacing her words with a jibe about withholding legal aid from terror suspects, she conflated the two \u2013 and also drew attention to another distinction between Mr McKinnon and the Muslims. Mr McKinnon, with his wonderful campaigning mother and media support, is popular, while Islamists are reliably the opposite. The success of his campaign to stay in Britain is cause to celebrate, but Mrs May's pick 'n' mix approach is dismaying. Rights are for everyone, or they are not rights at all.</p>",
  "<p>The death toll from the meningitis outbreak linked to a contaminated steroid drug rose to 16 on Tuesday night as a leading medical expert said the infections were \"nowhere near the end\". </p> <p>William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he expects a \"steady increase\" in the number of fungal meningitis infections over the coming weeks. </p> <p>His warning came as the Virginia health department confirmed that a second person had died in the state, just hours after the Centers for Disease Control said the number of cases had increased by 19 to 231. It also reported two cases of peripheral joint infections.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday federal agents raided the New England Compounding Center, the pharmacy linked to the outbreak. US Attorney Carmen Ortiz, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts said agents from the Food and Drug Administration searched the NECC facility in Framingham.</p> <p>Schaffner described the escalating FDA investigation into further NECC products as \"ominous\" and said they would have to warn more patients.</p> <p>\"We were concerned that there might be other medications that might be contaminated coming from that pharmacy,\" said Schaffner, a past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Disease. \"The FDA has given us a heads up that that looks to be the case. We'll have to notify many more patients across the country that they may have been exposed to a fungal infection.\"</p> <p>On Monday, after reporting unconfirmed infections from two more drugs made by the NECC, the FDA told medical personnel to contact all patients injected with any drug from the pharmacy, in particular heart transplant and opthalmic patients, as a precautionary measure, to alert them of the risk of infection.</p> <p>The advice has confused some clinicians who accused the FDA of sending mixed messages which may panic patients.</p> <p>During a conference call with clinicians and journalists on Tuesday, Dr Janet Woodcock of the FDA stressed that no other NECC products have been confirmed as being linked to the outbreak, but they were investigating such products following at least one infection in a heart transplant patient. </p> <p>\"None of the infections have been confirmed\" said Woodcock. \"No other products have been linked to documented infections.\"</p> <p>Asked if they were in danger of issuing mixed messages in danger of scaring patients, Woodcock said: \"I don't think we are asking you to tell them they should be concerned, we are asking you to reach out to them make sure they are healthy and they are no signs of infections.\"</p> <p>The infections in patients that have been linked to two new drugs made by NECC, particularly that of a heart transplant patent, who are susceptible to infections, could have arisen from another source, officials said.</p> <p>Already, 14,000 patients at risk from contracting the disease after having been injected with a potentially contaminated steroid, methylprednisolone, are on the lookout for symptoms of meningitis.</p> <p>Asked about the spread of the outbreak, Schaffner said: \"I think we're still in the middle. We're nowhere near the end of this problem. And we will see more patients reporting in ill and we'll have to treat many more going forward.\"</p> <p>Hospitals, clinics and physicians have already been warned not to use any product made by NECC, as well as to contact patients who may have had an injection of the steroid associated with the 15 deaths.</p> <p>So far, those infected with meningitis have received a spinal injection of the steroid as a treatment for back pain.</p> <p>On Monday, the agency said it had reports of three patients, including two transplant patients, with possible meningitis who received an injection of another steroid made by NECC.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the FDA <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm322734.htm\">issued a revised statement</a> on its website saying that it was one transplant patient. The patient, who had received a heart drug known as cardioplegia solution made by NECC, had Aspergillus infection but the FDA said there may be another explanation for the infection.The investigation was ongoing, it said.</p> <p>The second patient identified by the FDA as potentially having meningitis received an injection of the steroid triamcinolone, also supplied by NECC.</p> <p>It cautioned that any injectable drugs made by NECC, including those intended for use in eyes, are of \"significant concern\".</p> <p>The statement on the FDA website said:</p> <blockquote> <p>At this point in FDA's investigation, the sterility of any injectable drugs, including ophthalmic drugs that are injectable or used in conjunction with eye surgery, and cardioplegic solutions produced by NECC are of significant concern, and out of an abundance of caution, patients who received these products should be alerted to the potential risk of infection.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>It also advised physicians and medical personnel to \"follow-up with patients for whom you administered an injectable product, including an ophthalmic drug that is injectable or used in conjunction with eye surgery, or a cardioplegic solution purchased from or produced by NECC after May 21, 2012.\"</p> <p>The FDA said they were still investigating the two infections found in patients who had received cardioplegia and triamcinolone made by NECC to see if they were linked.</p> <p>The NECC said in a statement that it was reviewing the new information from the FDA.</p> <p>On Monday a Tennessee woman who contracted fungal meningitis after receiving an epidural injection with the NECC-prepared steroid filed a lawsuit against the company seeking $15m in damages. Tennessee has been the hardest-hit state, with 53 cases and six deaths.</p> <p>Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. Fungal meningitis, which also causes strokes, is not contagious.</p> <p>All but eight of the 23 states that received suspect medications from the Massachusetts specialist pharmacy have reported at least one case of fungal meningitis, a rare and deadly disease that has proven difficult to treat.</p> <p>The suspect lots of steroid were shipped to 76 facilities.</p> <p>A list of <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm322979.htm\">recalled NECC products on the FDA website</a> ran 70 pages. </p> <p>The outbreak has raised questions over the oversight of pharmacies known as compounding centers, which are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/13/meningitis-outbreak-massachusetts-regulations\">not directly regulated by the FDA</a>.</p> <p>In compounding, pharmacies prepare specific doses of approved medications, based on guidance from a doctor, to meet an individual patient's need.</p> <p>However, state pharmacy regulators have said that NECC violated its license in Massachusetts by not requiring patient prescriptions before shipping products.</p> <p>The 15 states reporting cases of meningitis are Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, Texas, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Ohio and Florida.</p>",
  "<p>Larry Bushnell is one of the undecideds, that rarefied group of Americans who have yet to make up their minds whom to back on 6 November and whose vote could decide who holds the world's most powerful office.</p> <p>He lives in Ohio, one of the most crucial swing states in the US with its rich crop of 18 electoral college votes. It is often said that as Ohio goes, so goes the US presidency \u2013 it has consistently backed the winning candidate in every presidential election bar one since 1944. Within Ohio, Lake County where Bushnell lives is a bellwether, as it consistently cleaves more closely to the statewide voting pattern <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2008/08/ohios_presidential_election_be.html\">than anywhere else in the state</a>.</p> <p>Bushnell has yet another distinction as a voter. He belongs to a demographic group that in modern times Democratic presidential candidates, with Barack Obama as no exception, have struggled to bring on board \u2013 white men. In 2008, Obama won just 41% of the total white male vote across the US, a proportion that slumped further to 39% for white men without a college education.</p> <p>Polls this year <a href=\"http://decoded.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/voters-divide-along-familiar-l.php\">show that Mitt Romney</a> has capitalised on the Republican advantage among this demographic in key swing states like Ohio, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, bringing his support among non-college educated white men to about 58%. But Romney also knows how high the stakes are in this state \u2013 his overall poll rating has trailed behind Obama's, and though he has made up much ground in the past 10 days he will be all too familiar with the chilling fact that no Republican has won the US presidency without having also won Ohio.</p> <p>The good news for Obama and Romney is that they still have time to win over Bushnell, a 58-year-old retired manager at a jet engine repairs factory, such is his state of indecision. The bad news is that Bushnell detests both of them.</p> <p>\"I've been online checking them out, and I honestly think they both suck. They'll lie to get your vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Bushnell plumped for Obama in 2008, but is angry that the president has failed, as he sees it, to deliver on his promise of change. He is equally unimpressed by Romney, who he regards a \"coward \u2013 he keeps on flip-flopping from one thing to the next\".</p> <h2>'I'll vote for the guy I think will be better for me'</h2> <p>The Guardian gathered a sample group of five white male voters, Bushnell among them, in this bellwether area within a bellwether state to explore their mood and motivations. Interviewed outside a Home Depot store in Mentor, a small town within Lake County, they also included Roberto Ciora, 57, who has a message that will be pleasing to the Romney camp.</p> <p>In past presidential elections, Ciora has always voted for a third-party candidate, because he says he's so disillusioned with both main parties. But for now Romney has his vote, not so much for positive reasons but because he's the not-Obama candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397847816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350415380036/ohio-voters--006.jpg\" alt=\"ohio voters \" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roberto Ciora: 'I just go with my gut'.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ciora, a hospital nurse in Cleveland, says he will vote for Romney as a protest against the president. He doesn't like Obama's healthcare reforms \u2013 he thinks they will turn America into Canada \"where you have to wait months to see a doctor\".</p> <p>He also distrusts Obama on running the economy. \"Obama has no business experience \u2013 he's a lawyer. Romney is a businessman who could get the debt under control.\"</p> <p>Mark Luptak, 39, is leaning towards Romney, though not firmly so. Until recently he ran his own plastering business, but the residential housing market was in such doldrums after the 2008 economic crash that he had to shut it down and take a job in a larger commercial firm.</p> <p>The home improvement market is as bad as anything he's seen since the 1980s, and though he voted for Obama in 2008 he has little hope that another four years of his administration will drag it back up. \"I don't know if anything will help right now. The economy is horrible and I don't think that's going to change for years.\"</p> <p>The trade union at the construction firm he has joined is prompting him to vote for Obama. But Luptak says he's minded to swing behind Romney because he thinks a Romney administration would be more friendly to small businesses like the one he used to run.</p> <p>\"Honestly, I don't know. I'm a construction worker \u2013 I just go with my gut. I'll vote for the guy I think will be better for me, I'm selfish like that.\"</p> <h2>Ready to give Obama another chance</h2> <p>The relative faith of Luptak and Ciora in Romney as the best candidate to run the US economy runs in tune with recent polls which have seen the race tightening over the past two weeks in the wake of Romney's confident showing, and Obama's lacklustre one, in the first televised presidential debate on 3 October. Though there is considerable latitude between polls, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">the Real Clear Politics tracker survey</a> has Obama ahead by just two points in Ohio \u2013 a statistical tie.</p> <p>Obama's continuing, though slim, edge may have something to do with the fact that his re-election campaign has presented him aggressively as saviour of the American auto industry \u2013 a message conveyed by an avalanche of TV adverts served in the state. Ohio's resurgent car industry, particularly in northern areas of the state like Lake County where parts production factories are concentrated, <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/report-11300-new-auto-jobs-in-ohio-since-june-2009/nRCqd/\">has added more than 11,000 jobs since June 2009</a>, helping to bring down the jobless rate to 7.2%, well below the national unemployment rate of 7.8%.</p> <p>John Ferguson, 22, is thinking that he will probably vote for Obama on grounds that the economy, though far from perfect, will be safest in his hands. He works in a fiberglass factory making underground piping. \"I'm one of the lucky ones. I got in somewhere,\" he said.</p> <p>He says he is \"pretty sure\" he'll vote Obama to give him \"another chance. When Obama took over we were billions in debt, and it's pretty much impossible to swing that around in four years.\"</p> <p>Mark Travis, the fifth member of the group, says he is frustrated and upset by all the political banter this year. But he is firm in his position, having already decided that he will put his cross beside Obama's name on 6 November. </p> <p>An entrepreneur, aged 30, Travis said he adheres to many conservative principles but just doesn't trust Romney or the Republicans to follow through. \"The basic truth is that the Republicans don't deliver on what they promise. Neither do the Democrats, but they are a little more dependable.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>OK, that's all from me for this evening.</strong> Thanks for your time and your emails and hopefully I'll see you here tomorr ... actually, I won't, because I'm not due in. Well, somebody else will definitely be here to guide you through the afternoon's play, which is unlikely to be as exciting as this live blog of some men talking about weather.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>The match will be played</strong> tomorrow afternoon at 4pm (UK time). Hats off to everyone involved in that decision, for making it so quickly. I thought it would take hours.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>THE GAME IS OFF! POLAND v ENGLAND WILL NOT BE PLAYED TONIGHT! </strong></p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>\"You can write off tonight's fixture,\"</strong> says Gabriel Clarke, saying that the delay is being caused by various men in blazers arguing over whether it will be rescheduled for tomorrow night, a date in November or some other time. \"At the moment I think England are fairly confident that the game can be played tomorrow,\" he adds.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>This is great:</strong> \"My husband has explained the joke to me,\" writes Lyndsey from Morocco. \"No offence taken.\" No announcement yet about this godforsaken match. Apparently England are happy to play it tomorrow, but Poland aren't.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>This is splendid!</strong> The ref is back out, kicking a ball around, as if he expects the pitch to be in better nick after another 45 minutes rain than it was when he last tried. Oh to be in a bar in Morocco watching Spain against France with Lyndsey and her husband. It's 20 degrees in Marrakech today.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Some pre-announcement padding:</strong> \"I'm indoors with the wife but we're not watching GBBO, she's whacked a recorded episode of True Blood on,\" writes James Barnes. \"I'm keeping up to date with you, Barry. I kind of hope it does get played tonight, it might show UEFA up a bit and cause a bit of trouble for those in charge.\" </p> <p>\"I've gone to the pub to watch this as the other half was watching the great British bake off,\" writes Alec Cochrane. \"Now I'll have to keep up the charade of a game having taken place to explain why I stayed here all night drinking.\"</p> <p>\"A few years back I played in a game where the referee had travelled so far that despite the fact that you could see the ongoing torrential rainfall streaming across the sloping pitch, there was no way he was letting the match not go ahead,\" writes Steve Gaw. \"With passes going about two feet, balls falling out of the sky and stopping dead in puddles and everyone sopped in mud the whole affair was like taking part in an extreme washing detergent commercial. It also ended nil-nil. If this game takes place I am tempted to run home and watch it rather than have to imagine those 20 yard sliding tackes.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>A Fantasy Football cheat and chutney maker writes:</strong> \"My wife wants to watch Adrian Chiles et al but I'm clinging on to the Baking stuff,\" writes stand-up comedy's Ian Moore, <a href=\"http://www.ianmoorejourneyman.blogspot.co.uk/\">whose amusing blog you can read here</a>. \"Out of interest has Ray Winstone been on to shout the odds on whether there'll be play or not?\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Rain update:</strong> I probably should have put a 'smiley face' or *smug Jimmy Carr face* emoticon after that comment to point out to the humourless and desperate to be offended that I was just joking with Lyndsey, shouldn't I? It's a sad state of affairs when you've reached a point that such a thought even crosses your mind. </p> <p>Anyway, England's players have changed back into their tracksuits, trainers and preposterously over-sized headphones. Poland's, apparently, are still wandering around in their kit, desperately hopeful of playing a match.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>A chippy email:</strong> \"Hello, I'm disappointed by your reference to the Great British Bake Off and wives and girlfriends,\" writes Lyndsey. \"I normally have to reserve these sorts of emails for ITV coverage but wouldn't expect that sort of lazy sexism from the Guardian. I'm following on my husband's phone from Morocco as the only bar we can find is showing France v Spain and that sort of generalist comment is just a bit disappointing.\"</p> <p>Using your husband's phone to complain about what you perceive to be lazy sexism, Lyndsey? While it was very nice of him to let you borrow it, I think it would be kinder still if he let you have one of your own.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Faroe Islands 1-2 Republic of Ireland (Hansen 68)</strong> Oh sweet baby Jesus and the angels. \"It was the best move of the match too,\" says Paul Doyle.

One of the games at the Euros looked like it was going to be washed out, with thunder too, to make it more dramatic, but they managed to get the game on. So you never know.\"</p> <p>You might be right, but the pitch is currently waterlogged, the rain is torrential, the roof of the stadium is not closed and there's nobody working on the pitch to try and drain it. How can they get a game on?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Adrian Bevington is refusing to play ball here:</strong> The FA communications director looks furious, but is refusing to cut loose and rip into Fifa and the Polish FA, which would at least provide some much-needed entertainment and give the increasingly desperate Adrian Chiles, Roy Keane and Gareth Southgate a much-needed controversy to talk about. </p> <p>Down in the tunnel, it must be said, ITV's touchline prowler Gabriel Clarke is playing a blinder, asking the hard questions, ferreting around looking for information and fielding Adrian Chiles's relentless line of childish questioning about the stadium roof with a breezy bonhomie he almost certainly isn't feeling.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Conflicting reports coming from Warsaw:</strong> Some journalists in the stadium are reporting that there'll be another pitch inspection in 30 minutes, while others are saying the match is definitely off. I can't stress enough that there is <em>zero</em> chance of a football match being played on this pitch tonight. If you're reading this because your wife or girlfriend wanted to watch the Great British Bake-Off, don't hold a grudge.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>The Mirror's Oliver Holt tweets:</strong> \"Confusion in tunnel,\" he says. \"England look worried ref will somehow try and play this. Feel bad for fans but total madness if he does.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>One point of interest:</strong> I presumed I'd misheard her, but it seems I didn't. The Polish media officer who spoke earlier said \"we were expecting heavy rain, but not expecting a downpour.\" Eh?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>This is farcical:</strong> Fifa have told the gents in the press room that they will try to get this game on in the next 45 minutes to an hour. There isn't a snowball's chance in hell of this match being played - it's still lashing rain, one of the penalty areas is completely flooded and there's nobody making any effort to drain the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Do they <em>want</em> a riot?</strong> Presumably as a gag, the stadium PA man or woman is playing U2's Beautiful Day.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Not long now:</strong> The referee walks off the pitch, ignoring roy Hodgson as he does so. He marches down the tunnel and through a door. Hodgson, FA blazer Adrian Bevington and assorted others follow him. I'm not sure about you, but I can't contain my excitement.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Pitch inspection:</strong> The roof remains open, the rain is still lashing down and the referee has come out to throw a ball around, to see if it will bounce or roll. Why? It's quite obviously <em>way</em> worse now than the last time he checked. Every time he throws the ball and it splats into a puddle before stopping dead, he gets a hug round of applause from the crowd. \"He's a clown,\" says ITV pundit Roy Keane, who points out that he was late coming out to check the pitch in the first place.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>The Polish media officer speaks:</strong> She says they'll have a pitch inspection at 9pm (8pm our time) and decide whether or not to delay kick-off for an hour, to play it tomorrow or to play it some other time. She also says that the reason there's nobody out working on the pitch is because they have under-soil heating which can dry the pitch in half an hour, if required. Impressive, eh? Sadly, it seems that miracle-drier only works when the roof is shut and they can't shut the roof because there's too much rain. Ah, football. As toxic as you can be, I can never stay mad at you for long.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Umbrella watch:</strong> After all the of 'Wally with the brolly' Steve McClaren got from the media, it's amusing to see that <em>nobody</em> from the England backroom team has had the nerve to put up an umbrella to shelter them from the rain that's pouring down from the Warsaw sky. We'll know in five minutes whether or not the match will be played.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>This from The Telegraph's Henry Winter in the Stadium:</strong> \"Dave Watson #eng gk coach in penalty area, kicking puddles,\" he tweets. \"Miracle if this goes ahead tonight.

Apparently it can't be closed because - and I'm not making this up - \"the rain is too heavy\" for them to do so. Considering the torrential nature of the rain, the fact that not a single groundsman is out on the pitch drying to drain it and the audible whistling and jeering of the fans, I suspect there is no chance whatsoever of this match being played tonight. We'll know for definite in 15 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>This from Dominic Fifield:</strong> \"Roy Hodgson wading out into one of the penalty areas,\" tweets our man at National Stadium. \"He just kicked a ball along the ground as hard as he could. It went about four yards.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>According to Uefa rules:</strong> If the match doesn't go ahead in the National Stadium in Warsaw tonight, and I have to say it looks very, very unlikely, there's talk on ITV that it might be played tomorrow instead. THat ought to come as great news to all the England fans who are due to return home this evening or tomorrow morning.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <h2>This match is seriously in doubt ...</h2> <p>It's lashing rain, the pitch is waterlogged in Warsaw, the roof of the stadium hasn't been closed and there aren't even a few fellows out there prodding the grass with forks.

He reacted angrily by kicking away the ball and then reacted to fans making monkey noises as he left the pitch.</p> <p>An enraged Steve Wigley, one of the England coaching staff, was also caught up in the trouble and had to be restrained after after being punched at least once in the face.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <h2>This very important news just in ... </h2> <p>In a state of affairs that is bound to delight their many detractors, the England brass band will be absent for only the second time in 20 years after they were refused entry to tonight's World Cup qualifier. </p> <p>Band members had their instruments impounded as they tried to enter the National Stadium. It repeats an unhappy experience at the opening game of Euro 2012 in Donetsk, when the band were also only allowed into the stadium once they had relinquished their instruments.</p> <p>It is believed stadium authorities took tonight's decision because the Polish FA have refused to sanction a Polish band, and would be open to accusations of double standards if they allowed their English counterparts in.</p> <p>\"It is very frustrating,\" said band leader John Hemmingham. \"We have travelled tens of thousands of miles following England and were looking forward to banging the drum for the Three Lions once more. It is massively disappointing to get such a bum note.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The time for talking is over:</strong> Well, nearly over. At the time of writing there's just under an hour left for talking. And there's been lots of talk. England midfielder Steven Gerrard has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/15/steven-gerrard-england-poland-generation\">been talking about Patrick Vieria</a>, while Poland captain Marcin Wasilewski been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/15/poland-england-wayne-rooney-wonderful\">talking about how great Wayne Rooney is</a>. Meanwhile on yesterday's episode of our F<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/audio/2012/oct/15/football-weekly-england-poland-edgar-davids\">ootball Weekly podcast</a>, James Richardson, myself and others managed to mug our way through 40 minutes or so of nonsense, despite having very little to talk about.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>England team:</strong> Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Lescott, Cole; Milner, Gerrard, Carrick, Cleverley; Rooney, Defoe.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson look likely to return to the England line-up after their spell out on the naughty step, while James Milner, Jermain Defoe and Joleon Lescott are also tipped to start after being rested against San Marino because they were each just one booking away from suspensions of their own. Theo Walcott (rib) misses out courtesy of that brutal challenge by San Marino goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini, while neither Chelsea pair Frank Lampard (calf) nor Ryan Bertrand (virus) boarded the plane to Warsaw. </p> <p>As well as his skipper Jakub Blasczczykowski (ankle), Waldemar Fornalik will have to make do without Wojciech Szczesny (foot) and Lukasz Fabianski (shoulder), which means PSV Eindhoven goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. Central midfielder Eugen Polanski could also miss out, having left the squad prior to Friday's friendly win over South Africa for unspecified personal reasons.</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preview:</strong> Fifth in <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html\">the international rankings</a> take on 54th, but don't be gulled by the Fifa charts - both positions are laughable. As co-hosts, Poland went two years in the build-up to Euro 2012 without playing a competitive match, while often ponderous England would seem to be fortuitous in the extreme to be above teams such as the Netherlands, Uruguay and Italy. And France. And Brazil. While Poland, although no world-beaters, are surely better than Libya and the Cape Verde Islands. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Roy Hodgson's side will be fairly hopeful of taking all three points from their hosts in Warsaw tonight, but would almost certainly leave reasonably satisfied with just one. This is England's first major test en route to the World Cup finals in Brazil the summer after next and their fans may learn much tonight from a team comprising grizzled veterans, former fringe players newly elevated to senior status and several wet-behind-the-ears international newbies. </p> <p>With this being Hodgson's 11th match in charge of England, it's small wonder he concedes they're far from the finished article. \"We're trying to get there,\" he told reporters in Warsaw yesterday. \"We're on our way. Since the Euros, the Italy game was quite positive, Moldova was a good performance.\"</p> <p>Poland are also a team in transition. Waldemar Fornalik has replaced Franciszek Smuda after an underwhelming Euro 2012 campaign in which the co-hosts drew two and lost one of their matches to finish bottom of Group A. </p> <p>Indeed, arguably the most significant chapter of their summer endeavours involved team captain Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski proving as selfish off the field as he occasionally does on it, by inappropriately blaming their exit in part on his inability to relax before the final group game. The reason for his restlessness and ennui? Not being furnished with enough free tickets to satisfy demand for his nearest and dearest by the Polish FA. B\u0142aszczykowski kith and kin won't need to worry about not seeing him tonight, as the Borussia Dortmund winger misses out through injury. </p> <p>Anderlecht defender Marcin Wasilewsk will take over the armband for the Poles this evening and in his pre-match press conference, suggested this is exactly the kind of test his country requires to chart their position on the lie of the land. </p> <p>\"Such a match against quality opposition is needed,\" he said. \"It is similar to a game we had against Portugal a few years ago. Everyone thought we would lose but we won, and it gave us the spur we needed to go on and qualify for the European Championship.\"</p>",
  "<p>The way the two major parties control the presidential debates is a perfect microcosm of how political debates are restricted in general. Though typically shrouded in secrecy, several facts about this process have recently come to light and they are quite instructive. </p> <p>I was on Democracy Now this morning along with George Farah discussing the ways these debates, designed to cast the appearance of fostering vibrant exchanges, are actually intended to constrict the range of debated views as much as possible. My segment (and the transcript to it) can be seen <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/16/glenn_greenwald_presidential_debates_highlight_faux\">here</a>, but it was <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/16/secret_debate_contract_reveals_obama_and\">the commentary of Farah</a> - who is a genuine expert in the history of presidential debates - that I found revealing.</p> <p>He described how the two political parties in the 1990s joined forces to wrest control over the presidential debates away from the independent League of Women Voters, which had long resisted the parties' efforts to shield their presidential candidates from genuine surprise or challenge. Now run by the party-controlled Commission on Presidential Debates, these rituals are designed to do little more than \" eliminate spontaneity\" and \"exclude all viable third-party voices\". Citing a <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-complete-m-o-u/\">just-leaked 21-page \"memorandum of understanding\"</a> secretly negotiated by the two campaigns to govern the rules of the debates, Farah recounted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We have a private corporation that was created by the Republican and Democratic parties called the Commission on Presidential Debates. It seized control of the presidential debates precisely because the League was independent, precisely because this women's organization had the guts to stand up to the candidates that the major-party candidates had nominated. And instead of making public these contracts and resisting the major-party candidates' manipulations, the commission allows the candidates to negotiate these 21-page contracts that dictate all the fundamental terms of the debates.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Gawker's John Cook has <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5951977/leaked-debate-agreement-shows-both-obama-and-romney-are-sniveling-cowards\">an excellent breakdown</a> of the 21-page memo. In his piece, entitled \"Leaked Debate Agreement Shows Both Obama and Romney are Sniveling Cowards\", Cook details how the rules imposed on these debates demonstrate that, above all else, \"both campaigns are terrified at anything even remotely spontaneous happening.\" </p> <p>Under this elaborate regime, the candidates \"aren't permitted to ask each other questions, propose pledges to each other, or walk outside a 'predesignated area.'\" Worse, \"the audience members posing questions aren't allowed to ask follow-ups (their mics will be cut off as soon as they get their questions out). Nor will moderator Candy Crowley.\" The rules even \"forbid television coverage from showing reaction shots of the candidates\". </p> <p>All of this means, as Farah put it:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"The town hall debate we're going to see tonight is the most constrained and regulated town hall debate in presidential debate history. The first town hall debate was introduced in 1992, and no one knew what anyone was going to ask, none of the audience members were going to ask. The moderator could ask any follow-up questions. It was exciting, and it was real.</p> <p>\"Well, President George H.W. Bush stumbled in response to an oddly worded question about the federal deficit, and the candidates - the campaigns have panicked and have attempted to avoid that kind of situation from happening again. In 1996, they abolished follow-up questions from the audience.</p> <p>\"In 2004, they began requiring that every single question asked by the audience be submitted in advance on an index card to the moderator, who can then throw out the ones he or she does not like. And that's why the audience has essentially been reduced, in some ways, to props, because the moderator is still ultimately asking the questions.</p> <p>\"And this election cycle is the first time that the moderator herself is prohibited from asking follow-up questions, questions seeking clarification. She's essentially reduced to keeping time and being a lady with a microphone.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Making matters worse still, the Commission is run by lobbyists and funded by large corporations. As Zaid Jilani <a href=\"http://boldprogressives.org/little-known-fact-the-presidential-debate-commission-is-chaired-by-corporate-lobbyists-funded-by-corporations/\">writes today</a>, the two Commission co-chairmen are former GOP Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr. and former Clinton spokesman Michael D. McCurry. Fahrenkopf is one of the nation's leading <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=5262\">lobbyists for the gaming industry</a>, while McCurry <a href=\"http://www.psw-inc.com/mccurry.php\">advises a long list of corporate clients</a> including the telecom industry.</p> <p>The debates are paid for by <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=national-debate-sponsors\">large corporate sponsors</a>, including Anheuser-Busch Companies. As Jilani writes, \"in the past, the tobacco industry, AT&amp;T, and others have all been sponsors.\" And as Farah describes, with all that sponsorship comes the standard benefits:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"FARAH: 'First, the just nice advertising, of course. They get to - you know, Philip Morris sponsored one of the presidential debates, paid $250,000 and got to hang its banner in the post-debate spin room that was seen throughout the country. But more importantly, they get access, and they get to show support for both major parties.'</p> <p>\"AMY GOODMAN: 'The major parties on their podiums have Bud Light on the podium?'</p> <p>\"FARAH: 'Not yet. We're getting there. We're getting there, Amy. But they get to show support for both major parties. How often can corporations find a way to make a single donation that strengthens both the Republican and Democratic parties and get a tax deduction for that kind of donation? So it's a rare contribution. And it also gives them access. They get to go to the actual debate themselves and rub shoulders at private receptions with the campaigns and their staff.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, the moderators <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79690.html\">were selected</a> to ensure that nothing unexpected is asked and that only the most staid and establishment views are heard. As journalism professor Jay Rosen put it when the names of the moderators were unveiled, using <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/01/16/rosen/\">terms to describe</a> those views that are acceptable in Washington media circles and those which are \"fringe\": </p> <blockquote> <p>\"In order to be considered as a candidate for moderator you have to be soaked in the sphere of consensus, likely to stay within the predictable inner rings of the sphere of legitimate controversy, and unlikely in the extreme to select any questions from the sphere of deviance.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Here then, within this one process of structuring the presidential debates, we have every active ingredient that typically defines, and degrades, US democracy. The two parties collude in secret. The have the same interests and goals. Everything is done to ensure that the political process is completely scripted and devoid of any spontaneity or reality.</p> <p>All views that reside outside the narrow confines of the two parties are rigidly excluded. Anyone who might challenge or subvert the two-party duopoly is rendered invisible. </p> <p>Lobbyists who enrich themselves by peddling their influence run everything behind the scenes. Corporations pay for the process, which they exploit and is then run to bolster rather than threaten their interests. The media's role is to keep the discourse as restrictive and unthreatening as possible while peddling the delusion that it's all vibrant and free and independent and unrestrained. And it all ends up distorting political realities far more than illuminating them while wildly exaggerating the choices available to citizens and concealing the similarities between the two parties.</p> <p>To understand the US political process, one can just look to how these sham debates are organized and how they function. This is the same process that repeats itself endlessly in virtually every other political realm.</p>",
  "<p>I would like to protest in the strongest terms at the rash and blatantly prejudiced comments expressed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/oct/12/tories-conference-tedious-teachers-catholic-abuse\" title=\"\">Simon Hoggart's column</a> (13 October). As a former resident of Northern Ireland and a current teacher at a Catholic school in England, I was astonished by the claims attributed by Mr Hoggart to a former Northern Ireland Office minister that he could allegedly spot child abuse occurring in Catholic schools by looking into the faces of pupils.</p> <p>Mr Hoggart makes no attempt to locate these vague comments within any specific time frame or location, instead being content to leave the reader with the impression that such abuse currently occurs in NI Catholic schools and is being covered up by some higher political agenda. Mr Hoggart undoubtedly knows that child protection policies, standards and practice are as high and stringent within NI Catholic schools as they are in any other school in the UK.</p> <p>The former Northern Ireland Office minister is breaking the law by not disclosing any information he may have about actual abuse to the police. He should also be obliged to offer these intuitive powers of detection to the relevant authorities, who would be able to utilise them to good effect.</p> <p>Shame on Mr Hoggart for using these vague comments in his column as a vehicle for expressing prejudice and causing offence.<br><strong>Brendan McMullan</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008I have always enjoyed Simon Hoggart's writing, particularly his witty exposure of parliamentary pomposity, but I was saddened by his reporting of a claim by a former Northern Ireland minister that some children in Catholic schools were being abused (presumably, he means sexually). It is disturbing that bigoted accusations continue to fan the flames of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. I wonder which political party the ex-minister represented.<br><strong>Joe Haynes</strong><br><em>Wargrave, Berkshire</em></p>",
  "<p>He had been all but written off by most of The Great British Bake Off's 5&#xa0;million\u2011plus fans \u2013 many presumed the&#xa0;final clash of wooden spoons would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/15/great-british-bake-off-who-will-win\" title=\"\">be between Brendan Lynch and James Morton</a>. But underdog John Whaite defied expectations to sift, soften and stir his way to victory in the BBC2 baking show last night.</p> <p>\"People think bakers are dainty little housewives but they are not. They are quite controlling people who want to be told that they are loved,\" said the 23-year-old law student, wrangling with his rough puff during the all-male final. Later, shivering in shorts on a sodden lawn, he received TV baking's closest approximation to an emotional declaration: the Great British Bake Off trophy.</p> <p>For fans, the final made for an eventful but perhaps curiously unsatisfying close to a 10-week competition that has dominated Tuesday night TV and made stars of both its competitors and the judges, Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.</p> <p>Morton, the hipster medical student from Shetland, who has won bucketloads of admiring fans with his relaxed, laid-back approach and love of experimentation, began badly, and never seriously pulled things back, despite being much-fancied as a potential winner.</p> <p>While Whaite and Lynch's pithiviers gleamed warmly like burnished sunflower heads, golden flakes of pastry giving way to soft, delicious filling, his suffered from the dreaded Bake Off affliction. Never before has a solemn \"soggy bottom\" cut so deeply.</p> <p>After a semi-final that saw platters of immaculate choux swans, jewel-coloured macaroons and dainty sponges put before the judges, the technical challenge \u2013 a stand of sweet fondant fancies, nestled, pink and delicious as if awaiting a party of angelic children \u2013 was a reminder that even a GBBO finalist still needs the guidance of Berry.</p> <p>The splodgy, chocolate-spattered cubes gloopily assembled were a reminder that this is a home-baking competition. \"Mr Kipling would turn in his grave,\" said Whaite. Berry didn't look best pleased either.</p> <p>Which left barely a slip of baking parchment between the three finalists as they entered the final, showstopper bake round. Their task: to create a perfect chiffon cake themed around their personal highlight of 2012.</p> <p>Almost immediately it became clear that Morton was in trouble: having set himself another madly ambitious and likely impossible task \u2013 why bake one cake when you can bake five? \u2013 he promptly dropped one of the delicate sponges on the floor.</p> <p>The result was a lesson in why brilliance will not always beat planning. And that cakes shouldn't really come on enormous groaning boards that one person strains to carry.</p> <p>Lynch and Whaite, however, both put up cakes you would have trampled over the presenters, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, to reach first. Whaite's was a technically tricky gleaming mirror of chocolate, finished, beautifully, with a hairdryer. Lynch's was a classic raspberry and almond chiffon, with a charming story of family reunion behind it.</p> <p>Lynch, a recruitment consultant, has had a rough ride with viewers for his matter-of-fact manner and sometimes apparently humourless approach: he has proved himself a perfectionist with a wide repertoire, but sometimes less-than-camera-friendly manner.</p> <p>\"The one who can keep their emotion in check is the one who will win,\" he said, somewhat hopefully, at the beginning of Tuesday night's show. Not only did Lynch not win, but we also, touchingly, glimpsed the emotions raging beneath that super-calm exterior.</p> <p>Should it have been him grasping the trophy? If past performance had been taken into consideration in a battle between Lynch and Whaite, then probably \u2013 his truly sinister gingerbread birdhouse notwithstanding, Lynch's consistency has been incredible.</p> <p>Even, maybe, on the basis of the final bakes. \"That sponge is like a cloud,\" said&#xa0;Hollywood, as the interior of Lynch's chiffon was revealed. But he was missing that spark of invention that Whaite and Morton were able to conjure up, whether creating a gingerbread barn or a&#xa0;colosseum.</p> <p>It's that same special something that has seen The Great British Bake Off become a massive hit for BBC2. That its finale featured former rivals complimenting each other while standing in a field, under an umbrella, determined to have a&#xa0;good time despite the freezing rain, says a great deal about its elusive appeal.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Good evening, and welcome to The Great British Bake Off final liveblog! After nine weeks of sublime sponges, perfect pies and dubious doughnuts, only three bakers remain. All that stands between one of them and an embarrassingly gawdy trophy are three final bakes. There will be sweat. There will be tears. There may be blood, depending on whether John is left unsupervised with electrical appliances. There will definitely be mild baking innuendo and people staring anxiously into ovens. And by 9pm we'll have a winner, and GBBO will be sadly over for another year. Boo.</p> <p>So before we get started, let's take a look at our finalists. First we have John, who always manages to give the impression of having just crawled out of bed with a rancid hangover, but still manages to knock up something quite special (let's pretend the salty Rum Babas never happened). Watching him puff and sweat into his choux batter whilst turning the colour of a forest fruit tart makes me anxious, but he's brilliant with flavours and can plait a loaf beautifully. He's arguably the underdog in this final, so I'd like to see him do well. </p> <p>Second up is Perfectionist Brendan, whom I adore. Mostly this is because I love an overblown dessert with a sprinkling of fairytale whimsy, but also because he looks like the kind of guy who does the washing up as he goes along, which means he'd be allowed in my kitchen. Putting aside a few patchy bakes early on, Brendan is technically brilliant, with a calm, unflappable air that is both delightfully soothing and mildly unnerving. I worry that the pressure of the final may cause him to unravel faster than a Greggs sausage roll.</p> <p>And finally, we have James. The thinking baker's fondant fancy, James is a nerdy ambassador for chunky knitwear and the Wing-It School of Baking, and clearly a natural in the kitchen. Don't forget this man won Star Baker by transforming a beautiful gingerbread barn into a spooky derelict shed, just by adding spun toffee and poking holes in the crumbly walls. He may look like he's bumbling along by the seat of his tartan corduroys, but I'm convinced he's actually a finely tuned baking machine.</p> <p>So who will crumble, and who's a choux-in for the win? (Sorry. Actually no I'm not. I'm just getting warmed up). My money's on James, but it's a tough call and any of them could be wondering where the hell they might display their GBBO trophy come 9pm. </p> <p>I'll be here to record every curdled custard and flaky filling from 8pm, but in the meantime pop on a tank top, help yourself to a choux pastry swan, and don't forget to leave your comments in the box below as usual. See you at 8!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>7.52pm: Just for info, I had a hilarious gag lined up about a female Paul Hollywood impersonator called Creme Pat, but TV journo Gareth McLean did it far better on Twitter earlier and I've reluctantly binned it. I'm still a tiny bit in mourning, if I'm honest.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.59pm: And we're off! I'm excited. Ooh, a montage.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>8.00pm: I miss Cathryn. She was brilliant. This week the finalists' baking results will be going to a traditional British fete, so it's important not to poison anyone.</p> <p>Ooh, James is wearing shorts! Brendan looks calm and immaculate as ever, and John looks like he's just rolled out of bed. They all look terrified, so all is as it should be.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>8.03pm: I love Mel and Sue. They're like Ant and Dec, but funnier. And without the dodgy 90s pop career. And able to function independently. Actually, they're nothing like Ant &amp; Dec. Let's move on.</p> <p>The signature challenge is a Pithivier, which is the noise you make when you accidentally swallow a wasp. It's also the posh name for a pie. Basically it's two round bits of puff pastry with a savoury filling. Fray Bentos, anyone?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>8.04pm: Mary is looking fragrant as ever in a floral frock, whilst Paul is all perma-tanned silver fox with daft beard ready to hate on everything. And yet, I confess to a small and slightly confusing weird crush.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>8.05pm: Apparently James has had to learn to make rough puff pastry only this week. He's the Denise Van Outen of baking, isn't he? </p> <p>James has a girlfriend, and she's properly posh. A nation mourns. He's been studying for his Medicine finals whilst practising for the Bake Off. We can only hope he's less devil-may-care when I'm lying on his operating table.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>8.08pm: John's family are basically a Creature Comforts ad. They're hoping to be \"proud of him for the first time ever\". I hope he doesn't become a lawyer - the nation is packed with lawyers, but how many people can really PLAIT BREAD?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>8.09pm: All the Pithiviers look yummy, although Brendan's is stuffed with enough Garlic to slay a vampire horse. He's a Buddhist, we learn, and his partner is an expert at cleaning Brendan's piping bag. How are ALL their partners not enormous?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>8.12pm: Basically a Pithivier is a plate-sized pasty. James has decided not to go for the traditional look (which Mary wants), and has instead opted for an easier option. Risky, James.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>8.14pm: Right, Pithivier judgement time. Mary loves the look of Brendan's Pithivier, which has lovely base. It's full of potato, red pepper, spinach and spices, and it's a winning combination.</p> <p>John's Pithivier contains Italian sausage, cheese and roasted vegetable. Again it's a good bake, with lovely flavours. Mary compliments him on his lovely sausage. It's just too easy, this.</p> <p>James's Pithivier contains chicken, chorizo and red pepper. The bottom is soggy. James looks crushed, like a forsaken macaron in the patisserie window of despair.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>8.17pm: The final technical challenge is to make Fondant Fancies, which no-one has eaten since 1979. I'm assuming Mr Kipling still makes them, and that they're still rank.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>8.19pm: Brendan is happy because Fondant Fancies are all about sponge and detailing, and it's familiar territory. James has no idea what a Fondant Fancy is. So HE says.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>8.20pm: So it's sponge, with buttercream, and marzipan, and apricot jam, and icing, and chocolate swirly bits. Basically a heart attack in bitesized cube form.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>8.22pm: Brendan's got his ruler out. They need to make 25 cubes out of a square sponge. 5 by 5, surely? </p> <p>Next is the buttercream over the sizes, and a blob on the top. John drops his fancy in the fondant, and now they're all falling apart. He resorts to scooping the fondant on with his fingers. It's like an episode of the Generation Game.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>8.25pm: Brendan is cracking faster than an overbaked meringue, whilst James seems to have everything under control. John's Fancies look a bit of a mess.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>8.27pm: Paul looks unimpressed with Brendan's Fondant Fancies, sucking the joy out of the tent like the giant soggy-bottomed funsponge he is.</p> <p>John's fondant is too wet, but the chocolate on the top is neater than Brendan's. They're too small, however, and overwhelmed with buttercream.</p> <p>James's fondant is thicker, and they like his sponge, but his rosewater is too pungent.</p> <p>In last place, both Brendan and John. James wins, but generally the standard was poor for all three. Can we bring back Dani and Cathryn please?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>8.29pm: Right, so it's all even going into the final challenge. After forlorn Fondant Fancies, it's going to need to be something completely brilliant.</p> <p>The final showstopper is a Chiffon Sponge. This is the light and floaty version of the Corduroy Sponge, which\u2026ok, I'm just making random stuff up now. </p> <p>They have to give it a twist that makes it personal to them, giving it a flavour of 2012. But a Chiffon sponge is fiendishly difficult, apparently.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>8.32pm: Brendan's cake is a \"Family Reunion\" cake. He's bringing people in his family together for the first time in 30 years, apparently. It's an X Factor backstory in sponge form.</p> <p>John's cake represents \"Heaven and Hell\". Studying has been hell, but the birth of his nephews has been heaven. So, you know, why not recreate those moments in cake? </p> <p>James is making five cakes, which represent the United Kingdom. Four individual cakes to represent the countries of the UK, and another that brings in flavours from all of them. Alas he's not stacking them one on top of the other, which seems like a wasted opportunity for inter-nation sponge war.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>8.36pm: DISASTER - James has just dropped one of his cakes on the floor. So he's starting again, but doesn't seem that bothered. He just looks despondent. like a flumped souffl\u00e9.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>8.38pm: Ooh, all the previous contestants are at the fete! They all have their favourites to win. I miss Catherine peering glumly into her oven.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>8.39pm: James nearly dropped a second cake. It's getting a bit tense. The cakes are all out, and the decorating has begun. John is re-melting his icing with a hairdryer, for that glossy salon finish.</p> <p>Funsponge Paul is sharing his master baker wisdom - Brendan is a traditional baker, John is a technical genius, and James is an innovator. This cake will decide who wins the Bake Off. No pressure, then.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>8.41pm: James has made Turkish Delight for the first time. It's like silicone sealant, you could rim a bathtub with that.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>8.42pm: Five minutes left, and it's all about the finishing touches. Hundreds of hungry people are milling about at the soggy village fete, desparate to get their hands on a Chiffon sponge mountain.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>8.43pm: Brendan's cake looks like the BT tower, but now he's having a little cry. James and John come over for a group hug. I'm properly welling up.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>8.45pm: Judgement time! Both Mary and Paul love the look of John's \"Heaven and Hell\" - the chocolate Hell section looks amazing, it's basically just a massive chocolate sponge that I want to sink my face into. Paul deliberates for several weeks and pokes it with a fork for a bit, and then gives it a thumbs up.</p> <p>The Heaven Sponges look like a stack of headless owls, so I'll pass. Paul and Mary love them, however, so a brilliant bake for John.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>8.48pm: Brendan's \"Family Reunion\" cake is declared elegant, and a lovely bake. The main sponge is three layers with raspberries, with a touch of almond. Paul and Mary are in raptures. Another amazing bake for Brendan, who looks thrilled. I'm glad - I don't think I could have coped with a broken Brendan.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>8.49pm: And then James rocks up with five cakes, and tries to out-cake the other two with sheer volume. Paul's problem is that it's not one cake, which is what he asked for. Has James just ruined his chances, for the sake of stacking them one on top of the other?</p> <p>James's Chiffon sponges are too dry, and are welding Paul's mouth together. James looks devastated, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew, bless him.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>8.52pm: So, time for the judges to confer. James failed to unite the kingdom, cake-wise, but he's been Star Baker more than the other two.</p> <p>John had a bad start in the first few weeks, but he's had moments of genius. His cake today was outstanding.</p> <p>Brendan has amazing knowledge and experience, but he struggles with the technical challenge. But, you know, CHOUX PASTRY SWANS.</p> <p>I really can't call this - it could be any one of them. TENSION.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>8.55pm: So who will it be? Sue shouts at the crowd in the rain, at a distance of about 20 metres, apropos of nothing.</p> <p>And the winner is...JOHN! I'm so pleased, he's had his ups and downs, but he's a brilliant baker, and the one of the three I'd most like to go to the pub with, which is very important.</p> <p>Does he get a bit trophy, or just flowers? Last year's trophy was hideous, surely they need to take it to a new level?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>8.57pm: \"My mum's so proud, and that's the biggest prize for me\", sobs John, and I'm now having a good cry with him. Don't be a lawyer, John, be a baker. </p> <p>We also get to see what all the other contestants are doing. Cathryn and Sarah-Jane are running a market stall together, which is AMAZING. James passed all his exams, and John got a first in his law degree, but he's saving up to go to Paris and train as a Patissier. </p> <p>I LOVE a happy ending *sigh*.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>9.00pm: So that's it for the 3rd series of The Great British Bake Off! It's been wholesome, feelgood TV happiness, and Tuesday nights just won't be the same without an hour of crispy bakes, creamy toppings and soggy bottoms. Thank you all for joining in with the liveblog, you've been splendid as ever. You can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you'd like to say hello, and feel free to come and join in my Strictly liveblog on Saturday. Is anyone else really hungry now, or is it just me? Night!

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch told shareholders they can take their money elsewhere if they do not like the way he runs News Corp as he sailed through his second meeting with investors since the hacking scandal tore through his media empire.</p> <p>At the company's annual meeting in Los Angeles, the chairman and chief executive announced he had seen off moves by dissident shareholders calling for him to appoint an independent chairman. He also blocked a move to end a dual-class share structure that allows him to control the company by owning the largest chunk of voting shares.</p> <p>The victories were no surprise given that the arrangement gives him control of 40% of the voting shares in the company. The motion had gathered widespread support from many major shareholders including the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, the UK's Local Authority Pension Fund Forum and the Australian Shareholders Association.</p> <p>Most shareholders voted for the re-election of the board and James Murdoch escaped embarrassment with broad support, a reversal of last year's angry protest votes.</p> <p>But Murdoch did not get everything his way. A majority of independent shareholders voted for the separation of chief executive and chairman roles, with 156,615,065 shares votes for the proposal and 356,720,056 against.</p> <p>Murdoch wrote on Twitter last week: \"Busy preparing for next week's company AGM. Signs pretty peaceful, but any shareholders with complaints should take profits and sell!\"</p> <p>Asked at the meeting about the comment, Murdoch said: \"Oh please.\" He then pointed to a comment in the New York Times where an analyst suggested that dissident shareholders could sell their stock and buy other media firms.</p> <p>The exchange was a rare flash of annoyance from the often irascible chairman, who delivered a calm performance and avoided any tricky questions about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/rebekah-brooks-severance-deal-7m?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">alleged \u00a37m payoff for his former favourite Rebekah Brooks</a>, the News International chief who presided over News Corp's disgraced UK newspapers.</p> <p>Murdoch used his opening address at the sparsely attended meeting to talk about the hacking scandal. \"As you know, we never thought of ourselves as a conventional company,\" he said. \"We focus on writing our own future, and in doing so we have transformed the media landscape. But that is not to say we have not had mishaps.\" He said the company had \"seized the opportunity to make amends\", pointing out that its stock price had risen 45% since last year's meeting and that the problems at the UK newspaper division had proven to be isolated.</p> <p>News Corp is now planning to split its publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal, Times and Sunday Times, from its TV and film groups such as Twentieth Century Fox and the Fox TV network.</p> <p>\"Notwithstanding our success, our company is undervalued,\" Murdoch said. \"As we head into this future, the company you know will be replaced by two dynamic new ones with separate names, different visions\".</p> <p>Murdoch is planning to be chairman of both companies. He said details of executives and board members will be finalised by the end of this year.</p> <p>Shareholders repeatedly asked him about his dual role, called for clearer oversight and asked about his $22m pay package. But they did not ask about reports that James Murdoch will be put in charge of News Corp's flagship TV assets.</p> <p>Last year a majority of independent shareholders voted for James Murdoch to step down. He was recently heavily criticised by UK media regulator Ofcom for his role in the hacking scandal. After the meeting Julie Tanner, assistant director of socially responsible investing at Christian Brothers investment services, expressed disappointment in Murdoch's responses. Tanner had led the charge for him to step down as chairman.</p> <p>\"He is not in a position to be sending shareholders away,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The majority of independent shareholders voted against five board members last year and three are still there. It's very disappointing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the Afghan war had run for the past 40 years. Imagine 2,000 deaths a year. The enemy remains 400,000-strong, despite 40,000 being taken prisoner annually. The war costs \u00a31bn a month. Casualties vary from time to time, but there is no hope of victory. Were that the case, I suggest public opinion might be exasperated. Parliament might debate the matter. Ministers might review policy. Yet such is Britain's fatuously entitled \"war on drugs\". Each year governments re-legislate their \"war on terror\", despite the minimal threat, but reject any need to revise the <a href=\"http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/faqs/faqpages/what-are-the-uk-drug-laws\" title=\"\">1971 Misuse of Drugs Act</a>. They refuse to see if it is working, and do nothing but waste public money.</p> <p>Home secretaries trumpet idiotic \"drug seizures\". They pass \"awareness\" budgets, arrest and imprison thousands of citizens for drug possession and sale. The war has failed. But it continues to immiserate countless families and wreck countless lives. It is stupid, knee-jerk British government at its worst.</p> <p>There is now a small industry of liberals who spend their time saying so. I am probably one of them, having wasted hours on commissions, inquiries, conferences and lobbies. Worthy charities dole out money for fact-finding trips to California, Switzerland, Portugal and the Netherlands, all with lessons, none of which we learn. The British go abroad, as always, to have their prejudices confirmed. If we were investigating terrorism, the death rate would have ministers racing to the Commons in panic. As it is, the victims of the 1971 act die un-atoned.</p> <p>I sat on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/29/alantravis1\" title=\"\">Lady Runciman's Police Foundation inquiry in 2000</a> which, like her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/decriminalise-drug-use-say-experts?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">\"Runciman Two\"</a> this week, reiterated that criminal law had failed to end drug use or reduce harm. It suggested we go easy on cannabis possession and concentrate on treatment for hard drugs. Prison was the wrong place for users or abusers. We dodged the question of supply, as does every drugs report, because that involves discussing manufacture, money and retail. Liberal Britain has always had a distaste for trade.</p> <p>I hesitate to suggest that Runciman Two is a reprint of Runciman One, but after a decade of inaction I wonder what is different. The police have let up on cannabis possession, as in most countries, largely because they know that the law is unenforceable. This week's report says that government action is immaterial, drug consumption being unaffected by changes in classification, prison sentencing or education. Drug use seems to ebb and flow with price, fashion and, in the case of ecstasy and skunk, perceived harm. None of this stopped the home secretary, Theresa May, beating her chest and howling her rejection of Runciman from the rooftops.</p> <p>Britain on drugs is where China is on hanging, Saudi Arabia on beating, Russia on censorship and the Taliban on girls' education. Drugs policy is the last legislative wilderness where \"here be dragons\", a hangover from days when abortion and homosexuality were illegal and divorce expensive. It petrified home secretaries of left and right alike, Jack Straw and Jacqui Smith as much as Kenneth Clarke and Theresa May. So scared was Tony Blair that Alastair Campbell had to order the smothering of the 2000 Runciman report.</p> <p>Most sane politicians \u2013 including David Cameron \u2013 advocate reform in opposition, and again after leaving power. A phalanx of Latin American ex-presidents are in favour of cocaine legalisation, the so-called \"formers\". Yet fear grips the collective brain when in office. The mere word drugs gives every politician the heebie-jeebies and turns libertarians into control freaks.</p> <p>As Jonathan Haidt has argued in his book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/22/righteous-mind-jonathan-haidt-review\" title=\"\">The Righteous Mind</a>, political attitudes on most things, certainly drugs, are irrational, rooted in tribe and upbringing. Politicians who stuff their brains with alcohol, nicotine and amphetamines view ecstasy, cannabis and cocaine as dangerous exotics, like the black death or yellow peril, imported from dusky parts to corrupt the young. They shudder at decriminalisation, relying instead on their favourite legislative juju \u2013 \"sending a message\" and washing their hands.</p> <p>What should be researched is not drugs policy but drugs politics, the hold that taboo has on those in power, and the thrall that rightwing newspapers have over them. This has nothing to do with public opinion, which is now strongly in favour of reform. Most sensible people find the present regime disastrous and want drugs regulated, rather than the wild west that is the urban drug scene today. It is politicians who think \"soft on drugs\" implies some loss of potency.</p> <p>Just as few recreations are harmless so are few recreational drugs. To imply otherwise is silly. But the sheer longevity of marijuana use has embedded it in youth culture alongside alcohol. The menace to public health comes from the failure of government to legalise, test and regulate supply, which is what it should do for all narcotics. Over-prescribing of benzodiazepines is now far worse, and more dangerous, than the over-prescribing of heroin in the 1960s, which led to its disastrous banning and proliferation. No one is proposing to ban legal drugs today, so why leave illegal drugs, and their users, to the tender mercy of crooks?</p> <p>There is no reason in all this. We are dealing with the darkest of bourgeois taboos. Of all the things on which the world has declared \"war\" in modern times, self-harming substances must be the daftest. Yet the result has been to destroy millions of lives, expend trillions of dollars, and helplessly corrupt sovereign states, from Afghanistan to Colombia. It is the greatest single failure of modern statecraft. It is the dark ages, and we are still in them.</p>",

His manager, Stuart Pearce, confirmed Rose had been racially abused.</p> <p>A statement from the Football Association read: \"The FA condemns both the scenes of racism and the confrontation at the final whistle during which time our players and staff were under extreme provocation. The FA has reported a number of incidents of racism to Uefa following the fixture. These were seemingly aimed at a number of England black players by the crowd. The matter is now with Uefa.\"</p> <p>Pearce told ESPN: \"I think there were one or two racist incidents that came from the crowd and they have been reported to Uefa by ourselves. It is in their hands now; they will have to deal with that.\"</p> <p>After Jack Butland, the England goalkeeper, tried to lead his team-mates off the pitch, Wigley was attacked as he tried to follow down the tunnel. The goalkeeping coach, Martin Thomas, appeared to be headbutted.</p> <p>Pearce told BBC 5 Live: \"Punches headbutts, god knows what, were thrown at the end.\"</p> <p>The Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson said: \"There was a lot of racist abuse out there from the stands and a lot going on after the game. There were also stones, coins and seats getting thrown at us. What happened wasn't nice and is not called for in football.\"</p> <p>There were also reports of intimidation of England Under-21 players by a member of Serbia's backroom staff in the tunnel immediately before the game.</p> <p>Pearce added: \"It is very sad, but we are united as a team and a staff. A lot is happening in our country with regard to stamping out racism and I am very proud of the reaction of our players towards the end.</p> <p>\"It is a real shame because, over two ties, it was a really close game \u2013 two good teams going hammer and tongs at each other.It is just a shame it was soured in the last few minutes of the second leg of the tie. Savo Milosevic, their technical director, has come to our dressing room and apologised for any behaviour that was unsavoury. I never want to see any football matches end like that; this is a sporting arena.\"</p> <p>In 2007 Serbia were fined \u00a316,000 by Uefa for racist chanting from fans aimed at the England Under-21 side during a European Championship match there.</p> <p>This latest incident continued a troubled sequence of racist incidents in football that domestically have included the Luis Su\u00e1rez-Patrice Evra and the Anton Ferdinand-John Terry affairs.</p> <p>Ferdinand, apparently in reaction to the scenes in Serbia, tweeted: \"I wonder if Blatter is gonna say they should just shake hands!??\", a reference to the claim of Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, that any inappropriate remarks or gestures during a game could be forgotten if players shook hands.</p> <p>Paul Ince, who was working as a pundit on ESPN and whose son Thomas set up Wickham's goal, called for Serbia to be hit with a 10-year ban from major tournaments. \"Sepp Blatter and [Uefa's president, Michel] Platini need to look at this. If it was me they [Serbia] would be kicked out for the next five tournaments \u2013 European, World Cups \u2013 but they will get a little ban and that will be it. Things like that are not what we want to see in football \u2013 it takes it back to the dark ages.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If you are black, it is hard to actually keep control of yourself because you are the one having the racist chants. From looking at what we have seen on TV, they have done very well to keep cool heads. It is a shame because tomorrow we will be talking about something we don't want to talk about. What we should be talking about is England qualifying for Israel in 2013.\"</p> <p>Pearce has now overseen an unprecedented four consecutive qualifications for European Under-21 championships. \"The important thing, when the dust settles, is we are going to a championship because we deserved to over two legs,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Our players have put in a lot of hard effort and sweat to get there. There is a real collectiveness here. We will let the authorities deal with this.</p> <p>\"All we know is we have given a good account of ourselves over two matches, we have won nine out of 10 matches in qualification and I am very proud of my team.</p> <p>\"I am very proud of my players and my staff and very proud of the achievement in getting to a fourth tournament in a row.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two sides of the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, were on show at the same time on Tuesday. In the first, Good Dominic announced to MPs that he intends to apply <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-vote-office/October_2012/16-10-12/1.Atttorney-General-Hillsborough.pdf\" title=\"\">to quash the 96 Hillsborough inquests</a> and have them reheld. Result: approval all round as Mr Grieve sprang decisively to the aid of the families whose cause is to expose the truth about how the 96 died. Meanwhile, in the other, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/todays-commons-debates/read/unknown/133/\" title=\"\">while the attorney harvested congratulations from MPs</a> over Hillsborough, Bad Dominic was publishing an abject edict <a href=\"http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/AttorneyGeneralvetoesreleaseofPrinceofWalescorrespondence.aspx\" title=\"\">to veto the release of the Prince of Wales's correspondence with ministers</a> under freedom of information laws. Result: the normally admirable Mr Grieve risked seeming a pusillanimous ministerial jobsworth unwilling to let the public learn the full truth about our foolish and meddling heir to the throne.</p> <p>There is no dispute that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/31/prince-charles-public-duty-private-power?intcmp=239\" title=\"\"> the prince has been bombarding ministers</a> with his self-interested and often reactionary views for years. Even Mr Grieve admits as much <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-vote-office/October_2012/16-10-12/2.Atorney-General-Use-of-the-FoI-Ministerial-veto.pdf\" title=\"\">in his statement</a> confirming that many of the prince's letters to seven departments contained \"particularly frank\" personal views which, if revealed, would have \"undermined his position of political neutrality\". It seems all too clear that the disturbing prospect of a systemic and fundamental abuse of the essentially passive role of the crown in our constitutional monarchical system was too dangerous to contemplate.</p> <p>In his attempt to justify the unjustifiable, Mr Grieve has clutched at a fragile constitutional doctrine and adopted a deeply dubious legal course. The doctrine is that all letters from the prince are part of something called \"preparation for kingship\". This medieval-sounding notion is far too sweeping \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/18/prince-charles-letters-ministers-judges?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">as the courts themselves have found</a>. It is an invented tradition, a conceit devised for the purpose of getting this particular prince off the hook. A moment's thought shows it to be a nonsense. Where is the line drawn if <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19966376\" title=\"\">other lesser royals</a> fire off letters as self-indulgent as the prince's? How long \u2013 five years or 50? \u2013 is a prince deemed to be \"preparing for kingship\"? When, if ever, are preparations complete? Mr Grieve's doctrine seems to imply that writing foolish letters to ministers is a princely duty. This merely pours petrol on the flames.</p> <p>The dubious legal course is the claim that such matters are protected under the FoI laws. This is highly questionable. <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/DepositedPapers/Files/DEP2012-1316/HMGVetoPolicy4.pdf\" title=\"\">The law allows ministers to veto</a> the release of documents in exceptional cases, mainly where cabinet government is deemed under threat. But it is neither clear nor reasonable that the law extends to a case like this \u2013 the matter should be tested. Ministers pretend their concern is to protect the proper training of a good and useful prince, when in fact it is primarily to cover up for the constitutionally dubious blunderings of an indulged and even dangerous dauphin.</p>",

But in a promised overhaul of the extradition laws that accompanied the decision, May indicated that future home secretaries would be stripped of the very power that she had used to save the computer hacker.</p> <p>McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, said May had been \"incredibly brave\" to \"stand up\" to the Americans. She said she was overwhelmed after the \"emotional rollercoaster\" the family had been through in the past 10 years.</p> <p>McKinnon, from Wood Green, north London, could not speak when he first heard the decision but then cried and hugged his mother.</p> <p>\"He felt like he was a dead person,\" Sharp said. \"He had no job, he didn't go on holiday&#xa0;\u2026 he felt worthless&#xa0;\u2026 Thank you, Theresa May, from the bottom of my heart \u2013 I always knew you had the strength and courage to do the right thing.\"</p> <p>McKinnon's MP, David Burrowes, who had threatened to resign from the government if the extradition went ahead, said May had saved McKinnon's life: \"Today is a victory for compassion and the keeping of pre-election promises.\"</p> <p>McKinnon was first indicted by an American grand jury in November 2002 for hacking into US military computers, including the Pentagon and Nasa, from his north London bedroom while he was looking for UFOs. He could have faced a prison sentence of up 70 years under US law.</p> <p>The extradition order against McKinnon has been withdrawn and it will now be for the director of public prosecutions to decide whether he should be prosecuted in Britain.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the state department, Victoria Nuland, said: \"The United States is disappointed by the decision to deny Gary McKinnon's extradition to face long overdue justice in the United States. We are examining the details of the decision.\"</p> <p>The US authorities have described McKinnon's actions as the \"biggest military computer hack of all time\". The Washington Post observed that the decision \"could ignite tensions in an otherwise close transatlantic relationship\", while the former White House counsel Douglas McNabb said the US attorney's office would be furious.</p> <p>The decision, which is the first time an extradition has been halted under the 2003 US-UK treaty, prompted immediate delight from those who campaigned to prevent McKinnon's removal and politicians from all parties.</p> <p>Nick Clegg said he wanted to pay tribute to Sharp's determination to speak up for her son over 10 years. \"I've long argued that I think it would have been wrong to send someone as vulnerable as Gary McKinnon to the United States and also I'm delighted that the home secretary has set out some plans about how we rebalance the extradition arrangements between the UK and the USA,\" the Liberal Democrat leader said.</p> <p>The only discordant note came from the former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson, who said the hacker's human rights case had been rejected by judges in 2009 and claimed May had made the decision \"in her party's best interest; it is not in the best interests of the country\". He disclosed that the US authorities had been prepared to allow McKinnon to serve his sentence in a British prison when Johnson rejected McKinnon's earlier appeals.</p> <p>Other MPs and campaigners expressed the hope that May would now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/16/richard-odwyer-supporters-gary-mckinnon\" title=\"\">use her discretion to halt the extradition of British student Richard O'Dwyer</a>, who is accused of infringing US copyright laws. \"Home secretaries have to make these decisions,\" said Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee. \"We cannot hand all the decisions to the judges to make on our behalf.\"</p> <p>The home secretary told MPs that the treaty, which has been criticised as \"lop-sided\", was \"broadly sound\". But she made an important concession to critics, announcing that a \"forum bar\" would be introduced.</p> <p>This will give a British court the power to bar prosecution overseas if it believes it will be fairer for the accused to face a British trial. This change may, however, take some time to come into effect as, rather than implementing an existing clause in the 2003 Extradition Act, May will introduce fresh legislation to overcome problems of delay and possible \"satellite litigation\".</p> <p>She confirmed to MPs her intention to scrap the home secretary's discretion under the Human Rights Act that enabled her to prevent McKinnon's extradition. \"Matters such as representations on human rights grounds should, in future, be considered by the high court rather than the home secretary.</p> <p>This change, which will significantly reduce delays in certain cases, will require primary legislation.\"</p> <p>She opened the door for more wide-ranging reform of the extradition process to reduce delays of up to 14 years by looking again at the provision of legal aid for terror suspects in national security cases and introducing a permission stage for appeals to UK courts.</p> <p>The former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell told May the treaty still needed reform, in particular the standard of proof required. He hoped that no British citizen would be sent to the US unless there was \"probable cause\".</p> <p>The Liberty director, Shami Chakrabarti, welcomed the McKinnon decision. \"This is a great day for rights, freedoms and justice in the United Kingdom,\" she said. \"The home secretary has spared this vulnerable man the cruelty of being sent to the US and accepted Liberty's longstanding argument for change to our rotten extradition laws.\"</p> <p>But the family of Babar Ahmad, who along with Talha Ahsan was deported two weeks ago to the US on terrorism charges, accused the legal system of double standards. \"We strongly welcome the decision not to extradite Gary McKinnon.

  "<p>West African troops are gearing up for a military intervention in Mali after the government said it will meet a United Nations security council deadline to begin recapturing the country's north from al-Qaida-linked insurgents.</p> <p>The government said a plan for military action by its army and the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) would be ready within 45 days. One senior security official told the Guardian he believed plans for the offensive would break the \"vicious cycle\" that has seen months of inaction and a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in the north since rebels seized key towns following a 22 March coup.</p> <p>\"The government does not have one single representative in northern Mali, we have absolutely no control of the territory,\" the source said.</p> <p>\"But the UN security council has given 45 days to Ecowas and Mali to present a plan for military action to recapture the north and we are confident that this will be enough time.</p> <p>\"Resolving this crisis is a political issue and it is never easy to have a consensus on this kind of thing. It is even not easy to get troops from many countries together in a short time.</p> <p>\"The problem has been that Ecowas does not have the means to act without the international community's help, but the international community has hesitated, wanting Ecowas to take the lead. Now I think we have broken this deadlock.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10789.doc.htm\" title=\"\">UN resolution</a> followed months of negotiations between Ecowas, the African Union (AU) and Mali's unpopular transitional government, which took over from a military junta that toppled the previous civilian government in March and which is supposed to hold elections by 13 April next year. The resolution also called for assistance for Ecowas troops, imposed targeted sanctions against al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and supported a negotiation process with rebel groups.</p> <p>On Tuesday the French defence minister said military action in Mali was imminent. \"It's a matter of weeks; not months, weeks,\" Jean-Yves le Drian told France 2 television.</p> <p>\"A number of groups, hundreds of rebels, fundamentalists and those involved in trafficking arms, drugs and humans\" had \"sliced Mali in two\", he said, describing the arid north as \"a terrorist sanctuary\".</p> <p>France and other foreign powers, including the European Union and the Africa Command, which co-ordinates US military activity in Africa, have been keen to downplay the question of any direct use of their forces in Mali, stressing instead logistical assistance.</p> <p>On Monday, EU foreign ministers agreed to support Mali's struggling army, which one official described as \"poorly trained, badly equipped and poorly disciplined\".</p> <p>Their meeting preceded that of the Support and Follow-up Group on Mali \u2013 made up of the AU, UN and Ecowas \u2013 to flesh out a political and military strategy to end the crisis.</p> <p>However if Mali meets the 45-day deadline, a second UN resolution is required before troops can be deployed.</p> <p>Experts say questions remain about the role of non-Ecowas neighbouring countries, especially Mauritania, which has launched its own military intervention against al-Qaida, and Algeria, which is becoming a focal point for tackling instability in Mali and whose 800 mile desert border with Mali is seen as a major route for rebels smuggling weapons and resources into the country. Both countries held talks recently with the Africa Command head, General Carter Ham, to discuss military intervention.</p> <p>\"Algeria thinks of the Malian Sahara in the way that Pakistan thinks of Afghanistan \u2013 as their backyard,\" said Gregory Mann, an expert on Mali from Columbia University, New York. \"They are not going to accept being marginalised in discussions, but questions still remain as to whether Algeria will give covert backing to an intervention.\"</p> <p>Reports of atrocities continue to come from the north, which was initially seized by Tuareg rebels but is now in the control of Islamic extremists from foreign countries who have imposed sharia law. About a third of the area's population has fled and there are about 100,000 refugees in Burkina Faso, 100,000 in Mauritania, 30,000 in Algeria and 40,000 in Niger.</p> <p>Last week a senior UN official reported that rebels were paying families around $600 (\u00a3370) to enlist their children to fight and build improvised explosive devices, and that forced marriages were taking place in return for cash.</p> <p>\"Human rights violations are becoming more systematic, relating to the takeover of the radical Islamists,\" said the UN assistant secretary general for human rights, Ivan Simonovic. \"They have now imposed an extremist version of sharia, so the population is suffering a number of human rights violations, particularly targeted at women.\"</p> <p>The security council has called for an immediate end to targeted attacks on civilians, sexual violence, the recruitment of child soldiers and forced displacements.</p>",
  "<p>We are all told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day \u2013 and now neuroscientists are starting to understand why. Skipping the first meal of the day not only means you eat more at lunch, research has found, but also means your brain is primed to seek out unhealthier, higher-calorie foods.</p> <p>Dieters who skip meals often end up gaining weight over the long term, but why this happens is not well understood. <a href=\"http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/tony.goldstone/\" title=\"Imperial: Tony Goldstone\">Tony Goldstone</a>, of the MRC Clinical Science Centre at Imperial College London, scanned the brains of people who skipped meals and found mechanisms at work that could help explain the conundrum.</p> <p>Prolonged fasting of any kind seemed to prime certain brain regions to gravitate towards higher-calorie foods when the person did eventually find a meal. \"That makes evolutionary sense if you're in a negative energy-balance situation,\" he said. \"You're not going to waste your time going for lettuce.\" He will present <a href=\"http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=ad6ab60f-ef54-429c-b9a6-6aecaac4bc4d&amp;cKey=d099c6c0-159b-48f6-934f-46e4e3da4a61&amp;mKey={70007181-01C9-4DE9-A0A2-EEBFA14CD9F1}\" title=\"Lack of modulation of brain resting state networks by fasting and ghrelin in humans \">the results of his study</a> on Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in New Orleans.</p> <p>In the experiment, Goldstone scanned the brains of 21 men and women, all around the age of 25, on two separate days while they were shown pictures of food and asked to rate how appealing they found everything from chocolate and pizzas to vegetables and fish. On one of the days, the volunteers skipped breakfast before their scans; on the other, they were given a 750-calorie breakfast of cereals, bread and jam an hour beforehand. After the scans on both days, the volunteers were given lunch, where they could eat as much as they liked.</p> <p>\"Not surprisingly, when they are fasted they are hungry and they rate the high-calorie foods as more appealing than when they are fed,\" said Goldstone. \"For low-calorie foods, the effect is not as marked. When they come out of the scanner, they are given lunch and they eat more when they haven't had breakfast.\"</p> <p>When the volunteers had skipped breakfast, they ate around 20% more at lunch, compared with days when they had eaten a normal breakfast. Their brain scans also showed that activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, which is just above the eyes, was especially responsive to high-calorie foods. \"We believe that bit encodes the value of rewards \u2013 how rewarding, how pleasant, how tasty something is. Not just food but other rewards seem to be signalled there in the brain,\" said Goldstone.</p> <p>The more you like the food you're eating, the more active the orbitofrontal cortex becomes, and when people are asked to suppress their desire for tasty foods, its activity drops.</p> <p>The changing activity in this brain region could also explain why different methods of weight-control surgery work to differing degrees.</p> <p>Gastric bypass surgery, for example, involves sealing off parts of a person's gut so that they end up with a smaller stomach, and this produces an average of 20-25% weight loss. In gastric band surgery, doctors tie a band around the gut, which they gradually inflate over the course of a few weeks. This provides, on average, a 15-20% weight loss. \"People describe to us that, after gastric bypass, they really don't crave high-calorie foods at all,\" said Goldstone. \"The banding people say: 'I'm not hungry but I do still like those [high-calorie] foods.'\"</p> <p>His research team carried out brain-scanning studies on people who had undergone gastric surgery and found that the orbitofrontal cortex activity was less in the people who had had bypass surgery, compared with the banding. \"One of the reasons we think people do better after bypass is that you alter the craving for high-calorie foods, which is mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex,\" said Goldstone. \"We think that is possibly mediated by hormone changes and possibly also they get a little bit ill when they eat the high-calorie foods and they learn that they feel sick and so they avoid those foods.\"</p>",

  "<p>In 2001, Gary McKinnon was an unknown computer nerd hunched over a screen in a north London bedroom, scrolling through US defence sites for information about UFOs. On Tuesday, the 46-year-old, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, was at the centre of a political and diplomatic storm that spans the Atlantic and has rewritten the law on extradition.</p> <p>So overwhelmed was McKinnon by the news that he would not be deported for trial in the US, he did not appear for his own lawyers' press conference. The longer his extradition ordeal has ground on, the more his condition has deteriorated.</p> <p>One of McKinnon's multiple misfortunes was to indulge in hacking at a time when security on US military sites was relatively unsophisticated but US prosecutors were extremely sensitive to online penetration. US lawyers accused him of committing \"the biggest military computer hack of all time\". Post 9/11, his intrusions were viewed with even more concern.</p> <p>What McKinnon had done was trawl through Nasa and other defence websites, such as the US naval weapons station Earle in New Jersey, occasionally leaving messages such as \"your security is crap\".</p> <p>The US authorities accused him of deliberately deleting information, shutting down their military networks in the Washington district, and copying sensitive data.</p> <p>McKinnon was initially indicted by a federal grand jury in November 2002 on seven charges of computer-related crime. By then he had already been interviewed by Scotland Yard's national hi-tech crime unit and had his computer seized.</p> <p>In 2004, the US government submitted a request for his extradition to face charges. He was arrested in March the next year on a warrant issued by Bow Street magistrates court, which at that time dealt with extradition hearings.</p> <p>John Reid, then home secretary, signed an order for his removal in July 2006, initiating an ever-more-convoluted legal saga that highlighted emerging concerns about the integrity and justice of the UK's extradition procedures. McKinnon has been on bail during much of the time as the judicial process intensified. In 2008, evidence that he had Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism, was first presented to the courts.</p> <p>Appeals continued through the House of Lords. His lawyers launched a judicial review of the CPS 's refusal to prosecute him in the UK. The Commons home affairs select committee called for a \"comprehensive review\" of the US/UK extradition treaty. In 2009, the then leader of the opposition, David Cameron, described McKinnon as \"a vulnerable young man and I see no compassion in sending him thousands of miles away from his home and loved ones to face trial\".</p> <p>Janis Sharp, McKinnon's mother, emerged as a redoubtable campaigner on his behalf, standing in Blackburn against Jack Straw in the 2010 general election. She condemned Straw for signing the extradition treaty with Washington. Sharp received 173 votes.</p> <p>In office, the coalition government did not rush to resolve McKinnon's case. A detailed review of extradition procedures by the appeal judge Sir Scott Baker dismayed campaigners last year when it found that the treaty between the US and UK was balanced and fair.</p> <p>But fresh evidence of McKinnon's increasingly suicidal frame of mind, presented this autumn, finally enabled the home secretary, Theresa May, to rule that sending him overseas to face trial would breach his human rights. He would be likely to kill himself if extradited, she told the Commons.</p> <p>At the press conference convened after the announcement, Sharp said the decade-long fight had been an \"emotional rollercoaster\". Her son, she said, couldn't speak when he heard the news. \"We hugged and he cried.\" In recent months, she explained, \"he felt as if he were dead. He had no job. He had no children. He felt he was useless \u2026 He's lost 10 years of his life, but if this happens as well, we can deal with that.\"</p> <p>Edward Fitzgerald QC, who represented McKinnon, praised May for using the Human Rights Act to halt the extradition. \"It was only thanks to the Human Rights Act that she had the power to stop this extradition,\" he said.</p> <p>David Burrowes, McKinnon's MP, said: \"It's a life that's been given back to Gary in a long dark tunnel that is 10 years. This must never happen again.\"</p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the civil rights group Liberty,, said: \"This is a great day for rights, freedoms and justice in the United Kingdom.\" She cautioned, however, that the very discretion May had used as home secretary to prevent McKinnon's removal would disappear under proposed reforms.</p> <p>It will now be for the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, to decide whether McKinnon should face charges in the UK. His solicitor, Karen Todner, said it was \"a great day for British justice\" and hoped that the DPP \"might consider that Gary has suffered enough\".</p>",
  "<p>The cell biologist Keith Campbell, who has been&#xa0;found dead at the age of 58, played a&#xa0;leading role in making possible the birth of Dolly the cloned sheep. This breakthrough opened up revolutionary new opportunities in regenerative medicine by demonstrating that the future of cells is not rigidly fixed, but can be changed from one tissue type to another.</p> <p>In 1995, Campbell's research at the <a href=\"http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/news/2012/10/12/dolly-scientist-dies/\" title=\"Roslin Institute website\">Roslin Institute</a>, Edinburgh University, led to the birth of Megan and Morag, two Welsh mountain sheep. These were the first mammals to be cloned from cultured cells at an early stage of specialisation, or \"differentiation\". The following year, these experiments were extended to produce Dolly, the first mammal cloned from a somatic cell \u2013 one from a part of the body, in this case the breast \u2013 taken from an adult.</p> <p>The aims of this programme were to&#xa0;understand the basic mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation and&#xa0;to provide a means for the precise genetic modification of farm-animal species. The first of Campbell's key insights was that it is necessary to coordinate the cell cycles of the donor cell and recipient egg in order for the cloned embryo to develop normally. These mechanisms regulate replication of DNA and cell division. Second, it seemed that \"reprogramming\" of gene function in&#xa0;the transferred nucleus is more accurate&#xa0;if the donor cell is induced to&#xa0;hibernate before transfer. This was&#xa0;achieved routinely by depriving the&#xa0;cell&#xa0;of nutrients.</p> <p>In collaboration with PPL Therapeutics, the company that was spun out from the Roslin Institute, the cloning procedure was used to produce a further ewe in 1997. Polly was the first mammal to be both created in culture by nuclear transfer and also transgenic, with material introduced from another organism, in this case human, so that it could produce a blood-clotting protein.</p> <p>That year Campbell left the Roslin to&#xa0;become head of embryology at PPL. He wanted to accelerate the benefits of&#xa0;transgenic technology in human medicine, particularly by producing cloned pigs for xenotransplantation \u2013 the transplantation of tissues and organs from one species to another. In&#xa0;1999 came the first gene-targeted sheep, Cupid and Diana, showing that it&#xa0;was possible to delete and insert genes, and then, in 2000, the first pigs&#xa0;cloned from somatic cells.</p> <p>In late 1999, Campbell had left PPL to&#xa0;become professor of animal development at <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2012/october/keith-campbell.aspx\" title=\"Nottingham University website\">Nottingham University</a>. There he continued his research into the&#xa0;basic mechanisms underlying development and differentiation in order to enhance breeding and maintain food security. In 2008 he shared the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&amp;twoid=49&amp;threeid=56&amp;fourid=72&amp;fiveid=15\" title=\"Autobiography on the Shaw prize website\">Shaw prize</a> for medicine and life sciences with Shinya Yamanaka, the Japanese stem-cell researcher made a Nobel laureate this month, and myself.</p> <p>Born in Birmingham to an English mother and Scottish father, Campbell started his education in Perth. When he&#xa0;was eight, his family returned to Birmingham, where he went to King Edward VI grammar school for boys. After qualifying as a laboratory technologist specialising in medical microbiology at Selly Oak hospital, he gained a BSc in microbiology at Queen Elizabeth College, now part of King's College London.</p> <p>Following laboratory work in Yemen and a project to eradicate Dutch elm disease in West Sussex, Campbell joined the Marie Curie Research Institute, in Surrey. Its research into the underlying causes and mechanisms of cancer encouraged his interests in cellular growth and differentiation, and in 1983 it awarded him a scholarship that took him to Sussex University. There he studied the mechanisms that control the&#xa0;segregation of genetic material during the development of amphibian eggs and early embryos, and during cell&#xa0;growth and division in yeast. He&#xa0;was&#xa0;awarded a DPhil.</p> <p>A return to Scotland for two brief postdoctoral posts enabled him to pursue his love of hillwalking and mountain biking. In 1991 he joined the&#xa0;Roslin, where I was a principal investigator, and his research blossomed.</p> <p>Campbell applied his experience of the regulation of the cell cycle to the work we were doing on the production of mammalian embryos by nuclear transfer. Much of this work was presented at the annual meetings of the <a href=\"http://www.iets.org/index.asp?autotry=true&amp;ULnotkn=true\" title=\"IETS website\">International Embryo Transfer Society</a>, where he will be remembered as an enthusiastic participant in discussions lasting late into the night. Always cheerful and friendly \u2013 with a strong distaste for bureaucracy \u2013 he will be sorely missed.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Kathy, and&#xa0;two daughters, Claire and Lauren, by his former partner, Ange Mills.</p> <p>\u2022 Keith Henry Stockman Campbell, cell&#xa0;biologist, born 23 May 1954; died 5&#xa0;October 2012</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 January 2013.

  "<p>The outsourcing of individual council services to large private corporate companies such as Capita, Serco and BT has been common practice across local government for four decades.

  "<p>Last week, Lord McNally told a Legal Aid Practitioners Group conference that \"it is time to move on from LASPO\". He was referring to the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/notes/division/5/5/13/1\" title=\"\">Legal Aid Sentencing and Prevention of Offenders Act 2012</a>. LASPO's cuts to applicants' scope and eligibility come into force in April next year: cuts to lawyers' remuneration have begun and there is more to follow. McNally is fed up with people still whingeing about cuts that are, as far as ministers are concerned, done and dusted.</p> <p>McNally's impatience is misplaced. Government policy on legal aid now amounts essentially to one aim: the delivery of the lowest level of service that will comply with our minimum obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights at the least possible cost.</p> <p>We cannot move on from LASPO until ministers have absorbed the enormity of the cuts that they are implementing. They are so great that they demand a reformulation of policy. This will not be easy. There will be no magic answer, to be produced like a rabbit out of a hat. We will not saved by one bold proposal. The answer must be a completely different approach.</p> <p>Legal aid needs a more coherent policy objective. And that needs to be something better than an anodyne version of the widely used one of providing \"access to justice\". This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/06/access-to-justice-legal-aid-cuts\" title=\"\">phrase</a> has become totally debased. After all, Ken Clarke asserted it as \"the hallmark of a civilised society\" even as he implemented his cuts package. The basic policy goal surely has to be that anyone in society, rich or poor, is entitled to expect that any dispute is settled on its own intrinsic legal merit and not by the extraneous issue of the different resources of the parties.</p> <p>We can call this equal justice under the law. This might sound vaguely familiar to those who have travelled to the United States. It is pretty much what is engraved on the architrave of the US supreme court building. This heralds \"equal justice under law\". It is a worthy ideal for all that the US is certainly not a good example of its achievement. But that does not invalidate it as a worthwhile goal of policy. To quote the US supreme court itself in the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_v._Illinois\" title=\"\">Griffin v. Illinois</a>, \"there can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has\".</p> <p>A true access to justice approach will tax ministers to the limit and beyond. This is why Lord McNally cannot be allowed to move on too quickly. We need the kind of holistic approach to policy which is much praised but little followed. We cannot now afford to avoid grasping a difficult nettle. Our task is to maximise what we can get for the total amount of money that we spend on justice \u2014 including but not limited to, legal aid. As a very practical matter, this is probably just not possible under our current governmental arrangements. We need one department and one budget.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice should pass prisons back to the Home Office where they belong. The justice budget for courts, judges, legal aid and possibly prosecution should be considered as one. Savings on courts should be able to be spent on legal aid and vice versa. The lord chancellor should be firmly concerned with developing justice policy and managing the interface between the government and the judiciary.</p> <p>The current model of legal aid as stand-alone provision is unsustainable. It must be reconceived as only one of a set of linked policies and provision \u2013 including reform of substantive law, methods of adjudication, the provision of non-legal assistance. Improve a complicated law \u2013 such as that on the defences to murder \u2013 and you can save on legal aid. Penalise government departments which don't care about tribunal decisions against them and you can meet the costs of the adjudication.</p> <p>Such an access to justice approach would build up from substantive law through the availability of information and end with the funding of lawyers \u2013 not the other way round. So, let us ensure that everyone has access to a legal version of NHS Direct. We may not be able to afford advice but we could provide information.</p> <p>So, no, Lord McNally. It is not the time to move on from LASPO. We know that it implements cuts that will be experienced as disastrous by about half a million very poor people a year. There is more for us all to do to make these cuts at all acceptable.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract of Roger Smith's </em><a href=\"http://www.justice.org.uk/events.php/45/justice-tom-sargant-memorial-annual-lecture-2012\" title=\"\"><em>Tom Sargant JUSTICE annual lecture</em></a><em> given on Tuesday evening</em></p>",
  "<p>Over the weekend, we learned that the Romney and Obama campaigns were extremely concerned that Candy Crowley of CNN, the moderator for Tuesday's debate, might try to commit journalism. Neither side wanted <em>that</em>. </p> <p>But there's not much they can do about it. Because they're not in charge. Of course, neither is she. In fact, no one is really in charge of the presidential debates. The situation is in charge. That's about all you can say.</p> <p>Let me explain.</p> <p>Mark Halperin of Time magazine <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/14/moderator-role-under-scrutiny-before-the-debate/\">broke the story</a> on Sunday. Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/10/report-obama-romney-camps-send-letter-to-debates-commission-138421.html#.UHuPBRa7u1Q.twitter\">confirmed</a> it with their sources. Both campaigns had complained to the Commission on Public Debates, the organizer of Tuesday's townhall-style event, after Crowley<a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/191561/candidates-debates-commission-upset-candy-crowley-may-ask-follow-up-questions-tuesday/\"> made it clear</a> in interviews that she would be engaging in certain normal journalistic behaviors. These included: pressing for answers, following up if needed and moving the candidates off their stump speeches and talking points.</p> <p>The lawyers for Romney and the lawyers for Obama thought they had an agreement: the moderators would not be doing any of that. And in a sense they were right. They <em>did</em> have an agreement. Crowley <em>was</em> ignoring parts of it. Halperin had been leaked a copy of the document that is negotiated between the two campaigns, specifying the rules for the four presidential debates. For example: The candidates can't bring notes with them, but they can take notes. (Good rule.) No shout-outs to anyone in the audience, except your family. (Good rule.) Then there's this one:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In managing the two-minute comment periods, the moderator will not rephrase the question or open a new topic\u2026 The moderator <strong>will not ask follow-up questions or comment</strong> on either the questions asked by the audience or the answers of the candidates during the debate<strong> or otherwise intervene in the debate</strong> except to acknowledge the questioners from the audience or enforce the time limits, and invite candidate comments during the two-minute response period.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>(My bold.) In other words: <em>Just hold the mic and keep the clock, Candy</em>. Good rule?</p> <p>On that we have no consensus. But the strange thing is that our complete lack of consensus has been built into the system. That's why we keep arguing about it. It can sound arcane, like a dispute over procedure, with big egos getting in the way. But what we're really arguing about is this: In a real debate, in a grown-up world, in the political and media systems we actually have, does presidential power need an interlocutor to reveal itself? Or can it speak <em>for</em> itself and by taking responsibility \u2013 stepping up to the plate, under pressure \u2013 make itself sufficiently clear?</p> <p>In the first debate, Jim Lehrer of PBS tried <a href=\"http://pressthink.org/2012/10/the-vanishing-moderator-jim-lehrer-answers-your-questions-about-his-part-in-the-first-debate/\">the Vanishing Moderator method</a>. That's my term for it. He tossed out some big topic areas and got out of the way. (Not <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/10/04/jim_lehrer_vs_silentjimlehrer_a_closer_look_at_the_pbs_newshour_anchor_s_debate_performance_.html\">completely</a>, though.) Explaining himself afterwards, he said that the he and the commission wanted to push the form, try something new. \"Get out of the way\" means let the candidates confront each other. You are <em>not</em> their interlocutor. They do that for each other. You start things rolling, keep time, and invite them into the issues. You try to be dull (Jim Lehrer: \"What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\") so that they can shine. It's up to them to reveal themselves, and to \"check\" each other. If they choose not to, viewers will judge them for their passivity under pressure.</p> <p>Lehrer declared himself, proudly, a debate-moderator minimalist.</p> <p>In the vice-presidential debate, Martha Raddatz said something like this back: Thank you for your service, Jim Lehrer! I will <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/scott-herhold/ci_21757780/forceful-raddatz-draws-praise-moderator\">not be taking your approach</a>. I am the interlocutor tonight. I represent the audience's interest in getting better answers. And <a href=\"http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/11/in-praise-of-martha-raddatz/?pagewanted=all\">I will intervene</a> when needed. Politely, of course! And if I don't hear any specifics, I will press the candidates to provide them. I am also a reporter myself, and will bring my knowledge to the table when I ask my questions. I think the people watching this understand very well why I am here, so abuse me at your peril. Are you ready, candidates?</p> <p>To Jim Lehrer's minimalism and Martha Raddatz's vitalism, Candy Crowley has to bring something different: a kind of ventriloquism. The debate she will moderate Tuesday night is described in the agreement between the campaigns as the \"audience participation ('Town Hall') format\". The questions originate not with the moderator but with a <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/attitude-check/debate-drawing-town-hall-audience\">specially selected</a> group of very, very undecided voters \u2013 as picked by Gallup. Crowley meets with them beforehand, finds out what they want to ask, and chooses the few she is going to call on, indirectly selecting the questions but also picking the characters who will step to the microphone and speak. Her participation takes place through their (closely managed) participation. She amplifies their intent.</p> <p>Her authority is also mixed up with theirs. Each person called on is a potential stand-in for the frustrated American voter. Televisually, Crowley equalizes the inherent power difference between standing candidates for president and the undecided voters rising to ask their questions. She can sharpen a question or follow up when it isn't answered, advocating for the questioner's right to hear straight talk from the candidates. It doesn't matter what the agreement signed by the candidates' lawyers says. Crowley isn't a party to it, she didn't sign, and anyway the parties aren't in charge.</p> <p>The debates in their current form are a temporary alliance among three players: the campaigns of the major-party candidates for president, the Commission on Presidential Debates and the journalists who are chosen to moderate and maintain order. Each draws power from a different source. The campaigns are the exclusive agents for the two main characters in the drama; without them there is nothing. The commission represents in institutional form the expectation Americans voters now have that the nominees for president will meet face to face and argue their respective cases. This is a potent force. It's virtually impossible for the candidates to refuse, although nothing in election law prevents it. The journalists who moderate have power because once the cameras come on and the debate begins, no one is telling them what to say.</p> <p>Each player is also weak, in its way. The campaigns are weak because of the inherent risk in submitting to questions on live television before an audience of 50 to 60 million. No matter how hard the candidates prepare, there is no way to prevent something unexpected from happening. And the risk of catastrophic failure is real, as Texas governor Rick Perry learned during the primary season. Yet they have to participate.</p> <p>The commission's weakness is structural: it has no constitutional or statutory right to put on the debates and no base of power independent of the two major parties, which created it in 1987. The moderators are weak because no one elected them, everyone can criticize them, and they're supposed to be completely upstaged by the candidates. \"It's not about the moderator!\" is something on which everyone agrees. This constrains their every move. But not completely.</p> <p>The result is that no one is fully in charge of Tuesday night's debate. But this is too scary for such high stakes. So rules are invented, like the ones that were leaked to Mark Halperin. In reality, the rules don't describe what happens because the real limits are audience expectations, which bear down on everyone in the hall with greater force than any timekeeper. Do we expect power to reveal itself without an interlocutor? If more and more of us do, pressure will build for the Vanishing Moderator. But we aren't there yet. Lack of consensus reigns.</p> <p>After he drew criticism for light questioning, Jim Lehrer wanted to explain better his approach. \"I was not there to question people,\" he said. \"I was there to allow the candidates to question each other.\" But the <a href=\" http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">agreement signed by the two campaigns</a> says, flat out: \"The candidates may not ask each other direct questions during any of the four debates.\"</p> <p>He did it anyway, because he could. The rules aren't going to help us, people. The Great Commission is powerless to decide. Despite all precautions the moderator and the candidates are always alive in unknown territory when the debate broadcast starts. This freaks everyone out, but I say let freedom ring.</p>",
  "<p>Google's changes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/15/google-privacy-policy\" title=\"\">its privacy policies</a> have been criticised by 30 European data protection commissioners for resulting in 'uncontrolled' use of personal data without individual's clear consent, relating to their use of YouTube and Gmail.</p> <p>The commissioners told Google on Tuesday to give people more detailed control over personal data, and said the changes the search giant introduced in March amounted to breaking European data protection law, because the company was storing without consent cookies and data about sites people visited for between 18 months and two years.</p> <p>The French data protection commissioner, the CNIL, led the inquiry and said that Google in effect let users pick and choose how their data was used among different services such as Gmail, Youtube and Google+ \u2013 a dramatic rewrite of the single privacy policy Google introduced in March.</p> <p>CNIL's demand stops short of demanding a wholesale rollback of the changes introduced in March, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/01/google-privacy-policy-analysis\" title=\"\">Google unified its privacy policies \u2013 and data</a> \u2013 from about 60 services into a single data store.</p> <p>Google said it would consider its next steps, but said it had not broken the law. Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel said in a statement: \"We have received the report and are reviewing it now. Our new privacy policy demonstrates our long-standing commitment to protecting our users' information and creating great products. We are confident that our privacy notices respect European law.\"</p> <p>Google's latest privacy policy means that users get a simpler experience when signing up for a new Google-owned service. But it also means that Google can build up a more comprehensive picture of the user for advertising \u2013 for example, monitoring a person's use of YouTube to help better target adverts within Gmail.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/googles-new-privacy-policy-incomplete-information-and-uncontrolled-combination-of-data-across-ser/\" title=\"\">CNIL's press release</a> is highly critical of Google, noting that it \"provides insufficient information to its users on its personal data processing operations\", doesn't tell people how long data will be held, and allows \"uncontrolled\" combination of data across its service.</p> <p>The CNIL notes that for Google users, merely visiting a site which displays one of its \"+1\" buttons is recorded and kept for at least 18 months and can be associated with other data from other Google services. Data collected via a DoubleClick ad cookie \u2013 which is then associated with a unique identifying number \u2013 is stored by Google for two years, and can be renewed without consultation.</p> <p>CNIL also criticised the company for being unco-operative in its responses to queries from the commissioners. \"Google did not provide satisfactory answers on key issues such as the description of its personal data processing operations, or the precise list of the 60+ product-specific privacy policies that have been merged in the new policy,\" the CNIL said.</p> <p>The CNIL report was applauded by privacy groups, though the US search company remained unruffled. Sources close to Google indicated that the CNIL report mostly outlined actions that the search giant \"should\" carry out rather than that it \"must\" carry out, which is being interpreted as light-touch regulation rather than full-on confrontation.</p> <p>But the CNIL may be biding its time. The UK Information Commissioner's Office said that it would wait for Google's response to the report before deciding what to do next. Bradley Shears, a US lawyer who has watched the process unfold, said: \"It appears that the CNIL is providing Google one last opportunity to take the appropriate actions necessary to properly address its concerns before going down the litigation route.\"</p> <p>Marc Dautlich, a partner specialising in data protection law at Pinsent Masons in London, said: \"If Google's get-out is that it's only being told 'should' rather than 'must', then it becomes a question of trust. How does a company purport to be transparent and trusted if they're put to the test and use a legal nicety to avoid it?\"</p> <p>There is no set timetable for a response from Google.</p> <p>The CNIL wants Google to give users the chance to decide when their data is combined into services, to give better control over the combination of data. The regulators also want to centralise the change to opt out of use, decide which services their data goes into, and change its tools so that data is only used for the intended purpose \u2013 separate those used, say, for security from advertising.</p> <p>The CNIL led the group of 30 data protection commissioners from across the EU, who began examining Google's proposed changes to its privacy policies in February. The company had said in January that it would alter them from the start of March, and went ahead with the changes despite requests from the CNIL to delay them, and warnings from senior European Commission officials that they could be illegal.</p> <p>The CNIL has now called on Google to adhere to the EU's data protection principles. \"European Data Protection legislation provides a precise framework for personal data processing operations,\" the CNIL said. \"Google must have a legal basis to perform the combination of data of each of these purposes and data collection must also remain proportionate to the purposes pursued. However, for some of these purposes including advertising, the processing does not rely on consent, on Google's legitimate interests, nor on the performance of a contract.\"</p> <p>Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \"Consumers have been kept in the dark about how much data Google collects and what happens to that data, and Google's new privacy policy only further disguised what really happens when you use their services.</p> <p>Pickles added: \"It's absolutely right that European regulators focus on ensuring people know what data is being collected and how it is being used. Unless people are aware just how much of their behaviour is being monitored and recorded it is impossible to make an informed choice about using services. This ruling is an important step to putting consumers in control of their personal information and ensuring that companies like Google are not able to easily disregard people's privacy in pursuit of more information and greater profits.\"</p> <p>Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"It's good to see European data protection authorities take action so that users gain control of their data. This must be backed by strong new data protection powers, for fines based on turnover, and rights to retrieve and to delete your data.\"</p> <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said: \"We await Google's response which will be considered by the CNIL, on behalf of the ICO and the other European data protection regulators. A decision will then be made on whether further action is required.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chief executive of Citigroup abruptly quit on Tuesday after five years in the top job, amid reports of a boardroom clash.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.citigroup.com/citi/news/2012/121016a.htm\" title=\"\">Citi said</a> Vikram Pandit, 55, was stepping down as chief executive and leaving the company's board with \"immediate effect\". Within minutes of the bank's announcement, Pandit's name was gone from Citigroup's website. Chief Operating Officer John Havens, a long-time associate of Pandit, also resigned.</p> <p>Pandit said the decision to leave was his own and he was quitting because it was \"the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup\". However, the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443854204578060280201488530.html?mod=WSJEurope_hpp_LEFTTopStories\" title=\"\">Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Pandit resigned after clashing with the board over strategy and performance.</p> <p>There has also been speculation that Pandit may have quit over a row about his pay. In April Citi shareholders voted down his $15m (\u00a39.3m) pay deal, but the vote was non-binding and his pay rise went through.</p> <p>Michael O'Neill, Citi's chairman, said the board respected Pandit's decision to leave the bank. \"Since his appointment at the start of the financial crisis until the present time, Vikram has restructured and recapitalised the company, strengthened our global franchise and refocused the business,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>However Citi's shares, which were trading 1% higher on the back of Pandit's resignation, have lost almost 90% of their value since he took the helm in December 2007.</p> <p>Pandit told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday night: \"The bank is actually in damn good shape.\" He said confidence had been restored and capital rebuilt.</p> <p>Citi said Pandit will be replaced by Mike Corbat, the bank's current head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and a former Harvard University footballer who once planned to play professionally in the NFL, the top American football league.</p> <p>Pandit said he \"could not be leaving the company in better hands\" and the announcement came just 24 hours after the bank reported better-than-expected profits.. \"Mike is the right person to tackle the difficult challenges ahead, with a 29-year record of achievement and leadership at this company,\" he said. \"I will truly miss the wonderful people throughout this organisation. But I know that together with Mike they will continue to build on the progress we have made.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Citigroup+%28C%29+Pandit+Memo+to+Employees/7795400.html\" title=\"\">In a memo to Citi's 260,000 employees,</a> Pandit added: \"Only you can understand the effort and hard work that was put in to get our company where it is today.</p> <p>\"I am proud of each and every one of you and I have the utmost confidence in your future success.\"</p> <p>The bank's president and chief operating officer John Havens, and long-time associate of Pandit, also quit. The bank said Havens \"had already been planning retirement from Citi at year-end but decided, in light of Mr Pandit's resignation, to leave the company at this time.\"</p> <p>The departures remove a leadership team that navigated Citigroup through 2008's global credit crisis, when US taxpayers rescued the bank from collapse with a $45bn bailout.</p> <p>Matt McCormick, banking analyst and portfolio manager at Bahl &amp; Gaynor in Cincinnati, Ohio, said: \"What Pandit and Havens did was increase the uncertainty around Citi. There's a perpetual cloud of uncertainty surrounding Citigroup. There's always turmoil ... that's had to affect the stock price.\"</p> <p>Following Pandit's departure, just two men who ran Wall Street banks during the financial crisis remain in their posts: Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan Chase and Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>If no changes are made to Pandit's compensation package, Citigroup will have paid him about $261m in the five years since he became chief executive, including $165m it paid to buy his Old Lane Partners hedge fund in 2007 in a deal that led to him taking the top job, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>The shake-up at Citi came as Goldman Sachs reported profits of $1.46bn in the three months to the end of September, compared with a $428m loss in the same quarter a year earlier.</p> <p>The bank said higher profit and revenues allowed it to more than double salaries, benefits and bonuses to $3.7bn.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which is calling for a 0.5-1% tax on financial transactions to fund welfare projects, said: \"These eye-watering profits and pay are further evidence that banks are a law unto themselves. While the rest of us are belt-tightening, banks are yet to change their ways.</p> <p>\"If banks can afford to dole out such lavish bonuses, they can afford to pay more to get the economy they helped derail back on track.\"</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, we asked a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/jun/13/national-curriculum-gove\">panel of education specialists to respond to proposed changes to the national curriculum</a>.</p> <p>Although there was a mixed bag of responses, a theme did emerge: government messages don't really add up. How can schools be expected to innovate, as they are encouraged and expected to, when faced with the pressures of league tables, examinations and delivering ever-improving results? And why is a strict curricula being developed alongside encouragement for schools to pursue more freedom to innovate?</p> <p>Primary school teacher Joe Waddle summed it up nicely in this comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>\"What we need above all else now is a curriculum that takes risks, that allows children to develop their imaginations through skill development in information technology, that encourages and rewards risk-taking and that sees failure in those areas as a learning curve. That's what gave Asia the jump on us in the 1970s and 1980s. They were bold, focused on innovation and they encouraged invention. Above all else, they weren't tested to exhaustion.</p> <p>\"The government develops strict curricula while telling schools to opt out of it because they need freedom to innovate. And there's the rub. A clever head and governing body will look at the ideological option (Gove's love of academies and free schools) and be tempted to opt out of a curriculum that would do Mr Chips proud.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a paradox ripe for debate; how can schools innovate when the range of ways students are assessed is so limited.</p> <p>Of course this potentially also renders our discussion topic something of a misnomer. Is this the golden age of curriculum innovation, after all?</p> <p>Some of our panelists would argue it is - and feel that as more schools break free from local authority control there will be more creativity. Others strongly disagree and find it hard to see how this curriculum can create an age of innovation when we the arts are being cut and a one size fits all approach is rolled out.

A higher pound over the last two months will also offset some of the inflationary pressure from imports. So it is possible there may be little impact on consumers' real disposable incomes.</p> <p>However, the economy is likely to need zero base rates for some time to come, which means that whatever price rises work their way through the system will be borne by consumers without any support from the Bank of England or the Treasury, and that is the way it should be. Raising rates to quash demand when inflation is largely generated by variations in supply is a waste of time.</p>",
  "<p>If Judge John Deed ever returned to our television screens, the passionate crusader for justice would be presiding over an unrecognisable courtroom scene.</p> <p>A cast of poorly-motivated barristers, their polyester gowns emblazoned with supermarket logos and cut-price offers, would be stumbling through a hubbub of semi-comprehended legal terms.</p> <p>In a speech at Lincoln's Inn Fields on Tuesday evening, Martin Shaw, the actor who played the lead role in the defunct BBC series, will summon up such an unappealing and lugubrious scene. It might be from an episode entitled \"The Death of the Bar\".</p> <p>The veteran actor's portrayal of romantic life on the bench has been rewarded by his election as an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn. His stepdaughter is training at the bar.</p> <p>Delivering the <a href=\"http://www.thekalishertrust.org/\" title=\"\">annual Kalisher lecture</a>, Shaw pays tribute to all he learned in perfecting his red-robed role. His identification with the part is complete, voicing opinions that some judges might, in unguarded moments, volunteer.</p> <p>His praise of the glory days of the bar is affectionate. The legal profession, he maintains, \"as well as our courts, has an unrivalled international reputation. Why else do Russian oligarchs want to fight their legal battles here?</p> <p>\"That blend of courage, independence and rugged individualism largely defines the popular image of the advocate.\"</p> <p>But it is the vision he presents of the threat to the traditional bar from cut-price, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/12/brands-alternative-business-structures\" title=\"\">mass-market competitors</a> - inspired perhaps by firms becoming ABSs, or alternative business structures (nicknamed Tesco law), cuts in legal aid and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jul/11/qasa-regulators-unqualified-advocates\" title=\"\">imminent launch of Quality Assurance Schemes for Advocates</a> - that chills.</p> <p>Shaw, whose speech is supported by the Criminal Bar Association, declares: \"There appears to be a feeling in government that legal services are well down the pecking order of priorities. Fees for lawyers are not a popular cause.\"</p> <blockquote> \"... What will happen if proposals for your future are not halted? Big beasts, of differing hue, will bid for publicly funded work \u2013 your work - at fixed prices. Industrial scale rather than personal service will be the order of the day. <br>\"Never mind the lament for the high street butcher, cheesemonger, baker, ironmonger. You'll struggle to find a high street solicitor before long. How is he going to survive if BeastCoLegal can offer advocacy on the same basis that Tesco sells sugar?\"  \"Commerce will mean low-cost in-house advocates. ... If 'scale' becomes the motif for the profession, it takes little imagination to see the direction of travel. Hardy souls hungry for advancement and for recognition \u2013 and every one of them self-employed \u2013 will become historic, and not in a good way. <br>\"What is contemplated would be a no-frills, cheap and cheerful bulk legal service. Tesco Law, Asda Legal, and, if you need the cachet of a Silk, Waitrose Lex. And this risk, this real risk, the profession rightly views as deeply suspicious and damaging.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>The damage is already apparent, he warns, in \"good solicitors leaving the profession, those who remain are under intense commercial pressure and they survive only by bringing more and more advocacy in-house.\"</p> <blockquote> \"It is misery for the young bar. It is strangling training. One generation is becoming disillusioned and giving up. Another generation is being turned away. It is no less than disaster for the criminal justice system.

  "<p>Just when you thought the Bumi saga couldn't become more complicated and acrimonious, a new rich seam has been struck. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/15/nat-rothschild-resigns-bumi\" title=\"\">Nat Rothschild resigned on Monday</a>, accusing chairman Samin Tan of being \"complicit\" in the \"oppression\" of minority shareholders. But it turns out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/bumi-resignation-threats-email-nat-rothschild\" title=\"\">Tan himself had threatened to resign at the weekend</a> unless the board ditched the \"disruptive\" Rothschild; moreover Lord Renwick, a senior non-executive director, had sided with Tan.</p> <p>That little row will burn even after Rothschild's departure since it is fuelled by serious allegations made by Tan, including the claim that Rothschild had been reading his (Tan's) emails. Rothschild calls the claims \"untrue and defamatory.\" Lawyers, inevitably, will be summoned.</p> <p>Behind the fireworks at Bumi, Rothschild's resignation letter made one substantial charge that the board must address immediately. This is that Tan, who became one of Bumi's biggest shareholders last year after buying half the Bakrie family's stake, would receive preferential treatment if the London-listed company takes up the proposal to sell all its Indonesian coal assets back to the Bakries.</p> <p>Rothschild claimed, based on \"news reports and other sources\", that Tan would receive \u00a310.91 a share \u2013 the price at which he bought from the Bakries \u2013 whereas other shareholders would get 430p a share. If true, such an arrangement would clearly be outrageous.</p> <p>To clear the air, Tan should declare that he will be treated equally with all Bumi shareholders; state that he doesn't have any side-deal or private understanding with the Bakries; and explain what was meant by the statement attributed to one of his companies last week that it expects to recoup its investment in Bumi plc.</p> <p>Assuming Tan can give satisfactory answers on all those points, Bumi's non-executive directors should continue to proceed on all fronts. That means publishing the eventual findings of the investigation by law firm Macfarlanes into \"potential financial and other irregularities\" in the Indonesian companies and encouraging the Bakries to explain how they would fund their latest proposal. At that point, some welcome light can be shed on what's gone wrong and a sensible view can be taken on the Bakries' offer of a divorce on terms that would see original investors in Bumi lose more than half their money.</p> <p>For his part, Rothschild is free to continue to make the case against selling the assets back to the Bakries. But he ought to refrain from trying to soften his own role in the disaster via sentences such as this: \"It is a matter of great regret for me that I was a party, with our advisers, to bringing the Bakries to London.\"</p> <p>Come on, you weren't just any old party: you were the creator of the company in its cash-shell form, did the deal with the Bakries and received a large helping of bonus shares for your troubles. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/oct/11/bakries-proposal-bumi\" title=\"\">As mentioned here last week</a>, the decent thing would be to return those shares.</p>",
  "<p>The parents of Trayvon Martin have launched a website and a political action committee aimed at fighting the proliferation of stand-your-ground laws.</p> <p><a href=\"http://changefortrayvon.com/\">Change For Trayvon</a> will collect funds to be \"distributed to candidates, elected officials and efforts which support the mission of \u2026 revising stand-your-ground laws across the nation to ensure there is judicial or prosecutorial oversight\".</p> <p>A video on the website shows Martin's father, Tracy Martin, and mother, Sybrina Fulton, sitting side by side, urging viewers to join their campaign. \"We need your help to change the laws which keep parents like ourselves from finding peace,\" Tracy Martin says.</p> <p>The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, a Hispanic neighbourhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, prompted weeks of protest and racially charged debate. Police cited Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows the use of deadly force if threatened, in their decision not to arrest the gunman.</p> <p>Zimmerman, who claims he shot the unarmed 17-year-old in self-defence, was eventually charged with second-degree murder and is out on bail awaiting trial.</p> <p>\"These laws allow individuals to shoot first and ask questions afterwards,\" says Tracy Martin in the video. Martin says he is standing with the 30,000 parents who have lost children to gun violence. A black and white photograph on the website shows father and son in baseball caps, Martin with an arm around his son's neck, planting a kiss on his cheek.</p> <p>\"Worse, under existing stand-your-ground laws, decisions on shootings are made even before a judge or prosecutor can review the case\" adds Fulton in the short video.</p> <p>The website carries a link to a PayPal account for donations and includes a colour-coded map of the US, showing 32 states which have enacted stand-your-ground laws. Six states have passed such laws since Martin's death on 26 February. The website shows a further eight states where proposed stand-your-ground laws are on the ballot in November. </p> <p>The site's stated mission is to give Trayvon Martin's family a voice in the political process. It states: \"Your support will help engage the discussion across the country regarding stand-your-ground laws and the need to revise them so that there is required judicial or prosecutorial review before decisions are made \u2026 The Change for Trayvon movement will shine the light on stand-your-ground laws across the nation.\"</p> <p>Fulton says: \"Stand-your-ground is a solution in search of a problem, and it's a terrible solution with tragic results; like the death of our son.\"</p> <p>No member of the Martin family or their attorneys will benefit directly from donations, the website says. It promises that 90% of donations would go to \"support the mission of Change for Trayvon\".</p> <p>No further details on how the campaign would be taken forward were immediately available and a call to the Martin family lawyer went unreturned. However Benjamin Crump, Martin's lawyer, is quoted on the site talking about proposed laws on the ballot next month.</p> <p>\"Most people don't know whether these laws are on the ballot to be reviewed in their state or not,\" says Crump. \"The Change For Trayvon CCE and its associated website and social media outlets will work to enlighten voters about the status of these laws across the country.\"</p> <p>In August, Zimmerman's lawyer said he would no longer pursue a stand-your-ground defence for his client. However, he said that the defence team would still try to get the case dismissed during a stand-your-ground hearing.</p> <p>\"I think the facts seem to support that though we have a stand-your-ground immunity hearing, what this really is, is a simple, self-defence immunity hearing\" Mark O' Mara <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/14/george-zimmermans-lawyer-stand-your-ground_n_1775105.html\">told the Huffington Post</a>. He will argue that Zimmerman was being attacked by Martin and fired the fatal shots in an act of self-defence without having an opportunity to escape.</p> <p>According to Florida stand-your-ground law, a person may use deadly force without having to take evasive action if they are in reasonable fear of danger. This means that even though individuals may have the opportunity to escape their attacker, they could choose to stand ground and fight back.</p>",
  "<p>Besuited and fiercely disciplined, with a powerful family background and experience in the Communist Youth League, Liu Yandong appears much like other cadres jockeying for position in China's pending leadership transition, bar one very obvious difference: her gender.</p> <p>She is the only female member of the 25-member politburo and would be the first woman to reach its standing committee, the country's top political body. Though she is regarded as a long shot, \"the door is not closed\", said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/\" title=\"\">Brookings Institution</a>.</p> <p>Slogans such as \"women hold up half the sky\" once embodied the Communist party's pledge to raise the status of women. Economic reforms further boosted them. China ranks a respectable 35th on the UN's gender empowerment index.</p> <p>Yet in Chinese politics women remain a glaring absence. The annual session of the National People's Congress shows banks of dark-suited men; only a fifth of the largely rubber-stamp legislature is female, and barely one-sixteenth of the party's central committee. There is one female provincial party secretary and one governor. At the grassroots 2%-3% of village party chiefs and 22% of committee members are female.</p> <p>Feminists say better representation is crucial to addressing enduring, or even increasing, inequality. Many fear women face a deterioration in their status, citing <a href=\"http://www.chinadebate.com/2011/09/china%E2%80%99s-new-marriage-law-may-exacerbate-gender-wealth-gap-by-leta-hong-fincher/\" title=\"\">changes to marital property rights that have disadvantaged women</a>, incomes shrinking in comparison to men's and increasing gender stereotyping.</p> <p>\"The mainstream value system portrays women as weak. From kindergarten on, girls are told to be obedient,\" said Xie Lihua, the founder of the Rural Women NGO.</p> <p>She added: \"If women's political status can't be improved, all other talk about women's rights is just empty words.\"</p> <p>Women played an important role in shaping modern China; there were high-profile leaders and thinkers, and female soldiers. Yet the two most prominent female leaders gained power through marriage. Song Qingling was the widow of revered revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing was blamed for the Cultural Revolution's excesses, though she later insisted she was \"Chairman Mao's dog. I bit whomever he wanted me to bite.\"</p> <p>Many believe the backlash against her damaged women in general.</p> <p>\"The number of women in politics declined from the late 1970s onwards,\" said Tamara Jacka of the Australian National University, who is studying the effect of female leadership on gender equality in Chinese villages.</p> <p>Under Deng Xiaoping the regime sought legitimacy by distancing itself from its predecessors.</p> <p>\"One of the most powerful leaders was Jiang Qing and so part of the discrediting of the Cultural Revolution involved the discrediting of the notion that women should be involved and take leadership positions in the public sphere,\" Jacka said.</p> <p>As in other countries, women lack confidence to step forward, are disadvantaged in networking, bear more of the household chores and face higher standards and stereotyping, such as the assumption they will interrupt their career to have children.</p> <p>But other obstacles are particular to China. Rural women usually marry into their husband's villages, so men have better-established connections. The government's limited tolerance for civil society means that grassroots campaigners don't enter politics from outside. The opaque promotion system encourages institutional discrimination; there is anecdotal evidence that female officials do better in open selection processes. Women also retire earlier than men, just when they might take on more significant roles.</p> <p>Optimists hope that today's young, high-achieving female students will be a powerful force for progress. At least a few are hungry for change; small protests this year included the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/world/asia/chinese-women-demand-more-public-toilets.html\" title=\"\">occupation of men's toilets in Guangzhou</a>, by women demanding better female facilities.</p> <p>At government level the All-China Women's Federation has launched a <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMP-All-China-Womens-Federatio-China-Profile-July-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">UN-funded $2.5m programme to promote political participation</a>. Beijing has made a growing number of officials undergo training on gender issues and there are some quotas, though usually low; in cities, at least one of the top four leaders should be female.</p> <p>But as Feng Yuan, the founder of an anti-domestic violence network, warned: \"'At least one woman' can always become 'one woman'.\"</p> <p>Xie noted that the issue was not a government priority, but added: \"Women have to change themselves too. They have to be brave and courageous enough to compete.\"</p> <p>A civil group working with officials in a Shaanxi county increased the proportion of female village heads from 0.6% to 4.5% over six years with imaginative tactics, including commissioning a local opera on women and power.</p> <p>But Gao Xiaoxian, the scheme's pioneer, noted afterwards: \"Some male cadres formed alliances to prevent women from succeeding \u2026 some town and township cadres demanded total perfection of the women officials, exaggerating every tiny defect.\"</p> <p>Female village committee members are usually relegated to minor roles and women are more likely to head poorer settlements with no collective wealth. In those places, said Jacka: \"Being a village leader is just hell. You don't have the resources to do anything for villagers and you don't have the power to change anything much; you are under enormous pressure from villagers but also from above.\"</p> <p>Addressing participation alongside broader issues may help. In one village in Henan residents drew up new rules after undergoing gender awareness training. As well as introducing quotas, they demanded the division of housework, an equal right for women to inherit their parents' land rights, and the option for children to take their mother's name instead of their father's.</p> <p>Appointing 67-year-old Liu to the standing committee could send a powerful signal from the very top. Even Wu Yi, the formidable negotiator dubbed China's \"Iron Lady\", never made it that far. But Cheng Li warned: \"Competition is so intense they don't even bother to look at the symbolism.\"</p> <p>Russell Leigh Moses, dean of the Beijing Centre for Chinese Studies, added: \"She is extremely qualified, amazingly competent and remarkably proficient at both politics and the subjects put in front of her. Unfortunately, it won't come down to just talent.\"</p> <p>He also noted that her policy pronouncements have been markedly conservative recently. They do not suggest she will push for reforms, still less feminist ones \u2013 and other countries have found that a handful of senior women may not be enough to shift political culture.</p> <p>\"It is a historical problem. The dominance of politics by men can't be changed by one or two female officials in a short period of time,\" said Feng.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional research by Kathy Gao</p>",
  "<p>Cuba will open its exit doors wider than at any time in 50 years following migration reforms announced on Tuesday that will make it easier for citizens to go overseas. Under the new government policy, most Cubans will no longer require an exit visa or letter of invitation to leave the country.</p> <p>The change raises the prospect of increased travel, particularly to the US.</p> <p>There will continue to be limits affecting certain members of society, however. Doctors, scientists and military staff could be restricted, in a government effort to prevent a brain drain of people who have benefited most from Cuba's highly regarded state education and health systems.</p> <p>The big shift in migration policy follows economic and social reforms by the president, Ra\u00fal Castro, which loosen controls on sales of private property, mobile phone ownership and hotel stays, and aim to make the island more attractive to foreign investors.</p> <p>The exit visa system dates to 1961, when the government tightened border controls to stem a flood of migrants amid tensions with the US and unease among some sectors of society about the 1959 revolution that put Fidel Castro in power.</p> <p>Abolition of the system, which will come into effect before 14 January, is likely to be popular because it will save time and money for tourists and for those who want to work overseas or visit relatives among the large diaspora in the US. Exit visas cost about $150, roughly a third of the average monthly wage.</p> <p>The change, which was promised by Ra\u00fal Castro when he became president in 2008, was announced by the Communist party newspaper Granma.</p> <p>\"As part of the work underway to update the current migratory policy and adjust it to the conditions of the present and the foreseeable future, the Cuban government, in exercise of its sovereignty, has decided to eliminate the procedure of the exit visa for travel to the exterior,\" read the notice.</p> <p>The government has also extended the time Cubans can remain overseas without losing their social security, health benefits and voting rights \u2013 from 11 to 24 months.</p> <p>The exit visa reform will have political ramifications well beyond the island's borders.</p> <p>There are thought to be more than a million Cubans in the US, which has a longstanding policy of granting citizenship to almost all migrants from the island, on which Washington imposed an economic embargo.</p> <p>Sharp economic disparities, political differences and migration controls have prompted many Cubans to migrate illegally in recent decades. Thousands travel via Mexico and other countries in central America each year, sometimes at great risk in unsafe boats.</p> <p>Under the new system, travellers should need only a passport and a visa from the country they intended to visit.</p> <p>But critics said controls on the movement of dissidents were likely to continue,.</p> <p>A dissident blogger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoanisanchez\" title=\"\">Yoani S\u00e1nchez</a>, who was detained by the authorities this month, tweeted: \"The devil is in the details.\" She said that the new law could be used to prevent overseas travel by Cubans who \"organise or participate in actions that are hostile against the country's political foundation\".</p> <p>Most citizens were thought likely to welcome the change, however.</p> <p>\"There have been many expectations for many years about a new travel law.

  "<p>The extraordinary row erupting at Bumi plc took yet another dramatic turn after it emerged that the group's chairman and a non-executive director had threatened to resign unless founder Nat Rothschild quit the board.</p> <p>The threat, contained in an email sent by the chairman, Samin Tan, over the weekend to Sir Julian Horn-Smith, Bumi's senior non-executive director, pre-dates Rothschild's dramatic resignation as a director on Monday evening, when the banking scion declared he had \"lost confidence\" in the board to stand up for investors.</p> <p>Tan was supported by Bumi independent non-executive director, the former British diplomat Lord Renwick, who also threatened to step down from the London-listed company if Rothschild remained.</p> <p>Tan's note said: \"I will resign as the chairman of Bumi plc with immediate effect unless I receive assurance that Mr Nat Rothschild will as soon as practicable stand down from the board of the company.\" He went on to explain his stance by claiming that Rothschild:</p> <p>\u2022 Had been persistently \"disruptive\".</p> <p>\u2022 Had suggested that he had \"access to, and has been reading, [Tan's] e-mails\".</p> <p>\u2022 Had hinted that he could have Tan sent to jail in London.</p> <p>\u2022 Had claimed he could have Tan banned from entering London and could \"make sure [he could be] banned from being a director in any UK company\".</p> <p>The latest escalation of hostilities comes after shares in Bumi crashed by a quarter on a single day last month as the mining investor hired the law firm McFarlanes to investigate allegations of financial dishonesty at its main affiliate, one of Indonesia's largest coal producers. The lawyers have yet to report on the allegations.</p> <p>Following news of Tan's email, Rothschild immediately issued his own statement. His spokesman said: \"The allegations are untrue and defamatory. Mr Rothschild did warn Mr Tan that, given the allegations in the McFarlanes letter, there was a risk that Mr Tan could be disbarred from serving as a director of a UK company. It is amusing that, rather than investigate the allegations, some directors want to shoot the messenger.\"</p> <p>Rothschild led the London flotation of Bumi two years ago, when it was known as Vallar. It was a \u00a3700m cash vehicle intended to make acquisitions in the mining industry and was renamed Bumi after taking a 29% stake in the mining business controlled by the Bakrie family in Indonesia.</p> <p>The two founding parties quickly fell out and last week the Bakries proposed severing the embittered tie-up by offering $1.29bn (\u00a3800m) cash in return for Bumi plc's mines plus cancelling the family's own shares in the London-listed investment vehicle. The Indonesians also spiced up their proposal with a separate suggestion that Rothschild should give up a stake in Bumi plc worth upwards of \u00a340m. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/11/nat-rothschild-bumi-bakrie-family\" title=\"\">Rothschild immediately opposed all aspects of the offer</a>.</p> <p>The emergence of Tan's ultimatum gives a totally new context to Rothschild's dramatic resignation on Monday night when his own sharply worded letter to Tan stated: \"You appear determined to drive through the Bakries' proposal. I believe that this proposal is so obviously not in the interests of minority shareholders that I find it impossible to stay on as a director. I am afraid that I have lost confidence in the ability of the plc board to stand up for investors.\"</p> <p>However, Rothschild's attempts to portray himself as a hero of independent investors has caused some surprise in City circles, where many find it difficult to forget that it was the financier who created Bumi \u2013 and did the original deal with the Bakries. He reportedly had just two meetings with the controversial Indonesian family over three weeks before signing the deal and he said afterwards: \"One has to be decisive when opportunities present themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>Fifty years after the Cuban missile crisis, three generations of American policy-makers have cut teeth on those events that brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink in October 1962. This generation is now winding its way upwards as twenty- and thirtysomething speechwriters, special assistants, reporters and congressional candidates. </p> <p>The basic outline of what they have been taught remains the one <a href=\"http://live.belfercenter.org/publication/1334/second_look.html\">canonized by Harvard's Graham Allison</a> some 25 years ago, in four lessons. First, \"nuclear war is really possible.\" Second, \"the principal risk of nuclear war arises from the uncontrollable\" events that take place during genuine crises \u2013 such as simple mistakes or errors of perception \u2013 and not from the risk that rational human beings will intend war as a matter of policy. Third, \"the reality of nuclear interdependence\" means that states depend upon other states to avoid war for their own survival. Taken together, these \"perils of crisis management\" in the nuclear age ultimately teach that \"crisis must be prevented.\"</p> <p>In other words, if it is true that the only way to win a nuclear war is not to play, the only way to guarantee we don't find ourselves in an accidental pick-up game is to prevent crises before they occur. </p> <p>These lessons still hold; but they are far less obvious than they were in 1987, when the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact still existed, Osama bin Laden was fighting alongside US allies, email was for universities and Twitter was for the birds.</p> <p>Is nuclear war really possible? <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/12/cnn-poll-public-divided-on-eliminating-all-nuclear-weapons/\">Americans today still worry</a> about the possibility of a nuclear attack, though by a stateless terrorist group, rather than from Russia or China. But we are less likely to believe a nuclear war \u2013 as opposed to a one-off terrorist attack \u2013 is possible. So, even as military planners increasingly find nuclear weapons less useful than decades ago, the public responds to the possibility of nuclear terrorism with the desire for the US to keep its weapons, which are <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/08/06/top_air_force_officer_backup_supply_of_nuclear_warheads_larger_than_needed/\">more numerous now</a> than in the 1980s.</p> <p>What is uncontrollable? During the cold war, or by the 1980s at any rate, conventional wisdom held that our Soviet opponents were rational, interested in regime survival, and thus deterrable. Therefore, the threat of accident and misperception was as great as that posed by Communist aggression. Today, arguing that Iran's leaders are rational, and deterrable, is enough to get you called out from a presidential campaign podium \u2013 even if you are <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/03/01/435346/dempsey-iran-rational-actor/?mobile=nc\">chairman of the joint chiefs</a>.</p> <p>The irrationality of North Korea's leadership is an article of faith on the right, though <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kim/them/hermit.html\">not among experts</a> who have actually spent time there. (It seems necessary to note that \"rational\" is not the same thing as \"moral\".) If the threat from \"the uncontrollable\" now is perceived to arise from the character of regimes and terrorist groups, rather than circumstance, then lessons three and four of Allison have been placed in doubt. And so, we have the Pentagon worried about misperception and accident, showing interest in hotlines and incidents-at-sea agreements with Cuba and Iran \u2013 and political leaders saying no.</p> <p>What about nuclear interdependence? Developments in the last two decades or so have brought this core tenet of deterrence theory very much into question for those countries that must plan to deter the United States \u2013 and thus, for us as well.</p> <p>First, Ronald Reagan's dream of national missile defense remains so attractive precisely because it seems to offer a path out of interdependence (which, back in the day, we used to call \"mutual assured destruction\"). Experts, however, continue to tell us that watertight coverage is <a href=\"http://armscontrolnow.org/2012/10/03/for-missile-defense-it-depends-is-not-good-enough/\">unlikely to impossible</a>, and systems to counter such defenses will always be cheaper and advance faster than the systems themselves \u2013 both thanks to the laws of physics.</p> <p>Second, we are moving rapidly toward hyper-powerful, hyper-effective non-nuclear weapons with destructive powers that, decades ago, would have required nuclear weapons. If the United States is one day able to make a credible, non-nuclear threat to cripple another state's nuclear forces \u2013 which future systems like <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/world/europe/23strike.html\">Prompt Global Strike</a> are moving steadily toward \u2013 then does that end our nuclear interdependence? Could cyber weapons one day achieve similar effects? Some US commentators and political leaders believe this would be a good thing.</p> <p>But a moment's thought about how the leaders of a smaller nuclear power could be expected to respond to such a threat should be disquieting. Hard as it may be to imagine for those old enough to have grown up with nuclear nightmares and duck-and-cover drills, we might come to miss that interdependence once it is gone.</p> <p>Lastly, do we still believe in crisis prevention? The debate continues, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/cuban-missile-crisis-russian-roulette\">including here</a>, about who got the better of whom 50 years ago. But we know that both Kennedy and Khrushchev believed it was important to de-escalate, important to control the hotheads in each of their governments, and important enough to risk their own leadership to do so. Each spent a great deal of time, before and after, publicly criticizing the other. But each could withdraw to private diplomacy and crisis management when he needed to.</p> <p>Is this still true? Fifty years ago, the discussion and debate over how to manage the crisis was influenced by an extremely small number of voices. The sources of information the American public \u2013 and decision-makers \u2013 had were limited. And neither the media nor the public had the ability to know and comment on everything as it happened. For better and worse, it is now simply impossible to control the media and public environment as Kennedy, to say nothing of Khrushchev, did. This year alone has seen <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/social-media-and-the-assassination-of-an-ambassador.html\">Twitter turn</a> a series of demonstrations and a terrorist attack in North Africa into a central issue of the presidential campaign, outstrip policy-makers in managing the sensitive case of a would-be Chinese defector and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/twitter-room/other-news/250129-obama-camp-hammers-romney-on-47-percent-through-social-media\">magnify</a> gaffe, after gaffe, after gaffe. </p> <p>Fifty years after Cuba, in short, nuclear war is still possible. Crisis management is more perilous and the international environment is, if anything, less controllable. America is now as interdependent in economics, health and well-being as we were in nuclear strategy then. We have not learned to live with our interdependence any more gracefully.</p>",
  "<p>The US government and its intelligence agencies were influential in the UK government decision to introduce a highly controversial new generation of secret courts, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has told MPs and peers.</p> <p>David Anderson QC told parliament's joint human rights committee on Tuesday that he could not know whether the US was the driving force behind the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> but, after a series of conversations during a visit to America, he concluded: \"I am quite sure they had something to do with it.\"</p> <p>Anderson, who told the committee of MPs and peers on Tuesday that the bill was \"disproportionate\", added that he had been left in no doubt that US officials were genuinely alarmed by the English courts' willingness to disclose information the CIA had passed to British intelligence agencies in the case of Binyam Mohamed, the UK resident who was tortured and rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Anderson said he was told in Washington that the future of UK-US intelligence sharing depended upon the Britain's ability to \"sort this one out\" before more material was made public.</p> <p>\"It was said to me that there would have to be a reassessment of the intelligence relationship,\" Anderson said.</p> <p>He claimed that what angered US officials most was that an English court was prepared to overrule the view of a foreign secretary \u2013 a reference to David Miliband's evidence during the Mohamed hearings in 2008 that disclosure would damage UK intelligence relations with the US.</p> <p>The sensitive material disclosed in the Mohamed case was a report supplied by the CIA in which they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/10/binyam-mohamed-torture-evidence-paragraphs\" title=\"\">detailed the manner in which he was being tortured</a> after being detained in Karachi in 2002. It was sent to MI5, who then dispatched one of its officers to Pakistan to interrogate Mohamed.</p> <p>There was \"no rational basis\" for Miliband's claim, the high court ruled, adding that the CIA material should be disclosed \"for reasons of accountability and the rule of law in the United Kingdom\".</p> <p>Anderson was asked by the Labour peer Lady Kennedy how, under the bill, Britain could honour its obligations under the UN convention on torture, which obliges countries to act if they have evidence. He replied that \"accepting a principle\" might lead to a \"pragmatic cost\" \u2013 referring to the prospect of the US cutting on the amount of intelligence it passes to Britain.</p> <p>Anderson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/19/secret-court-genuine-problem-disproportionate\" title=\"\">reiterated his view</a> that the bill, while addressing a genuine problem, did so in a \"disproportionate\" manner. He said judges \u2013 and not ministers, as the bill states \u2013 should have the discretion to decide whether evidence should be heard in secret \u2013 so-called closed material proceedings (CMP) \u2013 and the bill should state clearly that such secrecy should be used only as a last resort.</p> <p>Depriving judges of the discretion over whether to use CMPs would not bolster public confidence in the judiciary or the UK's intelligence and security agencies, Anderson warned, although he accepted that the proposals were about \"more than the convenience of the intelligence services\".</p> <p>The government argues that CMPs are needed to prevent courtroom disclosure of sensitive evidence from causing damage to the so-called \"control principle\" governing intelligence shared between states.</p> <p>Secret evidence, which is already used in terrorism-related immigration tribunals, allows government lawyers to rely on evidence that cannot be seen by victims or claimants, or their lawyers. The evidence can be seen by security-vetted barristers known as special advocates, but they cannot discuss what they have seen. The system is <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/14/government-still-not-made-case-for-inherently-unfair-secret-trials-say-special-advocates/\" title=\"\">widely regarded as inherently unfair</a> and would inevitably lead to legal challenges.</p> <p>Anderson suggested that if the bill became law, it should be subjected to annual review. Critics of the bill warned that secret courts could be introduced in more and more cases unrelated to terrorism.</p>",
  "<p>The oil company PetroAmazonas is promising my Amazonian Kichwa community a new school, college, eco-lodge, grant funding for their children to go to university, money for healthcare, dentistry, jobs and a cash lump sum, in return for being able develop their land. But with my wife and 14-month-old baby, I've embarked on the task of persuading the community otherwise \u2013 in order to preserve intact the 70,000 hectares of virgin rainforest here, its inhabitants, medicinal plants, flora and fauna.</p> <p>A vote by my people is imminent. We are going to go through the rainforest, house to house, to talk to the people to help them choose tourism and rainforest preservation over the offer from the oil firm.</p> <p>We have protected these lands with our hearts, soul and lives since before we can remember. In 2009, when I was president of the community, the entire community got together and wrote and signed a document that we hand-delivered to the oil company, staying that we would never give up Sani Isla lands for oil exploitation. This holds firm in indigenous law but they are here now, saying that a change to the Ecuadorian constitution has rendered the document we wrote as worthless \u2013 so now we are fair game. We have since found out that this is not true.</p> <p>My life changed in 2008 when I met my wife, the woman I had seen in a vision when I was 15. We married in 2010, not an easy path to take for either of us \u2013 I am an indigenous Amazonian shaman and community leader from Ecuador whose role is to honour, protect, serve, advise and heal the people, emotionally, physically and spiritually. She, a caring, outgoing entrepreneur from London with an interesting energy and a deep passion to help others \u2013 but destiny had spoken. Now, with our daughter we find ourselves in the middle of a fight to protect my ancestral lands, the virgin rainforests of Ecuador from oil exploitation.</p> <p>The modern world is advancing faster than we as a people can cope with, but we know that education is key and there is a need for money too. Life has changed. Even in the rainforest we now need money for schooling and to sustain ourselves to start projects such as an organic fruit farm.</p> <p>We built a lodge on the edge of a beautiful lagoon to bring in tourism, and it does, and we are grateful for everyone who has visited us. But financially it has struggled; my wife's life savings are keeping it going at the moment. It could work though \u2013 and we are hoping to attract more tourists from the UK and elsewhere.</p> <p>The oil companies have made great in-roads this time, they have found our people at an all-time low emotionally and financially, and have seized their chance. How can we help the community give up such wonderful opportunities?</p> <p>In Quito we sit, making a plan and have asked our friends and family to help. Even my wife's 90-year-old mother has been on the phone to embassies asking for help. We ask every person we meet if they might know someone or have an idea. Lists are written in journals and on phones at patio tables, emails address passed on slips of paper, people have been wonderful.</p> <p>We are going to return to the community and meet with the main leaders to try to reason with them and to offer alternatives to what seems to be too tempting an offer from the oil companies \u2013 we want to help them choose self-sustainability and tourism and protecting the forest instead. Then by canoe, my wife and I, along with our baby, will go house to house attempting to reunite families who are disagreeing, ask what their dreams are and try to explain the pros and cons, so that when the vote comes soon, they feel able to vote \"no\" with confidence and not \"yes\" out of desperation and lack of hope.</p> <p>Why risk it? I asked my wife. She answered, how can we look our daughter in the eye in 20 years' time and see the community living when there are no trees, no fish in the rivers, our little house by the river gone, the lodge closed and a concrete jungle replacing the living one and say we did not try because we were afraid. I see her eyes fill with tears. As she says, we must. Right now, there is no one else.</p> <p>\u2022 To help or contact Patricio, visit the <a href=\"http://sanilodge.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sani Lodge website</a> or email patricio@sanilodge.co.uk</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May must have found it galling to use the despised Human Rights Act as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/16/gary-mckinnon-not-extradited-may\" title=\"\">get-out-of-jail-free card for Gary McKinnon</a>. But there was no alternative to her using article 3 of the human rights convention, which says that no one shall be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p>How else was she going to be able to stop McKinnon being extradited to the US, with the risk that he would end his own life and, with it, May's political career?</p> <p>\"I have concluded that the ordering of his extradition and his subsequent removal would give rise to such risk to his health and, in particular, to a high risk of his ending his life that a decision to that effect would be incompatible with his human rights under article 3,\" May told MPs.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/contents\" title=\"\">Extradition Act 2003</a>, brought in by Labour in a vain attempt to stop lengthy legal delays, had taken away the home secretary's discretion to block extradition on what were seen as political grounds. The reforms also ensured that the courts were left with little or no discretion to block extradition once the formalities had been complied with.</p> <p>So the home secretary was left in the unenviable position of trying to block extradition requests that were politically unacceptable without any legal powers to do so. Hence her decision that McKinnon was too ill to be extradited.</p> <p>That recalls <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/599526.stm\" title=\"\">Jack Straw's decision</a> in 2000 that the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was unfit to stand trial in Spain for human rights abuses, made while the home secretary still had the discretion to block extradition.</p> <p>As May told MPs, \"matters such as representations on human rights grounds\" will be given to the courts under planned new legislation. She clearly doesn't want to find herself under political pressure of this sort in future.</p> <p>Already, the home secretary is being asked why she was not persuaded by the medical evidence put forward by Abu Hamza, Babar Ahmad or any of the other suspected terrorists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/abu-hamza-loses-extradition-appeal\" title=\"\">extradited to the US earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>Even more significantly, parliament will be asked to approve a new forum bar, allowing the courts to block extradition if they decide that it would be in the interests of justice for defendants to be tried in the UK instead.</p> <p>\"This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas, if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so,\" May said.</p> <p>What's meant by that is not clear. It would be possible, for example, to try McKinnon in the UK \u2014 but only if the US government were willing to send witnesses to an English court who could give evidence about security systems in the Pentagon, which must be highly unlikely.</p> <p>The government review headed by Sir Scott Baker was told by the specialist extradition judges in London that there was not a single case decided under the 2003 Act in which it would have been in the interests of justice to have tried in the UK, rather than in the requesting territory.</p> <p>Many of the recent cases involving extradition to the US were ones that the Crown Prosecution Service was simply not interested in taking up. If the only test is whether a prosecution is \"possible\", some defendants will escape both extradition and prosecution.</p> <p>What we do know is that the government is not going to implement the forum bar provided by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/48/contents\" title=\"\">Police and Justice Act 2006</a>, which has never been brought into force. The Scott Baker review said the major disadvantage of introducing that forum bar was that it would create delay and had the potential to generate satellite litigation.</p> <p>\"This would slow down the extradition process, add to the cost of proceedings and provide no corresponding benefit,\" the review added.</p> <p>Without seeing the government's proposals, it is difficult to see how May's new forum bar \"will be carefully designed to minimise delays\". The most that can be said is that giving these powers to the courts would avoid lengthy challenges in the courts to decisions by the home secretary.</p> <p>The government's concern will be to satisfy its critics while causing as little damage as possible to relations with the United States. It's possible to imagine a forum bar that would be inconsistent with the US-UK extradition treaty.</p> <p>Fortunately for May, though, the English courts moved quickly in permitting the extradition of Abu Hamza and his fellow suspects this month. If the US get to try the five terrorist suspects and we get to keep a man who says he was searching for UFOs, perhaps honour will be satisfied.</p>",

In fact, Night Engine \u2013 a four-piece from London who only formed in January 2012 \u2013 seem to be influenced either by great musicians after their artistic peak (we can also detect in their work a little Talking Heads, but circa the anticlimactic Speaking in Tongues), or by poorly regarded ones. One of their songs reminds us of INXS. INXS! </p> <p>They're good, though \u2013 not least because they've succeeded in turning this inferior base matter into gold. Tomorrow night, we'll find out whether they can Do It Live: they're making their London debut at the Sebright Arms and we'd urge you to come on down but apparently the gig has already sold out \u2013 quite impressive considering they don't quite seem to tick any hipster boxes. Yes, they've only been going for 10 months, but even at this formative stage there's an audible buzz about them, as there was around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/25/vaccines-brother-interview\">the Vaccines</a>, say, at a comparable point in their development. There is chatter, and there has been some recourse to Twitter \u2013 just not from the \"right\" sources. </p> <p>This is possibly because they are doing something deeply uncool, and apparently with straight faces: funky rock. Not the trendy, arty funk noir of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hn7bZOm9QY\">A Certain Ratio</a> or the edgy funk-metal of early Chili Peppers but the rocked-up disco of Hutchence and co, Bowie during his rolled-up jacket-sleeves nadir and the heinous pomp funk of <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcu2z8_the-power-station-some-like-it-hot_music\">the Power Station</a>, that mid-80s \"supergroup\" who managed to extract the \"super\" from \"supergroup\" and had at their helm Robert Palmer, who wasn't so much a Thin White Duke clone as he was a replica, a mini-me version, of Bowie '83. </p> <p>And yet, like we say, somehow their tunes are irresistible, even if they're hardly novel. Their mission statement is a variation on that old indie standby \u2013 employed by Franz Ferdinand and adopted by many bands since \u2013 about wanting to make women dance, and there are allusions in their press release to Nile Rodgers and krautrock: this is, now that they mention it, a sort of 21st-century version of a streamlined, commercialised 80s take on 70s Teutonic grooves. I'll Make It Worth Your While is their lead track and it is supremely chunky and tuneful, the singer's voice a theatrical, mannered croon, the backing chants ironically laddish, the handclaps absurdly infectious. Treat Me Like a Baby opens with fast, fuzzy bass and has the murky momentum of a glam anthem \u2013 these young dudes could be heroes. On and On is like a mashup of Bowie and Union City Blue by Blondie while Seventeen recalls everyone's favourite space oddity like he's going out of fashion, which funnily enough he did round about the time he sang Fashion. Beep beep! Night Engine might not be cool as such, but they could, at a push, with a push, be colossal. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"These guys are primed to make crowds bounce\" \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.7bitarcade.com/music/article/band-of-the-day-night-engine/\">7bitarcade.com</a>. </p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong>&#xa0;It's loud and tasteless, <a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/david+bowie/fashion_20036921.html\">and we've heard it before</a> \u2013 but we like it. <br> &#xa0;&#xa0;<br><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Turn to the left! </p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Turn to the right! &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> You can hear their tracks on their SoundCloud. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> INXS, Kane Gang, Power Station, David Bowie. &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nightengine\">soundcloud.com/nightengine</a>. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> Wild Swim. </p> <p> &#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Conservative plans to privatise council services plans were dealt a fresh blow on Tuesday when the leader of Cornwall council was acrimoniously ousted for trying to push through a \u00a3300m sell-off.</p> <p>The project to part-privatise services including libraries, benefits and payroll to either BT or CSC, the US IT services giant, is now in doubt after Alec Robertson, the Tory leader of the authority, was toppled by his fellow councillors. He faced a vote of no confidence at an extraordinary meeting in Truro which he lost 63 votes to 49.</p> <p>The outsourcing programme was seen as a test bed for local authorities struggling to cope with 28% cuts in Whitehall budgets, but it faced widespread public opposition with 6,000 people signing a petition against it. Robertson had sought to defy a council vote last month calling for a rethink of the decision to enter into a partnership with the private sector. His deputy, Jim Currie, resigned last week, warning: \"The financial risks involved with the rush into the new joint venture proposals are unacceptable. The joint venture is basically too large to control.\"</p> <p>The upheaval at Cornwall council, which is the county's biggest single employer, is the latest crisis for Conservative-controlled councils seeking to sell off public services. Earlier this month the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/05/barnet-easycouncil-chief-quits\" title=\"\">chief executive of the London borough of Barnet quit</a>, casting into doubt the direction of his authority's radical \"easyCouncil\" plan to reduce the town hall to a commissioning body. Somerset county council's partnership with IBM, which it shares with Taunton Deane borough council and the Avon and Somerset police force, has run into trouble with \u00a330m losses. Last year Suffolk county council <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/04/suffolk-virtual-council-plan?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">halted its \"virtual council\"</a> plans to outsource all its services.</p> <p>Bob Egerton, the independent councillor for Probus in Cornwall who proposed the motion of no confidence in the Cornish leadership, said the county's outsourcing programme ceded too much control over key services to the private sector.</p> <p>\"It is handing over public services to a private company where decisions are not being made for the local council tax payer, but for the company,\" he said. \"Look at the rail franchises. People are beginning to wake up to the fact that the private sector doesn't necessarily do things better than the public sector. It wasn't the councils that caused the financial problems, it was the bankers, and it is the councils that are having to bail them out.\"</p> <p>He admitted he had no plan B, but said: \"If you are heading towards a cliff edge it is not your job to reprogramme the GPS with a new route, but to stop the car.\"</p> <p>Cornwall had proposed to form a partnership with three local health boards to sign a contract for support services for 10 to 15 years. The projects covered by the contract would be for a common computer infrastructure, joined-up procurement and commissioning systems, shared document management, websites and contact centres. The council also plans to establish a trading vehicle with the private company to bid to provide services to other local authorities with a view to creating profits and jobs.</p>",
  "<p>The Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph newspaper, have given the luxury hotel group behind Claridge's and the Berkeley a temporary reprieve after the company missed a September deadline to repay borrowings of \u00a3660m \u2013 debt described by a high court judge in August as manifestly \"too high\".</p> <p>Sir Frederick and Sir David bought up Coroin's debts last year and have been seeking to win full control of the business for more than two years. In 2010, the trophy hotels of its subsidiary Maybourne Hotel Group attracted a rush of interest after it became apparent that the company, and several of its band of Irish property tycoon owners, had become financially overstretched. Among those circling were Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour and the Al-Thani ruling family of Qatar.</p> <p>But in January last year the Barclay brothers bought the stake of one Coroin shareholder and a second pledged to sell his holding to them. However, a third investor, Paddy McKillen, has been fighting a bitter battle against ceding full control to the brothers. He faces a \u00a36m legal bill after a failed attempt to sue the twins. Refusing to give up, he is seeking an appeal.</p> <p>As well as controlling much of the equity, in September last year the Barclays used a loan from Barclays bank to acquire Coroin's \u00a3660m debt, which had fallen to Ireland's <a href=\"http://www.nama.ie/\" title=\"\">National Asset Management Agency</a>, its state-owned toxic loan book.

  "<p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/reddit-free-speech-gawker\">On Monday the Guardian ran a comment piece</a> by James Ball on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/12/reddit-blocks-gawker-creepshot-photos\">Reddit's decision to ban links to the gossip website Gawker</a> after <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web\">one of Gawker's writers confronted, and then revealed the identity of</a>, a prominent user who had run message boards on Reddit with photos of women and underage girls, taken in the street or lifted from Facebook and elsewhere.</em></p> <p><em>\"Rearth\" is a moderator on the popular Politics subreddit (and others), who contacted the Guardian after publication and verified his identity. His response and explanation of the actions of Reddit's moderators is below, slightly edited for clarity.</em></p> <h2>We need to be clear about this</h2> <p>We need to be clear on this: Reddit is not a monolithic entity. It's a collection of communities. There can be very little overlap between the communities of <a href=\"http://askhistorians.reddit.com/\">/r/AskHistorians</a>, <a href=\"http://leagueoflegends.reddit.com/\">/r/LeagueOfLegends</a>, <a href=\"http://fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.reddit.com/\">/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu</a> and <a href=\"http://hotchickswithtattoos.reddit.com/\">/r/Hotchickswithtattoos</a>. These communities have all been created by individuals, with any rules the founding individuals wish. To make statements like \"Reddit is doing this\" is for all intents and purposes meaningless. Creating a community is as simple as going to <a href=\"http://reddit.com/reddits/create\">http://reddit.com/reddits/create</a>.</p> <p>For what it's worth, I was strongly against the Gawker ban for the precise reasons James Ball listed. However the consensus amongst the /r/politics mods was that Chen was witch-hunting an individual \u2013 not for breaking a law, but for doing something he, Chen, found distasteful. We (as a group) found that a dangerous precedent to set. We feel that Chen has had a long campaign against Reddit, and decided (as a group, despite individual concerns) that we did not want to condone someone attempting to destroy someone's else's life for doing something they didn't like.</p> <p>If Violentacrez had done anything illegal he would have been reported to the police long ago. In fact, he was the first line of defence against illegal content. As the mod in many of the distasteful subreddits he was responsible for removing and reporting illegal content. I'm not calling him a hero, personally I think he's a symptom of the <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19\">GIFT (Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory)</a>, but when you strip back the hyperbole, righteous indignation and misinformation that's being spread, that's the truth of the matter.</p> <p>Witch-hunting is a large problem on sites like SomethingAwful, 4chan and reddit. People have lost jobs, families and even their lives after campaigns started on the internet. Campaigns run without due process or any real justice. Both myself and a number of other mods, together with the admins of reddit, take a very firm stand against witch-hunting. This is the basis for the /r/Politics ban. (Once again, I did not personally agree it was wise.) If laws are broken we are the first people to report this. We do <em>not</em> think it's our job to prevent anyone from ever being <em>offended</em>, as that's impossible to police.</p> <h2>Gawker: the block remains</h2> <p>I do not think we will unblock Gawker \u2013 not for the foreseeable future, anyway. There would need to be a major change in the way Gawker approach stories like this before they [the mods] would reconsider. We have not formally discussed this, however.</p> <p>As for the creepshots subreddit itself. I only visited it once, and saw nothing that caused me much concern. Certainly it was nothing worse than <a href=\"http://tubecrush.net/\">this site</a>. It was distasteful, but only as distasteful as your average Daily Mail sidebar. It had a very small number of readers (about 3,000) until it was linked by the mainstream press. </p> <p>People need to view the Reddit website as more like [free blogs space] Blogger than [\"social news\" site] Digg. If there was a distasteful blog on Blogger, people would not accuse Google of having direct editorial control over that blog. They also would not accuse readers of a separate blog of condoning the views of the offensive blog.</p> <p>The sections being user-created and moderated makes a huge difference that people always overlook. Chen's concern over \"double standards\" is almost comical when viewed from this realisation. Different subreddits are completely different animals.</p> <p>We have large and thriving LGBT communities, religious communities, self-help communities, music, TV show and book communities.</p> <p>Just because a few hundred people do something you disapprove of in one dark corner does not mean all these other people are tacitly supporting them.</p> <p>I do believe that Reddit (the company) needs to think about how it wants to deal with problems like this. Reddit (the site) is becoming mainstream now and the owners need to make a choice between being the spiritual successor to &amp;totse, SA and 4chan - or if they want to be the family-friendly front page of the internet. </p> <p>I don't think they can be both.</p>",

  "<p>The drunken sailor described in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/09/transport-transport-hull-creown-court-goole-docks-drunken-russian-skipper\">a <em>Guardian Northerner</em> post last week</a>, whose 'What shall we do with..?' headline drew many suggestions in the comments thread, has been jailed for 28 days.</p> <p>The sentence on 44-year-old Russian skipper Viatcheslav Poleshchuk is conventional compared to those in the sea shanty, but Judge Michael Mettyear said that it was designed to send a message to all sea captains.</p> <p>He told Hull Crown court that his scrutiny of case law, after adjourning last week to study previous, similar episodes, left him in no doubt that prison was unavoidable. An earlier hearing, at which Poleshchuk admitted being in charge of a ship while over the legal alcohol limit, was told that the skipper drunkenly asked police \"Can I have another go?\" after twice ramming the lock gates at <a href=\"http://www.abports.co.uk/Our_Locations/Hull_Goole/Goole/\">Goole.</a></p> <p>The judge told the disgraced captain, who has lost his command and job after the incident last month:</p> <blockquote> <p>It really does seem to me that a person as drunk as you were must expect a custodial sentence. The courts must send out a clear message that a custodial sentence is inevitable.</p> <p>This was really disgraceful conduct to be four-and-a-half times over the legal limit in charge of a massive boat. I accept there was no immediate danger, but there were others on board. When someone drinks as you did on board a ship, anything could happen. You were fully aware of what condition you were in. </p> </blockquote> <p>Poleshchuk's counsel Simon Norton said earlier in mitigation that the skipper had been told unexpectedly to leave the Yorkshire port earlier than expected with his cargo of scrap metal aboard the 3000 tonne cargo ship RMS Baerl. But the judge said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is not an excuse to say your sailing time had been brought forward. You could have put some else in charge or said you were not fit and delayed your sailing. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also made a geographical point about the effect of the sentence as a warning:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am not saying for a moment that all east European captains are guilty of this, but all the case law of drunken sea captains provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency enforcement unit features eastern European captains. </p> </blockquote> <p>The judge also fined Poleshchuk \u00a31,000 fine with \u00a3250 costs and ordered that if a wire transfer of funds from his family in Rostov failed to arrive, he would have to serve another 28 days in jail.</p>",
  "<p>Jo Milligan is slumped across the bare mattress of his single bed, awake but clearly undisturbed by the deafening roar and fumes of four lanes of traffic through the open window of the tiny bedroom. On a low table are an ashtray, cigarettes and a half-drunk can of Skol Super (9%&#xa0;abv) lager; it is early afternoon and he is already on his third can of the day in addition to a large bottle of cider.</p> <p>\"I'm trying to cut down to just six cans a day from seven,\" he slurs, barely able to see me because of the cataracts in both eyes, which will eventually lead to complete blindness if he does not have surgery. His last scheduled operation at nearby St Thomas's hospital did not materialise because he breached the necessary NHS detox programme that was a pre-condition of the medical treatment.</p> <p>So three weeks ago, Milligan returned here \u2013 Graham House Thames Reach hostel in Vauxhall \u2013 one of the largest homelessness hostels in London with rooms for 69 \"residents\" and \u2013 currently \u2013 seven dogs. Here, <a href=\"http://www.thamesreach.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Thames Reach</a> \u2013 one of the UK's leading homelessness charities \u2013 tries to help Milligan and others like him by giving them a roof over their heads and access to professional help and medical care, which will \u2013 in some but not all cases \u2013 lead to detoxification and rehabilitation elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>Place of extremes</strong><br></h2> <p>This autumn, the charity is stepping up warnings that its life-saving work is being made even more challenging by the prevalence of super-strength lagers such as Skol Super, Carlsberg Special Brew and Tennent's Super. Cheaper and more intoxicating than wine and spirits, these have become the drink of choice for people with an alcohol problem who gather in small groups on the streets to drink. Ranging between 7.5% and 10% in strength, these potentially deadly lagers and ciders are, according to the charity's research, now killing more homeless people than heroin or crack cocaine.</p> <p>In another hostel (not run by Thames Reach) 21 former rough sleepers died over two years probably from the health problems created by these super-strength drinks. Liver failure and brain damage \u2013 including <a href=\"http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=98\" title=\"\">Korsakoff's syndrome</a>, which leads to the familiar \"shuffling\" \u2013 are the grim long-term result, along with regular seizures and double incontinence.</p> <p>Jeremy Swain, chief executive of Thames Reach, says: \"These people are literally drinking themselves to death. These super-strength lagers and ciders were not around in the 80s and 90s, and they have no place in society today. It is scandalous that the drinks industry is making money from the most vulnerable and troubled members of our society.\"</p> <p>In the last year, Swain says that at least 17 Thames Reach clients from a variety of projects, including supported housing, died from drinking super-strenth alcohol, although the deaths could arguably have been from other factors as well as excessive drinking. To help address the problem, Thames Reach is about to start research with homelessness charities across England to establish how many deaths are being caused by super-strength alcoholic drinks.</p> <p>Another significant new trend is that people are dying younger, Swain adds. \"We are losing people in their early 40s rather than at 65. But many of them look much older because of the ravages of super-strength alcohol.\" Swain has witnessed the emergence of a new group of middle-aged people \u2013 the \"young olds\" \u2013 who have developed the health problems more commonly associated with people long past retirement age: poor mobility, memory loss and incontinence. Milligan, for example, looks as though he is in his early 60s but is only 38.</p> <p>Graham House is a \"wet\" rather than a \"dry\" facility, which means that residents are able to drink alcohol here. Many spend most of their time confined to their rooms, which are locked to prevent other residents wandering in. The hostel's senior practitioner, Sonja Sullivan, explains that the whiff in the corridor outside their rooms is because the residents have become doubly incontinent as a result of their drinking.</p> <p>Many wander round the communal areas, all with cans in hand, some slumped against the walls in corridors. Their alcohol dependence is so serious that if they were told they could not drink here they would simply leave and head back to their old haunts on the streets. This a place of extremes, where most of the residents have come after becoming homeless as the result of catastrophic personal trauma \u2013 prison, offending, abuse and bereavement as well as drug and alcohol addiction.</p> <p>Paul Cachia, alcohol case worker with the charity <a href=\"http://www.foundation66.org.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Foundation 66</a>, runs tailored sessions at Graham House, warning the residents of the dangers of long-term drinking and helping those who make the crucial decision to accept professional help. \"Nearly all my clients here are drinking 200 units of alcohol or more a week,\" he explains. \"When you compare that with a weekly limit of 14 for women and 21 for men, that means my clients are drinking 10 times over safe limits. You have to be realistic about what they can achieve. For many it is about harm minimisation or reduction, and this is where the problem with super-strength comes in.\"</p> <p>The cheap price is, of course, key to the attraction of the super-strength drinks. As a condition of its licence, the new Emerald supermarket opposite the hostel agreed not to stock alcohol stronger than 6.5% abv, and Swain believes that such community partnerships could be the way forward in encouraging retailers to take the offending super-strength liquors off the shelves. The charity is also backing a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/25/ipswich-bans-superstrong-alcohol\" title=\"\">recent initiative</a> in which retailers are voluntarily destocking their shelves \u2013 the first of its kind in the UK. Ideally, he would like a major supermarket to \"take a stand\" on the issue.</p> <p>Accepting that a complete ban of super-strength alcohol may be unrealistic, Thames Reach is calling on the government to increase the tax on the most harmful products, perhaps offset by taxing weaker ones less. It also believes the drinks industry and wholesale companies need to regulate themselves more responsibly \u2013 and if they fail, should be regulated by others. Significantly, after a visit to the hostel two years ago, brewery giant Heineken halted the production of its super-strength ciders.</p> <p>But another problem is when wholesale companies flood inner-city off licences with super-strength ciders such as White Ace. These come in three-litre bottles, containing a massive 22.5 units of alcohol for as little as \u00a33.99, only 17p per unit and less than half of the government's proposed minimum price of 40p per unit.</p> <p>Of those persuaded to enter alcohol treatment or switch to weaker brews, some do get their lives back on track. There have been \"fantastic\" success stories at the hostel, according to Cachia. One female client in her early 40s had been haemorrhaging from the oesophagus in a \"life and death situation'', he explained. \"She was in intensive care when I assessed her and had only 20% of her liver function \u2013 another drink would have killed her,\" he said. \"She came back to this wet hostel and stayed sober for a year before moving on. I have just given her a reference and she has apparently been accepted to study for a law degree. In the year and a half that I have been here we have had about six people who have gone through treatment and have moved on. That is six lives that have been turned round.\"</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Weddings series has been blamed for an increase in bullying and negative stereotyping of the Gypsy and Traveller communities.</p> <p>Educational consultant Brian Foster said there was \"no question\" in his mind that the Channel 4 series and its controversial poster campaign \u2013 featuring the strapline \"Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier\" \u2013 had caused \"real, measurable and long-term harm\".</p> <p>Foster, who chairs the advisory council for the education of Romanies and other Travellers, is also a trustee of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain (ITMB).</p> <p>He was commissioned by law firm Howe and Co, which represented the ITMB's complaint against the Channel 4 ad campaign, to consider the impact of the show in its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/03/big-fat-gypsy-weddings-stereotypes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">evidence to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)</a>.</p> <p>Foster said in his report: \"That harm is on a number of levels, including physical and sexual assault, racist abuse and bullying, misinformation and hostile questioning, resulting in damage to the self-esteem of children and withdrawal from school.</p> <p>\"Evidence drawn from practitioners across the country presents a consistent picture that the Big Fat Gypsy Weddings programmes have significantly contributed to racist bullying and abuse of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children in schools.\"</p> <p>Arthur Ivatts, an expert in the education of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities who worked as a senior policy adviser to the Department for Education for more than 30 years, was also commissioned by Howe and Co to provide evidence to the ASA.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt in my professional opinion that this advertising campaign has seriously damaged and harmed Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities and caused harm (physical, mental and emotional) to very many GR&amp;T children,\" he said in his report.</p> <p>\"Supposing the posters had said, 'Bigger, Fatter, Blacker'? Hopefully this example illustrates the point being made here in this report.\"</p> <p>The Channel 4 ad campaign was criticised by the ASA earlier this month. The watchdog ruled that it depicted a 15-year-old child in a sexualised way, reinforced negative stereotypes and said Channel 4 had acted \"irresponsibly\".</p> <p>The broadcaster has apologised for any offence it caused.

  "<p>Autumn has arrived in much of Europe but on boarded-up streets and in the corridors of government, political temperatures remain high. As European Union member states gather for a summit in Brussels, international tensions over how to manage Greece's bank bailout have spilled over, with the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a> now disputing openly the eurozone's Greek bailout strategy, and urging it to write off up to $38bn of debt.</p> <p>As the Guardian's Europe editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/iantraynor\" title=\"\">Ian Traynor </a>writes in this week's cover story, the showdown between the eurozone and the IMF \"is being described as eyeball-to-eyeball, a shouting match, and a contest to see who will blink first\". It will be fascinating to see which \u2013 if either \u2013 gives in.</p> <p>Inside the paper we examine the fallout from Australian prime minister Julia Gillard's row with the opposition leader about sexism in politics and society, which is being hailed as a possible turning point for the representation of women in the country.</p> <p>Further inside, in our Review section and on a related topic, we bring you an extract from Hanna Rosin's new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780670922642\" title=\"\">The End of Men</a>.

  "<p>Yorkshire were given a brutal reality check in their first game in the Champions League proper with a crushing defeat by a powerful Sydney team in Cape Town. Michael Lumb, the Nottinghamshire opener who was a non-playing member of England's World Twenty20 squad, ended unbeaten on 43 from 24 balls as the Sixers cruised to a tiny target with more than 11 overs to spare.</p> <p>Andrew Gale's young team, who were runners-up in the domestic Twenty20 Cup in the summer, had sprung a surprise by coming through the qualifying tournament despite the absence of the England internationals Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow. But a Sydney bowling attack including three seamers fresh from taking Australia to the semi-finals of the World Twenty20 \u2013 Pat Cummins, Shane Watson and Mitchell Starc, the left-armer who played a key role in Yorkshire's success last summer as an overseas player \u2013 represented a huge step up in class.</p> <p>Yorkshire started brightly after Gale won the toss and chose to bat, taking 13 off Starc's first over and reaching 29 without loss after five. But after Gale's dismissal, losing his leg stump to the highly impressive Josh Hazlewood, the innings pretty much ground to a halt.</p> <p>Crucially Phil Jaques, Gale's left-handed Australian opening partner, holed out for 21 from 19 balls in Starc's next over, a wicket maiden. Joe Root, the 21-year-old from Sheffield who is in contention to make a Test debut for England on the forthcoming tour of India, managed 25 from 24 balls with three fours and a hooked six off Watson .</p> <p>but he was bowled by Moises Henriques and the rest of the batting floundered. Cummins claimed two for 13 from his four overs, Starc ended with three for 22 and Hazlewood conceded only nine runs.</p> <p>Root was then given the daunting task of opening the bowling to Watson in the powerplay, and the big Queenslander duly crunched him for a six and a four. Root did catch Watson on the boundary in the next over from Ryan Sidebottom, but that only brought in Brad Haddin who belted 41 from 21 balls in a second-wicket stand of 78 in seven overs with Lumb.</p> <p>Yorkshire will now almost certainly have to win their three remaining matches \u2013 Mumbai Indians on Thursday, Highveld Lions on Saturday and Chennai Super Kings next Monday \u2013 to make the semi-finals. On this embarrassing evidence, Root will be heading home early next week, allowing him to link up with the England squad for their training camp in Dubai before the India tour.</p>",
  "<h2>SUN HILL DAY! EVERYTHING'S A-OKAY!</h2> <p>This being 16 October 2012, families the length and breadth of the UK are convening to celebrate the 28th anniversary of the first ever episode of The Bill being shown on ITV. Hurrah! Needless to say, Fiver Towers is no exception. Look! There's the Fiver's Scottish and English cousins Short Bread McFiver and $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver glueing a pair of souvenir Bradley Wiggins novelty sideburns across their upper lips, in homage to scruffy DC Tosh Lines. Remember? He was disorganised, but always got results!</p> <p>And what's this? Why, only the Fiver's Welsh cousin Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch Fiver, pushing his Norn Irish counterpart No! No! No! We Want To Go Down That Road Fiver down the stairs, in a tip of the hat to maverick old school DI Frank Burnside. Remember? Sergeant Cryer didn't trust him an inch! And over there, under a pile of coats, it's our loveable Irish cousin Theme Pub O'Fiver. He's sleeping last night off wearing the bobby's hat he stole on the way home, which is just a coincidence because he's never heard of The Bill.</p> <p>Of course with only one television in Fiver Towers and the national teams of all five cousins playing World Cup qualifiers tonight, a giant cartoon brawl \u2013 a massive cloud of dust with assorted fists, feet and colloquial expletives emerging from it \u2013 is almost certain to break out over which one they'll watch. Because with four of the five teams involved facing defeats ranging from the monotonously predictable (Croatia v Wales, Belgium v Scotland and Portugal v Norn Iron One-Nil) to the downright embarrassing (Faroe Island v Republic O'Ireland), nobody except $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver will want to watch their own team play.</p> <p>\"It is our job to make sure they do have an off-night and we can add to them having a frustrating night by taking our opportunity when it presents itself,\" said Norn Iron One-Nil manager Michael O'Neill ahead of his side's defeat in Lisbon tonight. It is a sentiment almost certain to have been echoed in different words by his Scottish and Welsh counterparts Craig Levein and Chris Coleman, but this being the Fiver, we're too lazy to check.</p> <p>Over in Torshavn, where the harbour is served by the Smyril Line international ferry service to Denmark and Iceland, Giovanni O'Trapattoni has been fending off difficult questions about his future as O'Ireland manager by talking about how often he has crossed the Alps in \"my bare feet\" and wondering if the hostile journalists quizzing him could write \"have they no the pen or no the computer\". He also asked them if they'd get fired for writing one really bad article, a fact we're loathe to mention here for fear of the sheer volume of reader correspondence it will generate.</p> <p>And finally, there's England. Good old reliable England, whose manager Mr Roy looks and sounds like a deceptively courteous conman being held in the Sun Hill cells and whose side's relentless march towards automatic qualification will continue against a decidedly average Polish side tonight. Ensuing victories will prompt no end of media cheerleading, which will inflate a giant bubble of national optimism that will be duly deflated in Brazil. Hackneyed and predictable with occasional moments of drama? It's just like The Bill, except England's story arc is endless and more of a loop.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em><i>Follow Poland 1-2 England, Belgium 4-1 Scotland and the rest of the night's World Cup qualifiers with our live MBM coverage from 7.30pm</i></em></a><em><i>.</i></em></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"He is just so ignorant, someone who just talks a lot and I don't like him.

  "<p>The first visit to the food bank is always the hardest. Michelle Venus, 52, cried. \"Not while I was there,\" she said. \"But before and after.\" Four years earlier, she'd been a homeowner in a $75,000 a year job. She'd donated to the food bank's fundraising drives. Now she was there to pick up food she couldn't afford to buy. \"It was not what I'd expected for myself or from myself. It was just a really hard day.\"</p> <p>Mark Weaver, 54, the former chairman of nearby Loveland chamber of commerce, tried to avoid the gaze of acquaintances he'd met when he attended the food bank's galas. \"It was very humiliating,\" he says. \"I used to take clients to their events, and all of a sudden I'm living below the poverty line.\" He used to earn a six-figure salary plus commission plus benefits, and also chaired the Northern Colorado Legislative Alliance, which lobbied local politicians on behalf of the business community. He made up his mind to go after a friend, a well-paid software engineer who'd also fallen on hard times, told him to: \"Get over being proud.\"</p> <p>The queue at the Larimer County food bank in Fort Collins, a town of 147,000 in northern Colorado, snakes out of the door and is mostly silent. In line there are slightly more people than trolleys. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/09/land-of-free-home-of-hungry\">The number of families visiting here</a> has increased more than 50% over the last five years. On average they also visit more often and need more food. </p> <p>In the parking lot there are only two bumper stickers \u2013 one for Mitt Romney and one for the US navy. Inside it is set up like a grocery store. People take what they need, although there are limits for some items such as bread. From the outside, if you didn't know it was a food bank, you might think they were going to the cinema.</p> <p>People often think they know what poverty looks like until they end up here, and then they realise it looks like them and many other people that they know. Weaver lives in a nice area. The first he knew that his next-door neighbour was struggling with his mortgage payments was when his house was foreclosed on and he was moving out.</p> <p>The official poverty rate in the US has risen 19% since 2000 with just under <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/americans-access-basic-necessities-recession-level.aspx\">one in seven Americans now poor</a> and one in five reporting they did not have enough money to buy food last year.</p> <p>But since the beginning of the financial crisis it is the 'precarity rate' that has really taken off \u2013 the number of people who feel economically precarious. Those who fear poverty, look it straight in the eye at the end of every month, face a constant battle to avoid it or slip in and out of it while struggling to retain every semblance of middle-class stability. People who may have high school diplomas, college degrees, pensions, good credit and mortgages, juggling aspiration and reality, who find themselves one lay-off or illness away from a steep and dizzying descent into hardship.</p> <p>More than the half the people who use the Larimer County Food Bank are working. One in 10 have at least a college degree, almost a third have no health insurance and more than half have unpaid medical bills.</p> <p>\"There's been a real difference, not only in the number of people that we serve in recent years,\" explains Amy Pezzani, the food bank's executive director. \"But also in the kind of people we serve. People think that if they're not living in poverty then they're middle class. But the official poverty level is such an unrealistic indicator of economic status. Most of the people who use the food bank are working people. These used to be referred to as 'emergency food pantries', but now it's like people are having an emergency every day. It's really just a way to exist.\"</p> <h2>'There are more people struggling that the official numbers show'</h2> <p>Last year the census bureau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/poverty-gets-new-measure-at-census-bureau.html\">released a new measurement of poverty</a>, which takes regional cost of living, medical payments and other expenses into account and found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/us/census-measures-those-not-quite-in-poverty-but-struggling.html\">a third of Americans are either in poverty or desperately close to it</a>. Half are married, almost half are suburban. \"These numbers are higher than we anticipated,\" Trudi Renwick, the bureau's head poverty statistician, told the New York Times. \"There are more people struggling than the official numbers show.\"</p> <p>This is the fragile economic terrain on which the election is being fought: the needs and aspirations of the ever-expanding numbers of America's working poor and the far larger ranks of those anxious about joining them.</p> <p>These are the people most likely to be offended by Mitt Romney's suggestion that 47% of the country see themselves as victims, who most needed the kind of change Obama promised four years ago, and have been least impressed by the apparent lack of it. These are the people at whom the ads attacking Romney's record of outsourcing and asset-stripping at Bain Capital were aimed.</p> <p>They are also the ones the Tea Party sought to galvanise through their populist message against the bailout and in defence of small business. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html\">A New York Times poll in 2010</a> revealed that more than half of those who identified as Tea Party supporters were concerned that someone in their household would be out of a job in the next year, while more than two-thirds said the recession had been difficult or caused hardship and major life changes.</p> <p>A slim majority of Americans <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">now define getting ahead as \"not falling behind\"</a>. That describes life for many here in <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/exec_summary.htm\">Larimer County</a>, where between 2006 and 2010 <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/median_family_income_ec_ind.htm#chart3 \">median family income</a> (adjusted for inflation) shrank by 9% leaving around a third of homeowners <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/homeownership_cd_housing.htm#chart4\">paying 30% or more of their income for housing</a>.</p> <p>The number of people using food stamps, and applying for heating assistance over the last six years has rocketed. Over the past 10 years the number of children getting free and reduced lunch doubled, while <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/higher_education_enrollment_ed.htm#chart4\">in-state tuition fees at Colorado State University</a>, which has a huge campus in town, increased 138%.</p> <p>The Fort Collins Homelessness Prevention Initiative, which provides one-time grants for emergency rent assistance, has seen a 50% increase in the number of people they are helping every year. \"We mainly serve two kinds of people,\" explains executive director Sue Beck-Ferkiss. \"One are the pay-check surfers who are used to skating by on very little. But we also see more people who are falling out of the middle class. It could be a couple who both worked on contract. The work dries up. But the world doesn't stop just because your income stops. They wipe out their savings and maybe they end up here.\"</p> <h2>'I don't think the Republican party cares about people like me'</h2> <p>Larimer County is a swing county in a swing state. It voted for Bush twice, but went for Obama in 2008. Now Colorado is on the fence and Mark Weaver is right there with it.</p> <p>Mark is one of those rare species this election. An undecided voter with genuinely eclectic views. He's an evangelical Christian who is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy, who wants to rein in the deficit, thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion although he'd rather peoples' hearts changed than legislation. He voted for John McCain last time because he didn't think Obama had the experience, and was a registered Republican until July 4 when, appropriately enough, he registered as an independent.</p> <p>Both campaigns are spending millions to reach him with microtargetting on the issues they think will swing his vote their way. They're also bombarding him with ads. But all they are earning so far is his contempt. \"If you took all the money they spent on the political system and elections you could feed the world,\" Weaver says.</p> <p>He's not particularly impressed by either candidate. \"Somebody's got to fix the economy, but I don't know that either of them has the guts to do it,\" he says. \"I'm looking to vote for someone I like and trust; I've never been more distrustful of the whole thing. I wish we could vote for none of the above. I want a do-over.\"</p> <p>Mark's fortunes began to change in the summer of 2009 when was a human resources manager in a company with 1,500 employees. He was let go and replaced by a colleague 20 years his junior on half his salary. He could have found other work elsewhere in the country, but that would have involved uprooting his three children, and he didn't think that was fair. He got another job in a start-up that involved a long commute and eventually collapsed owing him money. With his mortgage paid off and no debts, the biggest expense for a family of five was healthcare. Since everyone in the family was healthy they contemplated doing without it.</p> <p>Then his youngest daughter got bitten by a rattlesnake. \"That would have been a six-figure healthcare bill,\" he says. \"If we'd gotten rid of healthcare at that point we would have been sunk.\" It was around that time he started going to the food bank. He stopped after he got a job at a major bookstore as a night-time accountant and head cashier paying just $9 an hour but with good health benefits, and is now getting a human resources consultancy practice off the ground.</p> <p>When Pezzani heard the tape of Romney referring disparagingly to the 47% of the country who don't pay taxes she was unimpressed. \"It's very difficult to see the folks that we're serving maligned in that way,\" she says. Beck-Ferkiss at the HPI has similar reservations. \"It's hard for me to believe that Romney is focused on the population that I serve,\" she says.</p> <p>Mark, however, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">it just confirmed everything he already thought</a>. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him. It was exactly the same as Obama saying \"You didn't build that\". Those were exactly the words I would expect to come out of his mouth.\"</p> <p>Michelle, on the other hand, was devastated. \"I was heartbroken,\" she says. \"I was highly offended. I thought he's just disrespected me personally. I just don't think the Republican party cares about people like me.\" Michelle describes herself as a lifelong Democrat. She had not long moved to the Fort Collins area when her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. They had health insurance, but with only one salary coming in they ate through their savings just to keep afloat. \"We raided our personal accounts to survive.\"</p> <p>She got a job in marketing paying $75,000 a year and remained relatively comfortable in the 2,400 sq ft house she was buying. Then she lost that job and went into consulting. \"I just kept going,\" she says. \"I lived through recessions before, and assumed I'd come out the other side.\" But work was drying up and when her boyfriend of six years killed himself last March she struggled to keep up. \"After that I'd get up to feed my dogs but that was about it.\" When a client complained that she wasn't meeting deadlines she texted back: \"I'm just not trying to kill myself.\"</p> <p>Struggling to pay the mortgage on the house, which had been sold on from her bank to a loan company, she tried to renegotiate. In a conference call with an adviser and the lender, she was told that it made more sense to foreclose on her than change the terms of the loan. \"I stopped paying the mortgage and got the house ready to sell,\" she says. She managed to sell it for a small profit and move into a place less than half the size with her son. It was around this time she found herself crying as she prepared to go to the food bank. \"I just couldn't make ends meet,\" she says. \"I don't go every week. Just when I really need something. When I first went I was worried that I would see people I knew. \"</p> <p>Now she's starting a new career as a journalist and has scaled down considerably and muddles through. \"I have an understanding mechanic,\" she says. \"If something happens to my car and I can't pay him everything he let's me pay what I can.\"</p> <p>She thinks things are getting better, although she wishes they would improve faster. She blames the slow pace on the Republican congress rather than Obama. \"He tried to incorporate some of what they want but ever since he got in all they've wanted to do is get him out.\"</p> <p>The ramifications of the inability of the nation's political culture to engage with this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\">increasingly pervasive sense of fragility</a> goes beyond the immediate election. Since the financial crisis began five years ago, the significant shift in Americans' economic wellbeing has posed a considerable challenge to both national mythology and the political rhetoric on which it is built.</p> <p>Among other things, the American dream rests on the notion of meritocracy and progress \u2013 that those who work hard will get on, that each year will better than the last and each generation better off than their parents'. Since 1977, when Gallup first asked if people thought they would be personally better off the following year, an overwhelming majority say yes every year, even though there have been four recessions. It's not a guarantee of success \u2013 indeed, quite the opposite. Inequality of wealth, and the poverty that comes with it, is tolerable on the understanding that there will be equality of opportunity. While only 2% described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\".</p> <p>\"Because differences in income in the US are believed to be related to skill and effort, and because social mobility is assumed to be high,\" <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/events/2012/09/20-middle-class-pathways#ref-id=20120920_ES_Sawhill\">argued Isabel Sawhill</a>, co-director of the Centre on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution in September, \"inequality seems to be more acceptable than in Europe\".</p> <p>But the recent downturn has delivered a severe dent to that self-image. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/business/economy/family-net-worth-drops-to-level-of-early-90s-fed-says.html?_r=1\">A report earlier this year</a> showed that between 2007 and 2010 the median American family lost a generation of wealth. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147350/Optimism-Future-Youth-Reaches-Time-Low.aspx\">Most Americans believe it unlikely</a> that young people will have a better life than their parents \u2013 the highest on record.</p> <h2>'I still feel the American dream is available to me'</h2> <p>Meanwhile, as the National Journal's Ron Brownstein made clear recently, the sclerotic effects of class entrenchment are <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/is-american-faith-in-upward-mobility-faltering--20120926\">becoming ever more deeply embedded</a>. In a study called 'Pathways to the middle class', Sawhill and two colleagues pointed out that nearly two-thirds of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of income stay in that category as adults, while more than three-fifths of children born into families in the top fifth remain in theirs.</p> <p>But despite that it seems the belief in the American dream remains steadfast. Eighty-five percent of Americans still believe theirs is the land of opportunity, <a href=\"http://www.allstate.com/heartland-monitor/getting-ahead-h14.aspx\">while other polls over the last four years</a> reveal a sizeable majority of Americans still believe \"the American dream is still possible and achievable for \u2026 people like you\".</p> <p>When Mark reflects on the last few years he falls back on his faith. \"This experience has definitely made me more humble. I think God's made me more authentically who I am.\"</p> <p>Having moved into a smaller home with her teenage son, Michelle now wonders why she surrounded herself with so many things she didn't need. </p> <p>\"When I was working, if I saw something I wanted I would buy it. Now I wonder if I really need it. When I see people in Target getting all these things for Halloween I think: what are you going to do with all that stuff? Where are you going to put it? I still feel the American dream is available to me. I'm not prepared to let that go yet,\" she says. \"But I no longer think it's about being a consumer.\"</p>",
  "<p>Channel 4 chief David Abraham has said he can't recall seeing an image of a 15-year-old girl in a low-cut top prior to its use in a campaign to promote Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, despite the broadcaster telling the advertising watchdog the ads were all approved at the \"highest level\".</p> <p>The Channel 4 chief executive was forced to offer a public apology for the ad campaign \u2013 which used the strapline \"Bigger. Fatter. Gypsier\" \u2013 after it was condemned by a committee of MPs as offensive and irresponsible.</p> <p>The poster campaign was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/03/big-fat-gypsy-weddings-stereotypes\" title=\"\">censured by the Advertising Standards Authority</a> for reaffirming negative stereotypes and prejudices and depicting a child in a sexualised way.</p> <p>Channel 4, in its submission to the ASA, had said that the campaign was approved at the highest level of the broadcaster.</p> <p>However, Abraham, appearing before the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday, said he could not recall if he had seen the most contentious of the four images \u2013 two girls in low-cut tops, one of whom was 15 at the time of the photograph \u2013 before it appeared on billboards.</p> <p>\"I was aware of the overall approach but not the detail,\" said Abraham. \"I can't recall whether I saw this particular advert. I definitely saw the advert with the horse, and the one with the boy.\"</p> <p>Committee member and Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said the campaign had caused \"immense distress and upset\" in the Gypsy and Traveller communities, who \"quite clearly feel so far that Channel 4 hasn't expressed a strong enough or categorical enough apology\".</p> <p>Abraham said the broadcaster had taken \"great care\" in getting permission from the people featured in the photographs and their families. \"We were absolutely of the view that the child was 16 when the advertising ran. Those photographs were taken at a New Year's Eve party [and] taken out of context,\" he said.</p> <p>But another member of the committee, Tory MP Damian Collins, said it was Channel 4 that had taken the photographs out of context. He said: \"They are two young girls, one of whom was 15 when the photographs were taken, wearing low-cut tops. I would think that was irresponsible, I would hope you did too.\"</p> <p>Abraham said: \"We have categorically apologised if we have offended sections of the community. The fact remains we are proud of the programme and its ability to shed a light on the [Traveller and Gypsy] community.\"</p> <p>The ASA said in its ruling on 3 October that Channel 4 had acted \"irresponsibly\" by including the sexualised image of a 15-year-old girl, and also criticised its use of the picture of an aggressive looking young boy.</p> <p>It later emerged that a Channel 4 art director had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/11/big-fat-gypsy-weddings-dirty-kiss?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">tried to persuade the photographer working on the campaign in an email</a> to take pictures of a \"very young girl pretending to be a bride\" and also a \"dirty kiss ... with a tongue\".</p> <p>Abraham said only one of the four photographs used in the campaign was taken after what he called the \"ill-advised email\". He said the email, sent by Pablo Gonzalez de la Pena, \"did not reflect the approach of Channel 4 and the individual has apologised and we have apologised as well\".</p> <p>He added: \"We would absolutely distinguish between the ill-advised writings of a relatively junior member of staff and the overall approach of the programme and the campaign.\" He said de la Pena had been \"formally reprimanded and put on a training programme\".</p> <p>\"He took a personal view to express to the photographer to take a more sensational approach, which was not what the original brief to the photographer was.\"</p> <p>In evidence provided to the ASA by law firm Howe &amp; Co, which represented the Irish Traveller movement in Britain in its complaint against Channel 4, it said the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding programmes had \"significantly contributed to racist bullying and abuse of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller children in schools\".</p> <p>It said the billboard campaign had \"played its part and to some extent exaggerated the effect of the programmes\".</p> <p>But Abraham, giving evidence to MPs, said the programme had shone a light on a marginal community about which the public previously knew little about.</p> <p>\"The research suggests three times more people have a positive understanding of the community than they did before they saw the programme,\" he said. \"The people who participated in the programme and the advertising campaign were very comfortable with it.\"</p> <p>Channel 4 has said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/23/big-fat-gypsy-wedding-axed\" title=\"\">there will be not be another full series of the big-rating show</a> but there are likely to be a number of specials next year.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<h2>What will happen to Gary McKinnon now?</h2> <p>The director of public prosecutions will now consider the charges brought in the US against Gary McKinnon and assess whether he should be prosecuted in this country \u2013 perhaps under the Computer Misuse Act. \"We are going to consider his case carefully and come to a decision as quickly as possible,\" a Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said. In the past, the CPS has said punishments available under such UK legislation were far lower than under equivalent laws in the US.</p> <h2>What are the charges against him?</h2> <p>Ten years ago McKinnon was originally indicted by a US court on eight counts of hacking into more than 90 US military computer systems. He is alleged to have gained access online from his home in the UK and faced up to 60 years in an American jail if convicted.</p> <h2>How will this decision affect others facing extradition to the US?</h2> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, is planning to introduce new legislation which will allow courts to decide where suspects should be tried. Other cases already in the extradition pipeline, such as that of Richard O'Dwyer, a British student wanted by the US authorities for allegedly breaching American copyright laws, may not be affected by her announcement, however.</p> <h2>What is the new 'forum bar' test that will be introduced?</h2> <p>The test will transform current extradition processes. It will allow a UK court to decide whether a person should stand trial here or abroad. As May told the Commons: \"This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas, if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so.\"</p> <p>It is meant to rebut accusations that the government is too willingly abdicating its responsibility for UK citizens and handing them over to foreign jurisdictions for trial.</p> <h2>Why have some critics accused the home secretary of double standards?<br></h2> <p>The family of the terror suspect Babar Ahmad, who was extradited alongside the radical cleric Abu Hamza earlier this month, welcomed the McKinnon decision but accused the government of selective justice.</p> <p>\"Many of our supporters are angry at what appears to be blatant old-fashioned racism under which all British citizens are equal but some are more equal than others,\" Ahmad's family said in a statement. \"Questions do need to be asked as to why within the space of two weeks, a British citizen with Asperger's accused of computer-related activity is not extradited, while two other British citizens, one with Asperger's, engaged in computer-related activity are extradited.\"</p>",
  "<p>Literature has saved my life. If I hadn't used writing as part of my rehabilitation from drugs and crime, I'd be dead, plain and simple. I've used reading and writing to support and guide me for most of my 45 years.</p> <p>In 2008, the Hay literary festival launched its first, high-profile collaborative project with Parc prison in Bridgend, Wales. I was proud to be part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/04/prisons.probation\" title=\"\">Hay in the Parc</a>.</p> <p>This September another literary festival \u2013 the first of its kind in England for young prisoners \u2013 was launched at <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/markets/homeaffairs/custodial/ashfield.asp\" title=\"\">Ashfield young offender institution</a>, in South Gloucestershire. For three days, 120 students were taken off the main timetable as the prison readied itself for exclusive visits from award-winning writers, including sports celebrities, musicians, ex-cons, dramaturges and rappers.</p> <p>Ashfield prison has been blazing a literary trail for educational events for more than 10 years, including a recent series of workshops with the Bristol Old Vic that led to one inmate securing an apprenticeship as a writer in residence. Soon after, I started my first residency at the prison. I co-wrote a BBC Radio 4 docudrama, Inside Out, with a group of young inmates. We recorded part of the play inside the prison walls. Not many prisons would back that kind of project so enthusiastically.</p> <p>The festival was put together by Ashfield's head librarian, Kelly Chong, its deputy head of learning and skills, Simon Emmett, and its education staff, with the blessing of Serco, the private company that runs the prison. The intention was to raise the awareness of literature as a force for long-term rehabilitation.</p> <p>\"The aim of the festival was to foster a love of literature and writing as a form of expression,\" says Chong. \"I wanted to dispel the myth of reading being 'boring' and for old people. We wanted \u2026 to encourage students to \u2026 look at the power of language as a cathartic tool to demonstrate to young men the opportunities available to them and also how much skill with language they already have.\"</p> <p>It was clear from speaking to the young inmates that the festival was changing the way they saw literature. \"It's great to have people tell me about language,\" one lad enthused. Another, who attended the <a href=\"http://www.hiphopshakespeare.com/site/\" title=\"\">Hip Hop Shakespeare Company</a> workshop, found it made him want to \"get my feelings down.\"</p> <p>When the students I work with are invited to see the world through the lens of their own experience, they always engage and produce startling, original, often moving work. I ran a Flash Fiction competition within the festival, offering books to winners as an incentive. They quickly came up with writing that had a clear, arresting quality.</p> <p>An English teacher at the prison told me he found the festival an effective tool for engaging otherwise disinterested students. \"It was good to see such talented people come into the prison and inspire the boys. It takes some guts to do that, but the positive effects are obvious.\"</p> <p>Authors and organisations at the festival included <a href=\"http://www.elencaldecott.com/\" title=\"\">Elen Caldecott</a>, <a href=\"http://nikeshshukla.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Nikesh Shukla</a>, <a href=\"http://www.timbowler.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tim Bowler</a>, <a href=\"http://theforgivenessproject.com/\" title=\"\">The Forgiveness Project</a>, Man Booker prize shortlisted writer <a href=\"http://peppergrain.com/tag/yvette-edwards/\" title=\"\">Yvette Edwards</a> and TV scriptwriter Tony McHale.</p> <p>Inspirational youth worker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/14/chris-preddie-buckingham-palace\" title=\"\">Chris Preddie</a>, awarded an OBE this year for his work with young people, was a highlight. He brought his passionate, machine-gun delivery to a series of workshops that electrified the room, winning over both students and staff. \"This guy made me look at my own life and really think about what I want to do next,\" said one wide-eyed young prisoner as he headed back to his cell.</p> <p>Emmett believes there is a clear future for the festival. \"The plan is for annual festivals and quarterly events to promote literacy. The whole idea is for the festival to have a legacy to continue to develop the literacy provision specifically through these types of events.\"</p> <p>Of all the prisons I've run residencies and events in over the last 10 years, Ashfield has been the most consistent, innovative and supportive, never afraid to take risks and invest cash and energy in setting up dynamic, educational projects.</p> <p>Chong says a number of young prisoners have asked how they can get hold of books. \"I've had lots of requests for books by Junior James and Alex Wheatle,\" she says. \"One lad asked about entering the national PEN Prison Writing Competition.\"</p> <p>It seems that reading and writing inside is becoming hip. The hope is that literature, in all its forms, can really be a bridge to a life free from crime. If it can work for me, it can work for anyone.</p> <p>Caspar Walsh is founder of the award-winning charity <a href=\"http://www.writetofreedom.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Write to Freedom</a></p>",
  "<p>Gypsy and Traveller officers working for councils share mixed views about government proposals to give local authorities new sanctions to eject Travellers and Gypsies from unauthorised sites before they have a chance to settle.</p> <p>Communities secretary Eric Pickles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/oct/12/eric-pickles-gypsy-traveller-communities\" title=\"\">announced the new powers </a>for councils \u2013 which would involve issuing \"temporary stop notices\" and unlimited fines \u2013 at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham last week.</p> <p>But Bill Forrester, chair of the National Association of Gypsy and Traveller Officers <a href=\"http://www.nagto.co.uk/\" title=\"\">(NAGTO)</a>, says many professionals are already achieving these ends without the promised extra powers. \"What a lot of us are doing now about this issue, is maintaining contact with planning enforcement officers and their work with unauthorised sites, to prevent them getting out of hand. That approach appears to work.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state's announcement of a new policy on the Gypsy and Traveller communities has coincided with a call to draw up a national model for looking after their needs. According to Pauline Burton, Gypsy Liaison Officer (GLO) at Leicestershire county council, pulling together a team of professionals from the local authority, health, police and education sectors can help to reduce public prejudice and provide Gypsies and Travellers with the most appropriate support at the right time.</p> <p>Burton, who is also a member of the NAGTO national executive committee, says: \"I would like to see the model we have developed in Leicestershire established all over the country, to have a multi-agency Gypsy and Traveller unit all in one place.\"</p> <p>The Gypsy and Traveller unit in the East Midlands is made up of a team co-ordinator and three GLOs, a police officer, an education welfare officer and a supporting people officer. Its remit includes helping with planning applications for permanent sites, as well as responsibility for evictions from unauthorised sites. While the unit is in charge of site management, it also works to increase understanding of the Traveller community and develop links. A similar multi-professional team already exists in Northamptonshire and discussions are underway about establishing a unit in Essex.</p> <p>The success of the East Midlands unit, which was set up three years ago and covers Leicester city, Leicestershire and Rutland, led to the creation of the Gypsy and Traveller Equity project. Its volunteers, together with the Gypsies and Travellers who take part in the project, have become the voice of the community, raising awareness about their lifestyle and culture.</p> <p>Burton says: \"They have become a voice for themselves, which is much more important than having somebody like me. No GLO should be talking about Gypsies and Travellers \u2013 they should be talking themselves.\"</p> <p>There are thought to be around 125 GLOs in England, working for local authorities and traditionally based in housing and environmental health teams, yet there are few nationally accredited qualifications for these staff.</p> <p>Until last year, the Chartered Institute of Housing offered an accredited Level 3 professional housing qualification for people working with Gypsies and Travellers. The course was unusual in two ways: firstly, Gypsies and Travellers were learning alongside professionals; secondly, it was thought to be the only course of its kind that offered Gypsies and Travellers the chance to complete a national Level 3 qualification. However, the course folded last year, after local authority funding dried up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.swcouncils.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=431\" title=\"\">South West Councils</a> in Somerset, which represents the interests of local authorities in the region but also has a national training arm, runs a Level 3 Btec advanced award in management of Traveller and Gypsy sites. The qualification includes learning about site management, planning law, health and safety issues and current government policy around the Gypsy and Traveller communities and their sites. The organisation is in the process of developing the course into a Level 4 qualification, which will include a new module about Gypsy and Traveller culture.</p> <p>Fay Edwards, director of learning at South West Councils, says the qualification now attracts a broad range of students from across the public sector, amid growing interest in Gypsies and Travellers. \"What we have found in recent years is that it's not just GLOs and Gypsy site managers who attend the course, we now get people from the police, from housing, and local councillors coming as well.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/housing/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network </strong></a><strong>for news, views and the latest job vacancies direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Unless you were living under a rock this weekend, you're probably aware that Felix Baumgartner, an Austrian daredevil, jumped out of a balloon 24 miles above the earth.

The Guardian's Leo Hickman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/shortcuts/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-key-questions-answered\">tackled a number of questions</a>, including: what was the biggest danger that Baumgartner faced?</p> <blockquote> <p>His team identified 16 key risks that had to all be overcome for the record attempt to succeed. They included ultraviolet radiation, wind shear, landing impact, extreme temperatures, hypoxia (oxygen starvation), decompression sickness, entering a flat spin during the descent, \"shock-shock interaction\" (an explosive effect when shock waves in the air collide when passing through the sound barrier) and fire aboard the capsule. But the team said two dangers hung over Baumgartner above all others \u2013 a \"breach\" in the suit or capsule, and the accidental deployment of a parachute.</p> </blockquote> <p>And how did they know where he would fall?</p> <blockquote> <p>Given that he reached a height of 24 miles above the surface of the Earth, it seems remarkable that he was able to land with such accuracy back on the desert floor in New Mexico. His team later confirmed that his landing site was just 23 miles from where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. Unlike an astronaut, Baumgartner remained within the Earth's atmosphere so never experienced the planet rotating underneath him as witnessed by anyone actually in orbit. His team waited for the perfect weather conditions when high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift were at a minimum. Once he exited his free-fall by deploying his parachute, Baumgartner was able to \"steer\" himself to a preferred landing spot. A beacon inside his suit meant his recovery helicopter was able to closely follow him.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Red Bull takes sponsorship to new heights </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397824728\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/15/1350303839057/Felix-Baumgartners-balloo-010.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Baumgartner's balloon and capsule, back on earth after the jump.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felix Baumgartner's balloon and capsule, back on earth after the jump.

The energy drink manufacturer has set a new high bar for publicity stunts, according to the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/15/red-bull-felix-baumgartner-sponsorship?intcmp=239\">Owen Gibson</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Sponsorship experts said on Monday that the online frenzy around Baumgartner's leap served to highlight trends that had been emerging for some time, as sponsors moved away from traditional models and towards their own bespoke spectaculars.</p> <p>\"The biggest trend in the last 10 years, and the social internet side of things has merely accelerated it, is that creating your own content has absolutely moved to the top of the agenda. The hackneyed old tickets, hospitality and perimeter boarding model is being left behind,\" said Tim Crow, chief executive of the sponsorship agency Synergy.</p> <p>Major brands have been talking for years about becoming content producers rather than simply paying media and rights owners to advertise or slap their logos on shirts and hoardings. But none have taken it as seriously as Red Bull.</p> <p>Red Bull were an early pioneer, trading in their sponsorship of a Formula One team to buy their own in 2004, for example. A couple of years later they bought the Major League Soccer team that was renamed New York Red Bulls. But most of their investment has been in extreme sport and in building up long-term links with individual athletes \u2013 funding an army of base jumpers, free runners, snowboarders, cliff divers and BMX riders for whom they could create bespoke events and completely control the content around.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Watch the entire jump</h2>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397743686\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/15/1350288211444/Felix-Baumgartner-011.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121015SkydivePress/121015SkydivePress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>",
  "<p>If you were a gamer in the 1980s, you knew Lords of Midnight. Released in 1984, first on the Spectrum and later on the Commodore 64, it was an absolutely singular adventure, a vast epic quest to destroy the evil witchking Doomdark and restore the land of Midnight to peace.</p> <p>Its designer, Mike Singleton, who died last week after having cancer, was already a veteran coder when he envisaged this role-playing fantasy classic. Originally a teacher, he started messing about on early computers such as the Commodore Pet and ZX80, discovering a talent for nippy arcade conversions, adeptly working within the ridiculous confines of these early systems. But in 1983, he approached Beyond Software with his idea for an ambitious adventure, allowing the player to control four separate characters as they traversed a desolate landscape, slaying dragons and taking on Doomdark's armies.</p> <p>The Spectrum was not capable of rendering an entire world to Singleton's vision, so he invented his own system named \"landscaping\". This involved drawing 32,000 images of the landscape, providing a view for everywhere players could look as they navigated the world, inputting simple navigational commands.</p> <p>And this considerable programming challenge was not the game's only claim to history. It was also one of the earliest titles to feature a day/night cycle, to allow control over more than one character and to successfully combine strategy and RPG elements. The protagonists could beat Doomdark in two ways; by stealthily destroying his ice crown or by defeating his armies. The former was a standard fantasy quest, the latter a military simulation. All this within thousands of times less processing power than a mobile phone.</p> <p>I was obsessed with this game. As a kid with a Commodore 64 in the early 80s, I had played countless blocky arcade game conversions by the time Lords of Midnight arrived, and I was immediately hooked by its comparative depth and ambition. The stark, stately landscapes were enormously atmospheric and somehow the loosely sketched lead characters \u2013 Luxor the Moonprince, Corleth the Fey, Rorthron the Wise and Morkin \u2013 had real stature and resonance.</p> <p>There was such a sense of literature about the whole thing. Brilliantly, your moves during the day were collated into a text commentary during the night cycle, which would detail the battles taking place throughout the realm. \"Night has fallen and the foul are abroad!\" read the text as the computer took its turn to manoeuvre Doomdark's troops against you. Such drama, such tension, and in the morning I would discover which of my armies had fallen and who had survived to wander further into the icy nothingness, searching for allies.</p> <p>The packaging, too, was beautiful. Lords of Midnight came with a lavish map and a novella written by Singleton, providing the backstory to the game. It all added to the experience and the immersive magic of the adventure. Lords of Midnight, like many fantasy titles of the time, operated somewhere between reading and gaming. It provided so much, but asked some more from the imaginative participant. Unlike today's role-playing adventures which effectively molly-coddle or batter us into a state of amazed supplication, Lords of Midnight and its sequels Doomdark's Revenge and The Citadel, required the gamer to become part of the fiction, an active interpreter, a student of the lore.</p> <p>I have also never forgotten the cruelly capricious nature of this world. The way that my mighty warriors could fight off a whole army, only to be attacked and slayed by wolves if they wandered into the wrong rocky pass. It could feel horrendously unfair, but it worked, because Singleton set out to create an uncaring world, a cruel slate, every bit as majestic and unyielding as Middle Earth or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/10/game-of-thrones-are-you-watching\" title=\"\">Westeros</a>. It was Lords of Midnight that sent me, an unwilling schoolboy reader, to Tolkien and Ursula K Le Guin. Nobody gives video games much credit for literary stimulation, but it happens, and I think it started here.</p> <p>This story doesn't end with Midnight. Singleton went on to code games until the current era. He made the brilliantly tense post-apocalyptic adventure Midwinter, as well as jobbing on games by LucasArts and Codemasters. But he ended his career on a nostalgic note, working on an iOS port of Lords of Midnight with longtime fan Christopher Jon Wild, who has written <a href=\"http://www.icemark.com/blog/archives/2012/10/16/night-has-fallen/\" title=\"\">movingly about his relationship with Singleton on his blog</a>. The iPhone version remains unfinished and Wild is not sure now that he is up to the task.</p> <p>As a gamer of more than 30 years, there are few games I remember actually unpacking and poring over \u2013 in the same way that music fans would scour the record sleeves of new releases. Lords of Midnight is one example. I had the map on my wall, I had a notebook, in which I scribbled my tactics and discoveries; it was where I also noted my trading missions in Elite \u2013 another game that relied on the collaborative imagination of coder and gamer.</p> <p>Singleton was an archetypal games coder of the 8bit generation. He had a vision of the epic adventures he wanted to create and he refused to be limited by the hardware on offer. Instead, he constructed his own idiosyncratic systems to conjure a craggy desolate realm from nothing. The video game industry is so young, we have not had to face losing too many of our heroes. But that is what has happened this week.</p>",
  "<p>Frankie Boyle has mounted a defence of some of his most provocative jokes, telling a high court jury his Channel 4 Tramadol Nights show was intended as \"ridiculous, over the top nihilism\".</p> <p>The Scottish comedian defended a series of Tramadol Nights sketches \u2013 including jokes about Muslim women in burkhas and his comments about Olympian Rebecca Adlington's looks \u2013 at the second day of his libel action against the publisher of the Daily Mirror on Tuesday.</p> <p>Boyle told the court that his jokes about immigration were intended as a parody of \"racism at the heart of British policy\".</p> <p>He said: \"I don't think British people are racist. I think it is a top down thing. I think you have a lot of rich and Conservative people who control our country who are racist and their views trickle down through things like tabloid papers. I think there is racism at the heart of British policy and has been both in Labour and Conservative times.\"</p> <p>Boyle is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/15/frankie-boyle-jokes-libel-mirror?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">suing Mirror Group Newspapers for libel</a> over an article that described him as a \"racist comedian\". He also claims he was defamed by the article because it stated that he was \"forced to quit\" the BBC show Mock the Week after a joke about Adlington.</p> <p>Asked about his use of the word \"nigger\" in an episode of Tramadol Nights, Boyle said: \"Context is everything. If you use this at a dinner party to insult someone that would be a terrible hate crime. It's not a word I would use lightly.\"</p> <p>He went on to tell the court how he had written more than 100 anti-war jokes and that far-right policies on immigration are \"the opposite of my views\".</p> <p>He added: \"I think one of the things about comedy is its easy to read stories in the papers and think it's a terrible thing for someone to have said but when you see it in the context of the show it can be more easily explained.\"</p> <p>Boyle later told how he was \"completely disgusted\" at being labelled a racist comedian. He said: \"I was just absolutely shocked by it. It just went against everything I've tried to do in my life and against everything I've tried to do in my work. I was completely taken aback by it, completely disgusted.\"</p> <p>The court heard how Boyle was confronted by an Asian man about the racist claim while out with his girlfriend and children in Glasgow.</p> <p>In one sober passage of evidence, Boyle accused Tony Blair of being a \"war criminal\" for his support for the war in Iraq, and described how he had been shocked to read Noam Chomsky's essays on Britain's imperial past.</p> <p>He later went on to show remorse for his infamous joke about Adlington on BBC2 show Mock the Week in 2008.</p> <p>The comedian left the show in 2009 and has repeatedly denied he was sacked because of the joke.</p> <p>He told the court jury: \"There was no malice in the jokes [about Adlington] in particular. I was really surprised by the Rebecca Adlington thing.\"</p> <p>Boyle said he had asked Mock the Week producers not to include a segment on the Oympics before the show was recorded, because be wanted to cover more serious topics.</p> <p>He added: \"I had no idea Rebecca Adlington was as famous as she was or that she had been a huge success.\"</p> <p>Asked by his counsel, David Sherborne, whether he was forced to quit Mock the Week over the gag, Boyle said: \"Absolutely not. The idea you would be forced to quit the show for saying someone looks like they are looking in the back of a spoon, it just seems ridiculous because they just don't sack people on those panel shows.\"</p> <p>Boyle will be cross examined by Ronald Thwaites QC, for Mirror Group Newspapers, on Wednesday.</p> <p>The trial before Mr Justice Eady continues.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<h2>This week's comedy news</h2> <p>We've been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/27/comedy-standup-new-offenders\" title=\"\">arguing about \"offensive\" comedy for years</a>. Now the law has stepped in to settle this thing once and for all. Mr Justice Eady will be adjudicating on whether offender-in-chief Frankie Boyle is \"racist\" \u2013 as the Daily Mirror called him \u2013 or mocking \"the views of people he detests\", as Boyle's legal people insist. Boyle has opened a libel action against the publishers of the Mirror, and his jokes are now being parsed in court for racist intent. According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/15/frankie-boyle-jokes-libel-mirror\" title=\"\">news reports</a>, Boyle told the court on Monday afternoon that his heroes include Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, saying he had been active in anti-fascist groups in the past.</p> <p>More intriguingly, over in the States, comic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/sarah-silverman\" title=\"\">Sarah Silverman</a> has <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/86557/obama-supporter-sarah-silvermans-campaign-labelled-sickening-rabbi\" title=\"\">likewise been brought to book</a> by a rabbi who accused her of \"using her Jewish background inappropriately\". \"Your culture may be Jewish, but your mind is not,\" wrote Texas youth rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt in <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/dear-sarah-silverman/2012/10/11/\" title=\"\">a letter to the Jewish press</a>. \"Nothing you say or stand for, Sarah, from your sickening sexual proposal to a Republican donor to your equally vulgar tweet to Mitt Romney, has the slightest thing to do with the most basic of tenets which Judaism has taught the world\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the creators of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/south-park\" title=\"\">South Park</a>, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are in court too, for an alleged copyright infringement in the animated series' Imaginationland trilogy. <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2012/10/south-park-creators-sued-by-a-guy-who-created-a-show-called-lollipop-forest-and-probably-isnt-crazy/\" title=\"\">Splitsider reports</a> that one Exavier Wardlaw claims the South Park character the Lollipop King plagiarises Big Bad Lollipop from his childrens' show, The Lollipop Forest. The case, as they say, continues \u2026</p> <p>There's been trouble too at the UK's comedy festivals. The Interactive Komedy festival in Kircaldy \u2013 home of Gordon Brown and, er, Michael Portillo's mum \u2013 was <a href=\"http://www.thecourier.co.uk/News/Fife/article/25370/refunds-confusion-after-kirkcaldy-interactive-komedy-festival-axed.html\" title=\"\">pulled mid-run last week</a>. The sudden cancellation nixed gigs by comics including Josie Long and Henning Wehn, and caused confusion as to whether and how ticketholders would be refunded. <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/10/14/16313/comic_had_indecent_images_of_kids\" title=\"\">Chortle reports</a>, meanwhile, that the Birmingham Comedy festival has had to axe one of its acts, Jim Kennedy, after he was convicted of downloading 4,500 pornographic images of children. None of this has stopped provincial cities seeking a piece of the comedy action \u2013 citizens have launched <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/colbertdoesdetroit\" title=\"\">a Facebook campaign</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/facebook-group-campaigns-for-comedian-stephen-colbert-to-visit-detroit\" title=\"\">bring satirist Stephen Colbert to Detroit</a>, after he repeatedly made detrimental gags about the city.</p> <p>Away from the real world and into the world of TV, where Jeff Garlin has been <a href=\"http://www.laughspin.com/2012/10/11/jeff-garlin-says-theres-a-decent-chance-for-a-new-season-of-curb-your-enthusiasm/\" title=\"\">raising hopes of a new series of Curb Your Enthusiasm</a> and mullet-toting soft rocker <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2012/10/30-rock-writer-sells-michael-bolton-sitcom-to-abc/\" title=\"\">Michael Bolton has signed to play himself in a new sitcom</a> penned by 30 Rock writer Tami Sagher.

The latest row surrounds the BBC's supposed censoring of gags about Savile on its flagship satirical shows Mock the Week and Have I Got News for You? Christmas came early for the Daily Mail and its stablemates this week when Mock the Week host Dara O Briain appeared to claim that \"Mock the Week bosses banned Jimmy Savile jokes\" \u2013 to <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/914822-dara-o-briain-mock-the-week-bosses-have-banned-jimmy-savile-jokes\" title=\"\">quote the headline in last Friday's Metro</a>.</p> <p>A closer look at O Briain's quote would reveal that he in fact said: \"The BBC were very cautious about that. I don't think they wanted anything about that on Mock the Week.\" Their \"ban\" \u2013 if ban it was \u2013 was not exactly totalitarian in its application, given that Andy Parsons went on to crack a joke about Savile on that night's episode, <a href=\"http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2012/10/12/16303/bbc_banned_jimmy_savile_jokes_on_mock_the_week\" title=\"\">as Chortle reports</a>. The sense that the Beeb is covering it's back isn't confined to the rightwing press, however. A commenter on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/10/blackadder-zach-galifianakis-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">last week's Laughing Stock column</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18842857\" title=\"\">PoorButNotAChav</a>, was convinced that reflections on the Savile story were suppressed on HIGNFY and Mock the Week: \"How can [these shows] continue to claim to be satirical if their response to the biggest news story of the week is either embarrassed silence or corporate spin? \u2026 If the BBC has exerted pressure on comedians, presenters and guests to toe a corporate line on the Savile story it should be ashamed of itself, and those people who willingly toed the line should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p> <h2>My pick of the best reader comments</h2> <p>Last week's news story about a rediscovered Blackadder script attracted comment, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18774683\" title=\"\">one from MZophiel</a> that surely raised a smile among fans of the series:</p> <blockquote> <p>Imagine they made another Blackadder. I'd be minaspeptic, frasmotic and even compunctuous. I'd certainly offer my most enthusiastic contrafibularities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leo Benedictus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/11/comedy-gold-eddie-murphy-delirious\" title=\"\">reviewed Eddie Murphy's Delirious</a>, \"arguably the most famous comedy show of all time\", in last week's Comedy Gold slot. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18799065\" title=\"\">Spaldy</a> spoke for most when he posted:</p> <blockquote> <p>It's his all time best stand up show even with the dated 80s homophobia. The Mr T impression cracks me up every time. He's no Pryor but he made comedy cool and fashionable in its day.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the homophobia issue, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18811487\" title=\"\">ianlarsen</a> had a handy tip:</p> <blockquote> <p>The convenient thing about the homophobia is that it's all at the beginning, so you can fast-forward through it if you can't stomach it. You could start at Mr T \u2026 or just head for James Brown.</p> <p>I saw Raw for the first time in years last week, and that's a little more uncomfortable throughout \u2026 In Delirious he's still fresh-faced and mostly sticks to family and pop-culture for his material (plus some really, really funny jokes about slavery). I understand why the purists go for Pryor, but to me Murphy was just screamingly funny, the great gags come every 10 seconds in Delirious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, a touching tale posted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18880030\" title=\"\">DONT</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/oct/15/stephen-k-amos-review1\" title=\"\">my own review of standup Stephen K Amos</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I saw Stephen K Amos at the Comedy Store in Manchester on my 18th birthday. Somehow he'd gotten wind of it being the official day I enter into manhood and proceeded to rip into me for being young throughout \u2026 Towards the end of the show Amos called me out again and said, \"Every time you masturbate during the next week, you'll see this,\" and he then pulled the most hideous gurn I have ever seen in my life \u2026 Now, over six years later I still see that monstrous gurn. Every time I think of sexual thoughts it's there, haunting me.

  "<p>The Conservative leader of a large unitary local authority has been ousted after trying to push through plans to part-privatise a range of key services.</p> <p>Alec Robertson lost his job at Cornwall council after moves by the cabinet he headed to press ahead with the reforms even though most members had voted against them.</p> <p>During a heated meeting to discuss whether Robertson should be removed, critics claimed the plans he had championed would take many services out of democratic control.</p> <p><a href=\"http://cllrgwalker.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Graham Walker</a>, an independent councillor, claimed the full council had clearly voted not to proceed with the \"privatisation of support services\".</p> <p>He said: \"This council rejected a policy that has no democratic mandate. This council rejected a policy that risks millions of pounds of Cornish taxpayers' money. Most importantly this council rejected a policy that risks losing meaningful control of services and ends any notion we may have of democratic accountability.\"</p> <p>Walker said Robertson's attempts to press on had shown disdain for members and for democracy. \"I no longer have confidence in a leader who chooses to put himself, ideology and party politics before the clear decision of the democratically elected representatives of the people of Cornwall,\" he said.</p> <p>Robertson's supporters said the move to oust him could leave the council, run by a coalition of Conservatives and independent councillors, rudderless at a time when it was having to manage deep cuts.</p> <p>Graeme Hicks, another independent councillor, said forcing Robertson out was damaging and destructive and had plunged the council into \"anarchy\".</p> <p>At one point during the debate, the chairman, Pat Harvey, called for security to remove a councillor who had accused a fellow member of being a \"backstabber\". A webcast of the meeting was halted for two minutes while tempers cooled. Such was the interest in the meeting that the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23ccwebcast\" title=\"\">#ccwebcast</a> trended on Twitter.</p> <p>Robertson is keen on the council working with a private-sector partner to help run services such as libraries, advice centres and assessing benefits claimants. He argued that such a move could realise 20% savings in the first two years and up to 5% annual savings thereafter, and create new jobs as well as protect essential services.</p> <p>In the summer the full council voted against the plan but the cabinet said it would press ahead. The communications giant BT and the outsourcing specialists CSC were bidding for the contract.</p> <p>The council is due to debate the issue again later this month, and Robertson said before his ousting that the cabinet had listened to the concerns and would, after all, respect the majority views of the council. But the change was not enough to save his job and 63 members voted in favour of his removal, with 49 against.</p>",

  "<p>Whether it's scandals over unsporting behaviour at the Olympics, or recent UK Border Agency decisions about foreign students, the cry \"It's not fair!\" seems to have been heard a lot .</p> <p>The problem seems to be one of balancing different notions of fairness and justice. All too often, those who suffer from a decision feel that the outcome is unfair, while those who have to make the decision feel that they are under an obligation to dispense justice impartially. Given the news value of these problems, it seemed worth looking at how the Guardian Weekly has reported on things fair and unfair over the last decade.</p> <p>In terms of simple numbers, the word <em>fair</em> (3,579 instances) occurs far more frequently than <em>unfair</em> (890). While you might think that this is because <em>fair</em> has a wider range of meanings (as in <em>fair weather</em> or <em>fair maiden</em>) it does not look as if this is the case in this newspaper, as it most frequently collocates with words such as <em>trade, trial, share, elections, play, election, minded, hearing, game, deal</em> and <em>price.</em> It is also found in the idioms <em>fair amount</em> and <em>fair enough</em>.</p> <p><em>Unfair</em> also occurs with: <em>trade, advantage, competition, trial, election</em> and <em>terms</em>, but is also found with <em>dismissal, discrimination, treatment</em> and <em>burden</em>. So while in both cases there is a clear focus on commercial and legal matters, <em>unfair</em> also gives an insight into the different kinds of unfairness.</p> <p>Looking at these social judgments from another perspective, we see that <em>legal</em> (7,368) and<em> illegal</em> (4,649) both occur more often than <em>fair</em>, and have very different collocates. <em>Legal</em> itself goes with <em>action, system, aid, challenge, battle, advice, experts, status, proceedings, rights</em> and <em>team</em> \u2013 a strong emphasis on the system of the law itself. <em>Illegal</em>, however occurs most frequently with a range of social issues that have high news value: <em>immigrants, immigration, migrants, drugs, logging, immigrant, trade, workers, drug, occupation, activities, settlements</em> and <em>war</em>: all contexts in which claims of <em>unfairness</em> might arise.</p> <p>It seems that issues of fairness are difficult things to report. If reporters lean one way they will be accused of taking sides with the powerless; if they lean the other they're lackeys for those in power.

But Catalonia is one of the richest parts of Spain (7.3 million people out of 47 million, against Scotland's 5.2 million out of 62 million) and its historical relations far more fraught \u2013 not least in the Spanish civil war of 1936-39 when it was a republican stronghold. Orwell's Homage to Catalonia is still a gripping read.</p> <p>Every case is different but let's not stop there. Among the world's more stable and mature societies, Canada is again threatened with a divisive battle over the independence hopes of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois\" title=\"\">Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois</a> now that the PQ \u2013 up and down over the decades \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/quebec-separatists-success-parti-quebecois\" title=\"\">has again won power in Montreal</a>. Pauline Marois is now provincial premier in francophone Quebec. Under economic pressure centrifugal forces vie with centripetal ones.</p> <p>Does Salmond follow these developments? You bet he does. So does Whitehall, which, so the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/15/scottish-independence-editorial\" title=\"\">Guardian's even-handed editorial</a> notes, has surprised Ottawa as well as Madrid by the ease with which it has exercised its reserved constitutional power to allow (not block) a Scottish referendum. It's a gamble for both sides.</p> <p>As noted everywhere, Salmond has also won over timing \u2013 a long runup \u2013 and over votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, though how this will be done is unclear, as Alan Trench writes on UCL's ever-authoritative Devolution Matters website at some length <a href=\"http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com\" title=\"\">here</a>. Cameron has won the battle to impose a binary question \u2013 yes or no \u2013 and to see that the neutral Electoral Commission supervises the detailed question (always important) and the referendum itself.</p> <p>Listening to Salmond and his deputy/successor Nicola Sturgeon at their press conference on Monday \u2013 Cameron thought it unwise to hold one too \u2013 I couldn't help but be struck by their emollient tone. That's only sensible. This vote will, as usual, be won by the undecideds who are neither passionate for the union nor for independence. Best to be civil and persuasive, best to ignore the uncouth heckling of Thatcherite hardliners like Lord Mickey Forsythe, a not-very-successful ex-Scottish secretary who accuses Cameron of being a Pontius Pilate. Politics is more subtle than that.</p> <p>But both Salmond and Cameron agreed that the deal was fair and that they would respect the result. The SNP claim to have won the battle for a \"Made in Scotland\" referendum \u2013 London had the power to block it \u2013 is important, because it makes it harder to cry foul if the polling results in 2012 are repeated in 2014. Alex Salmond says he is confident of victory, but he has to say that, just as his team has to say they will respect a no verdict, which we doubt, don't we?</p> <p>Yet Trench makes an important point when he says that by excluding the most popular option from the referendum ballot in the interests of a clear result the Edinburgh agreement makes Scottish voters the big losers. What option? English voters (more of whom would like to say goodbye than Scots would on some polling evidence) don't know much about \"devo-max'', the soft-independence option Salmond wanted included. But most Scots seem to favour more devolved powers, something London may concede after a no vote.</p> <p>It's possible in the unknown circumstances of 2014 that voters forced to say yes or no may decide that a yes is closer to their wish to see what Salmond \u2013 echoing the Irish debate of 100 years or so ago \u2013 is now calling home rule. The analogy is not perfect (no Ulster problem) but London's failure to grant it to Dublin in the 1880s and before the first world war led to the tragedy of 1916 and partition in 1921. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/15/uk-arms-northern-ireland-loyalist-massacre\" title=\"\">As Ian Cobain reports here</a>, the poison still drips.</p> <p>Though I'm a gut unionist I can see that life will go on if Scotland wants to go its own way, though it will consume unimaginable time, money and energy to unpick the union for uncertain outcomes. I'd say the effort would be better spent on improving the UK's economic and social performance as the unit it currently is. But sometimes the heart rules the head, which must be why Alex is so keen on giving votes to 16-year-olds. It does not suggest great confidence \u2013 and may well backfire.</p> <p>My problem in recent years has been the extent to which the SNP has chopped and changed on pretty important building blocks of the new state it hopes to create. In the 70s the message was a small modern state in a thriving new Europe, free of the anchor which was fuddy-duddy old England. That model doesn't look so clear-cut during the eurozone crisis when small peripheral states like Ireland are having more problems \u2013 and consequently less independence from EU control \u2013 than makes them comfortable.</p> <p>At least they are our own mistakes, say Irish patriots. It's a fair point. But Salmond now wants to keep the pound rather than embrace the euro, two states with one currency, not a fashionable formula. He wants to keep the Queen as head of state \u2013 much as James I and his heirs sat on two thrones from 1603-1707. It's a case of cheerfully making it up, adapting to changing times, which is what politicians are supposed to do. But it does make it all feel a bit rackety.</p> <p>Until recently Salmond also argued that both Scotland and Rump UK would have to reapply for EU membership \u2013 clearly not true, as Brussels has since made clear. Paris doesn't like the idea of breakaway states any more than other EU leaders do: 27 is quite enough of a headache without adding more, they feel. You can see their point of view too. Scottish business leaders, still unionist at heart most of them, want the uncertainty ended.</p> <p>But there has to be a proper debate and it has now been formally launched in a civil atmosphere, a good start. If I were Cameron or the \"Better Together\" campaign team \u2013 \"no camp\" sounds too negative \u2013 I'd be busy number-crunching the SNP's dramatic claim that an independent Scotland would be the sixth richest country in the world. It's a powerful claim. Let's find out how they did the sums.</p>",
  "<p>Vacancies for three supreme court justices <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/news/selection-commission-121016.html\" title=\"\">advertised</a> on Tuesday open up the prospect of increased judicial diversity in the UK's highest court. The appointments mark the largest changeover in judges on the 12 strong bench since the court was established three years ago. It is <a href=\"http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/about/biographies-of-the-justices.html\" title=\"\">currently composed</a> of eleven men and one woman, Lady Hale; none are from an ethnic minority.</p> <p>The information pack for candidates states that: \"The selection commission is anxious to attract applications from the widest field, and in making recommendations will bear in mind the nature of the court and the way it is likely to develop over the next few years.\"</p> <p>The salary is \u00a3206, 857 plus pension. One of the three posts will be filled by a Scottish judge to replace Lord Hope, deputy president of the supreme court, who retires in June next year.</p> <p>Another vacancy has been created by the departure of Lord Dyson, who has been appointed master of the rolls, the head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales. Lord Walker is due to retire in March next year.</p> <p>None of the remaining judges are due to retire until 2018 so there will be intense judicial and political interest in this round of selections.</p> <p>Judges are appointed on the basis of merit; a tiebreaker clause in the crime and courts bill, now going through parliament, would allow for the appointments panel to choose a judge from a less well represented social group if both candidates are deemed equally well qualified, but it is unlikely to become law in time for this selection process.</p> <p>A report by the House of Lords constitution committee earlier this year recommended setting targets to appoint more judges from among women and members of ethnic minorities if the judiciary does not make itself more diverse within the next five years.</p> <p>The selection commission chaired by Lord Neuberger, president of the supreme court, will include the judicial appointments bodies for the UK. Under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the selection panel must consult a list of people about their nominations including the lord chancellor (Chris Grayling) and \"the senior judges\" - that means the supreme court judges, the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls, among others.</p> <p>Successful candidates are expected to demonstrate \"to an exceptional degree\" social awareness and understanding of the contemporary world, clarity of thought and willingness to learn about new areas of the law. Interviews are scheduled for December but the results will probably not be announced until next year.</p> <p>The woman most frequently tipped for judicial promotion is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/oct/11/lady-justice-hallett-profile\" title=\"\">Lady Justice Hallett</a>, 62, who presided over the July 7th bombing inquests, though she has also been mentioned as a possible next lord chief justice. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jul/19/next-lord-chief-justice\" title=\"\">Joshua Rozenberg wrote here</a> that Lady Justice Black is also a contender for the supreme court.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/about/appointments-of-justices.html\" title=\"\">qualifying criteria</a> are set out in legislation. Applicants must have been judges in the high court, court of appeal or court of session for at least two years, or they must have been practising solicitors or barristers for at least 15 years.</p> <p>Who would you nominate?</p>",
  "<p>Moore's debut<em> The Drowning Pool</em> took inspiration from the legend of a 19th-century witch to shape an alternative history of the Essex girl and a disquieting reworking of the ghost story. <em>Witch Hunt</em> opens with journalist Sadie Asquith landing a contract to write a book on Matthew Hopkins \u2013 the Witchfinder General, who cut a bloody swath through East Anglia during the English civil war. Reeling from the untimely death of her mother, Sadie determines to assuage her grief through work, pushing aside doubts about her publisher, a Murdochian mogul with political aspirations. But as soon as she begins retracing Hopkins's path, Sadie is assailed by disturbances \u2013 the disappearance of her father-in-law, an anonymous email correspondence, a break-in at her flat and a series of visions, seemingly of Hopkins's victims, at the sites of their murders. Moore's merging of horror, ghost story, detective fiction and psychogeography is a heady addition to Jeanette Winterson's book about the witches of Pendle and increasingly popular genre mash-ups.</p>",
  "<p>This is the eighth book in Kennedy's Albany cycle, featuring dynasties of crooks, jazz musicians, politicians and heroes. The latest instalment harks back to events in earlier volumes, giving the large array of characters a deepening sense of history. In 1957 Daniel Quinn, journalist, follows in his grandfather's footsteps to Havana and is dramatically caught up in the Cuban revolution. Falling in love with glamorous, gun-running Renata Otero, he is plunged into powerful <em>santer\u00eda</em> magic, meets Hemingway and Castro and courts danger in the best tradition of the macho American hero-writer. Jumping forward to 1968, Quinn is back in Albany when Bobby Kennedy is shot and the city erupts with racial tension. He thrusts himself, as ever, into the action, championing the Black Brothers and filing news stories that provoke his paper's politically partisan owners. By turns muscular and experimental, realist and dreamlike, the novel moves swiftly back and forth along twin axes of time and location. Keep up and one is richly rewarded.</p>",

  "<p>The clich\u00e9s about pampered virtuosos are being put to flight. It is a small cost to football that the layabout individualist of yesteryear has very few counterparts in the top flight nowadays. Cristiano Ronaldo may work hard to look fashionable, but his efforts on the field are more prodigious still. At the age of only 27, he will collect his 100th cap when Portugal meet Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier staged in Porto.</p> <p>The time when some players seemed to regard international service as a burden seems to be over. If Ronaldo's trend-setting instincts are imitated it will be a boon to the game. Others could mimic the Real Madrid attacker's desire to play for their country with the same limitless desire that they do for their well-heeled clubs.</p> <p>On many occasions with Portugal, it must take self-control for someone like Ronaldo not to feel rueful that he lacks the calibre of team-mate to be found at the Bernab\u00e9u. There is no mystery about the uneven standard of a side drawn from a country whose population stands at just 10.5m, which is, for example, about one fifth of England's.</p> <p>All the same they were at no disadvantage while hosting Euro 2004, but Portugal, in the final, ended the tournament as they had begun it, with a loss to Greece. Ronaldo, at the age of 19, had at least notched his first international goal during that opening fixture.</p> <p>Opposing managers may curse him when his contributions amount to rather more than a consolation. It is intriguing for the rest of us, though, that no amount of thuggishness, computer analysis or tight marking can be counted upon to halt performers such as Ronaldo or the even more astonishing Lionel Messi.</p> <p>The shrewdest tacticians must have retreated into seclusion when Messi scored 73 goals for Barcelona in all competitions last season. Such a tally would verge on the unfathomable even for a player with an uncomplicated life, but Messi, of course, was diagnosed in childhood as having a growth hormone deficiency. The move to Barcelona when he was 13 secured the medical treatment he needed.</p> <p>The rivalry between Spain's dominant clubs should be enthralling in both its intensity and its capacity to entertain us. A player such as Ronaldo is also lucky to be at work in this period. We forget to appreciate how much technology has done to limit the wrongdoing and the harm done to players who have the effrontery to beat an opponent with sleight of foot.</p> <p>The entire attitude towards football has altered. It now seems strange that, for generations, it was understood that a winger could expect to be a victim of violence if he was at the peak of his form. Few who were present in Glasgow for the 1974 European Cup semi-final with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid will have forgotten the sight of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDElMvVdOK4\" title=\"\">Celtic winger Jimmy Johnstone being kicked in the testicles</a>.</p> <p>There was uproar over that occasion, but the tolerance of violence was greater then, particularly since television coverage could not be counted on to capture every dubious deed. The balance has shifted markedly since then. If anyone strikes fear, it will more commonly be a virtuoso such as Ronaldo or Messi rather that a brute of an opponent.</p> <p>Assuming they are in form, it can often appear that there is no legitimate means of denying them. That 73rd goal for Messi rounded off the 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the 2012 Copa del Rey final. In truth, however, the challenge of dealing with an exalted lineup does stimulate managers and players.</p> <p>Chelsea, having won 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, twice came from behind to draw at Camp Nou and so reach the last season's European Cup final, where they beat Bayern Munich in the penalty shootout. Messi had been unable to score in either leg of the semi-finals.</p> <p>It is a sign of all that he has achieved that people seem a little surprised when he is not a master of his destiny or that of his team. The same holds true for Ronaldo. Despite the weight of expectation on their shoulders, each of them seems elusive if not unstoppable.</p>",
  "<p>It was 40 years ago this month that screenwriter Kevin Laffan first introduced UK viewers to Emmerdale Farm. His vision was a \"26-episode play\" focusing on rural matters as seen through the eyes of a traditional, upright Yorkshire family, the Sugdens, who owned the eponymous holding just outside the village of Beckindale.</p> <p>Four decades later, you won't see a sheep coming down the high street for all the parkin in Yorkshire. Jack Sugden's concerns about milking are a distant memory. Now the inhabitants of Emmerdale are more worried about whether vicar Ashley will hit anyone again, or if a fatal slab of masonry is going to fall on Marlon's next girlfriend \u2013 his former beau Tricia didn't live to see 2004 <a href=\"http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/soaptrivia/soaps-most-tragic-deaths.php?ssid=6\" title=\"\">thanks to a chunk of the Woolpack</a>.</p> <p>Six nights a week, more than six million Emmerdale regulars tune in at 7pm for the soap, with its credits featuring a pair of male and female legs tripping naughtily upstairs for some illicit sex \u2013 perhaps just about right for a show that comes laden with sensationalism and melodrama.</p> <p>Laffan left Emmerdale in 1985, bemoaning its move towards \"sex, sin and sensationalism\". Later that decade, there were dramatic highlights such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbePgtUbAw8\" title=\"\">Pat Sugden's 1986 car crash</a> and, in 1988, a fire. But it was 1993 when then-new executive producer Keith Richardson decided to deal with falling ratings with a plane crash that wiped out four villagers. Sixteen million people tuned in \u2013 but not all were universally impressed. (Not least because the episode aired at around the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie disaster.) The stunt did, however, put a stop to rumours the show would be cancelled.</p> <p>\"It was driven by a need to get younger viewers, to please the advertisers,\" admits ITV's creative director John Whiston. \"Before, the soap was very much about the posh people who lived on the hill and had a control over the people who lived on the land.\" Now, Whiston says, that class element has changed. \"The people on the land often own their own houses. It's more modern, and less feudal.\"</p> <p>But some viewers still think fondly of the soap's heyday; of the old, reassuring Emmerdale that attracted audiences of 14 million in the late 70s and early 80s with its tales of mutton-chop-sporting rivals Amos Brearly and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qO8aZPq1k8\" title=\"\">Seth Armstrong</a>. Not since Thomas Beckett and Henry II has such bitter rivalry played out \u2013 albeit, once Seth got his allotment, over cabbages.</p> <p>So has Emmerdale abandoned its roots too much? Is that why it is, for some, the unloved ITV soap \u2013 always playing second fiddle to Coronation Street; marooned at 7pm and marking kids' bedtime?</p> <p>Anyone who works on any modern British soap will admit that it is difficult to balance news-grabbing storylines with maintaining credibility. In the old days, with just three channels, soaps such as Emmerdale could be far more sedate \u2013 a death or divorce was really was big news.</p> <p>ITV readily admits that Emmerdale has changed a great deal more than its stablemate Corrie. While the strong thread of northern humour that made Coronation Street so successful 50 years ago still beats at the heart of the show, Emmerdale retains less of its original character, even if the Yorkshire soap has retained a sprinkling of oldies, such as Betty and Alan Turner \u2013 who Whiston compares to Shakespeare's \"rude mechanicals\".</p> <p>But Emmerdale still has its fans. I went up to the set for a visit with a group of journalists on a lovely sunny day in early September. I can see why so many people call it one of the nicest working environments: there is a young cast, the atmosphere is hugely upbeat and jolly. Yes, the show features rather a lot of bed-hopping, and some of the characters and their behaviour stretches credibility. But at least it's all rather fun. I'll be looking forward to tomorrow night's live episode, at any rate. But will you? Let us know if you're still watching \u2013 and why.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney has pulled <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/11/mitt-romney-leads-national-polls\">even, (or even slightly ahead, in national polls</a> with President Obama since their first debate. The problem for the Republican is that this election will be won in a handful of key states. As I've pointed out in the past, and as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/2012-polls-obama-battleground_n_1966564.html\">Huffington Post's Mark Blumenthal emphasised Monday</a>, Romney seems to have a swing-state problem.</p> <p>The balloons on the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">Is Mitt Romney the President?</a> interactive graphic tell the story. Based on state polling, Romney would lose the electoral college by 294 to 244 electoral votes. Even adding in Virginia, where the <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">HuffPollster aggregate</a> has Romney slightly ahead, Romney is still down 281 to 257.</p> <p>This leaves Romney 13 electoral votes shy of an outright electoral college majority, and 12 electoral votes shy of a tie (the latter would likely result in a Romney presidency given that Republicans will hold a majority of delegations in the House of Representatives in 2013).</p> <p>So, how does Romney get over the top?</p> <p>Let's assume that Romney wins all the states I believe he's leading right now. Let's also assume Obama wins all the states where he holds at least a 3 percentage point lead. That leaves with five states where he can win, but isn't ahead at this moment: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</p> <p><strong>Ohio</strong></p> <p>Ohio has 18 electoral votes; taking these would result in Romney earning 275 electoral votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791154\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335705463/Ohiomap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The polling hasn't <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/sites/default/files/ohio%20post%20debate.gif\">exactly been consistent</a> in the Buckeye state. There are polls with Romney ahead, some with him just behind, and others giving Obama an approximate 5-point lead. Some have said Romney trails because of his <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2012/08/26/159987867/romneys-auto-bailout-stance-complicates-campaign-in-battleground-ohio\">opposition to the auto bailout</a>. Either way, it is the state with the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/2012-presidential-campaign-visits/\">most candidate visits</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DomenicoNBC/status/257895438580056064\">most money spent on television ads</a> except Florida. Ohio is also a state that is rarely more than a point more Democratic than the national vote, which suggests the closer polls could very well be right. </p> <p><strong>Nevada and Iowa</strong></p> <p>Without Ohio, Romney has to win at least two states. Iowa and Nevada look like two possibilities, with six electoral votes each, for a combined 12. This would get him to the minimum 269 electoral votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791155\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335740918/nevadamap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Nevada electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nv/nevada_romney_vs_obama-1908.html\">polling in Nevada</a> has been close for most of the year, yet Romney has only led in one poll conducted in 2012. It's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108604/nevadas-democratic-registration-numbers-jeopardizes-romneys-chances\">also a state</a> where Democrats have run up registration and where the polls have often overestimated Republican strength. On the plus side for Romney, it's a state with a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/03/politics/nevada-mormons/index.html\">large Mormon population</a>. Also, the pollsters who performed well in Nevada in the last few elections are not showing Obama with any greater advantage than other polls. </p> <p>Iowa is an interesting state in that there really isn't a middle ground. Its Democrats are very liberal, and its Republicans are very conservative. Romney led in a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ia/iowa_romney_vs_obama-1922.html\">number of polls</a> earlier in the year. He seemingly fell behind by more than 5 points in September. There are some signs that he's making some progress in the state, but it's a state with few polls recently. We'll need to see more data before knowing if it truly can be a staging-post for Romney's march towards the White House.</p> <p>This map might not be too alluring in that a tie in the electoral college <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/28/us-electoral-college-explained\">risks a split-party presidency</a>. Romney may have the necessary seats in the House to get elected, yet it is quite possible that Democrats will control the 50 seats in the Senate in the event of a tie, which would get Biden elected vice-president. I can't imagine this scenario \"intrigues\" Romney's team much.</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin and New Hampshire</strong></p> <p>The easiest way to avoid a tie without Ohio is to win Wisconsin and its 10 electoral votes. Then, all Romney would need is to win any other state. For this scenario, we add New Hampshire's four electoral votes for a total of 271.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397791156\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350335776623/Wisconsinmap_460.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin electoral map\" width=\"460\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wisconsin is probably only in play because of Paul Ryan. After selecting Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee, Romney's numbers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/paul-ryan-wisconsin-effect-us-political-map\">took off in the Badger state</a>. They dropped in September, and now Obama seems to have <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">a small lead</a> \u2013 though one even smaller than Ohio's. </p> <p>The issue is that Romney hasn't been in the state at all in the last month. He's visited North Carolina \u2013 a state where most would agree Romney has an edge \u2013 twice. It makes me wonder whether Romney's polling indicates something the public polls do not. It could be that Obama's right on the edge of 50% in Wisconsin and getting a plurality will prove tough for the former Massachusetts governor. </p> <p>New Hampshire is a contest that, before the primary season, I would have put in Romney's column. He led in pretty much all the <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">2011 polls</a>, was governor right next door, and owns a summer home in New Hampshire. Then something happened. </p> <p>Romney didn't lead in a single poll from mid-April through mid-September. The Granite state's mix of old-time libertarianism, an influx of liberal out-of-state residents on the Vermont border, and tax-fleeing Bay staters from Romney's home state, makes for a hard-to-figure concoction. There have been very few polls in New Hampshire recently, but the ones since mid-September point to a potentially tight race.</p> <p><strong>Other scenarios</strong></p> <p>It's quite possible that Romney will lose a state that I've put in his column for this exercise \u2013 such as Colorado, Florida, or especially Virginia. The reason none of my scenarios includes these states is I'm assuming that if Romney wins any of the states described in the three scenarios above, then he'd have won the states I automatically put into his column.</p> <p>In the same vein, it wouldn't be a complete shocker if Romney takes a state that I have not given him or which does not conform to one of these scenarios. That might be <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/pa/pennsylvania_romney_vs_obama-1891.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, where Romney seems to be closing the gap. It seems unlikely though that Romney would win a state like Pennsylvania without already carrying enough electoral votes from other states to put him over the top in the electoral college arithmetic.</p> <p>Thus, Romney's path to the White House seems dependent on winning <em>either</em> Ohio, <em>or</em> Iowa and Nevada, <em>or</em> Wisconsin and one other state.</p>",
  "<p>Good and bad ministers come and go, but there are deeper tides which one might hope are slowly pushing us towards policies that are better thought through. One is the tightening grip of the rule of law. The attorney general's slippery changes of mind over the Iraq war were notorious, but they were as nothing compared with those of his predecessor during the 1956 Suez crisis, who wrote to the PM to explain that he was backing the misadventure, even though he thought it illegal. The law can still be bent, but it can no longer be openly flouted. Human rights and judicial review have steadily raised the bar, forcing the authorities to demonstrate that they are not arbitrary or irrational. Whether it is the DNA database, votes for prisoners or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/08/jobcentres-benefits-sanctions-targets\" title=\"\">dodgy targets to dock jobseekers' benefits</a>, if ministers and departments forget that they are bound by the law, courtrooms will rudely remind them of it.</p> <p>Until recently, I had dared to hope, that \u2013 like regard for the law \u2013 respect for the evidence might be getting gradually entrenched in Whitehall's culture. A generation ago, the Thatcher government routinely cooked the books on unemployment, fiddling with definitions and ultimately signing a million claimants off sick to conceal the true scale of the problem. But under the Major, Blair and Brown governments, things steadily improved. The Office for National Statistics was established in 1996, and gradually developed clout before its independence from ministers was formally enshrined a decade later. Freedom of information strengthened the arm of citizens who wanted particular facts and figures. In parallel, codes restricting ministers' early access to official figures developed, as did the expectation that the warm words in policy documents would come attached to an \"impact assessment\" to provide a more objective analysis of the likely consequences.</p> <p>The coalition, too, with its early talk of \"a new politics\", seemed likely to continue this benign drift \u2013 and the early decision to hand responsibility for economic forecasting from the Treasury to an arms-length Office for Budget Responsibility seemed very much of a piece with it.</p> <p>Pretty early, however, the drive to cut costs ran into tension with the production of robust social statistics. There was the early signal that the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/beyond-2011/ons-takes-a-fresh-look--beyond-2011-.html\" title=\"\">census would be ditched</a>, even though there was no clear idea about what would replace a count that all other data is checked against. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/06/cabinet-reshuffle-david-willetts-universities\" title=\"\">David Willetts</a>, a rare minister who is as interested in good government as party politics, had to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2011/mar/01/politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">fight a hard battle</a> to salvage the \"cohort studies\", which provide the only objective basis for all those endless speeches about social mobility, from the Osborne axe. Meanwhile, whether out of suppression or incompetence, data on the work programme has been weirdly hard to come by.</p> <p>Now, however, we are witnessing outright fact-smashing of another order. This month, a <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2012/take-up-stats.shtml\" title=\"\">consultation on abolishing the figures</a> about how many people claim their benefit entitlements was closed. At a time when the government is embarked on a rash rewiring of the entire welfare system, it has decided it has better things to do than keep track of who does and doesn't get the cash they need. Universal credit, remember, is supposed to simplify the system and so boost takeup. It was already a giant experiment being run on millions of lives; now it is an experiment where no one can be bothered to collect the results.</p> <p>Without proper takeup figures, there will be no way of knowing whether it succeeds or fails. If it seems churlish to ask whether that is precisely the point, then just read the consultation responses of the fuming academics, all aghast at the move. Tony Blair became notorious for fixing the facts, but this lot appear to be bent on finishing them off entirely.</p> <p><em>Tom Clark is the Guardian's social affairs leader writer</em></p>",

The evidence can be seen by security-vetted barristers known as special advocates, but they cannot discuss what they have seen with the claimants, with the result that <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/14/government-still-not-made-case-for-inherently-unfair-secret-trials-say-special-advocates/\" title=\"\">most regard the system as inherently unfair</a>.</p> <p>Some human rights activists go further, saying the government is attempting to codify a cover-up of recent crimes or misdeeds, and <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/investigations/secret_justice/\" title=\"\">attempting to ensure that UK complicity in torture and rendition</a> will in future be concealed.</p> <p>No date has been set for the bill's next stage in the House of Lords, when peers will vote on the controversial measures.

At a national level, we are busy negotiating the right relationships with stakeholders, including the statutory bodies and the many voluntary and community bodies.</p> <p>We are a brand new organisation and we want to make sure that we talk about the things that matter most. Solid evidence from the people who use services will allow us to focus on the issues. If we try to do too many things, we won't achieve anything. So, we will have to focus.</p> <p><strong>Why is it the right time for a consumer champion for health and social care? </strong></p> <p>The scale and reach of the health and social care sector is immense: a combined budget of more than \u00a3120bn, three million people treated by the NHS each week, and 1.5m adults receiving social care each year.</p> <p>The scale [of the sector] would be reason enough, but this task is even more important because of the backdrop of stretched health and social care budgets, an ageing population and significant systems reform.

The biggest lesson I've learned is that you don't need to know everything, and you shouldn't even try. Being a good leader means you know and trust others to tell you what you need to know. You need a healthy dose of humility to be a good leader.</p> <p><strong>What do you do to relax?</strong></p> <p>I don't do enough. I love my family and spending time with them.

  "<p>Two years on, they are still haggling over the name. An Arab spring? Springs are seasonal, and tumultuous though transitional government is, what they have in Egypt and Tunisia is a long way away from an Arab winter. If the wave of revolt sweeping across the postcolonial borders of the Arab world looks as irreversible as the one that brought down the Soviet empire, revolution does not fit the bill either.</p> <p>Revolutions topple monarchs. This one has gone through republican dictators like a dose of salts but has yet to have the same effect on the royal families of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan, although of course the royal households are rightly petrified that it still will. How about the Arab awakening? Few words can do justice to the street battles of Syria, where 150 to 200 people, most of them civilians, die each day, but awakening is not one of them. This needs a label as brutal and as clinical as the daily trade of aerial bombardment and suicide bombings. An ethno-sectarian conflict?</p> <p>Words matter. Turkey's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tore into the UN, and by implication Russia, which wields the veto at the security council, for not intervening in Syria at a conference in Istanbul on Saturday. In Bosnia, he said, the UN claimed it did not know what was going on, but in Syria they lack even this fig leaf.</p> <p>However, the same conference, the Istanbul World Forum, heard that if Syria follows the trajectory of other ethnic conflicts, Erdogan may be right to keep the rhetoric high, and the military response low. Turkey's response to a series of border skirmishes with the Syrian army has been muted \u2013 at least by the standards of the Turkish army.</p> <p><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Steven Heydemann of the US Institute for Peace</a> rattled off some stylised facts about ethno-sectarian conflicts: they last on average between four and four-and-a-half years; foreign intervention extends the life of a civil war by 156%. Where the conflict ends by one side winning militarily, the average number of deaths is 133,000, as opposed to 86,000 if the conflict is concluded by negotiation. Most of the countries that have gone through civil war relapse into violence. And a transition to democracy is least likely to be final.</p> <p>The conclusion is bleak. If Syria follows this path, the 33,000 deaths it has so far caused may just be the start of what is to come. Heydemann's logic isn't necessarily anti-intervention. If you look at the 70% of the Syrian countryside that is liberated from government control, the transition from dictatorship to democracy is already happening and the longer this conflict goes on, he argues, the more pressure Obama will come under to protect this part of the Syrian population which is vulnerable from the air.</p> <p>What emerges loud and clear from Istanbul is that toppling Assad is not the problem. With the right weapons, it could be over in two months. It's the makeup and allegiance of the post-Assad government that Syria's regional neighbours are really fighting for. The proxy war being waged in Syria is a battle not for Syrians, but for regional control. The Iran government tells their Turkish counterparts every time they meet that they hate what Assad is doing to his people, but the bottom line is that Iran wants access to and influence over the government that replaces it.</p> <p>For Assad's other backer, Vladimir Putin, Syria is a rerun of Chechnya pure and simple. Putin has a strong stomach for civilian deaths. Over 200,000 are thought to have died in Russia's brutal suppression of that conflict (which still rumbles on in Dagestan and Ingushetia), but he is petrified of how a victory of Sunni Islamic militants in Syria could radicalise southern Russia's soft Muslim underbelly.</p> <p>Putin may or may not be right to say that we don't know who the opposition in Syria really is. But the bottom line is, it's Russia he is thinking of, not his country's plummeting reputation in a reshaped Arab world.</p> <p>Russia's support for a dying regime bemuses senior Turkish officials.\"What is Russia afraid of losing in Assad?\" one of them asked. But in downing a Syrian plane full of Russian military parts \u2013 they were communication components for the air defence system Russia has supplied Assad with \u2013 Erdogan is playing a game of chicken with Putin. Each knows that their own set of bilateral interests in the Caucasus is too important to sacrifice on the altar of Syria.</p> <p>As for the other side, the Saudis are past masters at using other countries to fight their war with Iran for them. Syria is little different to Iraq in this respect. For Turkey, which tried for six months to use its soft power to persuade Assad to reform, the Syrian conflict presents a series of hard power challenges. It allows ammunition over its Syrian border, but not heavy weapons. Enough to keep the insurgents in business, but not enough for victory. It will not do anything unilaterally, particularly as there is little appetite for intervention at home. Quite the opposite. And it too wants to keep a line to Iran open.</p> <p>The last word should have gone to the Syrian opposition, except that not one but two organisations turned up to the conference in Istanbul. Abdulbaset Sieda, president of the Syrian National Council sat alongside Abdulhakim Bashar, secretary general of the Kurdish National Council, whose organisation still refuses to come under the SNC umbrella. Sieda presented Syria as a multi-ethnic haven until the Ba'athists seized power 50 years ago. He spoke of the need for a national dialogue, of a written contract guaranteeing the rights of every Syrian regardless of creed. He was fulsome about the Kurds, and less than convincing about everything. Bashar, who is holding firm to a federalist future for Syria, said that toppling the regime was less of a problem than what would replace it. He may be right.</p>",

  "<p>The former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has proposed allowing Scotland to raise two-thirds of its taxes as the first step towards a new federal structure for the UK.</p> <p>Campbell will recommend that other parts of England should consider setting up their own regional assemblies, while the Welsh assembly would get greater autonomy, before the introduction of a wholly new federal treaty for the UK, overseen by a new federal parliament.</p> <p>The proposals are at the heart of 56 recommendations set out in a new plan for \"home rule\" for Scotland, which Campbell is due to publish in Edinburgh on Wednesday, and which has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19957358\" title=\"\">leaked to the BBC</a>.</p> <p>Commissioned by the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, the report will set out the first detailed plans put forward by any of the three UK parties as an alternative to Alex Salmond's independence proposals.</p> <p>Salmond's quest took a significant step forward on Monday after he and the prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/alex-salmond-scotland-referendum-deal\" title=\"\">David Cameron, signed a historic agreement</a> giving Holyrood the legal powers to stage an independence referendum in late 2014.</p> <p>All three UK parties, Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems, have been under pressure to produce detailed counter-proposals after successfully resisting the Scottish National party leader's efforts to get an extra question on greater devolution included in the referendum.</p> <p>Based on the latest opinion polls showing a drop in support for independence, and private polling by the pro-UK umbrella campaign Better Together, the three UK parties believe Salmond will lose the referendum.</p> <p>Campbell's eight-member commission will argue that defeat for independence would \"open the door to radical constitutional change\" for Scotland and the UK, accelerating legislation for greater devolution after the 2015 general election. They also suggest the SNP should take part in those discussions if the referendum is lost.</p> <p>In one of the most radical proposals, Campbell will suggest eventually abolishing the Act of Union in 1707, which scrapped the Scottish parliament and handed overall political power to Westminster.</p> <p>It would be replaced by a new \"declaration of federal union\" for all parts of the UK.</p> <p>A new federal government would take over central control for foreign affairs, defence, currency, welfare and pensions, the BBC reported.</p> <p>The Scottish parliament would control income tax rates, capital gains tax and air passenger duty, but not set VAT or alcohol or excise duties, which would remain set at UK level.</p> <p>Campbell hopes his proposals will be central to the Lib Dems' manifesto at the 2015 general election, when the party will be under intense pressure to rebuild its popularity following the damaging government coalition with the Tories at Westminster.</p> <p>But they are not yet UK party policy. His report has to be endorsed by the Scottish party's autumn conference in Dunfermline on 27 October and then passed to a federal party committee.</p> <p>Keenly aware that the north-east of England rejected proposals by Labour's John Prescott for a regional assembly, while demands for home rule in Cornwall have only minority support, Campbell's report notes that different parts of the UK would move at different speeds.</p> <p>Campbell says it is his \"firm belief\" that his proposals are in the best interests of the UK as a whole, not just Scotland. In his introduction, Campbell states: \"Over time, we are confident that the constitutional debate in England, currently under-developed, will progress and reach a conclusion \u2013 but time will be required for that debate.</p> <p>\"We expect that Scotland will contribute to the terms of that debate, at least by example, but it is for people in England to determine how they wish their own national and regional identities expressed within the constitutional structures of our United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Scotland will thrive with the fiscal responsibility and authority that comes with home rule, but that home rule settlement can only be stable if it forms part of the move to a truly federal United Kingdom. We shall promote home rule and federalism at every opportunity.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats highlighted the fiscal dangers of an independent Scotland when Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said it would face higher borrowing costs. Alexander, who is MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, told the House of Lords economic committee an independent Scotland would have a similar level of debt to the rest of the UK. But it would have to pay a premium on its debt because it would be a \"newly established country without any established fiscal track record\".</p> <p>Sir Nick Macpherson, the Treasury permanent secretary, told the same committee: \"Even countries that are pursuing [a] credible and tighter fiscal approach, such as the Netherlands and Finland, pay a premium on their debt compared to Germany. Even if on day one Scotland is pursuing a surplus there would be some sort of premium.\"</p> <p>The remarks follow a warning by the three leading credit rating agencies that an independent Scotland could not count on inheriting the UK's triple A credit rating. The three agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch \u2013 all <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c289e5f8-4e80-11e1-8670-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29UHG8beP\" title=\"\">told the Financial Times in February</a> that an independent Scotland would have to apply for a rating with no guarantee of a triple A rating.</p>",
  "<p>Keeping people warm and keeping the lights on while meeting our carbon emissions targets means we have to use all the lower carbon electricity generation technologies \u2013 gas, wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, maybe even a bit of geothermal and wave. At least, this is the politically comforting narrative behind the current proposals to reform the electricity market.</p> <p>No hard choices here. There is something for everyone. The government sets out its energy and climate security goals and the market chooses which technologies can best deliver its requirements. Everyone's happy, right?</p> <p>Well, not really. The risk of wanting to do some of everything is that you end up not doing enough of anything. In any case, the government has already made some choices. It is <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/renewable_ener/renewable_ener.aspx\" title=\"\">required by law to deliver about 30% of its electricity from renewables by 2020</a>. And it has <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/nuclear/nuclear.aspx\" title=\"\">announced that it wants 16GW of new nuclear by 2025</a>. Together, it supposes, this will be enough meet its climate change targets without the lights going out.</p> <p>The government seems not to have noticed that its own Treasury will prevent this from happening. No one else seems to have noticed this either. This is probably not an accident. The Treasury is a master at concealing its hand, especially when it comes to letting other ministers feel the pain of its decisions. To unravel this tangle will mean delving into public expenditure controls \u2013 welcome to the wonders of the <a href=\"http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/psr_controlframework_decc.htm\" title=\"\">levy control framework</a>.</p> <p>The renewables the government must have and nuclear it wants both require subsidies. Subsidies are unpopular, particularly so for nuclear. So the coalition has come up with a work-around. Electricity suppliers will be permitted to compel their customers to pay a levy. This cash will be used to finance a contract to pay nuclear and renewables generators the difference between what it costs them to produce electricity and the price offered by the market.</p> <p>This is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference\" title=\"\">contract for difference</a> that is at the heart of the government's energy bill. The cash never passes through the government's hands, ergo, it is not a subsidy. Well, maybe. But it is a tax. And therefore spending it still counts as public expenditure. And that must be controlled. And that's the Treasury's job.</p> <p>Hence the levy control framework which is the Treasury's device for ensuring that the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) does not spend too much meeting its energy and climate goals. This simply sets a cap on how much levy can be collected each year. If the cap is breached, Decc has to pay the difference from within its existing spending limits.</p> <p>The current cap is \u00a32.6bn a year and will rise to about \u00a33.87bn by 2015. Here's the rub. To get the 16GW of new nuclear by 2025 Decc wants will be expensive. On the most optimistic estimates this will require a levy of \u00a35.5bn a year by 2024. More realistic estimates make this \u00a312.6bn a year. Even if there is no increase at all in the subsidy for renewables the levy cap would have to rise to more than \u00a316bn a year.</p> <p>Anyone who thinks that the Treasury will agree to a levy cap this large is dreaming. Ed Davey will have to cut his policy cloth a lot better than this to fit within any levy cap the Treasury is likely to approve.</p> <p>He could choose to ignore British climate law and abandon its carbon reduction targets. But that would be pretty unpopular. He could choose to ignore European renewables law, which would be very popular with some, but also expensive as the commission imposes very large fines on countries which fail to meet their legal obligations.</p> <p>Or, he could get rid of the nuclear cuckoo and meet all his legal commitments. That would certainly upset the French, which would also be popular with some. It would embarrass all those who have been claiming that we will be freezing in the dark without new nuclear. But it would do nothing to imperil our climate or energy security and would save British householders and businesses a great deal of money.</p>",
  "<p>Theresa May will make a Commons statement on Tuesday on whether the computer hacker Gary McKinnon will be sent to the US to stand trial after an 11-year legal battle.</p> <p>The home secretary is also expected to give the official response to the review of Britain's extradition laws by the retired high court judge Sir Scott Baker, in the face of widespread criticism that the UK-US treaty is unbalanced and unfair.</p> <p>May spent the weekend reviewing the papers in the McKinnon case, which include a new government-commissioned report by two leading psychiatrists who warn that McKinnon, 46, who has Asperger's syndrome, is very likely to attempt suicide if his extradition goes ahead.</p> <p>If May orders his extradition, albeit with a string of fresh undertakings about his treatment by the Americans, McKinnon's legal team is expected to launch a last-ditch challenge with an application for judicial review. Provisional dates for a high court hearing on 28-29 November have already been pencilled in.</p> <p>McKinnon was arrested in March 2002 for allegedly hacking into dozens of Pentagon and Nasa computers from his bedroom in Wood Green, north London. He says he was looking for evidence of UFOs and left cybernotes mocking the Pentagon's lack of computer security. He could face up to 60 years in prison if convicted.</p> <p>The home secretary's decision will be a key test of the UK-US extradition treaty, which came into force in 2004 and was widely criticised by David Cameron and Nick Clegg while they were in opposition.</p> <p>McKinnon's lawyer, Karen Todner, said on Monday: \"It has been a long 11-year battle to fight this extradition and we wait with anxiety, but hope, that the home secretary will uphold the promises made by Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg.\" They have both previously condemned plans to send McKinnon to the US.</p> <p>Todner said the two psychiatrists who were instructed by the home secretary had concluded: \"We cannot offer reassurance that Mr McKinnon would not attempt to, or be successful in, harming or killing himself if he is arrested or extradited.\"</p> <p>McKinnon's MP, David Burrowes, has said he will resign from the government if May gives the green light to his constituent's extradition.</p> <p>Burrowes referred to previous pronouncements on the McKinnon case from David Cameron and Nick Clegg. He told the BBC: \"We have to keep in mind that assurances were given before the election, that Gary McKinnon is a vulnerable man and no compassionate view would allow him to go to jail, said the prime minister. The deputy prime minister said there would be no excuse for not doing the right thing.</p> <p>\"The only right thing is that Gary McKinnon is not extradited. I will be [resigning] because he is my constituent, he is seen as a man, who if he is to be extradited, he will lose his life. I don't want blood on my hands and also I hold firm to the promises we made and want to follow through with those.\"</p> <p>Baker's 2011 review of the extradition arrangements found that many of the criticisms of the UK-US arrangements were founded on misunderstandings about how it operated in practice or ignored the public interest in having effective extradition procedures.</p> <p>He did not recommend major reform but voiced serious concerns over the operation of human rights legislation that allowed delays of months or even years, and cited the McKinnon case as a prime example.</p> <p>He recommended that the ability of those facing extradition to raise human rights concerns with the home secretary because of changes in their circumstances should be scrapped and the last word should rest with the judiciary.</p> <p>The Home Office has confirmed that May's decision on McKinnon will be accompanied by an overhaul of the extradition laws that will include the introduction of a \"forum bar\" to extradition. This will give a district court the power to decide whether those facing extradition should stand trial in Britain or be sent abroad. The power exists in the 2003 Extradition Act but has not yet been implemented and would not apply in the McKinnon case as it would not be retrospective.</p> <p>Baker came down against the introduction of a forum bar to extradition, arguing it would create delay and generate satellite litigation.</p> <p>He said in his review that extradition judges at Westminster magistrates court, which deals with all the cases, could not think of a single case since the 2003 act in which the forum bar would have led to a trial in Britain rather than the extradition going ahead.</p> <p>But many extradition law reformers will welcome the move to a forum bar.</p> <p>Michael Caplan QC of Kingsley Napley LLP, backed the move: \"There's a clear case for legislative amendment to include a forum test by the courts to determine the fairest jurisdiction for trial,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It should be for a British judge to hear all the arguments in favour of domestic prosecution and balance those against the requesting country's application for extradition. He will have in mind where most of the conduct took place and where the trial should take place in the interests of justice.</p> <p>\"A forum test could prevent the delays and controversies we have seen in recent extradition cases,\" said Caplan.</p>",

  "<p>A Briton jailed for embezzlement in Dubai claims the Foreign Office is failing to protect British nationals from unfair extradition to the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Michael Smith, 45, is serving six years in prison after being convicted of embezzling the equivalent of $600,000 (\u00a3370,000) from a Dubai property developer following his extradition from Thailand.</p> <p>Smith claims he was misled into dropping his appeal against extradition after documents to the Bangkok court from the UAE embassy in Thailand stated he faced a maximum three-year sentence.</p> <p>Instead, he was sentenced to 12 years \u2013 since halved on appeal \u2013 after the Dubai court found him guilty.</p> <p>Smith told the Guardian he was on hunger strike \u2013 refusing solid food and only taking liquids \u2013 in protest and to draw attention to his treatment to warn others who might be similarly misled.</p> <p>He was convicted this year of forging salary transfers to 13 fake employees while working as HR manager at Limitless, a property developer subsidiary of Dubai World, where he was said to have been employed after using forged university degrees.</p> <p>Smith, originally from Feltham, Middlesex, was arrested eight months after fleeing Dubai when an international search tracked him to Bangkok. He spent two years in a Thai prison fighting extradition before agreeing to return to Dubai believing the maximum sentence he faced was three years, he said.</p> <p>\"It surely cannot be right that a sovereign government (UAE) extradited me without a treaty on the basis of incorrect information provided to another government, and then my own government refuses to protest,\" said Smith, who is in prison in Al Aweer.</p> <p>\"I gave up legal appeals because the maximum sentence stated during the extradition process was three years, and the extradition process would take up to four years. And I had already spent two years on remand in Thailand awaiting extradition, which they are not taking into account.</p> <p>\"Do you seriously think the British government would not protest if a government misled them on another issue? But because I am an individual, it is just accepted.</p> <p>\"I want the UAE to abide by its written request to Thailand, which states that I faced three years in jail. I want them to recognise the 747 days I spent on remand in Thailand, as is normal under extradition law.</p> <p>\"And I want the British government to do their job, which is to assist governments ensuring wanted British citizens face justice, but also protecting them from abuses and not hiding behind a policy of non-interference.</p> <p>\"I also want others facing the possibility of extradition to the UAE to be able to use my case as a precedent so that their lawyers can point to the UAE as not abiding by international and providing false extradition requests.\"</p> <p>There was no response to inquiries made to the Dubai or UAE authorities.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We are aware of the detention of Michael Smith in Dubai and continue to provide him with consular assistance since his extradition from Thailand to Dubai last year. We also continue to closely monitor Mr Smith's welfare and should any concerns for his welfare be raised, we can and will contact the authorities about this.</p> <p>\"As neither consular staff at the FCO nor the British embassy in Dubai are legally trained, we are unable to comment on Mr Smith's case in Dubai or his extradition from Thailand. It is not our role to provide legal advice, and we did not do so in this case. A lawyer would be best placed to advice Mr Smith with regard to these issues.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Fair Trials International said: \"The UAE's criminal justice system is no stranger to criticism about its failure to protect even the most basic fair trial rights. Beneath the glitz and glamour of Dubai's shining skyscrapers lies a series of harsh laws, poor prison conditions and disregard for the rule of law.\"</p> <p>Smith is wanted in Britain on deception and theft charges. He was committed for trial on six charges of obtaining a total of \u00a317,450 by deception from banks in 1997 and 1998, and the theft of \u00a318,965 from a bank in 1996, but failed to attend Teesside crown court for his hearing in February 1999.</p> <p>A CPS spokesman said: \"The charges against Michael Smith have been allowed to lie on file as his return to this country in the foreseeable future is very unlikely. However, we have informed the court that we would wish to proceed with the charges if he returns to this jurisdiction.\"</p>",

In the second year, from October 2010 to September 2011, the loss had been reduced to \u00a37m.</p> <p>Though the \u00a31m profit figure for the 12 months up to September this year is still subject to auditing, Mullins and the owner, Evgeny Lebedev, are confident of the paper's change in fortune.</p> <p>\"It has been tough work,\" says Mullins, \"and it remains tough because the advertising outlook remains bleak. But we are confident of returning a modest profit in the coming year too.\"</p> <p>Evidently, the figures are unaffected by the merger of some Standard editorial departments with those of The Independent - such as business and sport. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jul/05/independent-i-standard-losses\">It was revealed in July </a>that the publishing company controlled by Lebedev reported a 22.5% increase in pre-tax losses to \u00a327.4m in the year up to 2 October 2011. Lebedev's company owns 74.1% of the Standard and the rest is owned by the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust.</p> <p>Lebedev is extremely keen for the Standard to secure <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/14/local-tv-standard-lyons-johnson\">the licence to run the local TV channel in London</a> in the belief that it will substantially enhance the Standard brand.</p> <p>He believes that the paper's editorial and commercial skills can be translated effectively from print to TV. According to the bid document, the service - provisionally called London Live - will offer an 18-hour-a-day channel covering news, current affairs, entertainment and sport backed by an annual marketing support of \u00a35m.</p> <p>The Standard's bid is one of five received by Ofcom for the right to launch the capital's television service.<br> <em>Full disclosure:</em> I write a weekly media column for the Standard</p>",
  "<p>Pilots call it V-one. The critical point. The point of no return. To <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-lands-safely-record\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner</a>, the \"moment of no going back\" is the very second for which he lives \u2013 when the planning stops and the falling starts \u2013 and it could all end in the most sudden of stops.</p> <p>Baumgartner is hardly the biggest name in sport, let alone his native Austria, but he could soon be ranked alongside the very best in the business. The fact that he has been nominated for a World Sports Award is a measure of his achievement, but when you consider that his particular area of expertise is \u2013 for the most part \u2013 illegal, this level of recognition is quite a coup for him and his sport of BASE jumping.</p> <p>BASE \u2013 it stands for buildings, antennae, span, earth \u2013 jumping is the dark side of parachuting. It is a world of forced entries and very public, buttock-clenching exits. Get it right and you're up on a charge of breach of the peace, get it wrong and it's pine overcoat time.</p> <p>Baumgartner is the best BASE-jumper in the business. He holds the world record for the highest jump \u2013 1,480 feet off the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 and, even more brave, the lowest \u2013 a mere 95ft off the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>For his next trick, he plans to jump out of a balloon 30,000ft above Calais and glide across the English Channel. You might put your mortgage on him being a complete loony. He's disappointingly sane.</p> <p>We met last month in a field near Salzburg, because he wanted to show me what he does best \u2013 jumping off, or out of, things. The day's early exit is going to be from a balloon a mile up and this little stunt is small beer for Felix.</p> <p>For me, it is a different matter. I don't like heights and ballooning appears on my list of ambitions just below pot-holing and self-mutilation. The basket is cramped. A deaf boy dressed as a bat has written to Austria's answer to Jim'll Fix It, because he wants to go flying.</p> <p>He's along for the ride with his mum and her chum and also taking up space is Felix's pal Helmut, who is going to jump with him and take a few snaps on the way down. Additionally, there is a very pretty blonde and the pilot, who is the spitting image of Graham Gooch. Fortunately, when he opens his mouth, he is more Innsbruck than Ilford.</p> <p>UP WE GO, with Felix standing on the edge of the basket and holding on to a metal strut. I know he's going to jump, I know he's wearing a parachute, but I can still hear myself saying: \"Step inside, please step inside.\"</p> <p>There isn't really time for questions between the fiery bursts of gas that are keeping us up, but I eventually have a stab \u2013 it's a disappointing start. \"You know when you jump \u2026</p> <p>\"Yes,\" says Felix. \"Do you say 'Geronimo'?\" His eyes become slits and he looks at me like I've just insulted his entire family. \"No way, I say: 'Fucking see ya'.\" And then, without another word, he swallow-dives over the side.</p> <p>I steal myself to look down and there he is, dropping like Wile E Coyote after being stitched up by the Roadrunner. We're still at 6,000ft and he's a rapidly disappearing dot. I hadn't noticed that Helmut had gone as well so it is a relief to see both canopies open a mere 900ft above the ground, spin like sycamore seeds and land.</p> <p>By the time we bump to a stop in a field that has only recently been vacated by a large herd of loose-bowelled cows, Felix is already changed and waiting in the car. He gets out and gives the blonde a squeeze. Oh, that's who she is.</p> <p>We're impressed, he's not. \"I have done 2,600 parachute jumps, 98 BASE jumps, that was nothing.\"</p> <p>How did he get into it?</p> <p>\"When I was little I used to watch the parachuting near my home. I wanted to do it but in Austria you have to be 17. As soon as I was 17 I joined the club,\" he says.</p> <p>He's been doing it ever since, apart from a five-year break in the army. Now that can't be very good for an extreme sportsman's cool image. \"I loved the army,\" he insists. \"I like the discipline, it taught me a lot. I was a drill instructor and a tank driver. When I'm planning a jump I have to be organised, to be disciplined or I am dead.\"</p> <p>We are dragged off to a weird \"loss of ballooning virginity\" ceremony led by the Gooch lookalike. Wild. Then on to a drab Salzburg suburb and the offices of Hardcore Sport in the Air.</p> <p>On arrival, I'm presented with a copy of Austrian Playboy and a can of Red Bull. The most extreme of all extreme sports drinks, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/15/red-bull-felix-baumgartner-sponsorship?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Red Bull sponsor Baumgartner </a>and it works well. He's good-looking, lives close to the edge and jumps off things. His parachute is a fantastic billboard.</p> <p>Baumgartner talks of next summer's cross-Channel attempt. \"I am going to fly but it will be very difficult. I will have wings and I must control the angle and be very precise.\" He shows me a picture of him in his winged suit. He looks like Buzz Lightyear \u2013 and Buzz's flying pedigree wasn't exactly the best. \"I will jump out of the balloon at 9,000 metres and dive straight down until I have enough speed, maybe 400kph, and then I will level out and fly across.\"</p> <p>He estimates it should take him 10 minutes. \"When I'm over Kent [hopefully he won't fly straight into the side of it] I will open my parachute and land.\" He puts on a video of his greatest jumps. It's called BASE 502 \u2013 502 being his BASE-jumping number. I suggest that it is quite high for the best. \"Many of those with lower numbers are dead \u2013 or finished.\"</p> <p>There is no emotion in his voice. We watch him blag his way into the Petronas Towers \u2013 the forged security pass he used hangs on the wall \u2013 and we watch him fire a crossbow bolt over the arm of Christ the Redeemer and climb up the attached wire. THE VIDEO ENDS with Felix standing on the outstretched right arm of the statue. It is dawn in Rio and a helicopter circles him. His voice crackles over the speaker: \"OK guys, I'm outta here. Three-two-one, see ya.\"</p> <p>He steps out into nothing. The 'chute begins to deploy immediately but still isn't fully open as his feet miss the stone parapet that surrounds the monument by less than a foot. Then he is clear, sailing out over the jungle and the shanty towns. The silence in the room is broken by a voice from the back: \"Wow, that's something to show the kids when you get old.\"</p> <p>\"If I get old,\" says Felix Baumgartner. It's a good point.</p>",
  "<p>Our perception of risk is closely linked to our level of knowledge. The more knowledge you have, the better able you are to understand the risks and manage them.</p> <p>If I asked you to parachute from a plane without any instruction, your likely response would to be to back off rapidly and say: \"No way.\" However, some people would say: \"No problem.\"</p> <p>That may be because they have already experienced parachuting and perceive it as being less risky than crossing a busy road. If not, well let's just say there is a fine line between feeling fear and doing it anyway, and foolhardiness.</p> <p>When it comes to exporting, fortune favours the brave. And while I would always urge caution when considering international opportunities, you shouldn't allow fear of the unknown to prevent you from enjoying what should be, if you prepare correctly, a profitable experience.</p> <p>People who have never sold overseas before, or to particular countries such as China, perceive all kinds of risks that, in reality, are relatively easy to manage and are outweighed by the advantages in terms of new income, spreading risk across customers and markets, and increasing volumes to name a few.</p> <p>Perhaps the best proof of this issue is the change we see if a company recruits a member of staff with experience of selling into a given market, again say China. You can almost guarantee that the company will be selling there in a few months.</p> <p>Why? Because they have the contacts, they know the ropes and they have a more accurate perception of the risks.</p> <p>To my mind, there are two ways at looking at international risk \u2013 you can look at broad areas of risk, such as reputation, loss of intellectual property, financial and personal; and you can look at knowledge risks, false risks, managed risks, known unmanaged risk and unknown risks.</p> <p>To deal with the latter, you first need to minimise the degree of unknown risk. This is largely about acquiring knowledge. There are plenty of opportunities to find out about particular countries and trading overseas in general. UKTI provides comprehensive support programmes, such as Passport to Export, a training and mentoring support programme for new-to-export companies. The <a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/home.html?guid=none\" title=\"\">UKTI website </a>is a good starting point because it has plenty of content and links to many other information sources.</p> <p>In terms of managing financial risk, there is a range of accepted payment methods, and it is common practice to insure against non-payment. You can seek advice from all major banks and <a href=\"www.ukexportfinance.gov.uk\" title=\"\">UK Export Finance</a>, a UK government body providing export financing products and advice that now has staff based across the UK to provide information and guidance.</p> <p>However, you should remember that everything has a price. Secure payment methods and insurance costs, as does losing cashflow if you agree to be paid 90 days after receipt of the goods. Make sure you factor this into the price.</p> <p>Intellectual property (IP) and information needs to be protected. Yours may lie in design, brands, knowhow or processes. Before you rush off to patent attorneys or IP lawyers, it is worth looking at the information from the <a href=\"www.ipo.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Intellectual Property Office</a>, which provides advice as well as various tools to help you identify your IP and options for protection.</p> <p>The most common problems are failing to deliver on time because documentation is wrong, which means your goods have difficulty getting past customs, and appointing the wrong person or organisation to represent you overseas. Your local <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">chamber of commerce</a> will provide training to help you get documentation right, and in most cases can arrange to manage and check the documents for you for a fee.</p> <p>It is obvious that you have to pick partners overseas with some care, just as you would in the UK. Picking and managing agents, distributors and other people to work with is also an area where you can get help and advice. Cultural differences and different standard business procedures can also lead to misunderstandings and sometimes offence. Check understanding regularly, but don't panic about cultural issues: in most cases as long as you are polite and avoid the obvious gaffes you get some leeway as a foreigner.</p> <p>My core message is this: many companies support their domestic operations through profitable international trade. And if they can, then so can you!</p> <p>In many cases, the perception of risk does not reflect the reality. But, like the parachutist, leap having carefully thought about your landing. That way you can enjoy the ride!</p> <p><em>Mark Robson is the </em><a href=\"http://blog.ukti.gov.uk\" title=\"\"><em>UKTI</em></a><em> international trade director for Yorkshire and the Humber </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>There may not be enough money to solve the world's increasingly complex problems, but capital is gravitating towards investments that have a positive social or environmental impact.</p> <p>Delegates at the recent <a href=\"http://socap12.socialcapitalmarkets.net/\" title=\"\">SOCAP 12</a> conference, an annual event dedicated to increasing the flow of capital towards social good, heard how the emerging field of \"impact investing\" is seeking to achieve more than just making a buck.</p> <p>As financial returns from traditional investments limp along at low levels because of the global economic and financial crisis, impact has become an important differentiator among investors.</p> <p>\"Impact investing is an enormous opportunity for people, not only to get a return on their investment, but to also help make an impact on major societal needs at the same time \u2013 the two can go hand in hand,\" said Jed Emerson, chief impact strategist at <a href=\"http://www.impactassets.org/\" title=\"\">ImpactAssets</a>, a non-profit social investment company.</p> <p>Impact investing has gained traction in the philanthropic community in the past few years, with hundreds of new funds set up. The market could reach $1tn in investments in the next 10 years, estimated <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/impact_investments_nov2010.pdf?blobkey=id&amp;blobwhere=1158611333228&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs\" title=\"\">a report by financial services firm JP Morgan</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Rockefeller Foundation</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.thegiin.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home/index.html\" title=\"\">Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN)</a> in 2010.</p> <p>Even though the market is growing, it is fragmented and inefficient, leaving the 'demand side' \u2013 the social entrepreneurs seeking funding \u2013 struggling to get the money they need to help them grow their businesses.</p> <p>The flow of capital is dominated by high net worth individuals and family foundations, largely due to the perceived high risk of investing in the social impact sector.</p> <p>The Rockefeller Foundation was an early explorer of this type of finance, according to its president, Judith Rodin.</p> <p>\"We recognised, if you put a price tag on all the social and environmental needs around the world, it is in the trillions,\" she told SOCAP12 delegates. \"All of the philanthropy in the world is only $590bn. So the needs far exceed the resources.\"</p> <p>Even though there are trillions of dollars in private capital markets, none of the world's richest philanthropists has enough resources alone to tip the balance on the most pressing problems.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, many large funds have been developed to help roll out proven social enterprise models. <a href=\"http://www.acumenfund.org/ten/\" title=\"\">Acumen Fund</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lgt.com/en/private-banking/philanthropy/index.html\" title=\"\">LGT Venture Philanthropy</a>, for example, are expanding high-impact social ventures in some of the world's least developed economies.</p> <p>But even though there is pent-up capital waiting to be invested, much-needed smaller-scale investments in fledgling enterprises are still rare.

  "<p>Given all the hysteria over biofuels you'd be forgiven for believing that wiping out the biofuels industry will solve world hunger. It won't. Firstly, agriculture is not a zero-sum game. As well as offering genuine greenhouse gas savings today and even better prospects in future, biofuels have already led to big investments in sustainable farming practices which can improve agricultural productivity in the round.</p> <p>Here in the UK, our home-produced biofuels provide as much high-protein animal feed as low-carbon liquid fuel \u2013 essential for our hard-pressed livestock industry. This feed in turn displaces imported soy, which is often associated with high carbon emissions.</p> <p>Many NGOs also neglect to remind us that one-third of world food is wasted \u2013 a staggering figure which casts a very different light on how best to use land and tackle hunger. And extreme weather events consistent with climate change itself are destroying crops \u2013 yet transport is a major contributor to carbon emissions.</p> <p>Of course, if the biofuels industry were to endlessly expand there would be inevitable conflict between food and fuel. But what is vital to understand, and what is missing from the debate, is that biofuels are at an early stage in their technological learning curve. With the right framework, this technology will have moved on long before conflict need be inevitable, and agriculture will have become more sustainable and productive in the meantime.</p> <p>The European commission's new proposals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/21/biodiesel-industry-eu-policy-changes\" title=\"\">announced last month</a>, aim to dramatically reorientate support towards advanced biofuels. We've been asking for a clear 2020 pathway to reward exactly that. But having been ignored, the measures now put forward are so drastic and fast, they present the UK industry with a canyon it simply cannot leap.</p> <p>Why would investors who stand to lose hundreds of millions of pounds put their hands in their pockets for several hundred million more? The commission proposals \u2013 to allow crop-based biofuels to reduce our fossil fuel use by only 5%, and to withdraw the market for these biofuels altogether after 2020 - mean that around \u00a3700m of investment in the UK biofuels industry could be in peril.</p> <p>You'd think we can go on using oil forever. We can't. And neither can we decarbonise transport at the pace we need to with electric vehicles (EVs).</p> <p>In fact, EVs are not environmentally perfect \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/05/electric-cars-emissions-bad-environment\" title=\"\">a recent report in the Journal of Industrial Ecology</a> shows EVs can contribute more to climate change than cars running on oil and they can create more toxic waste. Does that mean we trash EVs? Of course not. It means we work hard on the technology and green our electricity supply to improve their performance. However, as the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/sectors/surface-transport/biofuels\" title=\"\">Committee on Climate Change acknowledges</a>, biofuels will be necessary over the next 20 years at least to decarbonise our transport sector.</p> <p>Domestic UK biofuels already deliver greenhouse gas <a href=\"http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/letter-commission-energy-20110729/letter-commission-energy-20110729.pdf\" title=\"\">savings of up to 77% versus fossil fuels</a>. Despite our domestic industry's small size (it makes up only 20% of the overall UK biofuels market, which also includes imports), it is also delivering technological innovation, in particular with plans to develop more biofuels from waste.</p> <p>However, rather than recognising our responsible achievements in difficult circumstances, commentators often demonise biofuels indiscriminately. The work of NGOs in exposing appalling biofuels practices overseas is indeed valuable. The UK biofuels industry also condemns these practices, over which we have no control. But there are, and will always be, bad businesses in every sector \u2013 banking, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, food \u2013 you name it.</p> <p>But what is particularly galling for the biofuels industry is that we have been attacked with considerably more venom than other non-food uses of land, such as cosmetics, cotton for our disposable clothing culture, or detergents. None of these industries are being made to account for land-use changes. Equally galling was finding ourselves alone this time last year in calling for the UK to legislate against the import of unsustainable biofuels of unknown origin into our domestic market. Government had the powers to do so and it certainly took its time.</p> <p>Today, 50% of Brazil's transport system is running on biofuels produced from around 1% of its land with greenhouse gas savings of up to 90%. It's a stunning result. Is Brazil really the only country whose technicians can pull off successful biofuel technology? If the EU proposals go through, we may never find out, as any hope of further investment in the UK industry will be destroyed.</p> <p>Grossly simplifying the issues and creating bogeymen may play well with the media but it risks crushing desperately needed solutions.</p> <p>It is so easy to demonise and destroy. It is considerably harder to apply careful considered thought and to secure an intelligent pathway through these complex issues. And it may also be hard to really listen to the industry's achievements given the scent of blood.</p> <p>But that is what we need, and we need the NGOs and politicians who recognise that to step forward and work with the UK industry, which is among the best in the world. The fate of this industry, and the climate, is all down to whether we can really develop the much more grown-up energy discourse we need in the UK, or whether we will remain stuck in this comic-book level of analysis and debate.</p> <p>\u2022 Clare Wenner is the head of renewable transport fuels at the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\">Renewable Energy Association</a></p>",

  "<p>It's the <a href=\"http://www.leedskirkgatemarket.co.uk/\">largest indoor market in Europe</a> and a treasure trove of everything from 30p greetings cards to live lobsters; but the future of <a href=\"http://www.leedsmarket.com/\">Leeds Kirkgate Market </a>is currently the subject of much debate.</p> <p>Traders have claimed a lack of investment and forward planning from landlords <a href=\"http://www.leedsmarkets.co.uk/\">Leeds city council</a>, while council chiefs point to a hefty repair bill for the aging facilities and a move by shoppers away such traditional markets and towards the supermarket.</p> <p>Now the council is asking for shoppers' comments on 12 possible improvements that could contribute to shaping the future of the market, restoring it to its former glory and increasing the number of people who use it.</p> <p>Earlier this year the council, along with property, design and management <a href=\"http://www.nps.co.uk/\">consultants NPS Group</a>, asked people for their views on how the council should improve the market.</p> <p>These views have been considered by council official and the NPS Group has identified 12 key elements which they believe could improve the market. These are:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br><strong>Fixing</strong> the basic structural problems the market buildings face</p> <p><strong>Replacing</strong> the leaking roofs of the 1976 and 1981 halls</p> <p><strong>Installing</strong> heating and cooling - the market's too hot in summer and too cold in winter</p> <p><strong>Finding</strong> your way round, including maps and more/better signs</p> <p><strong>Creating </strong>zones, such as combining the butchers row with fish and game, or something similar with fruit, veg and flowers or clothing and textiles.</p> <p><strong>Creating</strong> a heart to the market, possibly with a new central events, performance and display area</p> <p><strong>Creating</strong> a new route through the market to help shoppers find their way round</p> <p><strong>Rationalising</strong> the layout of the stalls to make the market easier to navigate around</p> <p><strong>Improving</strong> the look and feel of the market</p> <p><strong>Reducing</strong> the size, either by reorganising the space internally and taking out some stalls or by reducing the actual size of the market buildings. One possibility would see the demolition of the 1976 and 1981 halls and moving the existing open market to the existing buildings.</p> <p><strong>Improving</strong> George Street - by demolishing the existing 1930s single storey building down the side of the market, replacing it with a new building which would house stalls but also have small shop fronts looking out onto George Street - and phase one of the new Eastgate development opposite.</p> <p><strong>Improving</strong> public open space where people can sit, possibly with a dedicated space for events and music.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397804886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/5/1304630319017/shop-at-leeds-market-week-004.jpg\" alt=\"shop at leeds market week\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Endless variety and keen prices are hallmarks of the market.

He said that in the early 1980s more people started to use supermarkets for their shopping and that this move away from markets had hit Leeds as much an anywhere else in the country.</p> <p>He said it was important to address the structural problems of the buildings, such as leaking roofs, and to take advantage that the Eastgate development to one side of the market and the revamp of historic Kirkgate at the other would bring to the area.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have no hidden agenda. Absolutely nothing has been decided by the council regarding the market's future other than we want to make it the best market in Britain. This is a genuinely open public consultation. We don't want to turn it into a yuppified area for people who want to buy sundried tomatoes and pesto.</p> </blockquote> <p>Coun Lewis said that there had been investment over the past 20 years but that the council was more guilty of 'not coming up with coherent story about what we are doing.</p> <p>He also stressed the need to tackle the antipathy between traders frustrated at what they believe is a lack of investment and forward planning for the market and their council landlords.</p> <p>He said he wanted to come up with a management model which would involve traders in the decision making process, although he stressed the market would remain in council control.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have taken what people said in the engagement process earlier in the year and fed this into the 12 elements that are now being presented. Some changes are needed to make sure the market buildings are up to date and will last many more years. But the purpose of the changes is to make the market a a welcoming and attractive place to shop, visit and spend time in.</p> <p>In the short term the council cannot afford to resolve all those issues in one go, therefore it is important that we know which issues feel are important to tackle first.</p> </blockquote> <p>The thorny issue of traders' rents was also raised at the press conference. Traders fear the rents are too high and have been calling for a reduction, but Coun Lewis said rents had been held at the same level for five years. Markets champion Coun Gerry Harper added that if rents had gone up in line with inflation, they would have been 20% higher than they are now.</p> <p>The public feedback will shape a crunch report which is due to go before the council's decision-making executive board next year.

  "<p>Iraq has no national foreign policy. For the past decade, a lack of unity among its ruling elite has failed to allow for a unified approach towards its international relations \u2013 one that could have protected the country from becoming a playground for outside powers, with disastrous consequences for its political and security stability.</p> <p>The consequences are particularly telling today. The conflict in neighbouring Syria has placed Iraq in a pivotal position: sitting between Iran and Syria, but also bordering Turkey, it can either help bring the end of the Assad regime or complicate those efforts.</p> <p>Since the withdrawal of US troops last year, Iraq has certainly become more assertive internationally under the leadership of its prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, who has just purchased <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19881858\" title=\"\">Russian arms worth $4.2bn</a>, in defiance of the US and to the concern of the country's Kurds, who fear these weapons could one day be <a href=\"http://uk.krg.org/genocide/pages/page.aspx?lngnr=12&amp;smap=130000&amp;pnr=60\" title=\"\">used against them</a>.</p> <p>Yet, despite this assertiveness, Iraq's ability to influence regional events, as well as preserve its own national interests, is hampered by its fractious political process, presided over by comparably powerful factions and figures.</p> <p>On the one hand, Iraq has become a conduit through which Bashar al-Assad's regime is propped up and supplied with weapons, funds and in some cases fighters, most notably from Iran. Like Iran, Maliki and his Iranian-backed Shia allies fear the threat a Sunni Islamist-controlled Syria across the border would pose.</p> <p>Iraq is thus a crucial vanguard in the effort to maintain Assad's rule over Syria and central to the proxy war unfolding in Syria between the Sunni axis of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states ranged against the Shia axis of Iran, Iraq and Hezbollah.</p> <p>Yet, because divisions in the region are reflected within Iraq itself, the country's pro-Assad camp, despite doing its utmost to sustain the regime, find their efforts undermined by Sunni Arab rivals in Iraq (backed by Turkey and the Arab world) and the Kurds, whose region to the north has the benefit of a mix of cordial relations with the US, Turkey and Iran, largely because of the extensive autonomy it has and the stability it has enjoyed in contrast to the rest of Iraq.</p> <p>For example, much to the dismay of Maliki, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) continues to train anti-Assad Syrian Kurdish fighters, who are being trained by elite Peshmerga forces to prepare Syrian Kurds for the power vacuum in Syria as well as the stabilisation of an autonomous Syrian Kurdish region.</p> <p>The KRG controls an important border crossing point alongside the Syrian border, through which it has been able to penetrate Syrian territory. So important was the crossing point that Maliki, possibly under Tehran's orders, recently sent units from the Iraqi army to take control of the crossing, threatening to spark a Kurd-Arab civil war. In the end, they were stopped by KRG forces and forced to retreat after a standoff.</p> <p>Similarly, Iraq's Sunni-dominated northern provinces along the Syrian border have sent fighters to Syria to join the uprising, essentially returning the favour to brethren who supported and formed a key part of the post-2003 Iraqi insurgency.</p> <p>The problem is not entirely of Iraq's making. Lack of security, exacerbated by neighbours who allowed a flood of terrorists to enter Iraq in the aftermath of the war and in some cases orchestrated the attacks themselves, has stunted the state's progress toward maturity. This has allowed regional neighbours to exploit the country for its important strategic location, rich resources and ethno-sectarian diversity, to the detriment of Iraq's broader national interests and efforts to develop a coherent foreign policy.</p> <p>Yet, today's broader instability in the region means that these \"tougher\" neighbours find their own politics and stability tested as the war of attrition in Syria continues and the region deals with the aftershocks of the Arab Spring upheavals.</p> <p>Turkey has for long conducted cross-border attacks on suspected PKK targets in Iraq's Kurdistan region. However, in addition to the irony of defending its own territory from Syrian shelling aimed at Syrian rebel targets, the emergence of an autonomous Kurdistan in Syria means that Turkey must reconsider its policies toward its restive Kurdish population as well as the PKK, the rebel group it has fought over the past 40 years and whose sister organisation, the PYD, has uncontested control over Syria's Kurdish region.</p> <p>Iraq's elites have had one particularly unified foreign policy approach. Apart from a minority of the country's political contenders, Iraq's major parties mostly recognise the importance of a strategic relationship with Iran, which has its tentacles rooted in almost every political faction. Efforts have been made to move away from this, but placating Iranian interests remains at the forefront of foreign policymaking.</p> <p>The Iraqi state, a decade on since the US-led invasion in 2003, continues to linger between moribund and non-existent. Iraq could be leveraging its strategic location and rich resources by maximising on the vulnerability of its regional neighbours in what has emerged as a critical geopolitical proxy war.</p> <p>But the decentralised and conflicting foreign policy ambitions of Iraq's autonomous political actors has allowed for the country's broader national interests to be sacrificed, as they look toward the Syria conflict as an opportunity to weaken opponents within Iraq, rather than beyond.</p>",
  "<p>Like many other public services, fire and rescue services face an unprecedented challenge, made all the more acute by an unfortunate combination of factors, many of which are entirely beyond our control or influence.</p> <p>It has been described by some within the service as a \"perfect storm\", one that stands to sweep away years of progress unless more is done by both government and services themselves to mitigate against it.</p> <p>Government grant cuts, newly localised (and reduced) council tax benefit, the rising cost of providing adult social care and a retained pensions fiasco are just some of the factors that mean fire services stand to lose out more than most.</p> <p>I have recently taken over as president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association (CFOA), the professional voice of the UK fire and rescue service. We bring together the senior officers of more than 50 fire and rescue services, and so have unique insight into the likely impact of these cuts. A recent questionnaire has shown that 97% of our members have made significant cuts to their frontline service provision already, with 90% expecting to make further frontline cuts in the next two years.</p> <p>All this is despite our best efforts to find savings elsewhere. In England, we have identified about \u00a3117m of potential non-frontline efficiencies, many of which will have already been made. This leaves us with an \u00a380m shortfall, which can only come from frontline firefighters, fire engines and fire stations. If our fears are realised and the localisation of council tax affects us as badly we estimate, we may need to find a further \u00a360m.</p> <p>Of course, all this assumes that the definition of frontline is as simple as meaning those within services who wear a uniform and ride on fire engines. I have written before about my reservations regarding this definition; I maintain that a great many of the prevention activities, protection duties and support functions that exist are a vital part of our frontline service provision. Without them, fire crews would be less prepared and able to do their jobs, and a huge proportion of the reduction in fire damage, deaths and injuries simply wouldn't have happened.</p> <p>Nonetheless, we are not seeking complete exemption from cuts; our association recognises the government's desire to reduce the deficit and realise that all public services are being expected to make sacrifices (although local government and fire have been hit much harder than most). However, we are seeking protection from financial pressures we have little means to control or change.</p> <p>Fire and rescue services are famed for their can-do attitude and their ability to manage well in a crisis. If we are afforded some flexibilities, such as the removal of caps on council tax referenda and the breaking down of barriers to voluntary amalgamations, and some protections, such as exemption from the localisation of council tax benefit and the ring-fencing of fire within county council budgets, I strongly believe we are capable of delivering the first-rate services the public expects. If not, the results could be genuinely devastating.</p> <p>The CFOA has produced a detailed report outlining the impacts of austerity on fire and rescue services in England \u2013 it can be found <a href=\"http://www.cfoa.org.uk/13852\" title=\"\">here.</a></p> <p><em>Vijith Randeniya is president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association (CFOA) </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>We are facing a housing crisis and though the government has acknowledged this, it sees home ownership as the solution to not building more homes for social rent.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's policies on the right-to-buy decimated a valuable housing resource, while the long standing failure to allow local government to build has exacerbated demand to now critical levels. What's more, the government's policies on housing \u2013 as was often in the past \u2013 abandon one important group: single people.</p> <p>It is time for a new debate over statutory rights for housing for all single people. Social housing should exist as a resource for all who find themselves unable to participate in the private housing market. There is no rational reason for targeting single people or for regarding us as having less need of a roof over our heads than anyone else.</p> <p>Already single people are marginalised unless they are parents. In practice, even at times when there has been a concerted effort to meet the housing needs of the UK population there has always been scarcity, so allocation policy for social housing has always left single people at the hopeless end of a long queue.</p> <p>The current government's policies, however, directly target single people through cuts in housing allowances and other benefits. There is a serious risk of a crisis of homelessness among single households on a scale unprecedented in the past half century.</p> <p>In the last fortnight we saw the first raids on squats, under the new law that criminalises those without adequate shelter who take refuge in empty buildings. This tips the balance, as Grant Shapps explained, \"in favour of property owners\" as if that were not already the case.</p> <p>What we are seeing in today is a form of extreme inequality which abandons the rights of the majority in favour of the privileges of the few; policy making that is turning back the work done after World War Two, when many single men needed homes after fighting and suffering for so long.</p> <p>These are not new needs. Phoenix Housing Co-operative was established in 1980 by single people in east London \u2013 some former squatters \u2013 to create safe accommodation for single people on low incomes, but they are being exacerbated by today's economic climate and housing market.</p> <p>Article 25 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights states that everyone has the right to a \"standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of themselves and their family\", including housing.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the Cold War there has been a determined push by the US and others to exclude material needs such as housing from the human rights framework, restricting the legislation to such rights as freedom of expression. This ideology risks the wellbeing of single people here in the UK.</p> <p>Members of Phoenix are often artists or traders in other insecure professions, running small businesses but with no realistic place of affording a home of their own or gaining a social housing tenancy.</p> <p>There are other answers: the Phoenix Housing Plus formula brings empty properties back to life using volunteer labour from within the community, improving employment prospects and creating new homes for young single people. Our projects demonstrate that people are prepared to work hard for a right to secure housing.</p> <p>However, positive though they are, these small-scale efforts will do little to meet housing demand among single people of all ages on a national scale.</p> <p>Decent shelter for all is not just a social issue but a public health issue. It's time this was recognised in a statutory right to social housing for single people too.</p> <p><em>Pennie Quinton is chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.phoenixhousingcoop.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Phoenix Housing Co-operative</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>The demand for community engagement in local government is reaching a fever pitch: legislation requires it; stakeholders insist upon it; citizen journalism drives it. Yet the benefit of this engagement isn't all one way. If councils can find meaningful ways to interact with residents, they will learn more about what they want and understand how to target their resources more effectively.</p> <p>The problem is that the digital world is full of chatter. The sheer volume of noise created by tweeting, blogging, commenting, posting videos, creating GIFs and the general frenzy of activity on social media platforms can drown out the real views of the public on local issues. In fact, local government itself creates plenty of noise of its own with public meetings, consultation exercises, research projects and the published minutes of internal meetings. It is getting harder and harder for council to get to the crux of an issue simply by sifting through the vast amounts of information available \u2013 which itself is both costly and time consuming.</p> <p>Lord Toby Harris, the former leader of Haringey council, admitted as much. \"Keeping my finger on the pulse of public opinion was a difficult and arduous task,\" he explained. \"The cost of gathering the information was high, and the lack of use of reports after a particular project had ended was a problem. With the current Freedom of Information Act requirements, a method of trawling all internal information would be helpful. Even better would be trawling outside sources to see if research findings are still valid six, 12 or 18 months on.\"</p> <p>For councils, there is an opportunity to use new software to better understand their residents and cut through this meaningless \"chatter\". Local government can access new technologies that allow tweets, emails, comments and other digital information to be combined with an organisation's own existing data (such as minutes of meetings, formal letters to the council and research reports) and plotted on a map of the local area. These systems can even analyse the location, volume and meaning of debate on any given issue.</p> <p>Understanding what is important remains a challenge. To know that thousands of people have tweeted about an issue is not particularly helpful; the content and sentiment is critical. By casting your net widely to include blogs, pressure groups, local media and online communities, a more complete picture will emerge. Understanding opinion can be the difference between public backing and backlash.</p> <p>I am working with the Greater London Authority to develop a project called <a href=\"http://www.symfonix.co.uk/newsfull.php?id=61\" title=\"\">Listening to London</a>, which explores these issues. The overwhelming lessons learned from this project, where our \"Community Dashboard\" helps to collate disparate pieces of information, are that no single information source or even group of sources provides the answer to your questions about what the community thinks.</p> <p>Real insight into your community is achieved only when knowledge is gleaned from many information sets, by understanding the strengths and limitations of those sources, and then finally by combining this knowledge.</p> <p>It is vital for local government to engage with their communities, and there are clear benefits that come from effective engagement. But to engage properly you must turn down the background noise and listen to the conversations that really matter. The time and tools to do this may seem expensive as local government faces an unprecedented austerity drive, but the cost of not engaging with your citizens will be far higher.</p> <p><em>Edward Moore is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.symfonix.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Symfonix</em></a><em>, which produces a community dashboard tool to support community and stakeholder engagement </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis, best practice and the latest jobs</strong></p>",
  "<p>This year, the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210021195.html\" title=\"\">poaching of over 430 rhinos</a> in South Africa has rightly dominated the news. The massacre of these animals has forced the government to respond with more rangers in Kruger national park and stronger surveillance in the airports. Sadly, the energy and hand-wringing to protect one species is not extending to another. South Africa's lions are down to the last few prides, with just 2,000 living in the wild. But the failure to curb the nascent but burgeoning trade in lion bones could see this drop even further.</p> <p>In illicit auctions in Beijing and Ho Chi Minh City, lion bone wine has stepped in to replace its tiger bone cousin as a supposed cure-all. A complete lion skeleton <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-04-sa-breeders-embrace-growing-asian-demand-for-lion-bones\" title=\"\">can sell for as much as $9,000</a>. For the traders, lion bones are a big business. <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article966456.ece/Over-1400-Lion-Leopard-trophies-exported--Minister\" title=\"\">Over 1,400 lion and leopard trophies were exported</a> from the country in 2009 and 2010 and while much of this trade comes from private lodges, poachers <a href=\"http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2012/08/26/2003541237\" title=\"\">have been detained at Johannesburg airport</a> for attempting to smuggle out lion bones, an indication that the threat is now spreading into the country's famous national parks.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">CITES</a>, between 2009 and 2010 exports of lion bones from South Africa have <a href=\"http://www.ru.ac.za/perspective/perspectivearticles/name,68678,en.html\" title=\"\">risen by 250%</a>. Hundreds of thousands of people have called on the government to act to save these majestic creatures. The reaction so far: stubborn denials and political censorship to silence the growing drumbeat of lion campaigners.</p> <p>Dr Pieter Kat, a trustee of LionAid, says that by creating a supply for the trade in lion bones, South Africa has created <a href=\"http://www.lionaid.org/blog/2012/07/south-africa-wildlife-conservation-and-international-pressure.htm\" title=\"\">growing levels of lion poaching across Africa</a>, fuelled in large part by the much higher premium paid in East Asia for wild lion bone over its farmed alternative. But environment minister Edna Molewa has refused to acknowledge this risk, <a href=\"http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-09-27-the-lion-the-prez-and-the-airport\" title=\"\">slapping a target on the forehead of the last remaining lions</a>. The statistics are alarming. In the last 40 years, the African lion population has plummeted from roughly 200,000 to around 20,000 today.</p> <p>More than 700,000 people, many of them in South Africa, have <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/stop_lion_slaughter_for_sex_aides_d/?slideshow\" title=\"\">backed a campaign</a> by the online campaign organisation Avaaz calling on President Zuma to save Africa's last lions. Rather than allow the debate to flow, however, it has been gagged. When ads asking Zuma to take action went up in the Johannesburg airport next to the baggage carousel, they were torn down by the airports authority.</p> <p>The adverts \u2013 which were being seen by tens of thousands flying into the city \u2013 were powerful but not insulting: a picture of Zuma looks on as a lioness stares down the barrel of a gun, with the caption reading: \"Our lions are being slaughtered to make bogus sex potions for Asia. Will President Zuma save them? Urge him to stop the deadly lion bone trade now.\"</p> <p>These adverts break no law and are a protected form of free expression under the South African constitution. As this campaign to save the lions in South Africa has been censored by the government-owned airport authority, <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/legal-battle-looms-after-removal-of-lion-ads-1.1367262#.UGMErqTyY0M\" title=\"\">Avaaz has launched legal proceedings</a> against Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) and its advertising firm Primedia (which had approved the ads before their hanging). Acsa announced this week it planned to dig in its heels and defend its political censorship.</p> <p>South Africa is committed to conservation and it has forcefully protected at-risk species from poachers in the past, including taking swift action to save the rhino. But failing to act on lions exposes a conservation policy that can seemingly only cope with one burning issue at a time.</p> <p>The first step to solving this problem is for the government to first admit that there is a problem. This is not confined to canned lions \u2013 where animals are kept in a confined area to facilitate the hunt \u2013 but threatens a dangerous escalation in illegal poaching. Zuma has the power right now to institute a ban. Prohibitive sentences for commercial poachers and enhanced monitoring of airports and harbours to reduce the flow of these products would go a long way towards stemming the proliferation in illegal poaching. Effective laws must be put in place to cut off any legal loopholes and extinguish this shameful trade before one of the world's most majestic and celebrated creatures is relegated to a greed-fuelled and needless demise.</p>",
  "<p>Padraic Fallon, one of the great pioneers of financial journalism, has died from cancer, aged 66. He is credited with transforming the magazine Euromoney into a City institution and turning it into the hub of an international publishing company that now has a market value of \u00a3800m.</p> <p>The empire created by Fallon under the title Euromoney Institutional Investor publishes 100 specialist magazines in finance, aviation, pharmaceuticals and law. It also runs an extensive portfolio of conferences, seminars and training courses and is a major provider electronic information and data.</p> <p>Fallon, a journalist with an ability to bring arcane financial matters to life in print, maintained a love of writing throughout his life. </p> <p>Born in Ireland in 1946, he was the sixth of six sons of the poet Padraic Fallon and a member of a family of writers, journalists and artists. </p> <p>After graduating in business studies from Trinity College Dublin, he started his journalistic career at the Irish Times before moving to London in 1969.</p> <p>He worked first as a financial journalist at Thomson Regional Newspapers and then moved to the Daily Mirror, leaving after a couple of years to join the Daily Mail.</p> <p>In 1974, Fallon was asked to edit Euromoney by the Mail's then City editor, Patrick Sergeant, who had founded the monthly magazine some five years before under the Mail's umbrella.</p> <p>Sergeant was later to observe of Fallon's appointment: \"Apart from starting the magazine in 1969, it was the best thing I ever did for Euromoney.\"</p> <p>Indeed it was. Fallon pulled off a trick managed by few journalists - making a success of the transition from writing to running a business. Under his leadership, Euromoney grew beyond Sergeant's dreams.</p> <p>It launched magazines, made acquisitions and moved into new territory, such as the organising of events, making profits along the way, not least for Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, holder of a 68% stake in Euromoney.</p> <p>Fallon also embraced the digital revolution and developed what has become known as \"data mining\", websites with unique access to business information.</p> <p>He was successively Euromoney's managing director, chief executive and chairman. He sat on the DMGT board and also served as a director of Allied Irish Banks from 1998 until May 2007, when he resigned because of his prescient concerns at the lending policies of the Irish banks.</p> <p>Richard Ensor, Fallon's successor as chairman, said: \"Padraic was a terrific colleague\u2026 He is going to be an enormous loss.\"</p> <p>Fallon found the time to write three novels, including Hymn of the Dawn, based on a summer in his idyllic childhood in Wexford.

  "<p>Financier Nat Rothschild on Monday night suddenly resigned as a non-executive director of Bumi, the mining group he co-founded two years ago, declaring he had \"lost confidence\" in the board to stand up for investors in the London-listed company.</p> <p>In a sharply worded letter to Bumi chairman Samin Tan, Rothschild was critical of a proposal by the powerful Indonesian Bakrie family \u2013 co-founders in the company \u2013 to take control of mines owned by Bumi in Indonesia. \"You appear determined to drive through the Bakries' proposal. I believe that this proposal is so obviously not in the interests of minority shareholders that I find it impossible to stay on as a director. I am afraid that I have lost confidence in the ability of the plc board to stand up for investors,\" Rothschild said in the letter.</p> <p>The company<a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=20121015184352PFE9A\" title=\"\"> issued a three-line statement</a> announcing Rothschild's resignation and declined to comment further. There was no immediate public response from Tan to the letter.</p> <p>Rothschild led the London flotation of the business two years ago, when it was known as Vallar. It was a \u00a3700m cash vehicle intended to make acquisitions in the mining industry and was renamed Bumi after taking a 29% stake in the mining business controlled by the Bakrie family in Indonesia.</p> <p>Its shares crashed last month by a quarter when the London-listed company <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201209240700099404M\" title=\"\">said it was investigating \"potential financial and other irregularities\" </a>at the Indonesian operations. Bumi plc also has an 85% stake in the Berau coal mines in Indonesia.</p> <p>The shares, which were floated at \u00a310, ended at 280p on Monday night. The market was closed before Rothschild's resignation was known.</p> <p>The Bakries have <a href=\"http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=20121011070000P3244\" title=\"\">issued a proposal</a> that effectively allows them to buy back the mines in their native Indonesia from Bumi in London, leaving the company back at square one as a cash shell.</p> <p>Rothschild, who had been co-chairman of the company until a row with the Indonesian investors, is now intending to try to fight the proposals by the Bakrie family \"from outside the tent\". He said it would be a \"disgrace\" to back the offer from the Bakries because of the alleged irregularities that are currently being investigated.</p> <p>\"It is a matter of great regret for me that I was a party, with our advisers, to bringing the Bakries to London. As someone who loves Indonesia, it is also a matter of profound unhappiness that you and they have done such damage to Indonesia's reputation internationally,\" Rothschild&#xa0;said.</p> <p>He said the affair was damaging potential investment in Indonesia. \"The Bumi plc story is a small but high-profile impediment to ensuring [economic] growth, especially when resource nationalism is repeatedly used to abuse minority shareholder rights. I am determined to fight for my fellow investors and can do that better from outside the tent,\" he said.</p> <p>Christopher Fong, Bakrie group senior vice president, told Reuters: \"What a disappointment Mr Nat Rothschild has been to us and all shareholders \u2026 and now he has the audacity to say we have disgraced&#xa0;Indonesia.\"</p> <p>Fong said Rothschild should return all shares and other benefits received as commission for the venture.</p> <p>Tan became chairman last year after buying half of the 47% stake that the Bakries owned in Bumi, leaving the Bakries with 23%. Rothschild owns 11% of the shares while Rosan Roeslani, chief executive of the Berau coal mines, has about 13% of the shares.</p> <p>The complex offer that the board of Bumi has received from the Bakrie family would cancel their 23% shareholding in the London-listed company in return for about a third of the company's stake in the Indonesian mines.</p> <p>The remainder of the 29% stake would be bought in cash before Christmas, while in the \"next six months\" the company's 85% stake in Berau would also be acquired.</p>",
  "<p>\"Just a little bit of charity work\" \u2013 that's how the chairman of a private company described the multi-faceted career of a top, female voluntary sector leader earlier this year. He made the comment to Lynne Berry, who is leading Cass Business School's <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1154843/ftse-boards-reject-female-voluntary-sector-leaders-study-finds/\" title=\"\">research on the lack of female charity sector leaders</a> on the boards of corporates.</p> <p>Berry herself is a five-times voluntary and public sector chief executive, previously holding the top jobs at the <a href=\"http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/GraphicsFolder/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Equal Opportunities Commission </a>and the<a href=\"http://www.newpin.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> Family Welfare Association</a>. Along with six other women of similar experience, she is taking part in Cass Business School's research exploring the private sector's attitude to women voluntary sector leaders.</p> <p>\"It wasn't long ago that 'charity' jobs were seen as something that the director's wife did. It wasn't seen as professional. I think some are still in that mindset,\" said Berry, delivering the findings of the first six months of the project this morning.</p> <p>In half a year there's been precious little to get excited about in terms of responses from the private sector. \"The founder of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_250_Index\" title=\"\">FTSE250 </a>company was very interested when we told him about the experience of one of the women. He said she sounded 'fantastic' and 'just what he was looking for', said Berry. But, when he found out she worked in the voluntary sector, he changed his mind, saying: \"not-for-profit, not-for-me\".</p> <p>\"I've heard lots of people say that working in the voluntary sector has caused them to have a 'toxic CV', said Berry, who added that headhunters have told her that they think non-executive director roles are \"too sophisticated, complicated and nuanced\" for those from the voluntary sector.</p> <p>The two-year research project was launched by <a href=\"http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/research-and-faculty/centres/cass-centre-for-charity-effectiveness\" title=\"\">Cass Centre for Charity Effectiveness</a> / Sir John Cass Business School, <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NCVO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Newton Asset Management </a> after the Lord Davies report on private sector boards and gender was released last year.</p> <p>Newton's chief executive, Helena Morrissey, is also founder of the<a href=\"http://www.30percentclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> 30% Club </a>- a group of chairs and organisations committed to bringing more women onto UK boards because they say they believe it is good for the overall effectiveness of the business.</p> <p>Lord Davies' report highlighted the slow rate of progress towards gender diversity in FTSE 100 and 250 boardrooms and argued that boards could be strengthened by adding senior women from government, academia and professional entrepreneurial backgrounds.</p> <p>There was no mention of voluntary sector women, which Lord Davies now says was an unintentional oversight. But, the Sir John Cass Business School is eager to highlight the potential of the sector's senior women. \"These women typically bring a wide breadth of knowledge to the table \u2013 charities are leaders in accountability, demonstrating impact, building public trust, motivating staff, stakeholder engagement and the need to produce high quality results to a strict bottom line,\" said Richard Gillingwater \u2013 the school's dean \u2013 earlier this year. \"Often they do this in competitive and international environments.\" But Berry said that in the past six months the women have only had a handful of meetings with private companies between them, and nothing has materialised from these.</p> <p>Careers expert Douglas Board also spoke at the project's six-month breakfast briefing. He runs a careers business and has worked as a headhunter in the voluntary and private sectors. Board said previous claims that there were hundreds of voluntary sector staff waiting to be discovered by private sector boards were wrong.</p> <p>\"But are there 30 or 40? I think so,\" he said. \"Many of the skills picked up at charities are more than relevant to needs of private sector boards. They've worked in the toughest conditions overseas, have \u00a3100m turnovers, they're leading thousands of people in a very ethical environment, they earn public trust, they grapple with government, thrive in a world of uncertain income, and some are trading,\" he said.</p> <p>Board believes there's a \"blind spot in corporate Britain when it comes to seeing the value of charity sector staff\".</p> <p>There was a discussion at the event \u2013 which attracted about 65 people from the corporate and voluntary worlds \u2013 on whether the issue was one of private companies not valuing the skills learned in the charity world, or whether they were concerned that charity staff would scrutinise them too much.</p> <p>There was also a sharp reminder from James Allen, head of public services at NCVO, that the voluntary sector itself hadn't got the issue sorted either. \"Yes, two thirds of voluntary sector staff might be women, but this drops sharply the higher up you get,\" said Allen.</p> <p>In terms of gaps in skills and knowledge discovered in the six months, Berry said the pace of decision making was often much quicker in private companies and that leaders from the voluntary sector had much less experience/ background in finance and law, compared to those in the private sector.</p> <p>She added that there was a general feeling that all of this could be easily developed, and if some mentoring was added in, the women would be more than equipped for private sector board roles.</p> <p>She also said the women realised when looking for such roles that they needed to package their skills and experience in another way and use different vocabulary to explain their impact in terms of the bottom line. She said she wanted to encourage a 'Plus One' campaign so that there is at least one person on every board that has a completely different background from the others.</p> <p>One delegate also suggested that chairmen of FTSE100 companies should be encouraged to mentor women specifically from the voluntary sector. Another said there could be merit in approaching smaller private companies too.</p> <p>Many participants referred to Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of Save The Children International, who is also a non-executive director at BT. According to the panel, she is the only such example of a voluntary sector leader on a corporate board, and she was considered an exception because she worked in the corporate sector at the start of her career. \"Even she was told that her work in the charity sector could seriously affect her ability to get positions in the private sector,\" said Berry.</p> <p><em>Claudia Cahalane is a freelance journalist.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Thousands of horses and ponies face being abandoned or suffering from neglect as irresponsible breeding, spiralling bills, and rockbottom sale prices take their toll, according to six leading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/animal-welfare\" title=\"\">equine welfare</a> organisations.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of animals may have to be put down as they are forced to fend for themselves by so-called fly-grazing, according to their report, On the Verge.</p> <p>Some horse owners still believe they can make a profit from breeding but prices for live animals have dropped so far that some cannot even be sold for \u00a35, while shelter, food and vets bills are reaching \u00a3100 a week.</p> <p>With UK abattoirs paying \u00a3230 for a horse or \u00a3400 for a mare and foal, raising animals for meat may be a factor for dealers trying to cash in on exports to Belgium, France and Italy, the report says.</p> <p>Rescue centres capable of housing about 2,800 animals are full, while the RSPCA is spending more than \u00a33m a year on privately boarding animals. Prosecutions of irresponsible dealers and owners are becoming increasingly expensive.</p> <p>The organisations are calling for legislation that will enable them to more quickly identify owners and punish them with fines and the seizure of animals for fly-grazing. They also want a review of agreements allowing the free movement of horses not intended for slaughter between Britain, Ireland and France.</p> <p>The British horse population is thought to be just under 1m. The vast majority are owned privately for leisure \u2013 a sector which, unlike the horse racing industry, is not tightly regulated.</p> <p>Roly Owers, the chief executive of <a href=\" www.worldhorsewelfare.org/\" title=\"\">World Horse Welfare</a>, said: \"The organisations are already at breaking point, with a severe shortage of available places, and we are aware of an additional 6,000 horses which could be at risk over the winter.</p> <p>\"These are all groups of horses that are on the edge of becoming welfare concerns, either because their owners are struggling to look after them or because they are not getting the care they need and ownership is unclear. We could not cope if even a fraction of this number needed to be rescued.\"</p> <p>Nicolas de Brauwere, head of welfare at Redwings Horse Sanctuary and chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.newc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Equine Welfare Council</a>, said: \"It is an extremely serious state of affairs. In February this year, for example, we had a situation where a group of more than 60 horses and ponies that had been left to fend for themselves in Wales were facing euthanasia by the local authority, which had found itself in an impossible situation through the irresponsible actions of a callous owner.</p> <p>\"On that occasion several charities stepped up at the last moment and offered them a home, but we had to stretch ourselves and our teams to the limit to do so. Another case like that may be the final straw.\"</p>"
